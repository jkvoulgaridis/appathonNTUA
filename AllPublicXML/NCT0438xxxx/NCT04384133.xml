  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a worldwide prevalent disease. During recent
      years, increasing attention has been directed to the importance of the contribution of small
      airways in respiratory diseases. The small airways (usually defined as those with an internal
      diameter of &lt;2 mm) are recognized as the major site of resistance to airflow in obstructive
      lung disease. Although small airway disease is known in chronic airway diseases, the
      importance of small airway dysfunction on disease control, exacerbations and quality of life,
      and the importance of taking place among treatable targets is not clear. Therefore, our aim
      in the study is to determine the frequency of small airway dysfunction in COPD. Our secondary
      aim is to evaluate the role of small airway dysfunction in disease severity, disease
      phenotypes, disease control, quality of life and its effect on predicting the risk of
      exacerbation and its role among treatable targets in chronic airway diseases.

      This is a prospective cross-sectional interventional design. 100 COPD patients who applied to
      Mersin University Faculty of Medicine Hospital Chest Diseases Clinic between
      01.10.2019-01.04.2020 will be taken. 35 healthy participants with smoking history and 35
      healthy participants without smoking history who were admitted to our clinic within the same
      date range will be taken as control group. Impulse oscillometric pulmonary function tests
      will be performed to all participants. Thorax computed tomography will be performed to
      evaluate small airway dysfunction. To evaluate the degree of disease inflammation and
      phenotype in COPD patients, nitric oxide measurements will be made in the breath air with
      fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FENO) device. The blood eosinophil level will be studied to
      determine the COPD phenotype. To assess symptom control in patients with COPD, mMRC(Modified
      Medical Research Council) dyspnea scale will be administered. The COPD assessment test (CAT)
      will be applied to measure the quality of life. All patients will be followed for 1 year to
      record the number of exacerbations requiring emergency and hospital admissions for COPD. The
      effect of small airway dysfunction on the disease severity and control degree, disease
      phenotypes and quality of life, and the effect on the risk of exacerbation will be analyzed.
