  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The state of a coronavirus disease pandemic (COVID-19) was declared by the World Health
      Organization on March 11, 2020. Hospitalized patients receiving intravenous (IV) insulin
      therapy have been identified in the hospital setting as a group that places health care
      workers at high risk of contamination. Indeed, the many capillary blood glucose measurements
      required to adjust the IV insulin doses involve direct contact with the patient. It is
      generally recommended to measure blood sugar every 1 to 2 hours with an IV insulin infusion.
      Ensuring a working method allowing optimal monitoring of patients' blood sugar levels while
      limiting the risk of contamination of health professionals is therefore to be preferred.

      Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) systems are minimally invasive devices that allow you to
      get a blood glucose measurement every 5 to 15 minutes, and some devices allow you to access
      your blood sugar profile without having to be in contact with the patients. These devices are
      approved, validated, and widely used in diabetic ambulatory populations. The principle is
      based on a measurement of glucose in the interstitial fluid under the skin.

      DEXCOM G6 is the only device currently approved in Canada that does not require calibration
      using a capillary blood glucose level or contact with the patient for remote data
      transmission. A sensor installed on the skin makes it possible to measure blood sugar from
      the interstitial fluid. A transmitter installed on the sensor sends the data to a receiver
      which can be remote from the patient (up to 6 meters). Its use in an acute care setting,
      however, is not approved in Canada. However, Health Canada issued an emergency order on April
      25, 2020 allowing the use of Dexcom G6 in hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic.

      The CGM offers several potential advantages compared to the capillary glycemia currently used
      to ensure the follow-up of insulin-treated patients thanks to the real-time measurement of
      the glycemia and their transmission at a distance. In intensive care the SGC has the
      potential:

        -  For staff to limit contact with patients infected with COVID-19 (reduction in the use of
           personal protective equipment and contamination) while ensuring close monitoring of
           blood glucose levels for the adjustment of insulin therapy.

        -  For patients to reduce the discomfort related to multiple capillary blood sugar levels
           and possibly better detection of hypoglycaemia

      This study is the first step in a 2-phase research program, the ultimate goal of which is to
      use a CGM to replace capillary blood glucose in hospitals to adjust intravenous (IV) insulin
      therapy.

      The objective of the first study presented in this protocol is to validate the use of a
      continuous glucose monitoring system (CGM) for glycemic monitoring in patients hospitalized
      in intensive care.
