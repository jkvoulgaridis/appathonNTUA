  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary goal of this non-interventional study is to evaluate the change in level of
      allergen-specific IgE (EAST class) after allergen-specific immunotherapy with Pollinex
      Quattro with tree and/or grass pollen extracts and their mixtures under medial routine at
      adults with tree- and/or grass-medicated pollinosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this non-interventional study, the change in level of allergen-specific IgE before and
      after 3 or more years of allergen-specific immunotherapy with Pollinex Quattro in a patient
      population with tree and/or grass pollen induced pollinosis and/or asthma will be analyzed.
      In addition, the change in medication usage, asthma status for asthmatic patients after 3, 4
      or 5 years of allergen specific immunotherapy will be evaluated. Furthermore, patients will
      be asked for their change in quality of life after therapy end.
