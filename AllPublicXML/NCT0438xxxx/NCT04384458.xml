  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We have to be aware of the challenge and concerns brought by 2019-nCoV to our healthcare
      workers. Front-line healthcare workers can become infected in the management of patients with
      COVID-19; the high viral load in the atmosphere, and infected medical equipment are sources
      for the spread of SARS-CoV-2. If prevention and control measures are not in place, these
      healthcare workers are at great risk of infection and become the inadvertent carriers to
      patients who are in hospital for other diseases. Nowadays a question that has not yet been
      clarified by science has been arises: is hydroxychloroquine associated with zinc effective as
      a prophylaxis for asymptomatic healthcare workers involved in the treatment of suspected or
      confirmed cases of COVID-19?

      The study is a open-blind, randomised trial that will be conducted in healthcare settings.
      After obtaining fully informed consent, the investigator will recruit healthcare workers in a
      healthcare facility delivering direct care to patients with either proven or suspected
      COVID-19.

      Participants will be divided into 2 groups - intervention (HCQ = 400mg twice on day 1, 400mg
      / day on day 2, 3, 4, and 5 followed by 400mg once every 05 days, for the next 7 weeks
      associated with 66 milligrams of zinc sulfate daily for 50 consecutive days; and control
      group (healthcare workers who will not receive the study medication).
