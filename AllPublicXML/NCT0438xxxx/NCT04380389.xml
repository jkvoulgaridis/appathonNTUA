  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Performance testing of pulse oximeters. The protocol involves brief stable arterial oxygen
      desaturation in healthy volunteers and sampling arterial blood when a stable level of hypoxia
      has been attained. The blood sample is analyzed for oxygen saturation with a gold standard
      bench CO-oximeter. This protocol is aligned with the latest ISO and FDA guidance documents
      for pulse oximeter testing.

          -  The subject a hemoglobinopathy or history of anemia, per subject report or the first
             blood sample that in the opinion of the investigator, would make them unsuitable for
             study participation.

          -  The subject has any other serious systemic illness.

          -  The subject is a current smoker.

          -  The subject has piercings that may cause air leaks during the test

          -  The subject has any injury, deformity, or abnormality at the sensor sites that in the
             opinion of the investigators' would interfere with the sensors working correctly.
