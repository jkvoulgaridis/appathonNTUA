    <textblock>
      A 12-month pilot study will be comprised of two groups of people diagnosed with mild
      Alzheimer's disease and related dementia for a total of 80 senior subjects. Subjects will be
      randomly assigned to two groups: Group 1 users will play games with and administered by Ryan,
      2-3 times a week and 30-minutes per day. Group 2 (Active Control Group) will play solitary
      games and activities but will have to interaction with Ryan. The team will measure the
      changes and improvement in the social/emotional well-being of these two groups and eventual
      changes in the cognitive/memory functions of elderly people living in the similar
      environment.

    <description>Participants will complete the Saint Louis University Mental Status (SLUMS) test, a screening method for Alzheimer's and other dementia. Scores range from 0 to 30. Scores of 27 to 30 are considered normal in a person with a high school education. Scores between 21 and 26 suggest a mild neurocognitive disorder. Scores between 0 and 20 indicate dementia.
The measurement will be conducted three times over 1 year duration of the study (baseline, 6 months, and 1 year).</description>
