  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The retrospective cohort study INFINITY will be an instrument to analyze the current practice
      of precision oncology in the real-world setting. It will provide insight into real-world
      biomarker-directed treatment of cancer patients not eligible for standard therapies. The
      study will retrospectively collect medical records' data of patients who received a targeted
      treatment based on a potentially actionable alteration or biomarker identified by molecular
      diagnostics. Data of deceased patients will be included. The study will analyze how molecular
      test results guided clinical decision making. The compiled treatment and outcome data will be
      a valuable resource to analyze the use and effectiveness of targeted therapy approaches in
      biomarker-defined and entity-defined subpopulations of cancer patients. These signals might
      generate new insights and foster progress of targeted cancer treatment. The associated
      biomarker profiling module aims to set up a decentral biobank for future research on
      molecular alterations or central re-testing.
