  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to the 2019NCCN guidelines, immunocheckpoint inhibitors are recommended for
      first-line treatment of metastatic colon cancer patients with high microsatellite instability
      (msi-h) or mismatched gene deletion (dMMR) who are not suitable for intensive treatment, and
      for all patients with second-line or above msi-h /dMMR treatment.This study is a
      single-center, single-arm phase II study of the use of triplezumab (JS001) combined with
      CAPEOX regimen in the neoadjuvant therapy of msi-h /dMMR for locally advanced colon cancer.
      The subjects received neoadjuvant therapy with triplezumab (JS001) combined with CAPEOX
      regimen, with one treatment cycle every 3 weeks and two cycles of surgery followed by
      pathological evaluation.
