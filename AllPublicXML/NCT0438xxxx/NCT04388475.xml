  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II open-label study investigating the efficacy, safety and
      pharmacokinetic(PK) properties of OKN-007 combined with temozolomide(TMZ) in patients with
      recurrent glioblastoma(GBM). All patients will have been previously treated with the
      standard-of-care treatment which includes surgical resection, radiation and chemotherapy, and
      in some cases treatment for recurrent disease. Patients with unequivocal recurrence (first or
      greater) established by MRI and meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria, will be eligible
      for OKN-007 treatment on this protocol.
