  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, dose escalation study aimed at evaluating the safety, early
      efficacy and potential biomarkers of (+)-epicatechin in patients with Becker or Becker-like
      Muscular Dystrophy (BMD).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The safety and tolerability of three escalating doses of (+)-epicatechin will be assessed and
      early effectiveness measured by changes in plasma biomarkers, tissue biomarkers from muscle
      biopsies, cardiac imaging, and on clinical function assessments of participants' muscle
      strength. All patients will receive oral (+)-epicatechin for a total duration of
      approximately 52 weeks. Three doses of (+)-epicatechin will be tested in sequential 2 month
      periods with total daily doses of 75, 150, and 225 mg/day (+)-epicatechin. Doses will be
      escalated every 2 months, if tolerated, for the first 6 months of the study. Participants
      will then continue to receive the highest does they tolerated for an additional 6 months.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Participant must be â‰¥16 to &lt;60 years of age.

          2. Genotype confirmation showing a mutation of the dystrophin gene.

          3. Ambulation - participants must show a history of ambulation past the age of 16 years,
             with continued ambulation thereafter.

          4. If on glucocorticoid treatment in the last 12 months, participants must be on a stable

             disease, pulmonary fibrosis).

          8. Evidence of current liver disease or impairment.

          9. Inadequate renal function.

         10. Platelet count, WBC count, and hemoglobin at Screening &lt;Lower Limit of Normal (LLN).
