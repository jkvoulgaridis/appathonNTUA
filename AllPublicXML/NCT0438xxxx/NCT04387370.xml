    <textblock>
      Stump safety is provided by different methods in laparoscopic appendectomy. Stapler use,
      binding with endoloop and nonabsorbable clip are the most common methods. Although the
      stapler is safe, it creates a significant cost increase. In connecting with the endoloop, the
      learning curve and surgical time are longer. Nonabsorbable clip application which has been
      used recently; Urethra was also used in appendectomy after its safety has been proven by
      large studies to close cystic ducts and vascular structures. Its advantages such as low cost,
      no need for a learning curve and shortening the surgical time have increased the frequency of
      use.In this prospective observational study; It will be aimed to investigate the effects of
      stump closure methods applied in laparoscopic appendectomy on short-term clinical results. In
      addition, the factors that determine the surgeon's stump closure method and cost results will
      be tried to be determined.
