  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recurrent aphthous ulcer is a painful inflammatory lesion with a high prevalence. Since the
      etiology is not clear, several strategies have been proposed to reduce pain and severity of
      its symptoms. Today, curcumin is considered as an herbal medicine with anti-inflammatory
      properties. Treatment or control of various inflammatory diseases has been proposed, but its
      low solubility in water has reduced bioavailability, while the use of nanoparticle
      pharmaceutical techniques has been able to solve these problems. Therefore, the aim of the
      present study was to evaluate the clinical efficacy of a new topical curcumin gel with
      nano-technology and compare it with 2% curcumin gel in patients with recurrent aphthous
      ulcers.

      This randomized clinical trial was performed on 48 patients assigned to two groups
      (nano-curcumin gel) and (curcumin gel). Before treatment, the size of the wound and VAS were
      measured. After intervention, the two variables were measured again on the fourth and seventh
      days , then the amount of improvement was quantitatively and qualitatively compared in the
      two groups and a significant level of less than 0.05 was considered.
