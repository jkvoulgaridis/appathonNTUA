  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Insomnia is common in the older population, over 50% of older adults have sleep complaints,
      and 20-40% are reported to have insomnia. In HK, 38% of adults have reported insomnia.
      Insomnia is associated with increased mortality and morbidity. As the worldwide population
      continues to age, insomnia in older adults will increasingly cause substantial economic
      burdens on healthcare systems and society.

      Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is currently the first-line clinically
      recommended non-pharmacological treatment for insomnia in older persons. Our group has been
      actively studying the health-enhancing effects of tai chi. Tai chi has various health
      benefits including fall prevention, osteoarthritis management, cardiorespiratory fitness and
      improvement of sleep. In the present study, the investigators want to validate the clinical
      effectiveness of tai chi on improving insomnia in older adults. This study aims to exam
      whether three months of CBT-I or three months of tai chi have similar robust effects in
      treating insomnia in older adults.

      The investigators want to validate the clinical effectiveness of tai chi on improving
      insomnia in older adults. The CBT-I and tai chi classes will be held twice a week with each
      lasting for 60 mins. The treatment is three months with 12-month follow-up.

      The primary outcome of this study is the insomnia severity index (ISI) score at
      post-intervention measure, which examining sleep-onset and sleep maintenance difficulties,
      satisfaction with current sleep pattern, inference with daily functioning.

    <description>Subjects will participate in a tai chi program conducted in small groups (10 subjects per group) delivered by qualified instructors, who have experience in teaching tai chi to older adults. The tai chi intervention will be prescribed as a 3-month program with two 1-hour sessions weekly. Tai chi forms will be taught for 2 months followed by 1 month of consolidation. The 24-form simplified Yang-style tai chi will be adopted, as it is the most popular form of tai chi and older adults can manage to learn this simplified form of tai chi within 2-3 months. The instructors will introduce the safety issues, proper training principles, and skills to the subjects in their first class to minimize any avoidable adverse events due to improper skill/practice. The appropriate intensity will be individually determined for each subject by the attending instructors to achieve the training principle of progressive adaptation regarding the exercise intensity.</description>
