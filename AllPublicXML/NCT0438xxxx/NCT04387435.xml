  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a non-randomized, prospective study in patients with a diagnosis of epilepsy
      and previously implanted FDA approved Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS) devices. The goal of this
      clinical investigation is to evaluate the effects of adjusting vagus nerve stimulation
      parameters to engage cardioprotective effects.

    <textblock>
      Epilepsy patients are at increased risk for sudden cardiac death. Mechanisms behind this
      predisposition is poorly understood but parasympathetic dysfunction is heavily implicated.
      Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS) protocols currently set for seizure management are poorly
      optimized for cardioprotection, therefore this patient population presents a unique
      opportunity to assess VNS control of cardiac function, when VNS is appropriately titrated for
      cardiac and seizure benefit.

      This study will enroll 20 patients with a diagnosis of epilepsy and previously implanted FDA
      approved VNS devices. The study will last up to 9 weeks and the patient will undergo changes
      to their VNS settings, autonomic testing, cardiopulmonary testing, and maintain a seizure
      diary.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical diagnosis of epilepsy and have been previously implanted with a VNS device at
             least 1 year prior to entering this study

          -  Subjects must have stable stimulation parameters for treatment of epilepsy for at
             least 3 months and the treating neurologist should not have plans for reprogramming in
             the next 3 months

          -  Subjects must have no more than 1 seizure per day to participate in this study

          -  21 years of age or older at time of enrollment

          -  Subjects may be male or female and of any race/ethnicity

          -  Females of childbearing potential must be willing to use an acceptable method of birth
             control.

          -  Written informed consent must be obtained prior to the start of any study procedures

          -  Subjects must demonstrate willingness and ability to comply with study requirements

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Other implantable neuromodulatory device (e.g., brain stimulator)

          -  More than 1 seizure per day on current VNS settings

          -  Reprogramming of VNS stimulation settings for treatment of epilepsy in the last 3
             months

          -  Treating epilepsy neurologist plans to reprogram device for epilepsy therapy in the
             next 3 months

          -  Treatment with cholinergic or anticholinergic medication in the past month or during
             the study period

          -  Pre-existing cardiac arrhythmia or presence of cardiac pacemaker/defibrillator

          -  Cognitive or psychiatric deficit that in the investigator's judgment would interfere
             with the subject's ability to accurately complete study assessments

          -  Pregnant, breastfeeding, or unwilling to practice birth control during participation
             in the study.

          -  Presence of a condition or abnormality that in the opinion of the Investigator would
             compromise the safety of the patient or the quality of the data.

          -  History of previous therapeutic brain surgery or central nervous system injury

          -  History of dysautonomias
