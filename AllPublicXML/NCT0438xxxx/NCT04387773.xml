  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to learn about the effect of GOCOVRI (Amantadine extended
      release) on activity levels and measures of gait and balance quality in people with
      Parkinson's disease (PD) and levodopa induced dyskinesia (LID) during daily activities using
      body-worn sensors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Levodopa induced dyskinesia (LID) is a symptom of Parkinson's disease for which there are
      limited treatment options. LID leads to reduced quality of life, increased caregiver burden
      and an increased risk of falls (Rascol et al., 2015, Chapuis et al., 2005). GOCOVRI™ is an
      extended release capsule prescription medication shown to reduce LID in people with PD (Pahwa
      et al., 2017, Pahwa et al., 2018). However, a number of studies have identified an increase
      in falls in those on the active medication study arm but not the placebo arm (13% increase in
      active and 7% in placebo) (Pahwa et al., 2017). In order to understand this increase in
      falls, comprehensive measurements of quantity of activity (gait measured in the home
      environment) and quality of activity (comprehensive gait characteristics that may increase
      risk of falls) need to be assessed in participants taking GOCOVRI™. In addition, the evidence
      for the effect of GOCOVRI™ on gait and balance in PD is limited (Smulders et al., 2016).

      This study is an open label study in which the following Aims will be studied:

      Aim I: Investigate the effect of GOCOVRI™ on activity levels in people with Parkinson's
      disease (PD) and Levodopa induced dyskinesia (LID) Hypothesis I: We hypothesize that GOCOVRI™
      will result in an increase of daily activity due to improvement in LID symptoms. Primary
      outcome measures: Total number of steps and turns per day

      Aim II: Investigate the effect of GOCOVRI™ on comprehensive measures of gait and balance
      quality in people with PD with LID Hypothesis II: We hypothesize GOCOVRI™ may improve
      discrete characteristics of gait and balance that is evident even within the first hour of
      the day walking.

    <description>Participants will receive GOCOVRI over a total of 7 weeks and do two gait and balance testing visits -- one prior to starting GOCOVRI and one after 5 weeks of taking GOCOVRI. The first gait and balance visit is followed by 7 days of home monitoring with wearable sensors, and there are 7 days of home monitoring prior to the second gait and balance visit.</description>

    <description>Participants will take have a baseline gait and balance visit followed by 7 days of home monitoring. Then, they will take 137mg/day of GOCOVRI for two weeks, before increasing the dosage to 274mg/day. After two weeks of the increased dose, participants will have 7 days of home monitoring, followed by a second gait and balance testing visit. Then, participants will take a decreased dose of 137mg/day of GOCOVRI for one week, before stopping the medication at the eighth week.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Idiopathic Parkinson'd Disease in accordance with the United Kingdom (UK) Brain Bank
             Criteria

          -  Hoehn &amp; Yahr scores of II-IV

          -  subjective report of experiencing at least 1hr/day (two, half-hour periods) of ON time
             with troublesome Levodopa-Induced Dyskinesia (LID)

          -  ambulation with or without aids (e.g., walker or cane)

             dose administered ≥3 times daily

          -  a stable dose of levodopa throughout the study

          -  no amantadine for a minimum of 30 days prior to enrollment in the study
