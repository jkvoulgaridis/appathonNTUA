  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Youth living with HIV are at high risk of falling out of care when they transition from
      pediatric to adult care. The investigators are proposing to develop a mobile app to help both
      clinical providers and patients navigate this process.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The transition from pediatric/adolescent to adult-oriented care settings can be disruptive to
      care engagement for youth living with HIV (YLH).

      The objective of this trial is to pilot and evaluate effectiveness of iTransition, an mHealth
      intervention to improve healthcare transition (HCT) at the patient, provider, and clinic
      levels.It is a prospective non-randomized intervention pilot trial of 128 subjects in
      Atlanta, GA and Philadelphia, PA: 100 YLH (50 intervention and 50 historical controls), 20
      providers, and 8 Transition Champions. The study duration is 12 and 18 months for YLH and
      provider/champions, respectively.

      At baseline, YLH ≥18 years planning for care transition within 6 months, and reporting
      consistent internet access. Providers and Transition Champions must report working with
      transitioning YLH at pediatric/adolescent and/or adult HIV care centers.

      Data measures include iTransition usage, intervention satisfaction and health surveys,
      interviews (select participants), and medical chart review to measure clinical outcomes. The
      primary clinical outcome variable, measured at the patient-level, is linkage to adult care
      (defined dichotomously as having one completed adult clinic appointment or not). Secondary
      clinical outcomes are care retention (dichotomously defined as having or not having one visit
      in each 6-month period) and viral suppression (&lt;200 copies/ml) at 1-year post-baseline visit.
