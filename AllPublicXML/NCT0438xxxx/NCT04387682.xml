  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) has the highest annual increase in the rate of death
      among the top 10 leading cancers in Taiwan. This research aimed to explore whether increased
      anti-tumor immunity for OSCCs reduces the recurrence rate or improves survival. We first
      identified CD33+/CD11b+/HLA-DR-/low/CD14+/- as myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) surface
      markers by using flow cytometry to compare the MDSC frequency of OSCCs with blood samples
      from healthy donors (HDs). We then re-confirmed the suppression of T cell proliferation and
      function achieved by co-culturing with OSCC-educated MDSCs. We subsequently explore whether
      using particulate β-glucan as a food-grade supplement promotes the human immune system via
      subversion of immune modulatory MDSCs. Lastly, we correlated clinicopathological parameters
      with MDSCs and β-glucan administration to examine anti-tumor immunity, and to predict the
      therapeutic effect and prognosis in OSCC patients..

      function achieved by co-culturing with OSCC-educated MDSCs.

      Clinically, we enrolled 100 OSCC patients and 30 HDs to demonstrate a significantly higher
      MDSC frequency in OSCC candidates than HDs. To determine whether using β-glucan as a
      food-grade supplement promotes the immune system of OSCC patients, we further allocated OSCC
      patients with and without pre-surgical administration of whole glucan particle β-glucan to
      groups II and III, respectively (with group I being the HDs).

      We will explore whether using particulate β-glucan as a food-grade supplement promotes the
      human immune system via subversion of immune modulatory MDSCs. Lastly, we correlated
      clinicopathological parameters with MDSCs and β-glucan administration to examine anti-tumor
      immunity, and to predict the therapeutic effect and prognosis in OSCC patients.

    <description>β-glucan, a biological response regulator, derived from yeast has been known for more than 45 years, and has anti-infective and anti-tumor activities. β-glucan is a molecule with a β-1,3-linked D-glucose backbone and β-1,6-linked side chains. Thus far, at least 4 receptors for β-glucan have been discovered in humans, which are surface antigens associated with macrophages or myeloid precursor cells as complement receptor 3 (CR3; CD11b/CD18, Mac-1, αMβ2 integrin) (Vetvicka et al. 1996; Xia et al. 1999), lactosylceramide (Zimmerman et al. 1998), scavenger receptor (Rice et al. 2002) and dectin-1 (Brown et al. 2003; Taylor et al. 2007; Saijo et al. 2007).</description>
