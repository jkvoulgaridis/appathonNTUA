      Background

      Definitions of resilience vary according to the context in which it is discussed. It is often
      considered from the perspective of the individual. Connor &amp; Davidsondescribe it as &quot;the
      personal qualities that enable an individual to thrive in the face of adversity&quot;. Various
      studies have now shown a link between individual resilience and various mental health
      outcomes such as burnout, secondary traumatic stress, depression, and anxiety. In a
      systematic review by Fox et al., 22 studies explicitly stated an aim of improving physician
      resilience. However, there was a lack of consensus concerning the conceptual understanding of
      resilience with low methodological rigour of the included studies.

      Research Questions

        1. What effect will an evidence-based resilience building intervention have on levels of
           resilience, stress and subjective happiness in Department of Medicine Faculty at the
           University of Ottawa?

        2. How might implementation of an evidence-based resilience building intervention on
           Department of Medicine faculty, lead to the development of a community of practice for
           physician wellness in the Department of Medicine at The Ottawa Hospital/University of
           Ottawa?

      Methods All academic physicians in the Department of Medicine, University of Ottawa were
      invited to participate. We recruited 40 participants in total, randomized to either the
      ACTIVE or CONTROL groups.

      Workshop ACTIVE participants (Group A) attended a 2-hour Stress Management and Resiliency
      Training (SMART) program developed by the Mayo Clinic. CONTROL (Group B) participants did not
      attend this training.

      Questionnaires Both Group A &amp; B completed questionnaires on resilience, perceived stress,
      anxiety and happiness at 0 weeks (pre-training) and 12 and 24-weeks post training.

      E-learning support Following completion of the 2-hour workshop, Group A participants were
      enrolled in an online e-learning support program on a website developed by the Mayo Clinic.
      The aim of this was to support and reinforce the messages and techniques delivered in the
      2-hour workshop. Participants were invited to participate for either 12 or 24 weeks.

      Focus groups Group A participants were invited to join a focus group 12 weeks after the
      workshop was run. These focus groups explored themes of resilience, stress, and burnout.

      Analysis of Results Quantitative (Questionnaires): For each measurement scale, the change
      from baseline will be compared between groups (Active Arm and Control Arm) using the
      two-sample t-test. To supplement these analyses, the within-group change (baseline vs week
      4/12/24) will be assessed for the Active Arm using the paired t-test. A sample size of 40 was
      selected for this study after weighing statistical considerations along with logistical and
      resource constraints. In general, for a continuous outcome variable, a sample size of 40
      provides statistical power (two-tailed, alpha=0.05) of &gt;85% to detect a difference of 1
      standard deviation between groups.

      Qualitative (Focus Groups): Constructivist grounded theory informed the iterative data
      collection and analysis process. Transcripts were analysed using a three-staged process of
      initial, focused, and theoretical coding. Themes will be identified using constant
      comparative analysis and grouped to look at the interrelationship of categories.

    <description>The SMART program included a workshop and ongoing eLearning Support. The learning objectives of the workshop are: (1) learn the neuroscience and behavioural aspects of human experience, particularly with respect to stress, resiliency, performance and wellness and (2) learn practical approaches to enhance engagement and emotional intelligence and thereby decrease stress and anxiety, increase resilience, enhance performance, and improve relationships. The goal of the eLearning support is to support and reinforce the messages and techniques delivered in the 2-hour workshop.</description>
