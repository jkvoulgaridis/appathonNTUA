  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PREDICT is a prospective, multi-center study for the early detection of pan-cancer through
      cell-free DNA (cfDNA) methylation based model, in which approximately 14,000 participants
      will be enrolled. The development and validation of the model will be conducted in
      participants with early stage cancers or benign diseases, along with non-tumor (healthy)
      individuals through a two-stage approach. The sensitivity and specificity of the model in
      cancer early detection will be evaluated, and the accuracy of the identification for tissue
      of origin will be obtained.
