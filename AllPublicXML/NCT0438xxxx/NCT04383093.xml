  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) is a complex epidemic disorder with an impact on both lower urinary
      tract symptoms (LUTS) and erectile dysfunction (ED). Combination therapy of daily tadalafil
      and tamsulosin may provide relief to both diseases.

      Aim of the present study is to assess the impact of combination therapy of Tadalafil 5mg plus
      Tamsulosin 0.4mg on LUTS and ED, according to presence vs. absence of Mets.

      75 Consecutive men presenting with ED and LUTS suggestive of bladder prostatic obstruction
      were enrolled. Patients were divided into two groups according to MetS presence or absence.
      All subjects were then treated with tadalafil 5 mg/die plus tamsulosin 0.4 mg/die for 12
      weeks. Patients were re-evaluated after 12 weeks of treatment with Uroflowmetry and PVR,
      IPSS, IPSS QoL, OAB-q and IIEF-5 and comparison were made in and between groups.

    <description>Patients initial assessment included age, waist circumference, blood pressure, clinical laboratory parameters, digital rectal examination. LUTS were evaluated with total IPSS, focusing also on storage, voiding IPSS sub-scores, and IPSS QoL, and Overactive Bladder questionnaire (OAB-q), while ED with IIEF-515. Each patient underwent uroﬂowmetry and postvoid residual volume (PVR) was measured with abdominal ultrasound immediately after voiding. All patients reporting any intake of therapies for LUTS or ED underwent a 4 weeks treatment-free washout period.
All subjects were treated with tadalafil 5 mg/die plus tamsulosin 0.4 mg/die for 12 weeks. The medications were self-administered every day at the same time, before the night rest, without any limitations or variations of sexual activity timing or food intake. Patients were re-evaluated after 12 weeks of treatment with Uroflowmetry and PVR, IPSS, IPSS QoL, OAB-q and IIEF-5</description>
