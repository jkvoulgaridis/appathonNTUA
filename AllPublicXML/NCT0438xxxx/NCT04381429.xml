  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cystic fibrosis related diabetes (CFRD) is a major factor of morbidity and mortality at all
      disease stages. Insulin deficiency has serious clinical consequences by increasing
      malnutrition, since protein and lipid catabolism is accelerated in chronic infections.
      Traditionally, insulin is injected before a meal. Yet, in these patients with highly varied
      and often staggered nutritional intakes, insulin injection can result in an increased risk of
      postprandial hypoglycaemia, all the more so as CF patients exhibit decreased glucagon
      secretion.

      Recent progress in the development of new insulins mimicking the physiological secretion more
      closely has led to ultra-fast insulins (fast aspart), allowing for postprandial
      hyperglycaemia to be better controlled. In Type 1 diabetics treated with basal-bolus,
      faster-acting aspart insulin injected after a meal enabled metabolic control comparable to
      injection of aspart insulin prior to the meal. Fast apart insulin is of particular interest
      with regard to CFRD, wherein postprandial hyperglycaemia occurs early. In CFRD, these
      insulins are likewise advantageous in that they can be injected after the meal, thus
      permitting more flexibility in patients with highly varied diets. Moreover, the insulin dose
      can be adapted depending on dietary intake, thus preventing hypoglycaemia secondary to
      highly-varied carbohydrate intakes. Due to its flexibility, this insulin therapy is likely to
      be better accepted by patients with cystic fibrosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesis that post prandial administration of Insulin faster-acting
      aspart insulin in patients with CFRD may contribute to a better metabolic control with a
      decrease of hypoglycaemia and facilitate insulin administration according to the real food
      intake. The use of Insulin faster-acting aspart insulin will facilitate the functional
      insulin therapy. More particularly for CF patients, optimization of metabolic control should
      contribute to maintain a good nutritional status and to slowing the decline of respiratory
      function and improve the quality of life.

      Patients with cystic fibrosis related diabetes and treated by multiple insulin injection
      (minimal three insulin injection per day or basal bolus insulin regimen) or insulin pump with
      CGM from over 3 months were included in an open, randomized, two-treatments - 4 periods of 3
      months - 2 groups cross-over superiority study. Each group of patients will test both insulin
      treatments (A = pre prandial Aspart insulin, F = post prandial Faster-acting aspart insulin)
      in alternating periods with the following sequences: Group 1: A-F-A-F, Group 2: F-A-F-A The
      patients will be randomized to either one or the other sequence, which defines the groups,
      and take A or F in each of the 4 periods of the study. Each treatment period will last 3
      months.

      CGM (free style libre, Abott) will be performed for 2 weeks at baseline and after each 4
      months period.
