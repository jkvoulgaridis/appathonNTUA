  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Eggs may be a viable alternative to various types of supplemental proteins given its similar
      ratings on various measures of dietary protein quality.

      The investigators hypothesis is that whole eggs would create a greater improvement in
      skeletal regulatory markers, hormonal responses and body composition than egg white ingestion
      in resistance-trained men.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this investigation was to compare the effects of whole egg versus egg white
      ingestion (daily and after training sessions) during 12 weeks of resistance training on
      skeletal muscle regulatory markers, hormonal responses and body composition in
      resistance-trained men. Specific aims of the study are to:

      To investigate the extent to which both whole egg and egg white ingestion will improve
      anabolic factors, fat free mass, fat mass and decrease catabolic markers after 12 weeks of
      resistance training in resistance-trained men.
