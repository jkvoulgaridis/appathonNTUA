      Purpose: Identify the criteria employed by sports medicine specialists in assessing the
      aptitude/inaptitude of an overhead athlete to return to competition following an
      antero-internal dislocation of the glenohumeral joint that has been operated or not.

      Materials and methods: The target population consisted of French-speaking physicians in
      orthopedic surgery, physical medicine and rehabilitation or sports medicine. This study was
      conducted by the means of a questionnaire. The list of the most relevant criteria to be
      included in the questionnaire was established following a literature review.
