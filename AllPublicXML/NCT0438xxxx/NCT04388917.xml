      One challenge of robot-assisted partial nephrectomy (RAPN) is to reduce operative blood loss.
      Partial nephrectomy (PN) is a complex surgery that is being made easier by robotic
      assistance. In this study, we determined whether the use of hemostatic clips during the tumor
      resection step reduced blood loss during robot-assisted partial nephrectomy. Methods: In this
      retrospective study, we included all consecutive patients who underwent RAPN in our
      university hospital from 2017 to 2019. Three experienced surgeons performed the surgery. One
      surgeon used Hemo-lock hemostatic clips during tumor resection to prevent bleeding, and two
      did not. Blood loss in the two groups was compared as the primary endpoint. The duration of
      clamping, operative time, complications, surgical margins, transfusions, serum creatinine and
      hemoglobin were compared as secondary endpoints. Results: 53 patients were included, 36 in
      the No-clip group and 17 in the Clip group. Our two groups were comparable for age, weight,
      Charlson score, tumor size and RENAL score. There was a significant difference between the
      two groups for median blood loss 50 mL in the Clip group versus 300 mL in the No-clip group
      (p = 0.0001), whereas median operating time was shorter in the No-clip group, 140 min versus
      180 min for the Clip group (p = 0.044). No other criterion showed a significant difference.
      The use of Hemo-lock during the tumor resection step in RAPN reduced blood loss without
      impairing renal function. Larger studies are still needed to confirm our findings.
