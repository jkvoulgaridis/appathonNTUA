  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a combination of a single ascending dose (SAD) study to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, and PK of 3 oral doses of a MEK inhibitor and a multiple ascending dose (MAD)
      study of 3 oral doses of a MEK inhibitor.

      Subjects were to be enrolled in 3 different cohorts in the SAD and 3 different cohorts in the
      MAD and were to be randomly (blinded) allocated to active treatment or placebo (each cohort
      consisted of 8 subjects receiving active treatment and 2 subjects receiving placebo).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each subject in the SAD cohorts was to receive a single dose of the MEK inhibitor ATR-002
      (PD0184264), with a starting dose of 100 mg ATR-002 or placebo:

        -  Cohort 1: 100 mg ATR-002 or placebo;

        -  Cohort 2: 100 mg + X mg ATR-002 or placebo;

        -  Cohort 3: 100 mg + X mg + Y mg ATR-002 or placebo. An additional cohort (Cohort 4) of 10
           subjects (4:1 active vs placebo) could have been recruited into the SAD Part, if
           appropriate.

      Effectively, 4 cohorts were treated:

        -  Cohort 1: 100 mg ATR-002 or placebo;

        -  Cohort 2: 300 mg ATR-002 or placebo;

        -  Cohort 3: 600 mg ATR-002 or placebo;

        -  Cohort 4: 900 mg ATR-002 or placebo. Between each cohort, a blinded interim analysis of
           PK, safety and tolerability had to be performed. The available data was evaluated by the
           Investigator and sponsor in a Safety Review Committee (SRC) meeting.

      Once a dose level was judged to be safe, the SRC determined the dose level for the next
      cohort considering a maximal increment of 400 mg compared to the previous cohort, and the
      next dose level could be administered to the next cohort.

      The maximal dose level could not exceed 900 mg ATR-002. Each subject in the MAD cohorts was
      to receive once daily (QD) doses (fasted) of the MEK inhibitor ATR-002 for 7 days, starting
      with a dose of 100 mg ATR-002 or placebo QD.

        -  Cohort 5: 100 mg ATR-002 QD or placebo;

        -  Cohort 6: 100 mg + A mg ATR-002 QD or placebo;

        -  Cohort 7: 100 mg + A mg + B mg ATR-002 QD or placebo. An additional cohort (Cohort 8) of
           10 subjects (4:1 active vs placebo) could be recruited into the MAD Part, if
           appropriate.

      Effectively, 3 cohorts were treated:

        -  Cohort 5: 100 mg ATR-002 QD or placebo;

        -  Cohort 6: 300 mg ATR-002 QD or placebo;

        -  Cohort 7: 600 mg ATR-002 QD or placebo. Between each cohort, a blinded interim analysis
           of PK, safety and tolerability had to be performed. The available data was evaluated by
           the Investigator and sponsor in a SRC meeting. Once a dose level was judged to be safe,
           the SCR determined the dose level for the next cohort considering a maximal increment of
           400 mg compared to the previous cohort, and the next dose level could be administered to
           the next cohort.

      The maximal dose level could not exceed 900 mg ATR-002. During the study, no repeated daily
      dose could exceed the maximum single dose that has been shown to cause no safety concerns.

      Subjects were resident on the ward from the day (late afternoon/evening) before dosing (Day
      -1) until completion of procedures at 96h following their final dose of study medication.
      They were to attend a follow up visit 28 days (Â± 2 days) following their final dose of study
      medication.

      Subjects with AEs that were ongoing at the end of the study were followed up as appropriate
      until the AEs had resolved or stabilised, up to a maximum of 30 days after the last dose of
      study drug.

      Pharmacokinetics were determined predose 30 min, 1h, 2h, 4h, 8h, 12h, and 24h, postdose, and
      predose on Day 2-4 in the SAD Part, and predose 30 min, 1h, 2h, 4h, 8h, 12h, and 24h, of Day
      1 and Day 7, predose on Day 2-6 and 48h, 72h, and 96h post final dose of Day 7 in the MAD
      Part. The 72h and 96h samples in both SAD and MAD were only to be analysed if deemed
      informative based on the results of the 48h PK sample.

             was not of childbearing potential.

             Note: medically acceptable methods of contraception that could be used by the partner
             included combined oral contraceptive, contraceptive vaginal ring, contraceptive
             injection, intrauterine device, and etonogestrel implant;

         10. Willing to adhere to the prohibitions and restrictions specified in the protocol (see
             Appendix 16.1.1);

         11. Ability to comprehend the nature of the study and any hazards of participating in it.
             Ability to communicate satisfactorily with the Investigator and to participate in, and

         12. Informed Consent Form (ICF) signed voluntarily before any study-related procedure was
             performed, indicating that the subject understood the purpose of and procedures
             required for the study and was willing to participate in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Clinically relevant abnormal history, physical findings, ECG, or laboratory values at
             the pre-study screening assessment that could interfere with the objectives of the
             study or the safety of the subject;

          2. Presence of acute or chronic illness or history of chronic illness sufficient to
             invalidate the subject's participation in the study or make it unnecessarily
             hazardous;

          3. A condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, could compromise the well being
             of the subject or course of the study, or prevent the subject from meeting or
             performing any study requirements;

          4. Impaired endocrine, thyroid, hepatic, respiratory or renal function, diabetes
             mellitus, coronary heart disease, cancer, or history of any psychotic mental illness;

             the subject;

          7. Presence or history of severe adverse reaction to any drug, or sensitivity to
             components of the study medication;

          8. Use of a prescription or over-the-counter medicine, with the exception of
             acetaminophen (paracetamol), during the 7 days (or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer)
             before the first dose of study medication;

          9. Participation in another clinical study of a new chemical entity, new device, or a
             prescription medicine within the 3 months before dosing, or participation within 5
             half-lives of receiving an experimental drug (whichever is longer);

         10. Presence or history of drug or alcohol abuse, or intake of more than 21 units (14
             units for women) of alcohol weekly;
