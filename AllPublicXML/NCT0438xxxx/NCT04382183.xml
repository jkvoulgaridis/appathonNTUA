  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low-carb ketogenic diets have become extremely popular because of large weight loss in the
      short-term. Yet their potential benefits in preventing long-term weight regain have not been
      assessed in large scale studies.

      The aim of this study is to determine the effect of a low-carbohydrate (CHO) ketogenic diet,
      compared with an isocaloric balanced diet, on the maintenance of weight loss. The secondary
      aim is to investigate the impact of both diets on appetite. Adults with obesity (30&lt;BMI&lt;40
      kg/m2), will first undergo 4 weeks of a very-low energy diet aimed at inducing 5-10% weight
      loss and then will be randomized to two different weight maintenance diets for 1 year. One
      will be a low-CHO ketogenic diet (50 g CHO/day) plant-based (e.g. with less animal protein
      and more plant-based), and the other a diet following the Norwegian Health Directorate
      recommendations. Only conventional foods will be used in both diets.
