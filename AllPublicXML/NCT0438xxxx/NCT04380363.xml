  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to verify the safety and validate the usability of the Honda
      Walk Assist (HWA) device in the home setting versus an exercise program without the device in
      a gym setting for individuals diagnosed with stroke. The investigators hypothesize that the
      HWA exoskeleton is a safe and effective device for use by individuals diagnosed with stroke
      in the home environment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized control trial is to determine the safety and usability of the
      Honda Walk Assist (HWA) device in the home environment versus a gym membership. Secondarily,
      the study will investigate effects of the HWA exoskeleton in the home environment versus a
      gym membership on gait function and overall home training activity. Participants who are
      greater than 1 year post stroke and between the ages of 18-80 will be included.

      The HWA device is a lightweight, robotic exoskeleton designed to support people with gait
      deficits. The device is worn around the user's torso, waist and thighs, and assists with hip
      flexion and extension. The device weighs about 6lbs and has two motors that run on a single
      rechargeable battery. The device is equipped with angle and current sensors to monitor hip
      joint angle and torque output respectively. The adjustable assist torque (6Nm max.) is
      transmitted to the user's thighs via thigh frames. A trained healthcare professional can
      initially configure assist settings through software that runs on a mobile device. This
      trained professional can also make device adjustments to ensure a proper fit for the user and
      train the user for personal use of the HWA. After initial settings are established, users can
      don, doff and operate the device independently or with the help of an assistant.

      Participant with stroke greater than 1 year ago will be recruited from outpatient clinics,
      day rehabilitation sites, and the hospital's research registry. Following a screening session
      to determine subject eligibility, subjects will be randomized to either the HWA or gym
      membership groups.

      Baseline outcome measures will be collected and subjects will wear an ActiGraph activity
      monitor for 1-2 weeks. Subjects will then complete 1-3 sessions with a research physical
      therapist to acclimate and individualize the HWA device's settings or will be introduced to
      the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab gym and prescribed an individualized exercise program. During the
      2 month intervention, subjects will either utilize the HWA device at home according to the
      prescribed settings or complete the prescribed exercise program at the Shirley Ryan
      AbilityLab fitness center. Weekly phone calls from the physical therapists will check in on
      both groups to determine whether participants are following their exercise programs and to
      answer any questions or concerns. At the conclusion of the 2 month intervention, participants
      will wear an ActiGraph monitor for 1-2 weeks and outcome measures will again be collected
      over 2 testing visits.

      All testing and acclimation sessions will be performed under the supervision of a licensed
      physical therapist. Adverse events will be recorded.

      The investigators anticipate this study will help determine the feasibility of using the
      Honda Walk Assist device in the home setting in individuals greater than a year post stroke.
      The investigators do not foresee any potential pitfalls.

    <time_frame>2 months of at-home training</time_frame>
    <description>The HWA device is equipped with sensors that can detect hip joint angle movement. This joint angle data can be downloaded to an external computer. In the HWA group, HWA log data could provide an objective measure of participant activity when the HWA device is activated. HWA will be solely responsible for managing log data and will provide information of device use and misuse among therapists and study participants. This will also help determine device malfunctions.</description>

    <measure>Honda Training Experience Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months of at-home training</time_frame>
    <description>Each participant in the HWA group will be given a tablet to obtain subjective feedback about the HWA device and home training experience. These tablets will contain pre-loaded questions for subjects to answer on a daily basis to obtain information about device usability in the home setting.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>10 Meter Walk Test (10MWT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Post-testing (after 2 month intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>The 10MWT assesses walking speed in meters per second over a short duration of 10 meters (33 ft). In the 10MWT, subjects are directed to walk at their self-selected and maximum safe speed with the effects of acceleration and deceleration minimized by adding 1 meter at the beginning and at the end of the course to isolate the subject's steady state speed. Any assistive device and orthotic are kept consistent and documented. Gait speed at both the &quot;self-selected walking speed&quot; or &quot;fastest walking speed&quot; are recorded. The 10MWT has been validated for the stroke population and is accepted as a responsive, functional measurement of the patient's ability to ambulate over short distances such as those typical to a household setting.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>6 Minute Walk Test (6MWT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Post-testing (after 2 month intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>The 6MWT measures the distance a subject can walk indoors on a flat, hard surface in a period of 6 minutes, using assistive devices as necessary. The test is a reliable and valid evaluation of functional exercise capacity and is used as a sub-maximal test of aerobic capacity and endurance. The distance is measured with a measuring wheel. The instructions are &quot;Walk covering as much ground as you can in 6 min. You can stop to sit or stand if needed, but time will keep running.&quot; The change in the distance walked in the 6-minute walk can be used to evaluate the efficacy of an exercise-training program or to trace the natural history of change in exercise capacity over time. The 6MWT is measured in meters. For the HWA intervention group, this will be tested both with and without use of the HWA device.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Gait Analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Post-testing (after 2 month intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>A quantitative means of assessing gait function in adults post-stroke based on spatiotemporal parameters of gait. The GAITRiteÂ® system is an electronic walkway with integrated sensors and is considered a reliable and valid means of assessing gait changes post-stroke. For the HWA intervention group, this will be tested both with and without use of the HWA device.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional Gait Assessment (FGA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Post-testing (after 2 month intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>The FGA is a 10-item test for assessing postural stability during various walking tasks. It includes 7 of the 8 items from the original Dynamic Gait Index, and 3 new items, including &quot;gait with narrow base of support&quot;, &quot;ambulating backwards&quot;, and &quot;gait with eyes closed&quot;. The FGA demonstrates excellent concurrent validity with the Berg Balance Scale for individuals with stroke. The maximum score is 30 points; minimal detectable change for chronic stroke is 4.2 points.</description>

    <measure>Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Motor Recovery after Stroke (FMA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Post-testing (after 2 month intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>The purpose of the FMA is to evaluate and measure recovery in post-stroke hemiplegic patients. There are five domains assessed on a 3-point ordinal scale from 0-2. &quot;0&quot; is equal to &quot;cannot perform&quot;, &quot;1&quot; is equal to &quot;performs partially&quot;, and &quot;2&quot; is equal to &quot;performs fully&quot;. The domain for lower extremity motor function will be used. It has been found to be reliable and valid in assessing individuals with stroke with a minimal clinically important difference of 10 points for the lower extremity motor scores.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Manual Muscle Testing (MMT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Post-testing (after 2 month intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>The purpose of this test is to evaluate the strength of the legs by having the subject hold the legs in a position while the researcher applies manual resistance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Modified Ashworth Test (MAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Post-testing (after 2 month intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>The purpose of this test is to evaluate the amount of spasticity in the legs.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Passive Range of Motion (PROM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Post-testing (after 2 month intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>The purpose of this test is to evaluate a subject's passive range of motion in the joints of the hips, knees and ankles.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Activites-Specific and Balance Confidence Scale (ABC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Post-testing (after 2 month intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>The ABC is a 16-item self-report questionnaire that measures confidence in performing various ambulatory activities without falling. Items are rated on a scale ranging from 0-100, with zero representing no confidence and 100 representing complete confidence. It has good to excellent reliability and adequate construct validity, correlating with the BBS and 10MWT.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Stroke Specific Quality of Life (SSQoL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; post-testing (after 2 month intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>The SSQoL is a self-report questionnaire that is accepted as a reliable and valid way to assess health-related quality of life specific to stroke survivors. Subjects respond to 49 questions in 12 domains: mobility, energy, upper extremity function, work/productivity, mood, self-care, social roles, family roles, vision, language, thinking, and personality. Each individual domain consists of 3 to 10 items that are averaged to generate an overall score, each item is rated on a 5- point Likert scale, with a minimum value of 1 (meaning the worst outcome) and a maximum value of 5 (meaning the best outcome). Domains scores (non-weighted average of item scores) and a summary score (non-weighted average of all 12 domain scores) are computed. Summary scores range from 49-245, with higher scores indicating better functioning.</description>
