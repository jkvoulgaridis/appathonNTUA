  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parents of neurodiverse children are more likely to experience traumatic events related to
      the care of their child/children. This increases the probability to experience Posttraumatic
      Stress Injury (PTSI). However, interventions addressing PTSI symptoms in parents are rare.

      In this research project the study investigators will test the feasibility and efficacy of
      e-NET, a distance-delivered, exposure-based intervention for PTSI adapted to the needs of
      parents of neurodiverse children. E-NET is an adapted version of the Narrative Exposure
      Therapy (NET), an evidence-based intervention approach for individuals with PTSI who have
      experienced repeated or continuous trauma. The intervention will be conducted via
      videoconferencing with trained paraprofessionals. During the intervention a narrative of both
      positive and negative (traumatic) experiences in the parents' life will be created. The
      intervention contains approx. 12 one-on-one sessions with a trained paraprofessional via
      videoconferencing.

      The study design is a waitlist control group design. Approx. 20 participants will receive
      e-NET directly after the baseline survey and 20 participants will receive e-NET approx. 3
      months after the baseline survey. To test the efficacy of the intervention, participants will
      fill out surveys about PTSI and other mental health symptoms before, directly after, and 2
      and 6 months after the intervention. Adverse events and distress will be assessed in every
      session. As part of the baseline, participants will complete the survey &quot;Surviving and
      Thriving in Parenting Neurodiverse Children&quot; to determine their eligibility for the
      intervention. Main eligibility criterion is the presence of PTSI symptoms.

    <time_frame>Baseline, Immediately Post- intervention, 2 months post-intervention, 6 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>PTSD symptoms are measured with the PTSD Checklist - 5 (PCL-5). Respondents are asked to rate how bothered they have been by each of 20 items in the past month on a 5- point Likert scale ranging from 0-4. Items are summed to provide a total severity score. Higher scores indicate a worse outcome</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline; Wait list Baseline; Immediately Post intervention; 2 month follow up; 6 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The parent-child relationship will be measured with the Parent and Family Adjustment Scales (PAFAS). Items are rated from 0 to 3. Note that shaded items in the scoring key below must be reverse scored (i.e. 0=3, 1=2, 2=1, 3=0) before summing the Total Score. High scores indicate worse outcome.</description>
