  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of the study is to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of an
      internet-delivered Adolescent Community Reinforcement Approach (I-A-CRA) with therapist
      support for young adults (aged 18-24 years) with problematic alcohol use and their
      caregiver/significant other. Secondary aims include investigating the role of comorbid
      emotional symptoms, emotion regulation and prosocial behavior in treatment outcomes for the
      young adults. In a randomized controlled trial, participants (n = 60 young adults as well as
      an accompanying caregiver/significant other) will be recruited from the community through
      advertisements as well as through clinic referrals in Stockholm, Sweden. Eligible
      participants will be randomized either to the 10-week I-A-CRA treatment or to an active
      control group (receiving psychoeducation about alcohol use over the same time frame). In both
      conditions an accompanying caregiver/significant other will receive a support program in
      conjunction with the young adult's treatment. Participating young adults will be evaluated
      with regards to their alcohol use, psychiatric symptoms, emotion regulation, and prosocial
      behavior at pre-treatment, weekly during treatment, post-treatment, and at a 3-month
      follow-up. The primary outcome will be feasibility (measured as number of treatment
      completers; i.e., having completed 5 out of 8 treatment modules), and reductions in heavy
      drinking episodes (measured weekly by self-reported alcohol consumption, change from baseline
      in number of heavy drinking episodes/week). Secondary outcomes will include pre- and
      post-treatment self-rated levels of depression, anxiety and stress, emotion dysregulation,
      and prosocial behavior. Self-reports regarding stress, emotion dysregulation, and prosocial
      behavior will be complemented by behavioral measures (computerized tasks with eye-tracking).
      We hypothesize that treatment will be superior as compared to the control condition in
      reducing the number of heavy drinking episodes/week pre to post treatment, and reducing
      comorbid symptoms of stress, anxiety and depression.

    <description>The intervention is a behavioral internet-based intervention based on the Adolescent Community Reinforcement Approach. The program encompasses text, pictures, videos, and written as well as practical assignments (skills training). The main components of the treatment for the young adult with problematic alcohol use consist of psychoeducation and functional analysis, goal formulation, increasing prosocial behaviors, relapse prevention, problem solving, and communication training. The accompanying significant other receives modules containing information focusing on gaining an understanding of the treatment components aimed at the young adult, as well as communication training to improve communication between the young adult and the significant other.</description>

    <description>The intervention is a behavioural internet-based intervention including psychoeducation focusing on providing information on alcohol, alcohol use, and its effects. The psychoeducation is provided via texts and pictures, and there is a possibility of asking questions to a therapist if needed however no therapist contact is mandatory. There are separate programs directed towards the young adult and the accompanying significant other. The programmes give brief self-help tips at the end. The intervention approximately corresponds to the information given in a primary care setting for someone with problematic alcohol use.</description>
