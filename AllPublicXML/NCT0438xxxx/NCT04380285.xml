  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Objectives: This study compared the effectiveness of soft versus hard orthotics in treating
      heel pain and plantar fasciitis in adults. It also compared the level of function after
      orthotic use, cost and number of visits for orthotics and explored if age was a factor in
      orthotic effectiveness.

      Design: This randomized clinical trial included 44 adults (18+) with heel pain and plantar
      fasciitis. Participants received hard or soft customized orthotics and rated their pain
      intensity, pain interference and function, pre and post orthotic use. Scores were analyzed
      with repeated measures ANOVA. Analysis of age used repeated measures ANOVA. Costs were
      compared using t-test and number of visits was compared using Wilcoxon Rank Sum.

    <intervention_model_description>The study design was a randomized clinical trial.The study was completed when the target number of recruitments was reached. Prior to randomization to treatment groups, patients were stratified by age (younger adults: 18 - 64 years and older adults: 65 years and older) in blocks of four to ensure that there were an equal number of participants receiving soft versus hard orthotics in each age group.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Brief Pain Inventory: a sub-scale from this measurement tool measuring pain intensity. Change in pain intensity is being assessed using this measurement tool pre and post treatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>This questionnaire was administered on the initial visit and then 6 weeks after orthotics were provided.</time_frame>
    <description>Measures pain intensity on a numeric rating scale with anchors of 'no pain' (0) to 'pain as bad as you can imagine' (10)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Brief Pain Inventory: a sub-scale from this measurement tool measuring pain interference with activity and level of function. Change in pain interference is being assessed using this measurement tool pre and post treatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>This questionnaire was administered on the initial visit and then 6 weeks after orthotics were provided.</time_frame>
    <description>Pain interference was rated on the following items: general activity, walking, work, relations with other people, mood, sleep and enjoyment of life, using a numeric scale with anchors 'does not interfere (0) to 'completely interferes' (10)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Late Life Function and Disability Instrument (Late Life FDI): Function component. Change in function is being assessed using this measurement tool pre and post treatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>This questionnaire was administered on the initial visit and then 6 weeks after orthotics were provided.</time_frame>
    <description>It rates one's ability to do a wide variety of activities that involve basic upper and lower extremity function, such as reaching, standing and bending as well as higher levels of physical endurance such as walking and climbing stairs.It is a 32 item self-report questionnaire with five response categories and a score ranging from 32 to 160.</description>
