  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over phase 2 trial
      investigating the effect of C21 on cold-induced vasoconstriction in subjects with Raynaud's
      phenomenon secondary to systemic sclerosis. The purpose of the trial is to achieve a
      vasodilatory effect in subjects with Raynaud's phenomenon by stimulation of the AT2R with
      C21.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Written informed consent must be obtained before any trial related procedures are
             performed.

          2. Subjects diagnosed with SSc according to European League Against Rheumatism
             (EULAR)/American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria

          3. Age 19-75 years inclusive

          4. RP secondary to SSc as determined by the investigator, and with a typical frequency of
             attacks during the winter months (November-March) of on average at least 5 per week.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Smoking (including E-cigarettes) or use of nicotine replacement therapy for three
             months prior to Visit 1 and during the trial.

          3. Mixed connective tissue disease or &quot;overlap&quot; (i.e. those who satisfy more than one set
             of ACR criteria for a rheumatic disease).

          4. Concurrent serious medical condition with special attention to cardiac or ophthalmic
             conditions which in the opinion of the investigator makes the patient inappropriate
             for this study

          5. Malignancy within the past 5 years with the exception of in situ removal of basal cell
             carcinoma and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade I

          6. Planned major surgery within the duration of the study

          7. Subjects who forsake any alcohol intake or have known uncontrolled allergic conditions
             or allergy/hypersensitivity to any components of the trial drug or placebo excipients
             (see Section 7.1)

          8. Blood donation (or corresponding blood loss) within three months prior to Visit 1

          9. Treatment with any of the medications listed below within 4 weeks prior to Visit 1:

                  nefazodone, itraconazole, ritonavir)

               -  Any treatment with medicines that are substrates of CYP1A2, CYP3A4 or CYP2C9 with

         10. Any of the following findings at the time of screening:

               -  Finger temperature below 27°C after acclimatising at an ambient temperature of
                  23°C for a period of 20 minutes

               -  Prolonged QTcF (&gt;450 ms), cardiac arrhythmias or any clinically significant
                  abnormalities in the resting ECG, as judged by the Investigator

               -  Positive results for HBsAg, HCVAb or HIV 1+2 Ag/Ab

               -  Positive serum pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of
                  HCG)

               -  Clinically significant abnormal laboratory value at Visit 1 indicating a
                  potential risk for the subject if enrolled in the trial as evaluated by the
                  Investigator

         11. Pregnant or breast-feeding female subjects.
