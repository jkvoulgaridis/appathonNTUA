    <textblock>
      In light of the controversy that are already approved but that however still exists regarding
      the efficacy and influence of the protocols for the management of Periodontitis, the aim of
      this study was to evaluate, at 6 months follow-up, the post-treatment clinical parameters and
      immunological and gingival microbial profiles in patients with periodontitis, treated by
      either SRP in addition to full mouth scaling or quadrant scaling

      This trial was conducted in accordance with the World Medical Association's Declaration of
      Helsinki of 1975, and reviewed in 2008. The local ethical committee of the University of
      Messina approved the study protocol and each patient was carefully informed about the
      possible inherent risks of the study and provided their informed written consent 102
      patients, , aged 27 to 65 (mean age 44.2) were assessed for eligibility. In all subjects,
      subgingival plaque was acquired from 4 separate proximal sites at 180 days after therapy.
