  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is more common in females than in males but the difference has not been explained yet.
      Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) have recently emerged as critical players in the
      initiation of allergic responses but their implications in the difference between males and
      females in terms of asthma prevalence has not been fully studied. The aim of this project is
      to compare the proportion of ILC2 in blood between males and females with asthma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is more common in males until puberty but becomes more prevalent and more severe in
      females after puberty suggesting a protective action of male sex hormones. ILC2 have recently
      emerged as critical players in the initiation of allergic responses. Pr Guery's team
      established that androgens, signaling through the nuclear receptor 3 C4 (NR3C4) androgen
      receptor (AR), negatively control ILC2 at steady state and during lung inflammation. Relevant
      to this application, females with asthma have more circulating ILC2 than males. The present
      hypothesis is that harnessing AR signaling in ILC2 may provide a new therapeutic approach to
      down regulate tissue resident ILC2. This project will analyze the sex bias in circulating
      ILC2 in female and male patients with moderate to severe asthma. In females with asthma, the
      team will purify circulating ILC2 from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and expand
      them in vitro using cytokines and stromal cells in the presence of AR antagonist or agonist
      ligands. Bulk ILC2 cultures at day 7 will used to measure the expression profile of various
      gene, including AR.
