  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rural Americans are more likely to be unhealthy, older, living in poverty, uninsured, and
      medically underserved. The CDC has made achieving health equity and improving cardiovascular
      health for rural Americans one of their Healthy People 2020 overarching goals. ST-Elevation
      Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) is a life-threatening cardiovascular emergency that frequently
      affects people without warning within the communities the Participants live and work.
      Patients with STEMI have a linear relationship between first medical contact to Percutaneous
      Coronary Intervention (PCI) time and mortality. Delays are particularly important in STEMI
      patients with cardiogenic shock, who experience an excess 3.3 deaths per 100 for every 10
      minute delay to PCI (for PCI times between 60-180 minutes). Delayed PCI is also associated
      with a higher rate of long term morbidity, including congestive heart failure and repeat MI.
      Unfortunately, many rural EMS agencies fail to consistently achieve the recommended 90 minute
      PCI time goal. Rural agencies are less likely than urban/suburban agencies to meet time goals
      and this disparity exposes rural patients to excess morbidity and mortality. The American
      College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) endorse the need for prehospital
      strategies to reduce total ischemic time, particularly in rural settings.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Achieving PCI time goals is influenced by multiple factors, such as patient attributes,
      agency factors and elements of organizational Emergency Medical Services (EMS) culture.
      Organizational culture is defined as a set of shared values, beliefs, and assumptions within
      an organization that influences how people within that organization behave. Differences in
      organizational culture between hospitals have been associated with both cardiovascular
      mortality and disease-specific outcomes. Although not yet rigorously studied in the
      prehospital environment, it is likely that organizational culture contributes to differences
      in tempo and manner of completing interventions. Prehospital performance accountability and
      culture have been discussed by experts in EMS magazines but have never been formally studied.

      EMS STEMI protocols that include direct transportation to a PCI-capable hospital and
      pre-hospital PCI center activation improve patient outcomes. Unsuccessful EKG transmission,
      delayed PCI center activation, and cardiogenic shock have been shown to negatively affect PCI
      time metrics and patient outcomes. The impact of PCI delays in the rural setting has not been
      specifically studied. In addition, there are agency-level factors, such as ambulances per
      capita, number of satellite stations, miles of interstate that likely affect the EMS agency's
      ability to achieve shorter PCI times for the STEMI patients they care for. This proposal will
      use mixed methods to identify previously unmeasured components of rural EMS agency
      organizational culture, structure, care processes, and patient environment that likely
      influence PCI time and patient outcomes. In addition, this project will identify best
      practices that can be tested as novel interventions and implemented in rural EMS agencies to
      improve STEMI time metrics and therefore reduce patient morbidity and mortality.

    <description>Retrospective data will be collected to develop a well-characterized registry of patients treated from 2016-2019 by any of 14 local rural EMS agencies and transported to a facility capable of performing Percutaneous Coronary Intervention. This registry will be used to determine the time to PCI performance for each of the EMS agencies. Time will be adjusted for patient distance from a PCI center using a linear mixed model with a random effect for center and a fixed effect for distance. This process will allow qualitative methods to identify organizational culture, structure, and clinical processes that impact STEMI care from the two highest and lowest performing rural EMS agencies.
