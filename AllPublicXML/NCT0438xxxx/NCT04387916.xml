  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety，tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and
      preliminary efficacy of KC1036 in participants with advanced recurrent or metastatic solid
      tumors. The trial will be divided into three parts: dose-escalation phase, dose-expansion
      phase, RP2D-extension phase.
