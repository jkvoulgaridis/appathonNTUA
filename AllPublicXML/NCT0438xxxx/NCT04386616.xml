      This is a Phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study to assess
      the efficacy and safety of MSTT1041A (astegolimab) or UTTR1147A in combination with standard
      of care (SOC) compared with matching placebo in combination with SOC in patients hospitalized
      with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia.

             evidenced by chest X-ray or CT scan

          -  Peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2) â‰¤93% (on room air or supplemental
             oxygen) or partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2)/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) â‰¤300
             millimetres of mercury (mmHg) or requiring supplemental oxygen to maintain SpO2 &gt;93%

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding, or positive pregnancy test in a pre-dose examination

          -  Any serious medical condition or abnormality of clinical laboratory tests that, in the
             investigator's judgment, precludes the patient's safe participation in and completion
             of the study

          -  In the opinion of the investigator, progression to death is imminent and inevitable
             within the next 24 hours, irrespective of the provision of treatments

          -  Participating in another clinical drug trial

          -  Treatment with investigational therapy (other than for COVID-19) within 5 half-lives
             or 30 days (whichever is longer) prior to initiation of study drug

          -  Use of Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor within 30 days or 5 drug elimination half-lives
             (whichever is longer) prior to screening

          -  Have received high-dose systemic corticosteroids (â‰¥1 mg/kg methylprednisolone or
             equivalent) within 72 hours prior to Day 1

          -  Known HIV infection with CD4 &lt;200 cells/microlitre (uL) or &lt;14% of all lymphocytes

          -  ALT or AST &gt;10 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) detected at screening

          -  History of anaplastic large-cell lymphoma or mantle-cell lymphoma

          -  History of cancer within the previous 5 years unless it has been adequately treated
             and considered cured or remission-free in the investigator's judgment

          -  Clinical evidence of active or unstable cardiovascular disease (e.g., acute myocardial
             ischemia or decompensated heart failure), as determined by investigator assessment,
             ECG, laboratory assessment, or echocardiographic data

          -  History of moderate or severe allergic, anaphylactic, or anaphylactoid reactions or
             hypersensitivity to any component of study treatment
