  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study was a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled human trial. 80
      subjects were randomly divided into Angelica Gigas Nakai and Allium Cepa L.Extract Mixtures
      group and a placebo group. It is to evaluate the changes in the displayed evaluation items
      when taking Angelica Gigas Nakai and Allium Cepa L.Extract Mixtures once a day, in comparison
      with taking a placebo.
