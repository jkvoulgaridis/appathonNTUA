      This trial includes single-dose studies and multiple-dose studies, The single-dose study
      included six dose groups of 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, 300 mg, 400 mg, and 500 mg. Based on the
      results of a single dose, select 1 to 3 doses from 100mg, 200mg, 300mg, and 400mg to conduct
      multiple dose studies. To evaluate the tolerance of GST-HG141 tablets in healthy subjects in
      single and multiple administrations, pharmacokinetic characteristics, drug metabolism and
      transformation, and the effect of food on GST-HG141 pharmacokinetics.
