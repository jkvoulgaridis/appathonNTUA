      Pre-pivotal, randomized study to assess the safety and efficacy of the IUB SEAD™ device in
      women suffering from abnormal uterine bleeding.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB), involving menstrual bleeding of abnormal quantity,
      duration, or schedule, is experienced by 10-35% of women, and can markedly impact everyday
      activities, can lead to iron deficiency and in severe cases, can necessitate emergency
      medical care.

      While pharmacologic treatment options exist, some women desire a treatment that requires less
      maintenance or is definitive. Endometrial ablation is a minimally invasive approach applied
      to manage AUB and can be performed using resectoscopic instruments or with a
      non-resectoscopic approach, in which the device is inserted into the uterine cavity and
      delivers energy to uniformly destroy the uterine lining. Non-resectoscopic endometrial
      ablation has become an accepted office-based procedure, but requires training in
      administration and response to complications of conscious sedation and of assisting
      personnel.

      The IUB SEAD™ device is a novel Spherical Endometrial Ablation Device, developed to allow for
      a simple, office-based chemical endometrial ablation to treat AUB. The suggested procedure is
      expected to be simpler than the currently available ablation methods and to result in a
      clinically meaningful delay or abolishment of the need for hysterectomy

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Female subject age 35 to 50 years, inclusive

          2. Suffering from heavy menstrual bleeding with no definable organic cause and are
             candidates for global endometrial ablation or surgical treatment

          3. Have a histological finding in a recent (max 4-month-old, with a window of 1 month)
             endometrial biopsy (Pipelle® or other non-treatment-based biopsy) that demonstrates
             benign endometrial histology: proliferative endometrium and/or disordered endometrium
             and/or histological findings associated with dysfunctional endometrium (e.g. irregular
             shading, un-ovulatory bleeding and such); no histological findings of hyperplasia are
             allowed

          4. Premenopausal status confirmed by FSH level measurement at screening (FSH &lt; 40 IU/L).
             FSH level measurement will be repeated in case of a borderline result

          6. Uterine sound measurement of 6.5-11 cm (external os to internal fundus)

          4. Underwent prior uterine surgery that interrupts the integrity of the uterine wall
             (e.g., transmural myomectomy, classical Cesarean section, endometrial ablation,
             hysteroscopic resection) or a uterine biopsy accompanied by curettage in the last 12
             months

          5. Have abnormal endometrial biopsy (i.e., unresolved adenomatous complex hyperplasia,
             endometrial cancer)

          6. Have a documented clinical history of metal allergy or hypersensitivity

             sexually transmitted disease (STD)

          8. Suffers from active infection of the genitals, vagina, cervix, or uterus

          9. Presence of bacteremia, sepsis, or other active systemic infection

             Alternatively, a colposcopy performed prior to SEAD™ treatment, that showed evidence
             of dysplasia requiring treatment. In case treatment was performed &gt; 6 months prior to
             enrollment and follow-up was done with no evidence of disease by clinical evaluation,
