      Exercise is an important factor in bone health. Sclerostin is one of the key molecules
      involved in bone response to mechanical loading. In particular, sclerostin decreases bone
      formation directly through the inhibition of Wnt/ β-catenin signaling and increases bone
      resorption indirectly via upregulation of the RANK/RANKL. The Wnt pathway is an anabolic
      signaling pathway, which leads to the activation of osteoblasts. OPG is another osteokine
      secreted by osteoblasts and osteogenic stomal cells that has a protective osteogenic role in
      humans by inhibiting the binding of RANKL to its receptor RANK. The RANK/RANKL pathway is a
      catabolic signaling pathway controlling osteoclast differentiation. Only a few studies have
      examined the effects of one single bout of high impact exercise on serum sclerostin levels in
      adults, most of which are from the investigators' lab. However, not many studies have
      examined the acute effects of moderate intensity, low-impact exercise on osteokines of the
      Wnt signaling. Previous studies have only investigated the impact of high intensity cycling
      on sclerostin, OPG and RANKL, however, no research has been done to investigate the response
      of osteokines to moderate intensity continuous cycling. This study aims to investigate
      differences in osteokines and markers of bone turnover following three moderate intensity
      cycling trials of different duration (30, 60 and 120 min) in an energy replete state. The
      question we aim to answer is whether there is a threshold of time where continued stimulus
      from moderate strain on the bone fails to elicit an additional metabolic response in bone or
      even becomes osteocatabolic, when athletes are in an energy replete state. Additional
      biochemical responses to the exercise will also be examined including inflammatory markers,
      glucose, anabolic/hormonal markers and oxidative stress.

      Introduction Exercise has been shown to positively benefit bone health. It's well documented
      that an acute bout of weight bearing, high load and dynamic strain on the skeleton mobilizes
      markers of bone formation in normal weight males and females. Acute bouts of low-impact high
      intensity exercise such as cycling, have also been investigated for their effects on bone
      formation and resorption, showing an overall anabolic effect (Mezil et al. 2015). One study
      exists investigating an acute two-hour bout of moderate intensity cycling, which showed
      increases in parathyroid hormone, associated with bone metabolism, although the effects of
      these transient hormonal changes on bone remain unknown (Barry &amp; Kohrt, 2007). Minimal
      research has investigated the effects of acute bouts of moderate intensity continuous cycling
      (70% of VO2 max) on bone metabolism. In contrast to these acute controlled studies, at least
      two studies have reported that athletes who regularly participate in non-weight bearing
      sports such as cycling present with higher rates of osteopenia in the lumbar spine and hip
      region (Rector et al. 2008; Sherk et al. 2013). Another study investigated the bone status of
      adolescent male cyclists, over 17 and under 17 years of age, compared to healthy age matched
      controls. Cyclists had lower BMD at the legs, pelvis, and total hip. In cyclists over 17,
      reported BMD was 8.9% to 24.5% lower for the whole body, pelvis, femoral hip and legs,
      suggesting cycling performed during adolescent years may negatively affects bone health and
      one's ability to reach peak bone mass during this critical time (Olmedillas et al. 2011).
      However, a small study investigating 5 male elite racers during a 6-day road cycling stage
      race, while meeting energy needs, showed an increase markers of bone formation and a decrease
      in markers of bone resorption (Hinton et al. 2010). Thus, the evidence provided above appears
      contradictory. On the one hand, an acute bout of high intensity cycling has an osteogenic
      effect on bone, while longer-term studies or observational data, which allow for the time
      required to see changes in BMD, appear to show that road cycling can also have an
      osteocatabolic effect on bone (Olmedillas et al. 2012). This contradiction raises interesting
      questions about the impacts of larger loads of cycling, energy intakes, as well as the
      impacts of longer durations of cycling on bone health.

      There appear to be conditions related to the sport of road cycling, not specific to the
      mechanics of cycling itself, that can predispose an athlete to low BMD over time. These
      conditions remain unclear. Possible factors contributing to the lower BMD found in cyclists
      include low energy availability and its associated hormonal and nutritional implications,
      carbohydrate availability, the omission of weight bearing loads due to long hours spent
      performing non-weight cycling, weight loss, as well as excess calcium losses through sweat
      and urine. Recent studies have also provided evidence of the importance of consuming
      carbohydrates in attenuating markers bone resorption and supporting bone health during
      exercise (Heikura et al. 2019). Of interest, is the fact that gymnasts, athletes who also
      often train under conditions of low energy availability, appear to gain a protective effect
      from their high impact sport, that overrides the bone resorption typically associated with
      calorie deficits. The high mechanical forces in this sport have large osteogenic effects,
      maintaining BMD, unlike what has been observed in cyclists (Robinson et al. 1995). This makes
      one question if it is the non-weight bearing nature of cycling, certain conditions
      surrounding cycling or something inherent to the mechanical aspects of cycling itself, that
      have a seemingly negative impact on bone?

      To date, researchers have investigated the effects of an acute bout of high intensity cycling
      on markers of bone formation and resorption, as well as moderate intensity cycling and its
      effects on bone. Field studies have been executed where energy needs have been met and where
      energy deficiency was present. There is a gap in the research as far as the impact of
      duration of moderate intensity cycling on bone, in an energy replete state, in a controlled
      setting. Filling this gap through a systematic approach would help to better understand if
      and how duration impacts the metabolic bone response.

      There are a variety of methods to measure the bone's response to acute mechanical loading.
      Since changes in BMD are not immediate, and only occur over longer time periods, this
      measurement is not appropriate to use to investigate changes in bone metabolism after one
      acute bout of exercise. After an acute bout of exercise, it is common to measure circulating
      bone turnover markers. These markers are products of bone formation or resorption. There are
      a variety of bone turnover markers, however some of the more commonly used are procollagen I
      intact N-terminal (PINP) and C-terminal crosslinking telopeptides of type I collagen (CTX),
      which are recognized by the International Osteoporosis Foundation (IOF) and are products of
      osteoblastic or osteoclastic cell activation, respectively. More recently, bone metabolism
      has been investigated through measures of the glycoprotein sclerostin, an inhibitor of the
      Wnt pathway, which leads to decreased bone formation. The Wnt/β-catenin signalling process
      has influence on the mobilization of OPG (Osteoprotegerin). OPG binds to receptor activator
      of nuclear factor kappa-β ligand (RANKL), preventing RANKL from binding to RANK (an
      osteoclast cell surface receptor), acting as a decoy receptor. RANKL binding to RANK would
      otherwise increase bone resorption. Therefore, the two pathways, Wnt-B-catenin and OPG/RANKL
      have a relationship that can help us to better understand the processes of bone resorption
      and formation.

      This study aims to investigate differences in markers of bone metabolism (CTX, PINP) and
      osteokines (sclerostin, OPG and RANKL) between three moderate intensity cycling trials of
      different duration (30, 60 and 120 min) in an energy and carbohydrate replete state. The
      question the investigators aim to answer is whether there is a threshold of time where
      continued stimulus from moderate strain on the bone fails to elicit an additional metabolic
      response in bone or even becomes osteocatabolic, when athletes are in an energy replete
      state. Additional biochemical responses to the exercise will also be examined including
      inflammatory markers, glucose, anabolic/hormonal markers and oxidative stress.

      Methods Fifteen 20-30-year-old active male participants (sample size calculated based on
      Mezil et al. 2015) will arrive to the lab on 5 separate occasions. Visit one will include
      anthropometric measurements and a VO2max test. Participants will fill out a 24-hour food
      recall before visit one. Participants will complete one control and three continuous cycling
      trials (visits 2, 3, 4 and 5) on the cycle ergometer at 60-70% of their respective VO2 max
      based on their test from visit 1. The order of exercise sessions will be randomized.

      Participants will follow a balanced diet the day before visits 2 to 5, which will be based on
      the participants food log for the 24 hours before visit one. Adjustments will be made to
      participants' food log in order to meet the macronutrient composition of 65% CHO, 25% PRO and
      15% fat, to assure they arrive at the lab in an energy replete state before visits 2 to 5.
      Participants will also be given hydration guidelines for the 24 hours before arriving at the
      lab and will be asked to refrain from any vigorous activity for 24 hours before all visits to
      the lab.

      For visits 2 to 5, participants will arrive at the lab fasted for a resting blood draw
      followed by a standard breakfast. Thirty minutes after breakfast, participants will follow
      the respective protocol of the day (control, 30-, 60- or 120-min cycling). Blood samples will
      be taken 5 minutes, 30 minutes and 60 minutes after completion of each trial. Participants
      will maintain glucose levels throughout each protocol by consuming a carbohydrate sports
      drink. The value of these visits is to see if there is a change in bone metabolism over time
      between the control, and three different cycling duration protocols.

      Blood Samples During each cycling trial, a total of four (4) blood samples from each
      participant will be collected (pre exercise, 5 min post, 30 minutes post and 1-hour post. All
      the samples will contain 5-10 ml of blood using serum and plasma tubes. Bone turnover
      markers, anabolic/hormonal markers, inflammatory markers and oxidative stress will be
      examined in each sample. To control for circadian rhythm, the exercise session and related
      blood samples will be performed at the same time of day between 9:00 am and 1:00pm.

      Anthropometric Measurements Height will be assessed using a stadiometer to the nearest 0.1 cm
      with no shoes. Body mass (kg), relative body fat (%) and fat free mass (kg) will be measured
      using Bod Pod (air displacement plethysmography method). All the participants will have
      familiarization with Bod Pod by sitting in the chamber before the test to see if they are
      claustrophobic. Participants will have the choice of an investigator of the same sex to take
      their anthropometric measurements.
