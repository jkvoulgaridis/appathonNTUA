  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: The primary objective is to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of
      18F-fluoroestradiol (FES) PET/MRI for evaluating endometriosis.

      Participants: A total of 12 participants will be recruited from individuals with clinically
      suspected endometriosis who are scheduled for planned operative laparoscopy at the University
      of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC).

      Procedures (methods): This is a prospective, one arm, single center study of 12 subjects with
      clinically suspected endometriosis to demonstrate FES PET/MR's clinical utility for diagnosis
      of endometriosis. This study will be an evaluation of the radiotracer, FES, which binds to
      estrogen receptors and has previously been used to study estrogen receptor expression in
      tumors, to detect endometriosis. Participants will undergo one FES PET/MR scan within 4 weeks
      prior to their scheduled surgery. Participants will also complete questionnaires regarding
      their condition, pain, and quality of life.

      This is a prospective, one arm, single center study of 12 subjects with clinically suspected
      endometriosis to demonstrate FES PET-MRI's clinical utility for diagnosis of endometriosis.
      The primary objective is to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of 18F-fluoroestradiol
      (FES) PET/MRI for evaluating endometriosis. Secondary objectives include comparing PET to
      conventional MRI, using histopathology from laparotomy as the gold standard and evaluating
      association of uptake values (SUV-max) with EHP-30 and pain rating scales, controlling for
      covariates.

    <description>The sensitivity of FES PET /MR is defined as the ability of readers (radiologists) to detect endometriosis in patients. Diagnostic accuracy will be defined by the histologic presence of endometriosis and by symptomatic improvement as defined surgically by the referring physician within 3 months of surgery.</description>

    <description>The specificity of FES PET /MR is defined as the ability of readers (radiologists) to detect that patients do not have endometriosis.

    <measure>Comparison of the PET sensitivity to conventional MRI, using histopathology from laparotomy as the gold standard.</measure>
    <time_frame>Upon completion of all study image data collection for all participants [approximately 1 year]</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will use McNemar's test, constructing the 2x2 table among all patients with a surgical diagnosis of positive to compare sensitivity for PET versus conventional MRI. P-values &lt;0.05 for the comparison of sensitivity will be construed as evidence that sensitivity differ between PET and conventional MRI. P-values &gt;0.05 will be considered inconclusive.</description>

    <description>The Endometriosis Health Profile-30 (EHP-30), a quality of life questionnaire used in women with endometriosis. The EHP-30 includes questions related to pain, control and powerlessness, social support, emotional wellbeing, and self image. The purpose of the EHP is to indicate the extent of self-reported ill health on each domain measured. Therefore, each scale is standardized on a scale of 0 - 100, where 0 indicates the best health status through to 100 worst health status. Scale scores for each scale are calculated from the total of the raw scores of each item in the scale divided by the maximum possible raw score of all the items in the scale, multiplied by 100. The investigators will implement a random effects linear regression model, modeling SUV-max as a function of EHP-30, while controlling for patient-level covariates (BMI, race, age). The investigators will include physician as a random effect to account for physician-level correlation.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The correlation of uptake values (SUV-max) with pain rating scales (visual analog scale - VAS), controlling for BMI, race, age, and physician.</measure>
    <time_frame>Upon completion of all study image data collection for all participants [approximately 1 year]</time_frame>
    <description>For the VAS, individuals will be given a 100mm scale and asked to draw a single vertical line corresponding to the level of pain where 0mm is no pain and 100mm is pain as bad as it possibly could be. This line will be measured and the result will be recorded in mm. The investigators will implement a random effects linear regression model, modeling SUV-max as a function of the pain rating, while controlling for patient-level covariates (BMI, race, age). The investigators will include physician as a random effect to account for physician-level correlation.</description>
