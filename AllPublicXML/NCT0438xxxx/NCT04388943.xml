  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will examine the diagnosis and prognosis of patients with cardiovascular disease
      in hospital in- and outpatients and compare their characteristics with normal controls from
      the community. The cardiovascular diseases studied include coronary artery disease, heart
      failure, heart attacks, valve disease, cardiac surgery, dysrhythmias, aneurysms, embolism,
      strokes, peripheral vascular disease and hypertension. Current methods for diagnosis and
      predicting outcome in patients are limited and may lack accuracy. This study will collect
      clinical details, and blood and urine samples from patients for analysis of proteins,
      chemicals and genetic biomarkers which will enable an examination of the pathological
      mechanisms involved in cardiovascular disease. The data will also be used to improve
      diagnosis and also improve prediction of outcome in patients (future clinical events such as
      death, further hospitalisation with cardiovascular disease and the effects of any therapy
      given to the patients). In this way, we can develop accurate ways of assessing a patient's
      condition and how it could be effectively managed. The study will last for 20 years.

    <measure>To improve understanding of disease mechanisms in cardiovascular disease</measure>
    <time_frame>20 Years</time_frame>
    <description>The principal objective is to improve upon our understanding of disease mechanisms in cardiovascular disease, using plasma and urine proteins or chemicals and a patient's genetic makeup, which may impact on the diagnosis and assessment of prognosis of cardiovascular disease.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To improve prediction of responses to different treatments, using blood proteins or chemicals and a patient's genetic makeup</measure>
    <time_frame>20 Years</time_frame>
    <description>Secondary objectives include predicting response to different treatments (which would include drugs, devices) using blood proteins or chemicals and a patient's genetic makeup, after appropriate matching by propensity scoring. Plus, assessing whether biomarkers in stool or other tissue can discern the presence and severity of coronary artery disease.</description>
