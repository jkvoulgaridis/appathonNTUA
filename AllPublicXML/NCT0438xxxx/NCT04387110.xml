  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the current project is to measure the levels of ocrelizumab in the breastmilk of
      women with multiple sclerosis (MS) and clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) who are postpartum,
      and to collect information on 12-month infant development outcomes (length, weight, head
      circumference, infections) in their offspring.

      This study will fill a significant unmet need as many women with MS at high risk for
      postpartum relapses are not effectively treated for their MS in the postpartum period due to
      lack of information about the presence, concentration and effects of medications in
      breastmilk.

    <textblock>
      Levels of ocrelizumab in breastmilk will be serially evaluated across one drug half-life from
      women with MS and CIS who are postpartum and lactating at the time of the infusion (whether
      or not they plan to continue to breastfeed their baby after the infusion). The timeline for
      breastmilk sample is dependent on infusion schedule and dosing if receiving 600mg infusion
      x1, collection will occur: before infusion and at 8H, 24H, 7D, 20D, 30D, 60D, and 90D post
      infusion; if receiving 300mg infusion x2 collection will occur: before infusion 1, at 8H,
      24H, 7D, and 14D (before infusion 2) after infusion 1 and after infusion 2 at 8H, 24H, 7D,
      20D, 30D, 60D, and 90D in 20. Blood samples to determine serum concentration of ocrelizumab
      will be collected, when possible, at the 24-hour, 14 day (if receiving 300mg infusion x2),
      and 20D timepoint(s). Both women continuing to breastfeed their infant post-infusion and
      those that chose to discontinue will be included in the study.

      In order to ensure broad collaboration as well as rapid recruitment, samples will be
      collected from patients fitting eligibility criteria upon referral to our study by other
      investigators.

    <description>The Ages and Stages Questionnaire, third edition, (ASQ-3) will be completed by participating mothers at the following timepoints postpartum, to determine the developmental age of infants: 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, 8 months, 10 months and 12 months. The questionnaire scores 5 areas of development: Communication, Gross Motor, Fine Motor, Problem Solving and Personal-Social. Cumulative scores range from 0 to 60. Higher scores indicate more positive outcomes. Each version of the ASQ-3 has different cutoff scores that indicate whether the child's development appears to be on schedule, requires monitoring or requires further assessment.</description>
