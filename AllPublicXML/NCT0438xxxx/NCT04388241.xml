  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain is the primary complication of sickle cell disease (SCD), including vaso-occlusive
      crises and more persistent, chronic pain. SCD-related pain is associated with significant
      functional impairment, spanning poor school attendance, decreased quality of life, and stress
      and mood difficulties. Pharmacological approaches are the first-line treatment for
      SCD-related pain, but these can be costly and have unwanted side effects. Given limitations
      from pharmacological approaches and the influence that poor behavioral responses have on
      disease management and health outcomes suggest a critical need for alternative and adjunctive
      treatments. Due to gaps in available behavioral treatments specifically designed for
      addressing common challenges associated with pain management in pediatric SCD, the
      investigators developed a manualized behavioral therapy protocol by tailoring existing
      evidence-based treatments. The overall goal of the intervention is to reduce the impact of
      pain on daily functioning in pediatric SCD. This study will empirically test the feasibility
      and preliminary efficacy of this intervention for youth with SCD. Children and adolescents
      with SCD between the ages of 8 and 17 years old (n=20) will be recruited to complete the
      treatment protocol. Feasibility will be assessed by examining participation and program
      completion rates, as well as feedback from a treatment acceptability questionnaire and
      qualitative interview. Participants will complete baseline assessments, weekly
      questionnaires, and post-treatment assessments (post-intervention assessment, follow-up time
      points: 1-month following the intervention, and 3-months following the intervention).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Children and adolescents with SCD (HbSS, HbSC, HbS-beta0 thalassemia, or HbS-beta+
             thalassemia) between the ages of 8 and 17 years old with pain-related disability and
             who are currently prescribed short- or long-acting opioid medications.

               1. Participants will meet at least one of the following criteria for pain-related
                  disability: 1) Have had at least 3 pain crises in the last year, 2) Have had at
                  least one admission for pain in the last year, or 3) Have missed at least one
                  week of school (5 days) in the last year

               2. Current prescription of opioids will be confirmed by participants' primary
                  hematologist, review of the electronic medical record, and discussion with the
                  family.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients and caregivers with limited English proficiency, a neurodevelopmental delay,
             or a visual or motor impairment that would interfere with their ability to complete
             the assessments and intervention.

          -  Documented history of major depressive disorder in medical record and/or through
             discussion with their primary hematology suggesting that patients may need a specific
             and higher level of therapeutic care.
