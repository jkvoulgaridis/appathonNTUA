      To evaluate the efficacy,safety and immunogenicity of TQ-B211 plus docetaxel versus
      Herceptin® plus docetaxel in Patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.Trastuzumab
      plus docetaxel was chosen as the comparator in the control group,as it represents a common
      first-line treatment option used in HER2+ MBC population in China.
