  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of the study is the evaluation of the feasibility of comprehensive service which
      has been developed while considering patient-orientated needs. With regard to the study, apps
      have been developed for both groups of participants, parents and their child which suffers
      from cancer. These apps aim at supporting the documentation and communication of the own
      condition. This includes for example a video game which can be played via tablet or
      smartphone in which questions appear addressing the personally perceived burden by children
      amongst other things. Participants of the study are children between 6 and 17 years of age
      which suffer from leukemia or tumors. Further participants of the study are at least one of
      the patient's parents. It is an observational study. Within the course of the study, the
      usual treatment is not altered actively by the study, it is, however, supplemented by
      questionnaires which will be analyzed being anonymized after the end of the study running
      time.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed as observational prospective feasibility study. The main objective is
      to assess the feasibility of a comprehensive, patient-centred service for palliative care in
      children with cancer by adapting and advancing ePRO systems, which aim at supporting the
      communication between the patients, their parents and the treating medical healthcare
      professionals. Participants of the study are pediatric oncology patients between 6 and 17
      years of age and at least one of their parents, receiving treatment at one of the
      participating clinical centers due to leukemia or solid tumors. With regard to the study,
      apps have been developed for both groups of participants, which includes inter alia a game in
      which questions about burden considering symptoms can be answered by the children.
