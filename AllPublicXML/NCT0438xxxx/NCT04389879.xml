  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Introduction:

      Orthodontic retainers are used after the completion of orthodontic treatment to assure dental
      occlusal stability and to maintain the achieved end-result. However, without retention teeth
      could go back to their initial dental malposition or could even take a different unpredicted
      position resulting once again in dental malocclusion (a deviation from normal occlusion).

      There are different types of retainers, some are fixed (glued to the back of the front
      teeth), and others are removable (can be removed and replaced into the mouth by the patient).

      While there are various retainers used for retention (stability), there is no perfect method.
      Fixed retainers (FRs) are used worldwide. On the one hand, FRs focus on preventing relapse.
      On the other hand, there are sometimes some adverse effects of retainers; they could fail at
      a certain point (break/get loose), or cause unwanted tooth movements. Until now, the choice
      of a retention method is based solely on clinicians' experience as there is no substantial
      evidence regarding the best retention method or the duration of the retention period. Some
      clinicians prolong the retention period while others prefer to keep the retainers for an
      indefinite time.

      As the world is advancing, so is the orthodontic science. New FR fabricated by CAD/CAM
      (Computer-Aided Design/Computer-Aided Manufacturing), are assumed to have greater accuracy,
      better fit, and most importantly, might offer a passive positioning of the retainer. However,
      the evidence about CAD/CAM FRs is very limited.

      Purpose:

      To investigate and compare the clinical effectiveness of two types of FRs; CAD/CAM vs.
      multistranded wire, in terms of stability (primary outcome), failure rate, adverse effects,
      cost-effectiveness, and patient satisfaction (secondary outcomes), substantial up to 5 years
      after retainer placement.

      Hypotheses:

      Compared to traditional multistranded FRs, CAD/CAM FRs have:

        -  Better long term stability,

        -  Similar failure rate,

        -  Fewer adverse effects,

        -  Similar cost-effectiveness and patient satisfaction.

      Material and Methods

      Setting: Section of Orthodontics, Department of Dentistry and Oral Health, Aarhus University,
      Denmark and Department of Orthodontics, Faculty of Dentistry, University of Oslo, Norway.

      Sample size: 126 participants are needed for this study.

      Randomization: After oral and written consent is obtained, allocation to groups, either
      conventional multistranded Stainless Steel fixed retainers, or CAD/CAM custom-cut Nickel
      Titanium fixed retainers, will take place at the last appointment before debonding. Subjects
      will be allocated 1:1 into one of the two groups.

      Intervention protocol: After completing a full active orthodontic treatment, at both centers.
      The achieved treatment end result has to be maintained in the long term in order to prevent
      relapse (movement of teeth to the initial malocclusion). One of either two different fixed
      retainers will be bonded (to the upper and lower anterior teeth) by one operator in each
      center.

      This study follows a standard retention protocol procedure carried at both centers and has a
      long term posttreatment follow-up of 5 years. Patients will be recalled for follow-up
      appointments after 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 36 and 60 months. At follow-up visits, we will perform
      the following: at 1, and 3 months - a clinical examination. At 6, 12, 24, 36, and 60 months -
      a clinical examination, a digital impression of the teeth known as &quot;an intraoral scan&quot; (Trios
      3, 3Shape, Copenhagen, Denmark) and intraoral photographs. In addition, at 1, 6, and 12
      months patients will be asked to fill out a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) form regarding
      patient satisfaction Furthermore, we will investigate stability by superimposition
      (Orthoanalyzer, 3Shape, Copenhagen, Denmark) together with recording of adverse effects (i.e.
      any changes in torque and/or rotations of the teeth).
