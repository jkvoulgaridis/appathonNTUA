    <textblock>
      The study will consist of two parts:

        -  In Study A, objectively assessed physical activity, gait, balance, range of movement of
           specific joints during walking and neurophysiological findings between patients with
           cervical spine stenosis (CSS) without myelopathy who will be treated conservatively and
           patients with stenosis and signs of myelopathy who are candidates for surgical Treatment
           will be compared.

        -  In Study B, the 6-month changes in the same outcomes in patients treated conservatively
           (from the first specialist consultation until 6 months later) and in patients treated
           surgically (preoperative day and 6-month post-operatively) will be quantified.

      Study A is a single centre cross-sectional study with two study groups, one that will be
      treated conservatively (stenosis) and one that will be treated surgically (stenosis and
      myelopathy).

      Study B is a single centre longitudinal study where the same patient groups will be followed
      up during the course of their treatment.

      Clinical, radiological, biomechanical (kinematic and electromyographic), neurological and
      neurophysiological data will be collected. Differences in and the relationship between the
      clinical, radiological, biomechanical, neurological and neurophysiological data will be
      determined .

    <description>Neck Disability Index (NDI) questionnaire, a Patient-completed, condition-specific functional status questionnaire with 10 items including pain, personal care, lifting, reading, headaches, concentration, work, driving, sleeping and recreation.
The NDI has sufficient support and usefulness to retain its current status as the most commonly used self-report measure for neck pain. A score of 0-4 points means no disability, 5-14 points mild disability, 15-24 points moderate disability, 25-34 points severe disability, 35-50 points complete disability</description>

    <description>The Berg Balance Scale (BBS) is a subjective measure for balance and risk of falling. Based on 14 items, vestibular function, balance ability, proprioception and muscle strength are assessed. The cut-off value for an elevated risk of falling is at 38 of 56 points. Older persons with a score of 45 of 56 points are able to ambulate safely and independently.</description>
