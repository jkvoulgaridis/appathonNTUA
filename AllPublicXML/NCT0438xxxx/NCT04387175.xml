  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this randomized controlled trail is to compare the efficacy of an intraoral device
      (the Carriere® Motion 3D™ Class III Appliance) with the facial mask for the early treatemnt
      of Class III malocclusion. This is a monocentric, parallel, controlled trial with blinded
      examiner.

    <description>The device made of stainless steel consists of a flexible bar with two pads at the end which are bonded bilaterally with composite resin to the lower second deciduous molar or the lower first permanent molar at the rear and the lower deciduous canine at the front. The base on the lower deciduous canine has a hook to which bilaterally elastic latex bands are connected with the vestibular tubes of the cemented bands on the upper deciduous second molars (Force 2 elastics ) or on the first permanent upper molars (Force 1 elastics), on whose palatine surface the a rapid maxillary expander is welded.</description>

    <description>The facial mask consists of a chin pad and frontal pad connected by a central steel bar. On the central bar there is a horizontal steel bar to which latex elastic bands are attached which develop 14 ounces of force. The elastics are connected to the rapid maxillary expander by means of two hooks welded on the bands of the second upper deciduous molars or the first upper permanent molars.</description>
