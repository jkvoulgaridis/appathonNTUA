  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to evaluate short course radiation in the post-operative female
      pelvis after hysterectomy in stage III-IVA endometrial adenocarcinoma patients, or any stage
      patients with uterine serous or carcinosarcoma histology. The investigators hypothesize that
      short course pelvic radiation will have an acute and late grade 3-4 toxicity rate &lt; 10%, and
      patients will benefit from both convenient and effective loco-regional control comparable to
      the traditional 5-6 weeks of radiation.

    <measure>Change in patient-reported urinary and gastrointestinal toxicity as measured by PRO-CTCAE</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 2 weeks, and 3 months post-completion of radiation</time_frame>
    <description>PRO-CTCAE responses are scored from 0 to 4 with 0=Never/Not at all/None and 4=Frequently/Very Much/Very Severe/Almost Constantly
Scores for each attribute (frequency, severity and/or interference) will be presented descriptively</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 2 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months post-completion of radiation</time_frame>
    <description>Bladder has 7 questions and bowel has 9 questions
The response for each item is standardized to a 0 to 100 scale
The standardized values will be averaged for all items within a group to create the summary or subscale score.</description>

    <description>Questionnaire asking questions about physical well-being, social/family well-being, emotional well-being, functional well-being, and other additional concerns. Answers range from 0 = not at all to 4 = very much. Questions are phrased so that higher numbers indicate a better health state,
Scoring is performed through a simple sum of item scores. Each subscale is scored, and a total score is obtained by adding each of the subscale scores.</description>
