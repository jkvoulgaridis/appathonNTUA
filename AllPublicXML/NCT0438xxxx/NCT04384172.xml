  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The researchers want to see if nerve stimulation interventions cause a change in vaginal
      blood flow. The effect of this intervention will be compared between women who have
      neurogenic (spinal cord injury) or non-neurogenic dysfunction and healthy women.
