  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to develop and validate an automatic detection and classification system
      for vertebral compression fractures on computer tomography (CT) images using an artificial
      intelligence (AI) system (named Smart Bone) by Quanta.

      A computer search of CT scans (2010.01.01-2018.09.30) was performed in Wan Fang Hospital.
      Those CT images that were retrospectively reviewed by experienced radiologists. The CT scans
      of 1000-1500 subjects aged 50 and above with and without thoracic or lumbar compression
      fractures were included in this project for machine learning and deep learning. The control
      group included those without compression fractures while the patient group were those with
      compression fractures. Subjects that did not meet the inclusion criteria were excluded.

      The cortical layer of the T12-L5 spine images were manually labelled with the labeling
      software by the the technologists and confirmed the correctness of the image by an
      experienced radiologist. All the de-linked and completed images were provided to Quanta
      Computer Inc. for subsequent classification and analysis of AI machines for deep learning to
      facilitate the development of a system for automatic detection of pressure fractures by CT.
      This newly developed automatic system will be of valuable clinical impact in assisting
      radiologists to detect and classify vertebral compression fractures precisely and accurately.

    <description>CT Imaging Reporting and Data System descriptors suggested by Smart Bone are in good agreement with those selected by experts. In other words, the CT Imaging Reporting and Data System generated by Smart Bone are not statistically different from the consensus of experts.
CT Imaging Reporting and Data System Assessment Category Score: The user makes the final decision on the Assessment Category Score. Using this Score, Smart Bone displays the assessment description.

    <description>A device named Smart Bone that is using CT image retrospectively acquired to entails a second review of CT images with Vertebral Compression Fractures through an interactive AI program developed by Quanta Computer Inc. was applied to the CT images. The device is a computer-aided detection (CADe) software application and is designed to assist radiologists to analyze Spine CT images. The device uses deep learning methods to perform vertebrae detection and classification of images.</description>

        A total of 1000-1500 subjects were recruited in both sex, aged 50 and above, and who had
        come to Wan Fang Hospital for CT scans, including those with or without vertebral
        compression fractures as the compression fractures group and the control group
        respectively.
