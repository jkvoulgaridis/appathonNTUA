  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It was aimed to demonstrate whether erectile dysfunction is affected by BH pathogenesis and
      whether there is a relationship between erectile dysfunction and BD pathogenesis by assessing
      both sexual function and retinal micro-vascular blood flow in BH which may involve vessels
      from all calibrations and nature.

      Patients with factors and results that could cause sexual dysfunction will be excluded from
      the study.An International Index of ErectileFunction (IIEF) questionnaire will be applied to
      a total of 35 patients under 45 years old who met the inclusion criteria. IIEF's erectile
      function,sexual desire,sexual satisfaction,orgasmic function and general satisfaction sub
      parameters and Optical Coherence Eye Tomography (OCTA) data will compared.

    <measure>International Index of Erectile Function-15</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>This scale assessing the quality of erectile function within the previous 4 weeks was developed by Rosen et al. in 1997. The Turkish validity study was performed by Turunç et al. [30]. The IIEF-15 assesses male sexual function in 5 domains: erectile function (1-30 points), orgasmic function (0-10 points), sexual desire (2-10 points), sexual satisfaction from intercourse (0-15 points) and overall satisfaction (2-10 points). In contrast to other functions, the severity of erectile dysfunction can be rated with an overall score ranging from 6 to 30 points. Erectile function was graded as follows: 0-10 points as severe erectile dysfunction (ED); 11-16 points as moderate ED; 17-21 points as mild-moderate ED; 22-25 points as mild ED; 26-30 points as no erectile dysfunction.</description>

    <measure>Optical coherence tomography angiography</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>It is a functional method that detects the movement contrast in the bloodstream and displays the capillary nets of the retina and choroid and the outer retina without using paint.It is a non-invasive method that provides static volumetric angiography information.From the quantitative measurement results presented by calculating automatically by the software used by the device, the area of the foveal avascular zone (PHASE), the value of the asymmetric index (AI), the superficial and Vascular density (VD) percentages and retinal thickness values in deep capillary plexuses were included in the study.OCTA findings are classified in stages 1-5. OCTA findings worsen as the stage number increases. While stage 1 shows normal superficial capillary plexus; In stage 5, decreased vascular density in the outer retina and significant thinning in the retina are observed.</description>

        Behçet's disease (BD) is a chronic, multi-systemic vasculitis characterized by remissions
        and exacerbations, where etiology hasn't been fully elucidated [1]. It was first described
        as oral aphthae, genital ulcerations, and iridocyclitis with hypopyon by Hulusi Behçet in
        1937 [2]. Although its etiology hasn't been fully understood, it is widely accepted that
        the disease is caused by excessive inflammatory response triggered by environmental factors
        in individuals with genetic susceptibility
