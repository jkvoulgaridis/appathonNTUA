  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study is evaluating how well pembrolizumab and combination chemotherapy before
      surgery work for the treatment of specific types of muscle-invasive bladder cancer that have
      unusual appearance (variants). Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as
      pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with
      the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      methotrexate, vinblastine, adriamycin, and cisplatin work in different ways to stop the
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by
      stopping them from spreading. Giving pembrolizumab and combination chemotherapy before
      surgery may work better in treating patients with these muscle invasive bladder cancer
      variants compared to chemotherapy alone.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 of weeks 0, 3, and
      6 and methotrexate IV over 1-2 minutes, vinblastine IV over 10 minutes, doxorubicin IV over
      10-25 minutes, and cisplatin IV over 60 minutes on day 1 of weeks 0, 2, 4, and 6 in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive pegfilgrastim
      subcutaneously (SC) on day 1 or 2 of weeks 0, 2, 4, and 6 in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo standard of care radical
      cystectomy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up about 1 month after surgery and
      then every 3-6 months for 2 years.

             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive
             drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a
             form of systemic treatment and is allowed. Note: Patients with active well controlled
             type 1 diabetes mellitus, vitiligo, Graves' disease, Hashimoto disease, eczema, lichen
             simplex chronicus, or psoriasis, not requiring systemic immunosuppression within the
             past 2 years are not excluded

          -  Has history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or has current
             pneumonitis

          -  Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy

          -  Has known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Note: no HIV testing is
             required

          -  Has known history of active hepatitis B (defined as hepatitis B surface antigen
             [HBsAg] detected) or known active hepatitis C virus (defined as hepatitis C virus
             [HCV] ribonucleic acid [RNA] [qualitative] detected) infection. Note: no testing for
             hepatitis B and hepatitis C is required

          -  Has known history of active TB (Bacillus tuberculosis). Note: no testing is required
             unless it is clinically indicated

          -  Has history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality
             that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the subject's
             participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator

          -  Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
