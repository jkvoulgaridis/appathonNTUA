      HVAPNOR consists of Three work packages:

        1. Prospective observational study of Hospital (HAP) - and ventilator-Associated pneumonia
           (VAP) at 5 hospitals in Norway. Establish optimized routines for microbiological
           sampling, diagnostics and antibiotic stewardship..

        2. Biomarker studies in HAP and VAP.

        3. Studies on capacity building in HAP and VAP diagnostics.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lower respiratory tract infections include hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-
      associated pneumonia (VAP) with a very high mortality in critically ill patients. Diagnosis
      is difficult with an inherent uncertainty and complicated by comorbidity, lack of routines
      for high-quality airway sampling and low sensitivity of routine microbiological tests. There
      is limited data on the aetiology and burden from HAP and VAP, and to our knowledge, no
      previous prospective HAP and VAP studies has been performed in Norway. In the absence of
      rapid and accurate microbiological diagnosis, seriously ill HAP and VAP patients are often
      provided broad-spectrum antibiotics that have to be active on putative multi-drug resistant
      (MDR) bacteria, as failure to initiate prompt adequate therapy is associated with increased
      mortality. Overuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics promotes the selection and dissemination of
      MDR bacteria.

      HVAPNOR brings together a multidisciplinary research team from Norwegian (Haukeland
      University Hospital [HUS], University of Bergen [UoB], Vestre Viken Hospital Trust [VVHF],
      and international institutions (Denmark, Netherlands and UK), with a strong record in
      respiratory disease research.

      The overall aims of the HVAPNOR study are to contribute to effective diagnostic and
      antibiotic stewardship, improved treatment and management of HAP and VAP. We will in a
      Norwegian context, map the incidence and ascertain the aetiology of HAP/VAP infections.
      During a two-year period, adult HAP and VAP patients admitted at HUS and VVHF, will be
      identified and voluntarily included in a prospective descriptive study. We will strengthen
      the routines for adequate airway sampling and assess if provision of ultra-rapid,
      high-quality accurate molecular diagnostics will provide a more comprehensive microbiological
      etiological diagnose than routine analysis. A direct feedback to the clinician can facilitate
      pathogen-directed usage of antibiotics. We will evaluate the potential of molecular
      diagnostic platforms for the detection of pathogens and antimicrobial markers in HAP and VAP.
      Furthermore, we will identify barriers that inhibit the acceptance of rapid molecular tests;
      and contribute to the optimisation of treatment protocols for HAP and VAP.

      Finally, our study will also evaluate and identify new and clinically relevant diagnostic and
      prognostic biomarkers, including immune biomarkers and transcriptional profiling, in HAP and
      VAP.

      The HVAPNOR study is in line with the objectives of the funding agencies, addresses clinical
      research activities to help to ensure that patients receive high-quality and reliable
      diagnostics and optimized treatment.
