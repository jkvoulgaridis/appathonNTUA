  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational, descriptive, prospective and retrospective data collection study.
      The purpose of this study is to observe radiographic outcomes of patients who will undergo
      anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) utilizing Tritanium C (Stryker Spine). The
      rate of fusion success and adverse events will be compared retrospectively to patients who
      underwent instrumented ACDF utilizing structural allograft bone with plates.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Retrospective subjects will consist of 20 patients that received one or two level ACDF
      structural allograft with plates with autograft and/or allograft comprised of cancellous and
      /or corticocancellous bone chips. These subjects will be retrospectively reviewed for
      radiographic outcomes at 3, 6 and 12 months postoperatively, as well as adverse events and
      sensory and motor outcomes. If available, NDI and VAS questionnaires completed during
      baseline and post-op visits will be collected. Prospective subjects will consist of 20
      patients who are receiving Tritanium C as standard of care. These subjects will be asked to
      complete NDI and VAS questionnaires at baseline and post-op visits. Radiographic outcomes,
      adverse events, sensory and motor neurological outcomes, as determined per standard of care
      will be collected at those same time points. The total number of subjects is N=40.
