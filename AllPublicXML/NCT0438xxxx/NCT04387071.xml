    <textblock>
      This phase Ib/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of CMP-001 and how well it
      works when given together with INCAGN01949 in treating patients with stage IV pancreatic
      cancer and other cancers except melanoma. CMP-001 is made up of a short piece of DNA that is
      packaged in a protein, known as a virus-like particle (VLP). VLPs are detected and processed
      by cells of the immune system. The DNA contained in CMP-001 activates the immune system and
      recruit cells of the immune system to the tumor. INCAGN01949 is an antibody, a type of
      protein, which has been shown to stimulate the immune system. Injecting CMP-001 and
      INCAGN01949 directly into the tumor may work against tumor cells to slow tumor growth by
      causing tumor cells to die.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose and tolerance of virus-like particle
      VLP-encapsulated TLR9 agonist CMP-001 (CMP-001 [TLR9 agonist]) in combination with agonistic
      anti-OX40 monoclonal antibody INCAGN01949 (INCAGN01949) (an activating antibody against OX40)
      both given intratumorally for patients with previously treated (for their metastatic disease)
      pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and other types of cancer except melanoma. (Phase IB) II. To
      determine the efficacy (disease control rate of complete response [CR] + partial response
      [PR] + stable disease [SD] X 16 weeks) of CMP001 (TLR9 agonist) in combination with
      INCAGN01949 (anti-OX40 antibody) for patients with previously treated (for their metastatic
      disease) pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. (Phase II) III. To determine effects on tumor
      markers. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Define the toxicity of the combination of CMP-001 (TLR9) + INCAGN01949 (OX40).

      II. Determine progression free survival and overall survival.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Using flow cytometry on peripheral blood OX40 expression will be analyzed within the
      lymphocyte subsets (effector T cell [Teff] and regulatory T cell [Treg]).

      II. On tissue samples collected prior to, and during, treatment, will:

      IIa. Use flow cytometry to enumerate CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets, and the expression of
      activation/differentiation markers (including CD127, HLA-DR, CD45RO, CCR7, CXCR3) on each.

      IIb. Use reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and sequencing to amplify
      and characterize the T-cell receptor (TCR)a and b sequences of tumor-infiltrating T cells,
      looking for evidence of oligoclonal T cell expansion, OX40 expression.

      IIc. If there is adequate tumor tissue, perform ribonucleic acid sequencing (RNAseq) to
      determine different immune cell populations, including T cells and macrophages.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase Ib, dose-escalation study of INCAGN01949, followed by a phase II
      study.

      Patients receive CMP-001 subcutaneously (SC) on day 1 of weeks 1 and 2 and intratumorally
      (IT) on day 1 of weeks 3-6 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients also receive INCAGN01949 IT on day 1 of weeks 3-6 in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days, and then every 12
      weeks.
