      In this study the goal is to determine the causes of concern among the patients who will
      undergo surgical operations and receive general anesthesia, to gauge their preoperative
      anxiety levels and to study the effects of the BATHE method on preoperative anxiety and
      patient satisfaction.

      In this study the goal is to determine the causes of concern among the patients who will
      undergo surgical operations and receive general anesthesia, to gauge their preoperative
      anxiety levels and to study the effects of the BATHE method on preoperative anxiety and
      patient satisfaction.

      500 patients who were planned to undergo elective surgery and under general anesthesia as
      anesthesia method were included in the study. Demographic data of patients, their three
      biggest fears of anesthesia and APAIS scores were recorded. The patients were divided into
      two groups, they underwent BATHE anamnesis or standard anamnesis methods according to their
      groups, then their APAIS and patient satisfaction scores were recorded.
