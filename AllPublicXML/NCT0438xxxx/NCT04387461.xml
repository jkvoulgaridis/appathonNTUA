  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the activity of intravesical administration of CG0070 and intravenous
      administration of Pembrolizumab in patients with tissue pathology-confirmed non-muscular
      invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) who have Bacillus-Calmette-Guerin (BCG) unresponsive disease
      with carcinoma in situ (CIS) with or without Ta/T1 papillary disease.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An opened label trial designed to evaluate CG0070 and DDM in combination with Pembrolizumab
      in patients with NMIBC who have failed prior BCG therapy.

      The target population of 37 subjects with CIS with or without concomitant high-grade Ta or T1
      papillary disease will be enrolled.

      BCG failure is defined as persistent or recurrent disease within 12 months of completion of
      adequate BCG therapy.

    <description>CG0070 will be administered intravesically (IVE) following a sequence of bladder washes with 5% DDM and normal saline. CG0070 will be administered weekly x 6 on Day 1 to Week 6. If the patient shows persistent high-grade disease at Week 12, the patient will receive another cycle of 6 weekly treatments. If there is no disease present at Week 12 (e.g., complete response) then the patient will receive 3 weekly treatments.
Beginning at Week 24, patients will receive weekly x 3 treatments every 3 months through Week 48 then every 24 weeks thereafter.
Pembrolizumab will be given intravenous (IV) concurrently starting on Day 1 and continue every 3 weeks for up to 2 years.</description>
