  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research project is a randomized cross-over pilot trial which aims to test the efficacy
      of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) for the treatment of Repetitive Behaviors (RB) and self-injurious
      behavior (SIB) in patients with Cornelia de Lange Syndrome (CdLs).

      NAC is a known anti-oxidative stress and neuroprotective agent, which has been shown to
      decrease the occurrence of SIB such as skin picking. NAC has also shown partial response in
      trials for compulsive behaviors in Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and related disorders
      in autism.

      Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS) is a genetic disorder with autistic features, including RBs
      and SIB. In this randomized clinical trial, participants with CdLS will be blindly assigned
      one of two possible treatment arms: 1) placebo (8 weeks) and NAC (8 weeks); or 2) NAC (8
      weeks) and placebo (8 weeks), with an intermediate 2-week washout period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS) is a genetic condition caused by mutations in
      cohesin-related genes, mostly notably NIPBL. The CdLS phenotype includes physical features
      such as typical facies, limb abnormalities, short stature, and hirsutism as well
      developmental and behavioral manifestations such as intellectual disability, communication
      deficits, autistic traits and repetitive/self-injurious behaviors (RBs/SIB).

      Behavioral challenges such as RBs/SIB pose a significant obstacle to quality of life to
      individuals with CdLS and families. In CdLS, disruption of developmental systems can impact
      neuronal and brain development, and impact GABAergic inhibitory interneuron formation,
      leading to RBs/SIB. Given the potential for dysregulated excitatory glutamatergic output in
      CdLS, neuronal oxidative stress may play a role in these maladaptive behaviors. NAC
      replenishes Central Nervous System (CNS) glutathione, a potent antioxidant and may ameliorate
      RBs/SIB. NAC has been shown to decrease maladaptive behaviors in autism and grooming
      disorders such as excoriation disorder (skin picking).

      An 18-week cross-over trial is proposed to decrease RBs/SIB comprising two 8-week
      double-blinded active or placebo treatment with a 2-week wash out period in between. A
      cross-over design will afford for higher efficiency in sample size for similar power. Dosage
      will be titrated weekly starting at 600 mg daily and then increased by 600 mg every week to a
      target dose of 1800 mg per day. Participants will be recruited through CdLS Foundation.

      Based on a mechanism for regulation glutamate transmission homeostasis in the central nervous
      system, the use of NAC may be particularly pertinent to individuals with CdLS. It is known
      that in CdLS genetic networks that impact on limb formation overlap significantly with
      developmental systems that impact neuronal and brain development, in particular GABAergic
      inhibitory interneuron formation. Given a dysregulated excitatory glutamatergic mechanism due
      to interneuron deficits, which can then lead to neuronal oxidative stress and programmed cell
      death, NAC may act as a key homeostatic regulator to prevent glutamate overactivity and
      neuronal damage in CdLS.

    <description>CYBOCS-PDD scores range from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 20, higher scores indicate greater symptom severity. Efficacy of the intervention would be assessed by ≥35% reduction in CYBOCS-PDD repetitive behaviors measure score.</description>

    <description>The ABC irritability sub-scale consists of 15 items of which 3 focus on Self-injurious Behaviors (SIB). Each item takes scores ranging from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 3. The overall score for the SIB items would range from 0 to 9 with higher scores indicating greater symptom severity. Efficacy of the intervention in reducing self-injurious behaviors would be assessed by a ≥35% reduction in ABC irritability SIB items sub-scale score.</description>

    <description>The ABC irritability sub-scale consists of 15 items of which 12 focus on depressed mood and irritable behaviors (non-injurious behaviors). Each item takes a score ranging from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 3. The overall score for the non-injurious behavior items would range from 0 to 36 with higher scores indicating greater symptom severity. Efficacy of the intervention in reducing depressed mood and irritability would be assessed by a ≥35% score reduction in ABC irritability non-injurious behavior items of sub-scale.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, week 8, week 10, week 18</time_frame>
    <description>The PSI-SF is a 36-item questionnaire designed to measure stress in the parent-child system and identify those families most in need of follow-up services. The PSI-SF consists of three sub-scales: Parental Distress, Parent-Child Dysfunctional Interaction, and Difficult Child. Each sub-scale consists of 12 items rated from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Sub-scale scores therefore range from 12 to 60, whereas the total score ranges from 36 to 180. High scores on the PSI-SF total score indicate greater levels of stress.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, week 8, week 10, week 18</time_frame>
    <description>The Childhood Autism Rating Scale-Second Edition (CARS2) is a 15-item rating scale used to identify children with autism and distinguishing them from those with developmental disabilities. The 15 items can take 4 scores where 1 stands for normal for child's age, 2 for mildly abnormal, 3 for moderately abnormal and 4 for severely abnormal. Scores range form 15 to 60 with 30 being the cutoff rate for a diagnosis of mild autism. Scores 30-37 indicate mild to moderate autism, while scores between 38 and 60 are characterized as severe autism.</description>

    <measure>Change in Clinical Global Impression - Severity of Illness (CGI-S) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 8, week 10, week 18</time_frame>
    <description>CGI-S asks the clinician one question: &quot;Considering your total clinical experience with this particular population, how mentally ill is the patient at this time?&quot; which is rated on the following seven-point scale: 1=normal, not at all ill; 2=borderline mentally ill; 3=mildly ill; 4=moderately ill; 5=markedly ill; 6=severely ill; 7=among the most extremely ill patients. This rating is based upon observed and reported symptoms, behavior, and function in the past seven days. Clearly, symptoms and behavior can fluctuate over a week; the score should reflect the average severity level across the seven days.</description>
