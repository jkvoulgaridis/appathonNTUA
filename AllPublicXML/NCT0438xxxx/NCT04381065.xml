  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to evaluate whether persons with Parkinson's disease
      (PwP) whose Parkinson's disease (PD) symptoms are uncontrolled have improved clinical patient
      outcomes and quality of life when managed with the aid of objective measurement and use of
      PKG target ranges compared to PwP treated using only standard of care (SOC) (medical history,
      physical examination).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to compare the value of the Personal KinetiGraph®
      (PKG®) System and SOC vs. the SOC alone for treatment of PwP. The study aims to evaluate
      clinical outcomes, quality of life outcomes, health economic benefits, duration of controlled
      status, and need for additional PD treatment through 3 years follow-up of PwP specifically
      treated to a target range when using the PKG data in the clinical management of PD in routine
      clinical care compared to those managed with SOC alone. All subjects will be treated by
      Movement Disorder Specialists and General Neurologists with expertise in PD. Both groups will
      be recommended to undergo treatment changes until they reach a &quot;controlled state&quot; that is
      determined by either the clinician using SOC (PKG- Group) or using recommended target ranges
      for PKG scores and SOC assessments (PKG+ Group). Investigators will utilize standard
      available treatments to manage these PwP in both groups.

    <description>The Personal KinetiGraph (PKG®) System consists of the following:
A wrist-worn movement recording device known as the PKG® Watch, designed to acquire data on the kinematics of movement disorder symptoms over a 6-10 day period
Proprietary algorithms to translate raw movement data collected by the PKG® Watch
Data-driven report known as the PKG®
The PKG® provides continuous, objective, ambulatory assessment of the treatable and disabling symptoms of Parkinson's disease including tremor, bradykinesia and dyskinesia. The PKG® also provides an assessment of daytime somnolence and an indication of propensity for impulsive behaviors.</description>
