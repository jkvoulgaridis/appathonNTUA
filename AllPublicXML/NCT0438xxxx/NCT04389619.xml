      Comparing between the effect of Fractional Microneedling Radiofrequency Versus Intralesional
      Steroid Injection with and without Microneedling on Tissue levels of PDGF &amp; CTGF in
      Hypertrophic Scars

    <textblock>
      In each patient, each one of the two scars, or each side of a large scar will be assigned to
      one of the following treatment methods: 1-Fractional microneedling radiofrequency
      2-Intralesional steroids injection. Scars treated with intralesional steroids will be
      subgrouped into two groups, one group treated with only intralesional steroids and the other
      group treated with intralesional steroids and followed by microneedling. Fractional
      microneedling radiofrequency parameters; Power: 6 v, Exposure time: 800 ms. Depth: 2.5 mm
      (using non-insulated micro-needles), Frequency: 2 Hz. For intralesional steroids injection,
      Triamcinolone acetonide will be injected in concentration 1:2 (20 mg/dl) using insulin
      syringe. Microneedling will be done using the same tip of the fractional microneedling
      radiofrequency at same depth. All patients will receive 5 treatment sessions 4 weeks apart.
