  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rotator Cuff (RC) injuries are a progressive clinical condition that starts with an acute
      tendonitis, continues with partial thickness rupture and results in a full thickness rupture
      in the advanced period.

      Arthroscopic RC repair is effective in the acute RC ruptures treatment caused by traumatic
      events. In the acute period after arthroscopic RC repair, shoulder joint range of motion
      (ROM), muscle strength and shoulder functionality are decreased and daily activities are
      adversely affected. In the long-term, many studies have reported that these symptoms
      gradually decreaced.

      Many studies investigating postoperative treatment of RC rupture have mostly focused on
      parameters such as postoperative pain, functionality, muscle strength, ROM and quality of
      life.Evaluation of these clinical parameters is necessary for patient follow-up in the early
      period. However, it is unclear whether the biomechanical etiologic factors continue that lead
      to RC rupture in the advanced period after surgery.

      Therefore, the objective of this study was functional performance of shoulder after
      arthroscopic Rotator Cuff repair and ınvestigation of performance related factors.

    <measure>Modified Constant Murley Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Three months</time_frame>
    <description>Shoulder functionality was analyzed by using the MCMS evaluating pain, daily living activities, ROM and strength. Pain was evaluated by visual analog scale and ROM by goniometer. The force in the shoulder abduction position was measured with the Digital analyzer defined by the spring balance technique.</description>
