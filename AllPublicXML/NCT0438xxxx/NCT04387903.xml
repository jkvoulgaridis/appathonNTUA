    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to outline the incidence of early and late reoperation after PD,
      examine the risk factors for early surgical intervention and its impact on the surgical
      outcome, hospital stay, diseases recurrence and patient survival, address variable
      indications for late readmission and reoperation after PD and its impact on patient survival
      and disease recurrence.

      This is a retrospective cohort study of all patients who underwent PD for periampullary
      tumors in Gastrointestinal Surgical Center (GISC), Mansoura University, Egypt in the period
      between 2000 and 2018.The exclusion criteria included any patients with locally advanced
      periampullary tumor, metastases, patients with advanced liver cirrhosis (Child B or C),
      malnutrition, or coagulopathy.

      Patient data were recorded in a prospectively maintained database. Preoperative variables
      included; age, sex, body mass index, patients' symptoms and signs, laboratory tests, tumor
      markers and preoperative biliary drainage. Intraoperative variables included; liver status,
      tumor size, pancreatic duct diameter, texture of the pancreas, operative time, blood loss,
      pancreatic reconstruction method and blood transfusion. Postoperative variables included
      postoperative complications, drain amylase, liver function, day to resume oral feeding,
      postoperative stay, re-exploration, hospital mortality, postoperative pathology, and surgical
      safety margins.

      Data regarding reoperation included incidence, male to female ratio, hospital stay, interval
      to reoperation, number of explorations, indication of reoperation and surgical management,
      and postoperative outcome in terms of morbidity and hospital stay. Follow-up was carried out
      one week postoperatively, 3 months, 6 months and then after one year. The minimum duration of
      follow up was 2 years. Follow up was done by thorough history taking, clinical examination
      and abdominal CT in case of suspicious lesions on pelvi-abdominal ultrasound.

        This is a retrospective cohort study of all patients who underwent PD for periampullary
        malignant lesions in the duration between January 2000 and May 2018.

        Preoperative assessment was performed by clinical examination and detailed laboratory
        investigations. Assessment of local extension of the tumor and metastatic work-up was
        performed by pelvi-abdominal ultrasound (US), triphasic abdominal computerized tomography
        (CT) with angiographic assessment of the surrounding vessels, bone survey, and chest X-ray.
        Preoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) for preoperative biliary
        drainage was performed in selected cases
