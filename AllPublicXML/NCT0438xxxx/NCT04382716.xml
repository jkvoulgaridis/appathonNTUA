  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a brief (3 month) longitudinal study following children between the ages of
      4-16 years old who have been diagnosed with Pediatric Acute-Onset Neuropsychiatric Syndrome
      (PANS). Parents and children (who are at a 2nd grade reading level) will complete
      questionnaires online or in person weekly for 3 months. Additionally, parents will track
      their child's symptoms 3 times/week using a mobile application for 3 months. The
      investigators are hoping to begin to characterize the longitudinal trajectory of
      neuropsychiatric symptoms in children with PANS. Additionally, the study will seek to
      identify baseline demographic and clinical characteristics (e.g., gender, recent onset versus
      chronic course, GAS versus other triggers) that predict severity of baseline neuropsychiatric
      symptoms and predict change in symptoms over time.

          -  Abrupt onset of OCD or severely restricted food intake

          -  At least 2 equally abrupt-onset concurrent neuropsychiatric symptoms from the
             following 7 categories: anxiety, emotional lability/depression,
             irritability/aggression/severely oppositional behaviors, behavioral/developmental
             regression, deterioration in school performance, sensory or motor abnormalities (e.g.
             tics), somatic symptoms (e.g., urinary, sleep)

          -  Neuropsychiatric symptoms are not better explained by a known neurological or medical
             disorder.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        - Too unstable psychiatrically or medically to participate safely in the protocol, per
        clinical judgment of the Principal Investigator or Co-Investigator
