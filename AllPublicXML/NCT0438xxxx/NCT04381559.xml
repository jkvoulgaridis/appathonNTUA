  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given the continued high human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevalence rates among gay,
      bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) in North American cities, there is a
      critical need for HIV prevention interventions for MSM in Canada. Social anxiety, or anxiety
      about being evaluated in interpersonal and performance situations, is a reliable risk factor
      for condomless anal sex (CAS) among MSM. Social anxiety may also increase substance use in
      sexual situations, which is another risk factor for HIV among MSM. As such, an
      empirically-based social anxiety treatment may also reduce HIV risk behaviours among MSM. The
      present study will provide the first efficacy data for a novel and innovative HIV prevention
      intervention for MSM. This intervention will build upon empirically supported interventions
      to reduce HIV risk among MSM and therapies to reduce social anxiety. The investigators
      propose to test the efficacy of a novel integrated HIV prevention intervention that combines
      the most empirically supported treatment for social anxiety disorder, cognitive-behavioural
      therapy, with HIV risk reduction counselling in order to simultaneously treat social anxiety
      disorder, substance use disorders, and HIV sexual risk behaviour. This study will be a
      randomized controlled trial comparing the study intervention relative to applied relaxation,
      a behavioural intervention that is efficacious in treating social anxiety disorder but that
      does not address substance use problems or HIV sexual risk behaviours. For this trial, 176
      participants will be randomized to either 12 sessions of cognitive-behavioural therapy with
      HIV risk reduction counselling or 12 sessions of applied relaxation.

      Participants will be eligible for the trial if they are HIV-negative, report clinically
      significant symptoms of social anxiety disorder, substance use 2 hours before or during
      sexual activity, and CAS without the use of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with a male
      partner who was not known to be HIV-negative. PrEP is a biomedical prevention approach in
      which HIV-negative individuals are provided with daily oral antiretroviral medication for the
      primary prevention of HIV.126 The present intervention, if found to be efficacious, is
      innovative in that mental health clinicians will be able to not only extend empirically
      supported therapies tested primarily with heterosexual populations to MSM, but they will also
      be able to prevent HIV through empirically supported psychotherapy practice.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) continue to bear a disproportionate
      burden of the sexually transmitted infections (STI), such as HIV in Canada, largely
      attributable to efficient transmission during condomless anal sex (CAS). Despite overall
      declines in HIV incidence since 2005, HIV incidence among MSM remains stable. In 2016, MSM
      accounted for 52.5% of new HIV diagnoses in Canada, compared with 56.8% in 2014. MSM also
      represent over half of all prevalent HIV cases. The HIV epidemic among MSM has failed to
      decline despite biomedically-driven efforts to reduce infectiousness through the
      proliferation of antiretroviral Treatment as Prevention, and the emergence of HIV
      Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) to reduce HIV susceptibility. The epidemiologic data
      underscore the need for efficacious interventions for reducing sexual risk behaviour among
      MSM. The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) has therefore identified MSM as a high
      priority population to reach with prevention initiatives.

      Social anxiety is a risk factor for CAS among MSM. It is typically defined as the experience
      of fear of and apprehension about being evaluated in interpersonal situations, including
      romantic or sexual relationships. Social anxiety is higher among gay men and other sexual
      minority populations than among heterosexuals on both dimensional measures and categorical
      measures, with recent studies reporting the prevalence of social anxiety disorders among MSM
      as 22.3-22.9%.

      Social anxiety predicts risky sex among MSM. Research suggests a direct relation between
      social anxiety and CAS among MSM. Social anxiety was associated with a greater proportion of
      receptive and insertive CAS even after adjusting for condom use negotiation, depression, and
      club drug use. Social anxiety may also increase substance use in sexual situations, which is
      another risk factor for HIV among MSM. However, no studies have examined the efficacy of
      social anxiety treatment on CAS among MSM. Social anxiety is highly modifiable via
      cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT).

      Fears of being sexually rejected by one's partner fully accounted for the association between
      social anxiety at baseline and CAS at 6-month follow-up. This study is consistent with
      previous findings that 32% of gay men reported being less likely to use condoms when they
      were concerned their partner would react negatively. Substance use may be another mediator.
      Social anxiety is also a risk factor for later alcohol use and other substance use problems
      in clinical and nonclinical samples, including among MSM. Substance use tends to follow
      social anxiety disorder because alcohol and other substances are used to self-medicate
      anxiety symptoms in social situations. Alcohol and substance use in sexual situations was a
      relatively consistent risk factor for CAS among Canadian MSM, as well as higher HIV
      incidence. Due to consistent data linking substance use to HIV risks, it has been suggested
      that incorporating alcohol and substance use treatment into sexual risk reduction counselling
      may increase the efficacy of HIV prevention efforts for MSM. Social anxiety may have a
      specific relationship with substance use in creating risk for HIV and other STIs.

      The present study will provide efficacy data for a novel and innovative STI/HIV prevention
      intervention for MSM. This intervention, called Sexual Confidence, builds upon empirically
      supported treatments for social anxiety, including social anxiety-related substance use, by
      adding risk reduction counselling to reduce STI/HIV sexual risk behaviour.

      Over the past 10 years, numerous well-designed clinical trials have established the efficacy
      of behavioural interventions to reduce HIV risk behaviour among HIV-negative individuals.
      However, the success of these programs is limited and evidence suggests these effects
      diminish over time. Improving the efficacy of these programs is a public health priority.

      The current proposal seeks to reach individuals who are at higher risk for engaging in
      continued HIV risk behaviour due to the presence of social anxiety and substance use in
      sexual situations, and who may have difficulty responding to an intervention that targets
      sexual risk taking alone. Research from multiple countries suggests that all MSM are not
      equally at risk for HIV. A preponderance of data indicates the incremental presence of
      co-occurring mental health and substance use problems, called syndemic, predict both HIV
      prevalence and HIV sexual risk behaviour among MSM. One of the largest study of MSM from 151
      countries reported a strong dose-response relationship with increasing odds of HIV infection
      and greater number of syndemic problems. Compared with those without syndemic problems, the
      odds of HIV infection among those with 1, 2 and 3 or more syndemic problems were 1.67, 2.02
      and 2.35 times greater respectively. The MSM in our study may account for almost half (22% of
      MSM who have double the risk for contracting HIV) of the HIV epidemic in Canada and beyond.
      Our team and others in sexual health promotion and HIV prevention have found that untreated
      mental health issues interfere with safer sexual practices. If the investigators wish to meet
      the HIV prevention needs of MSM they need to augment HIV prevention interventions by
      addressing the mental health problems that contribute to increased risk in this group and
      that impede the efficacy of traditional HIV prevention efforts.

      Meta-analyses suggest that behavioural interventions can be efficacious at reducing
      self-reported CAS among MSM. Other reviews found greater efficacy with active interventions
      rather than interventions where participants just receive information. In accordance with
      these findings, the Sexual Confidence program includes actively role-playing situations in
      which participants practice their safer sex negotiation skills. Given the lack of efficacious
      interventions designed in Canada, there is a need for rigorous empirical testing of the
      effects of HIV prevention interventions for Canadian MSM.

      Rates of Syphilis, Chlamydia and Gonorrhoea have risen among MSM, especially among HIV+ MSM
      living in the Canadian urban centers including Toronto. Co-infection with HIV is particularly
      concerning as CAS with HIV+ MSM can increase likelihood of transmission. A cohort study from
      the Ontario HIV Treatment Network reported a 12-month cumulative incidence of 1.7% (95% CI
      1.1% to 2.2%) for chlamydia/gonorrhea, and having CAS with multiple HIV+ partners (HR=3.3,
      95% CI 1.4 to 7.8) was a strong predictor of the infection.

      CBT focuses on reducing psychological distress and the psychosocial interference of anxiety,
      substance use, and other psychological problems using cognitive restructuring techniques
      (i.e., teaching people to think more realistically about the situations they fear) and by
      repeated exposure to feared situations. CBT promotes learning adaptive responses to feared
      stimuli and is hypothesized to facilitate cognitive changes. Although behavioural therapies
      such as AR and exposure therapy are also brief and efficacious interventions, only CBT has
      evidence supporting its use when social anxiety disorder and substance use problems are
      comorbid.

      CBT has proven to be acceptable among diverse MSM populations. A manualized format, the
      availability of training, and the presence of competence and adherence rating scales are
      additional characteristics that make CBT a feasible modality for HIV prevention programming.
      Lastly, the conceptual underpinnings for CBT (social cognitive theory) are shared by most
      other research-supported HIV risk reduction interventions.

      The current state of the science identifies behavioural therapies, including CBT, as the
      psychosocial treatment of choice for social anxiety disorder. A review of 32 RCTs reported
      that the average CBT treated participant scored better than 80% of the waitlist and 66% of
      the placebo participants, and patients continue to increase the magnitude of their treatment
      gains over time. Pharmacotherapy treatments fare as well as CBT although pharmacotherapy
      often requires continuing treatment indefinitely to prevent relapse, whereas CBT has a finite
      number of sessions and is associated with strong maintenance of treatment gains. There are
      insufficient research findings available to evaluate interpersonal psychotherapy or
      psychodynamic therapy as treatment options for social anxiety disorder, and these modalities
      were not given further consideration.

      Our main objective is to test the efficacy of this integrated program in reducing sexual risk
      behaviour using a 2-armed randomized controlled trial (RCT). Secondarily, we will compare the
      social anxiety, substance use in sexual situations, and the cumulative incidence of bacterial
      STIs between the two arms over a 9-month follow-up period. The investigators hypothesize that
      relative to the control condition, Sexual Confidence will reduce sexual risk behaviour, as
      defined by CAS with HIV-positive or unknown HIV status sexual partners without the use of
      PrEP. The investigators further hypothesize that Sexual Confidence will result in greater
      reductions in social anxiety and substance use in sexual situations.

      Our proposed research is a single blind, two arm randomized trial. Participants will be
      randomly assigned to the CBT or Applied Relaxation (AR) arm. Counsellors cannot be blinded as
      they are providing treatment, however assessors will be blinded to treatment condition.
      Participants will not be provided with details on the treatment condition to which they were
      not assigned to minimize the possibility that participant beliefs about which condition is
      better will impact outcomes.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to CBT, the experimental arm, or the AR arm, which
      serves as the control condition. Both arms are active treatment conditions; however, the
      investigators hypothesize that the Sexual Confidence CBT arm will have a significantly larger
      effect on sexual risk behaviour than the AR arm as AR does not discuss or address substance
      use, sexual risk reduction, or sexual behaviour.

      The investigators propose a conceptual model for the relationship between social anxiety,
      substance use, and sexual risk behaviour. The goal of the model is not to provide a
      comprehensive account of all direct and indirect relationships, but rather to suggest
      particular vulnerabilities for sexual HIV risk. This model purports that the experience of
      social anxiety symptoms in sexual situations generates unwanted anxious affect (e.g., fear of
      sexual rejection, fear of negative evaluation), which individuals are motivated to avoid.
      Heavy alcohol and drug consumption before or during sexual activity is the behavioural
      mechanism in the model in this study for avoiding the anxiety associated with social
      interactions. In this way, using substances to avoid socially anxious thoughts leads to risky
      sexual behaviour both directly and indirectly through impaired safer sex negotiation.

      These mechanisms are consistent with cognitive-behavioural theory. Behaviourally, substance
      use (and potentially risky sexual behaviour) is negatively reinforced through the avoidance
      of (or escape from) unwanted anxious affect. Cognitively, socially anxious predictions
      generate unrealistic risk appraisals of rejection that contribute to sexual risk. Sexual
      Confidence is designed to address these specified pathways: (a) planned exposures to learn
      adaptive strategies for reducing social anxiety, avoidance-motivated substance use, and
      avoidance-motivated sexual risk, (b) cognitive restructuring to train realistic cognitive
      appraisals of rejection for negotiating safer sex, and (c) risk reduction counselling to
      increase safer sex negotiation skills and to specify safer sex behaviour change targets.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants must report engaging in CAS sex without PrEP with a man of HIV-positive
             or unknown HIV status within the last 3 months and report using substances within 2
             hours before and/or during sexual activities. Participants must self-identify as a man
             (including trans* men who self-identify as men), and be aged 18 or older.

        To minimize bias, participants will be asked to report to the research study clinician in
        case they decide to engage in other psychotherapies outside of the study protocol or decide
        to change their psychoactive medication or dose for the duration of their participation in
        the study. Participants who participate in outside psychotherapies or who change their
        medication regimens will still be permitted to conclude the therapy, but their data will
        not be included in the RCT analyses.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  As mentioned previously, participants taking PrEP will be excluded from participating.
             This excludes individuals 1) on daily PrEP dosing, with no more then 3 doses missed
             per week at the time of exposure and 2) on-demand dosing at the time of the exposure,
             including at least one dose before and after exposure. Participants need to score
             within 1 SD of the clinical mean (M = 67.2) for social anxiety disorder on the
             Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale.

          -  Persons will be excluded if our assessors/counsellors find that a participant's
             ability to respond to study measures is compromised by mental or physical disabilities
             or inability to speak and understand English.
