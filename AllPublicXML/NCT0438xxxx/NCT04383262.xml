  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) causes chronic cough, throat clearing, hoarseness, and
      dysphagia and if left untreated can promote the development of laryngeal cancer. More than
      20% of the United Stated population suffer from LPR, yet there is no effective medical
      therapy. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), which inhibit gastric acid production but do not
      prevent reflux events, continue to be prescribed for LPR despite their poor efficacy for this
      patient population, high cost ($26 billion/year), and associated risks. Pepsin, detected in
      the airway of these patients and now known to cause laryngeal inflammation and promote
      disease independent of gastric acid, is a key therapeutic target. We report preclinical
      studies of select HIV inhibitors that bind to and inhibit pepsin and thus hold promise for
      the treatment of LPR. In support, a very low incidence of LPR was found in patients taking
      these drugs compared to the general population. HIV inhibitors are ideal drugs to repurpose
      because they target a foreign virus. Thus, a repurposing approach can be used to safely
      perform proof of concept testing of the efficacy of a pepsin inhibitor for LPR. The Specific
      Aim of this project is to perform a 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      clinical trial to assess the efficacy of fosamprenavir/Lexiva for LPR. Lexiva will be used at
      the FDA approved, manufacturers recommended dose for HIV for 12 weeks in medically refractory
      patients with clinically diagnosed moderate/severe LPR and combined multi-channel
      intraluminal impedance - pH (MII-pH) confirmed laryngeal reflux events. Routine clinical
      outcome measures for LPR (Reflux Symptom Index and Reflux Finding Score) will be documented
      pre- and post-treatment with Lexiva (n = 52) and placebo (n = 52). Saliva will be collected
      pre- and post-treatment for both pepsin protein analysis and kinetic activity assay to
      compare with clinical measures. There is currently no effective medical therapy for LPR and
      pepsin is the key therapeutic target. Identification of an FDA approved drug which inhibits
      pepsin allows for a clinical trial to determine efficacy using a faster and safer repurposing
      approach to address a significant gap.
