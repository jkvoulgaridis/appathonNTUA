      Childhood obesity can adversely affect every organ and often has serious consequences.
      Compare the effect of transection at 2cm vs at 5cm from the pylorus during laparoscopic
      sleeve gastrectomy on the postoperative weight loss, glucagon-like peptide 1 levels and the
      glycemic control in morbid obese diabetic adolescents.

    <textblock>
      This was a retrospective sub-analysis included 18 type 2 diabetic morbidly obese adolescents
      of both genders from a larger study (performed on 67 patients between December 2014 and
      December 2015) conducted at pediatric surgery unit, surgical department, Egypt. They were
      divided in 2 groups, done by 2 surgeons, group A (8 patients) the first stable line was at 2
      cm from the pylorus, and group B (10 patients) at 5 cm from the pylorus.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adolescent, children (more than 12 years or less than 20 years), with BMI of at least
             40 kg/m2, or 35 kg/m2 with an associated co-morbidity (e.g. hypertension, diabetes,
             dyslipidemia, obstructive sleep apnea, left ventricular hypertrophy, nonalcoholic
             steatohepatitis, orthopedic problems). Those with failure to achieve clinically
             significant weight loss (10% of baseline body weight) despite strict participation for
             at least 6 months in a formal weight management program were included in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Adults, children (less than 12 years or more than 20 years) or their family who do not
             understand risks and benefits of the intervention, adolescents who are not
             autonomously motivated to consider operation, those have unrealistic expectations for
             results of the surgical intervention, or their parents, families or patients who
             cannot strictly comply with the postoperative nutritional recommendations and
             long-term medical and nutritional monitoring, presence of a medically correctable
             cause of obesity (relative contraindication), existence of a medical, psychiatric, or
             cognitive condition as attention deficit hyperkinetic disorders (ADHD) which may
             impair the ability of patient to assent to surgery or to adhere to postoperative
             dietary and medication regimen (relative contraindication), illicit substance abuses
             in preceding year, lactating, pregnant, or plans for pregnancy in upcoming 2 years and
             patients refuse to participate were excluded.
