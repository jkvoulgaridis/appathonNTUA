  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will explore the cerebral mechanisms of impaired awareness of hypoglycemia (IAH)
      in type 1 diabetics following exposure to experimental recurrent hypoglycemia (HG). To induce
      IAH, patients with T1D identified to have normal awareness of hypoglycemia (NAH) will undergo
      three 2-hour long hypoglycemic clamps. Neurochemical profiles will be measured by high field
      MRS before and after induction of IAH. Subject glycemic variability and activity/sleep for 1
      week before each study will be monitored as all factors have been shown to alter responses to
      HG.

      The long-term goal of this project is to identify how recurrent hypoglycemia (HG) leads to
      the clinical syndrome of impaired awareness of hypoglycemia (IAH) in type 1 diabetes (T1D).

      This study will test the hypothesis that recurrent HG in T1D leads to an upregulation in
      brain glucose transport and alterations in glutamatergic and GABAergic tone. The
      investigators will use MRS methodology that permits evaluation of cerebral cortex and
      hypothalamus in the same session to simultaneously evaluate the cerebral correlates/mediators
      of impaired awareness and impaired counterregulatory hormone responses (CRR). High MR data
      quality and reproducibility will be ensured by using high field MR scanners and technical
      advances (automated voxel placement, real-time voxel position, frequency, shim updates).
      Continuous glucose monitoring and actigraphy will be used to chronicle glucose variability
      and activity/exercise/sleep in the weeks before each experiment to assess the impact of these
      variables on IAH.

    <time_frame>240 Minutes</time_frame>
    <description>A kinetic model of glucose transport through the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) via reversible symmetric Michaelis-Menten kinetics and irreversible utilization in brain tissue will be utilized. The kinetics of glucose transport into and utilization in the frontal cortex will be quantified using dynamic modeling to extract the Michaelis-Menten constants and the maximal rate for glucose transport and utilization. The ratio of maximal transport rate to cerebral metabolic rate of glucose will be estimated for the hypothalamus by steady-state modeling.</description>
