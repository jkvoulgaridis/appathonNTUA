  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colonoscopy is considered the primary screening test for colorectal cancer screening
      worldwide. For technical difficulties previously experienced during colonoscopy, especially
      loop of the colonoscopy device in the colon, many solution methods have been developed and
      applied (manual pressure and position change, etc.). Although these methods are partially
      successful, there is no consensus on the optimum solution method. Few studies in the
      literature have investigated the use of corset during colonoscopy and conflicting results
      have been reported. In this study, elastic abdominal corset or false corset will be used
      during colonoscopy. Indeed, the investigators aim to determine whether this method is
      effective and safe with their own results and contribute to the literature. The primary
      outcome of this study will be the cecal intubation time. Secondary outcomes include manual
      pressure and position change during the procedure, length of cecal intubation (length of
      colonoscope required to reach the cecum from the anus), colonoscopy completion rate,
      additional anesthesia and / or analgesic requirement, patient pain and comfort level and
      colonoscopic findings.Efficacy will be assessed on the basis of pairwise comparisons between
      groups with respect to primary and secondary outcomes.
