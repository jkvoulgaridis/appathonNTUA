      4 Statistics

      4.1Sample size and calculation basis 18-21 cases of advanced gastric cancer and
      gastroesophageal cancer is planned to be selected.

      Calculation basis: see study design for details.

      4.2 Statistical analysis population Full analysis set (FAS): According to the basic principle
      of intent to analyze (ITT), all subjects who have received at least one trial drug after
      randomization, excluding those without all data.

      Per Protocol Set (PPS): On the basis of FAS set, subjects who met the inclusion and exclusion
      criteria, completed the administration, and completed the evaluation of main efficacy
      indicators, had good compliance and did not seriously violate the clinical trial scheme.

      Safey Set (SS): All subjects who completed adjuvant chemotherapy after randomization. Safety
      data will be analyzed based on the actual treatment received.

      In this experiment, the baseline data and validity analysis were analyzed by FAS. The main
      efficacy indicators were analyzed by PP at the same time, giving priority to FAS. Laboratory
      examination data, adverse events and adverse reactions data were analyzed by SS. The
      incidence of adverse reactions was calculated with SS as denominator.

      5 Test management

      5.1 Management and implementation of GCP

        1. Both the sponsor and the researcher should implement the quality control and quality

      5.2 Supervision system The sponsor will send an inspector to supervise the test together with
      QA Department of clinical research institution to ensure that the test is carried out in
      accordance with the scheme and the data recorded in the case record form is the same as the
      original data. At the same time, the corresponding regulatory agencies may inspect the
      research center, research database and relevant research documents at their own discretion.
      The purpose of the audit and inspection is to systematically and independently inspect all
      research related processes and documents to determine whether the implementation of the
      clinical study complies with the trial protocol, GCP, declaration of Helsinki and relevant
      regulatory requirements. The researcher shall inform the sponsor immediately when he receives
      the inspection notice from the regulatory authority.

      5.3 The problems in the research and the countermeasures

        1. Revision of the scheme: After the scheme is approved by the ethics committee, a plan of
           scheme modification shall be prepared in the case of modification, and signed by the
           main researcher, and the scheme can be modified only with the consent of the sponsor.

        2. The scheme with modification can only be implemented after it is reported to the ethics
           committee, unless it is to solve the security risk faced immediately or only involves
           logistics and administrative modification.

        3. Any personnel participating in the test shall not violate the scheme. In case of any
           violation of the scheme, a description shall be written and the sponsor shall be
           informed, the latter has the right to decide whether to continue the test.

        4. Any AE or SAE occurred during the test will be declared and handled in accordance with
           the requirements specified in the program.

      5.4 Clinical research data management

        1. Researchers must ensure that the data are true, complete and accurate.

        2. All items in the research record shall be filled in, and no blank or missing items are
           allowed. When making any correction, only scribing is allowed, and the modified data
           shall be noted, give reasons and sign and date by the investigator.

        3. Laboratory inspection items should be complete.

        4. This test adopts electronic data acquisition (EDC) system for data management, and the
           name of EDC system is BioKnow-eTMF.

        5. Construction of electronic case report form (eCRF): the data manager builds eCRF
           according to research scheme.

        6. EDC system authority control: The sponsor confirms the EDC account list, fills in the
           account application form and sends it to the data administrator for review, then the
           data administrator hands over to the database designer to open the account and grant
           different roles and authorities to the main researchers, researchers, supervisors and
           auditors to access to EDC.

        7. Data entry: eCRF shall be completed by the principal investigator of each center or its
           authorized research assistant (CRC), CRC needs to input the data in the original record
           form into eCRF timely and accurately. eCRF is not regarded as the original record, and
           its content originates from the original record.

        8. Logical verification: At the same time of data entry, EDC performs logical verification
           and issues system query. In addition to the system query, the data administrator
           manually checks the text data and issues the artificial query if there is a problem.

        9. Question and answer: Researchers can answer questions real-time online. The data
           administrator and the supervisor review the researcher's answers and, if necessary,
           raise questions again until all questions are resolved.

       10. Data lock and export: All patients complete the test and all the original data are input
           into EDC system. The main researchers, sponsors, statistical analysts and data
           administrators conduct blind review on data. After confirming that there is no doubt
           about the data, all parties shall sign the database locking application form, and the
           data administrator shall lock the database. After locking, the data administrator will
           export the analysis database to the statistician for statistical analysis. The locked
           data can no longer be edited. The non key data problems found after the locking can be
           corrected in the statistical analysis program and the file records can be prepared after
           confirmation. If there is exact evidence proving that it is necessary to unlock the
           database, it shall be approved by the sponsor.

      5.5 Data record and document retention The data of the subjects on the electronic case report
      form shall be recorded in code form, and the subjects can only be identified by the number of
      the subjects or their initials.

      All information required by the test scheme must be provided, any omission needs to be
      justified.

      The researcher must keep the original documents of each subject participating in the trial.
      All information on the electronic case report form must come from these original
      documents，which should contain all demographic and treatment information, including
      laboratory test data, ECG, etc., as well as the signed informed consent with test number and
      subject.

      Basic documents must be retained by researchers for the time required by national or
      international regulations (usually 5 years after the end of clinical study or the final
      approval of marketing). The sponsor shall inform the research institution of the time when
      relevant test records are no longer needed.

If DLT occurs in one of the first three subjects in each dose group within four weeks after cell infusion, three subjects will continue to be included. If more than 1/6 cases of DLT appear in 6 subjects with 1.5*10＾9 dose, the dose level and/or cell infusion frequency and method will be reduced after discussion between the investigator, the collaborator and DMC. If DLT did not occur in the first 3 subjects within 4 weeks after receiving 1.5*10＾9 cell infusion，another three subjects were enrolled into the group received 2*10＾9 cell infusion. DLT did not occur within 4 weeks after cell infusion, it will increase to 3*10＾9 dose group. That is to say, the first three subjects were included for observation for 4 weeks in the 3*10＾9 dose group, if DLT did not occur, there will be another 3 cases, reaching to 6 subjects.</description>
