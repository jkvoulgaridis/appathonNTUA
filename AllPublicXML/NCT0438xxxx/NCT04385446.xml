  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To identify and compare the differences in the concentration of the Muc2 and Muc5AC mucins in
      tear film in patients who underwent pterygium surgery using amniotic membrane transplantation
      and conjunctival autograft surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with nasal, primary pterygium bigger than 1 mm of corneal invasion with residence in
      Mexico City and older than 18 years were included. Under informed consent, patients were
      divided into two groups in a random fashion. Pterygium surgery was carried out with
      conventional technique performing amniotic membrane transplantation for group A, and
      conjunctival autograft for group B. Muc2 and muc5ac mucin concentration was measure min tear
      film by ELISA; samples were taken before surgery, at first, third and sixth month
      postoperatively. BUT was also measured on the same dates. Descriptive statistics and the
      U-Mann Whitney test for independent groups, considering a p≤0.05 as significant were used for
      analysis.

    <description>Using a capillary tube, tear film was collected en every patient. Then Concentration of mucin MUC5ac were measured by Elisa technique using a quantitative scale.</description>
