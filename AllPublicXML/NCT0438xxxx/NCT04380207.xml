  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      QPX7728 is an ultra-broad-spectrum beta-lactamase inhibitor, with activity against numerous
      beta-lactamases, including class A extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), class C
      cephalosporinases, and extended spectrum class D oxacillinases (OXA) that can hydrolyze
      cephalosporins and can be found in Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P.
      aeruginosa). QPX7728 is also a potent inhibitor of carbapenemases from all molecular classes,
      such as class A Klebsiella pheumoniae carbapenemase (KPC), class B New-Dehli
      Metalo-beta-lactamase (NDM) and Verona integron-encoded metallo-beta-lactamase (VIM), and
      class D OXA-48 that are found in carbapenem resistant Enterobacteriaceae, and also class D
      carbapenemases such as OXA-23 that are found in carbapenem resistant Acinetobacter baumannii.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has listed carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae and
      Acinetobacter as urgent threats and multidrug resistant Pseudomonas, and extended spectrum
      beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae as serious threats [CDC, 2019]. Consistent
      with the global nature of these resistant bacteria, the World Health Organization (WHO) has
      designated carbapenem-resistant, ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, carbapenem-resistant
      Acinetobacter baumannii, and carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa as pathogens for
      which new agents are critically needed [WHO, 2017].

      Qpex Biopharma is developing a fixed combination antibiotic of QPX2014 plus an ultra-broad
      spectrum beta-lactamase inhibitor, QPX7728.

         15. Liver function abnormalities defined by an elevation in bilirubin, Aspartate
