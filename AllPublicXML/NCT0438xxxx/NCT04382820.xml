  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Families of children with rare diseases (i.e., not more than 5 out of 10.000 people are
      affected) are often highly burdened with fears, insecurities and concerns regarding the
      affected child and his/her siblings. The aim of the present research project is to examine
      the psychosocial burden of the children with rare (congenital) pediatric surgical diseases
      and their family in order to draw attention to a possible psychosocial care gap in this
      population.

      The central objective of the cross-sectional study is to show the psychosocial supply gap for
      families with children and adolescents affected by rare diseases in the field of pediatric
      surgery. Among the rare diseases that are included are diaphragmatic hernia, anorectal
      malformations, esophageal atresia, Hirschsprung's disease and biliary atresia. In order to
      have a comparative sample, additional data of a matched control group are collected. Central
      standardized psychosocial outcomes will be assessed from the perspectives of the parents, the
      affected child and the siblings.
