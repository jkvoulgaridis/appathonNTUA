  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The world population has been growing and aging dramatically, with a rising prevalence of
      dementia. Worldwide, around 50 million people have dementia, with 10 million new cases added
      every year. Despite the epidemic scale of dementia, until now no cure or disease-modifying
      therapy has been identified. Therefore, the World Health Organization (WHO) has recognized
      dementia as a public health priority. Several large studies have demonstrated that hearing
      impairment is associated with a greater risk of cognitive impairment. Hearing rehabilitation
      could potentially provide a disease-modifying therapy to delay cognitive decline. Although
      auditory behavioral research has not yet revealed a reliable indicator of early cognitive
      impairment, cortical-evoked auditory potentials (CAEP) have shown promising evidence as a
      non-invasive way to identify early-stage cognitive impairment.

      The peripheral vestibular apparatus is located in the inner ear and codes rotation and
      translation of the head to preserve a stable view. Increasing evidence suggests that
      bilateral vestibular function loss, also known as bilateral vestibulopathy (BVP), leads to
      hippocampal atrophy and reduced spatial cognitive skills, as well as structural and
      functional alterations in parieto-insular and parieto-temporal regions. Many studies have
      demonstrated that vestibular function declines with age. Vestibular dysfunction can be linked
      to reduced topographical orientation and memory and has been suggested as a risk factor to
      AD, due to increased risk of falling and deficits in activities of daily life (ADL).

      Our first aim is to study the effect of SNHL and vestibular decline on CAEP, spatial and
      non-spatial cognitive functioning and trajectories in cognitively healthy older subjects, as
      well as patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. Our second aim is to study if
      MRI brain volume changes can be observed in the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and auditory
      and vestibular key regions in these populations and correlate with CAEP and cognitive
      functioning.

      The expected outcome is important to society because it will provide data from a cognitive
      assessment protocol adapted for a potentially hearing-impaired population, objective outcome
      measures (incl. CAEP and MRI brain volume changes) to identify older subjects with SNHL and
      BVP at risk for cognitive decline, and will support screening and interventional studies to
      assess the impact of rehabilitation on slowing down cognitive decline.
