  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single centre, open-label, non-randomised study to assess the mass balance
      recovery, absorption, metabolism, and excretion of a single oral dose of [14C]-orvepitant in
      healthy male subjects. It is planned to enrol 6 subjects. Each subject will receive a single
      dose of 30 mg [14C] orvepitant containing not more than (NMT) 3.7 megabecquerel (MBq) [14C],
      administered as an oral solution in the fasted state. Subjects will be admitted in the
      evening on the day prior to [14C]-orvepitant administration and will be dosed in the morning
      following an overnight fast. It is planned that subjects will remain resident in the clinical
      unit until 168 hours post-dose (Day 8) when they will be discharged from the clinical unit.
      Through the resident period samples (blood, urine, faeces) will be collected and analysed for
      mass balance, total radioactivity, orvepitant levels. Metabolite profiling and ID will also
      be performed.
