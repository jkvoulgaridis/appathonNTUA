  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic tonsillar hypertrophy is one of the most common causes of upper airway obstruction in
      children. Currently, several clinical staging systems are used to evaluate airway obstruction
      due to tonsillar hypertrophy. However, as these staging systems are based on a physical
      examination, it is not always possible to accurately evaluate the tonsil size, especially in
      children, and so objective and reliable methods are required in this field. In this study,
      the investigators aimed to develop a new method for the objective evaluation of airway
      obstruction due to tonsillar hypertrophy using submental ultrasonography (US) in children.

    <textblock>
      Tonsillectomy is one of the most frequently performed operations in childhood, and one of the
      most important indications of this surgery is chronic tonsillar hypertrophy. Chronic
      tonsillar hypertrophy accounts for 80% of cases with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS)
      in childhood, and growth and development delay, low academic performance, facial
      developmental abnormalities, and cardiopulmonary diseases may emerge as a result. For this
      reason, an accurate evaluation of tonsil size is crucial both during clinical follow-up and
      in tonsillectomy decisions.

      Currently, several clinical staging systems are used to evaluate tonsil size in children,
      with the &quot;Brodsky&quot; and &quot;Friedman&quot; scales being the most commonly used systems. These staging
      systems make use of a physical examination, with tonsil hypertrophies generally classified
      into 4 stages based on the extension of the tonsil from the anterior plica to the midline.
      Stages 3 and 4 tonsil hypertrophy are generally accepted as obstructive, and a tonsillectomy
      decision is made when clinical complaints support this. For such an evaluation of tonsil
      grade, the child should be cooperative, should easily open his/her mouth, and should not gag.
      In the event of the patient's non-compliance, the size of the tongue and tongue base, the
      hyperactive gag reflex, and trismus may challenge this evaluation. The gag reflex during the
      examination causes the tonsils to move towards the midline, making the tonsils seem bigger
      than the real size. An obstruction at the hypopharyngeal level due to hypertrophic tonsils
      may be missed due to poor visualization of the inferior pole of the tonsil in patients with a
      large tongue. For these reasons, a correct clinical evaluation of the tonsil size may not
      always be possible through a physical examination. Thus objective and reliable methods are
      required for the classification of tonsillar hypertrophy.

      There have been no studies to date investigating the use of ultrasonography (US) in the
      evaluation of airway obstruction due to tonsillar hypertrophy, despite the advantages of high
      patient compliance, low cost, and no radiation exposure. The present study suggests a new
      method for the evaluation of airway obstruction due to tonsillar hypertrophy using the
      submental US in children.

    <time_frame>20 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>After the neck of the participant will be brought to extension, the ultrasound probe will be placed on the submental region, and both tonsils will be visualized in the midline in the transverse plane. The narrowest airway space will be marked between the two tonsils and the intertonsillar distance (ITD) will be measured. Subsequently, in the same region, the attachments of the palatoglossal muscles to the tongue base, as the projection of the anterior plicae, will be determined, and the widest transverse length of the tongue base (TLTB) at this level will be measured. The ratio of ITD to TLTB will be calculated for each participant.</description>

    <description>An oropharynx examination of all participants will be performed and tonsil size will be evaluated according to the Brodsky staging system. According to this staging system, tonsil sizes will be classified as stage I when the tonsils fill less than 25% of the transverse oropharyngeal space measured between the anterior tonsillar pillars; stage II when they fill between 25% and 50%, stage III when they fill between 50% and 75%, and stage IV when they fill more than 75%.</description>

    <description>The submental ultrasonography will be performed on all participants. Ultrasonographic examinations will be performed blinded to the physical examination results. All measurements will be performed by the same radiologist with experience in the field of ultrasonography. A GE LOGIQ E9 (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI, USA) device will be used in the ultrasonography examination. The participants will be viewed using a 2-9 MHz linear probe from the submental region. The examination will be performed while the patient was lying in a supine position with a support placed under the neck.</description>
