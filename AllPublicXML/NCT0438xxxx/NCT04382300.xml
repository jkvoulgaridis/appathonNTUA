  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Various driver gene mutations have been identified in lung cancer. Among them, human
      epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) was identified in about approximately 2% of non-small cell
      lung cancers. Pyrotinib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting both HER-1 and HER-2
      receptors. This is a prospective single-arm, open-label phase II study, designed to evaluate
      the efficacy and safety of Pyrotinib combined with thalidomide in patients with pre-treated
      HER2 positive advanced Non-small cell lung cancer.
