      The diagnostic cohort study could will be use to verify the clinical performance of the AQP4
      -immunoglobulin G detection kit and whether it has a good correlation with the clinical
      diagnosis results. The applicability and accuracy of the kit in clinical diagnosis will be
      verified according to the measured data.
