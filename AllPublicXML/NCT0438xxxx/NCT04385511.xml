  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study assumed that supraglottic jet ventilation is an alternative solution as a safe way
      to do the preoxygenation before endotracheal intubation by contrasting it with mask
      pressurized ventilation. The investigators also expected that supraglottic jet ventilation
      won't increase the occurrence of esophageal reflux.

      The study assumed that supraglottic jet ventilation is an alternative solution as a safe way
      to do the preoxygenation before endotracheal intubation by contrasting it with mask
      pressurized ventilation. The investigators also expected that supraglottic jet ventilation
      won't increase the occurrence of esophageal reflux.

      The investigators randomly divided the patients into 2 groups:Group C and Group S.Patients in
      Group C will be preoxygenation with mask pressurized ventilation while patients in Group S
      with supraglottic jet ventilation by Wei NASAL JET（WNJ）.The tracheal intubation will be done
      after the 3 minutes preoxygenation. The investigators will measure the PaCO2 before and after
      preoxygenation, and the investigators will take the stomach-ultrasonography to find if there
      are too much gas in the gastro. If pulse oximetry is lower than 95% during the
      preoxygenation, the investigators will adjust the position of the Wei NASAL JET（WNJ) or use
      the change the way that the investigators hold the mask or change the pressure of ventilation
      on the basis of the group.

    <description>patients who were randomized into supraglottic jet ventilation group would be placed Wei Nasal Jet Tube after conducted. Then they will get the supraglottic jet ventilation to make sure their pulse oximetry is over 95%. After 3 minutes, endotracheal intubation was performed via mouth approach.</description>
