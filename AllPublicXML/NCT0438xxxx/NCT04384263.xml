  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High blood pressure and poor cognitive function are two common health problems among older
      adults in the United States. They are also closely related because high blood pressure may
      lead to negative changes in brain structure and function such as poor brain blood flow that
      can cause poor cognitive function. Executive function is one type of cognitive function that
      let people plan and perform difficult tasks. It is commonly damaged by high blood pressure.
      It is also very important for older adults because they need good executive function to live
      on their own. Tai Chi is a good exercise option for older adults because it is safe, fun, and
      social. Research studies show that Tai Chi can reduce blood pressure and improve cognitive
      function, especially executive function. However, researchers do know if these heart and
      brain health benefits of Tai Chi are connected.

      In the ACTION study, researchers will first measure how a single session of Tai Chi followed
      by a 12-week Tai Chi program with easy movements changes blood pressure and cognitive
      function, focusing on executive function. Then, researchers will test if these changes in
      heart and brain health are connected, and if they are connected through the changes in brain
      structure and function. Both the single session and 12-week Tai Chi program will be practiced
      by a group of older adults with high blood pressure and normal cognitive function. They will
      be new to Tai Chi and not exercising regularly.

      The hypotheses of the ACTION study are that practicing Tai Chi is good for the heart and
      brain of older adults with high blood pressure. Specifically, relaxing Tai Chi with gentle
      movements will reduce blood pressure, and thereby improve cognitive function, particularly
      executive function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension is a major cardiovascular disease risk factor affecting &gt;70% older adults in the
      United States. It is also a major contributor to cognitive impairment and dementia that
      affect over 8 million US older adults. Hypertension can cause deteriorations in brain
      structure and function such as reduced cerebral blood flow, leading to various types of
      cognitive dysfunction with declines in executive function being the most common. Of note,
      executive function is a strong predictor of older adults' ability to live independently in
      the community. Meta-analyses showed that Tai Chi reduces blood pressure (BP) by 12-15 mmHg
      for systolic BP and 4-6 mmHg for diastolic BP, and improves cognitive function with an effect
      size of 0.5 for global cognitive function and 0.9 for executive function. Surprisingly, no
      study has investigated the relationship between the heart and brain health benefits of Tai
      Chi among older adults with hypertension.

      The primary purposes and hypotheses are presented below. Of note, investigators will define
      the changes of BP, cognitive function focusing on executive function, and brain structure and
      functions in response to the 12-week Tai Chi intervention as the chronic change (see primary
      outcomes 1 to 9).

        1. To examine the relationship between the BP and cognitive function, focusing on executive
           function, response to a 12-wk Tai Chi intervention. Investigators hypothesize that the
           BP and cognitive function, focusing on executive function, response to a 12-wk Tai Chi
           intervention will be positively correlated.

        2. To examine changes in measures of brain structure and functions in response to a 12-wk
           Tai Chi intervention, and explore their associations with the BP and cognitive function,
           focusing on executive function, responses to Tai Chi. Investigators hypothesize that the
           relationship between the BP and cognitive function, focusing on executive function,
           responses to the 12-wk Tai Chi intervention is mediated by the changes in brain
           structure and function.

      The secondary purposes are to examine the relationship between the BP and cognitive function,
      focusing on executive function, response to a single session of Tai Chi exercise.
      Investigators hypothesize that the BP and cognitive function, focusing on executive function,
      response to a single session of Tai Chi exercise will be positively correlated. Of note,
      investigators will define the changes of BP, cognitive function focusing on executive
      function in response to a single session of Tai Chi exercise as the acute change (see
      secondary outcomes 1 to 5).

      The participants will be randomized to either a Tai Chi (n=10) or control group (n=10).
      Participants will attend Visit 1 at a local senior center that is adjacent to the University
      of Connecticut (UConn), Storrs, CT. They will sign the informed consent, and eligibility
      screening part 1. Participants will attend Visits 1 and 2 to complete eligibility screening.
      Participants will attend Visit 3 and 4 in randomized order. These two visits will include: 1)
      the Acute Exercise Visit 1 during which participants will attend a 45-minute Tai Chi exercise
      session at the local senior center; and 2) the Control and Magnetic Resonance Imaging [MRI]
      Visit 1 at the Brain Imaging Research Center [BIRC] at UConn Storrs during which participants
      will attend a 45-minute sham control session (i.e., watching Tai Chi themed video). A
      trained, blinded research assistant will: 1) measure resting BP and cognitive function before
      and after the 45-minute Tai Chi session in the Acute Exercise Visit 1 and the 45-minute sham
      control session in the Control and MRI Visit 1; and 2) attach participants to a 24-hour
      ambulatory BP (ABP) monitor at the end of both the Acute Exercise Visit 1 and the Control and
      MRI Visit 1 that will be worn to the next morning. In addition, participants will participate
      in an 60-minute MRI scanning session at BIRC in the Control and MRI Visit 1. The 12-week Tai
      Chi intervention will start after Visit 4, participants assigned to the Tai Chi group will
      attend supervised Tai Chi sessions led by a certified Tai Chi instructor for 3 sessions/week,
      50 minutes/session for 12 weeks. The participants will also practice Tai Chi at home between
      sessions using print out material that will be given to them at the end of each supervised
      Tai Chi session. Meanwhile, participants in the control group will perform only their regular
      habitual daily activities throughout the 12-week study. After the 12-week intervention
      period, participants will attend Visit 5 (Control and MRI Visit 2) at the local senior center
      with procedures identical to those conducted in Visit 3 or 4 (Control and MRI Visit 1).
      Participants will attend Visit 6 (Acute Exercise Visit 2) at the local senior center with
      procedures identical to those conducted in Visit 3 or 4 (Acute Exercise Visit 1).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

          -  All participants will have established hypertension evidenced by awake ambulatory
             systolic blood pressure (ASBP)≥130 mmHg or awake ambulatory diastolic blood pressure
             (ADBP)≥80 or taking antihypertensive medication regardless of the awake ASBP and awake
             ADBP values. In addition, participants will have blood pressure (BP) within the safe
             range to exercise evidenced by awake ASBP&lt;145 mmHg and awake ADBP&lt;90 regardless of the
             use of BP medications.

          -  For women only, participants need to be postmenopausal evidenced by having experienced
             &gt;6 consecutive months without menstruation. This is because menstruation could
             potentially influence BP.

          -  Participants will be free of Tai Chi practice in the past 12 months

          -  Participants will, at least, have graduated from high school or have obtained GED.

          -  Participants will have intact cognitive function evidenced by scoring 25 or higher on
             the Mini Mental State Examination.

          -  Participants will be physically inactive as did not exercise for 30 min or more per
             day at moderate intensity on 3 or more days per week in the past 12 weeks. Subjects
             will not have physically demanding occupations.

          -  Participants will consume &lt;2 alcoholic drinks daily because the effects of alcohol may
             obscure the BP response to exercise.

          -  Participants will be non-smokers for at least 6 months prior to entry because the
             effects of tobacco may obscure the BP response to exercise.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Participants will have no contradictions to fully participate in ACTION. They will be
             excluded if they have: 1) signs or symptoms suggestive of cardiovascular, renal, and
             metabolic disease; 2) psychiatric and neurological disorders such as general anxiety
             and depression; 3) body mass index &lt;18.5 kg.m^-2 or &gt;35 Kg·m^-2) orthopedic problems
             likely to restrict Tai Chi exercise in standing position; 5) contradictions to MRI
             scans to the brain.

          -  If the participants has been diagnosed with chronic diseases that require medical
             clearance to exercise that include cardiovascular, renal, and metabolic disease, the
             PI and the study medical director will review the participants's medical history and
             determine if it is safe for him or her to participate in ACTION. If determined unsafe
             to exercise, the participant will be excluded.

          -  For participants who have been diagnosed with cancer, only those who have had cancer
             under remission for 6 months or longer will be considered for inclusion. Otherwise,
             the participant will be excluded.

          -  Cancer survivors will be excluded if they: 1) had lung, abdominal surgery, or ostomy
             within the past 6 months; 2) are currently experiencing ataxia, extreme fatigue,
             severe nutritional deficiencies, worsening/changing physical condition (i.e.,
             lymphedema exacerbation), bone metastases. For other cancer survivors, the PI and the
             study medical director will review the participant's medical history and determine if
             it is safe for him or her to participate in ACTION. If determined unsafe to exercise,
             the participant will be excluded.

          -  Subjects who have extensive experience with Tai Chi, defined as have practiced Tai Chi
             for ≥2 sessions/week for ≥3 months continuously, will be excluded.

          -  Participants who have physically demanding occupations will be excluded.

          -  Participants acknowledging illicit drug use within the past 5 years will not be
             recruited.

          -  Participants taking any medications, except for corticosteroids and hypnotics, should:
             1) have been taking the medications for ≥3 months prior to entry; and 2) maintain
             their routine of taking the medications throughout the study when possible. Otherwise,
             the participant will be excluded.

          -  Participants who take corticosteroids and hypnotics as needed will not be recruited
             because these medications could potentially influence BP and brain blood flow and
             function.

          -  Participants taking any nutritional supplements other than a 1-a-day vitamin, cold
             medications, and herbal supplements would be asked to discontinue these medications
             before entering the study or be excluded.

          -  Changes in diet and weight have the potential to obscure and/or augment the influence
             of our Tai Chi intervention on BP. Participants will be excluded if they are seeking
             to gain or lose weight or had a weight change of &gt;5 lb in the past 3 months.
             Investigators will also not recruit subjects unwilling to maintain their habitual diet
             throughout study participation.
