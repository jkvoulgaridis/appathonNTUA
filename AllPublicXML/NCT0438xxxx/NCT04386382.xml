  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A clinical trial was conducted to evaluate the accuracy of dental implant placement in narrow
      ridges after ridge splitting flapless technique using an interchangeable guide.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A sample was selected conveniently to fulfill a list of inclusion and exclusion criteria.
      Then the selected participants underwent ridge splitting with the aid of interchangeable
      guide. After ridge splitting, all patients had simultaneous implant placement followed by
      clinical and radiographical evaluation over a period of 6 months.

    <description>An informed consent is taken from all the patients
I. Presurgical phase:
Proper dental and medical history.
Scaling and oral hygiene measurements.
Clinical examination.
Radiographic examination. Clinical bucco-lingual measurements was done using calipers to ensure the patients would meet our initial inclusion criteria prior to further investigations.
III. Fabrication of interchangeable surgical guide stent from primary impression:
Optical scanning of the dental casts was done using Ceramill map 400
surgical stent was designed using Mimics Innovation Suite 19 ™ software.
Series of creating and designing special 3D virtual guide slits and boxes that can accommodate and precisely fit the tools used for the ridge splitting technique.
All patients will be operated under local anesthesia, stent was placed on ridge and adapted well after disinfection osteotomy was done using piezotome splitting tips Implant-insertion was started immediately</description>
