  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of DCV plus sofosbuvir (SOF) with or
      without ribavirin (RBV) for treatment of Egyptian participants infected with HCV GT4.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Egyptian participants infected with HCV GT4 were classified into two groups: group 1 (easy to
      treat) was treated with a dual therapy of SOF/DCV daily for 12 weeks and group 2 (difficult
      to treat) was treated with a triple therapy of SOF/DCV/RBV daily for 12 weeks.

      SOF dose was 400 mg/day given orally DCV was given in a dose of 60 mg/day, orally. RBV was
      given as oral tablets in the morning and in the evening based on patient's weight and
      tolerability (starting dose 600 mg/day to reach 1200 mg/day.
