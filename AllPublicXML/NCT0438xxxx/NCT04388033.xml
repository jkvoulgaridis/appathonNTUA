      A multi-center, open-label, single-arm, phase I/II clinical study is designed to test the
      safety and immunogenicity of an investigational Dendritic and Glioma Cells Fusion vaccine
      given with IL-12 for treatment-naïve patients after resection of glioblastoma.

    <textblock>
      This clinical trail includes two phases: basic treatment phase and immunotherapy phase. In
      basic treatment phase, patients will receive concomitant radiation and TMZ-chemotherapy. In
      immunotherapy phase, besides maintenance chemotherapy with TMZ, Fusion cells will be
      administered with IL-12 to enhance the immunity of patients.

    <description>Basic treatment phase:
The patients have surgery followed by concomitant radiation (2 Gy/day x 30 days) and TMZ-chemotherapy (75 mg/m2/ day x 42 days).
Immunotherapy phase:
Maintenance chemotherapy with TMZ will be administered at 150-200 mg/m2/day for 5 days in each 28-day cycle. Fusion cells will be suspended in 0.5 mL normal saline and then injected intradermally close to a cervical lymph node. IL-12 will be injected subcutaneously at the same side at dose of 6ug twice for interval of one hour.</description>
