    <textblock>
      The objective of the present study is to evaluate the effectiveness of daily consumption of a
      Combination of Plant Extracts (BSL_EP027) on the incidence of respiratory infection symptoms
      and their duration in older healthy volunteers living in a nursing home.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prevalence of deficient immune state is estimated at 44% of the world's population, a
      figure that rises in the senior population group.

      Traditionally, protection against infection and improvement of the immune response has been
      addressed through the use of plant extracts. An effective immune response involves the action
      of both innate and specific responses and the perfect coordination between both. Natural
      strategies that can activate both types of immune response can lead to more effective
      treatments.

      Our hypothesis is that the different effects of the combination of several plant extracts can
      lead to a synergy that generates a more effective product in the prevention of respiratory
      infections, especially in susceptible populations such as the elderly.
