      This study explores the physiological and metabolic demands of passive ergometry as a step in
      active rehabilitation and compares two methods of monitoring these changes in critically ill
      patients.

    <time_frame>Minute by minute haemodynamic and metabolic measurements were taken over the 60 minute data collection period. Paired venous and arterial blood gas samples were taken every 10 minutes over the 60 minute data collection period.</time_frame>
    <description>Oxygen uptake (VO2) was calculated by two methods.
Method one calculated VO2 with the value of CO from the LiDCO™ using the modified technique of the Fick equation using paired central mixed venous and arterial blood gas samples: VO2 mL/min = CO x (CaO2 - CvO2) x10.
Method two calculated VO2 by the E-COVX metabolic module via the ventilator from the value of fraction of inspired O2 (FiO2), expiratory minute volume (MV), expired concentrations of O2 (FeO2) and CO2 (FeCO2) using the equation: VO2 ml/min= MV (FiO2 -FeO2 - FiO2 (FeCO2))/1-FiO2.</description>
