  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subject/Participant Groups:

      Study Group: Subjects undergo internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling during vitrectomy for
      the indication of tractional retinal detachment Control Group: Subjects do not undergo ILM
      peeling during vitrectomy for the indication of tractional retinal detachment
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>

      Hypothesis:

      Subjects undergoing ILM peeling during vitrectomy will have lower central macular thickness
      on OCT and lower rates of DME, fewer postoperative epiretinal membranes, and thereby better
      final visual acuity to control subjects Randomization: Subjects will be randomized according
      to a coin toss during PPV, once Grade 2 or Grade 3 vitreoretinal adhesion has been
      determined: heads undergo ILM peeling, while tails do not.

      Number of Subjects: With study power of 80%, a significance level of 0.05, a sample size of
      60 patients for each group was calculated.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion:

          1. Subject age is 18-85 years.

          2. Subject consents to study participation and is capable of 6 months of follow-up.

          3. The subject has type I or II Diabetes Mellitus with active PDR in the study eye.

          4. Best-corrected spectacle visual acuity (BCSVA) on the Snellen eye chart ranges from
             20/40 to hand motions in the study eye.

          5. The subject is determined to need a PPV for the indication of TRD (Grades 2 and 3).

        Exclusion:

          1. Subject is known to have a significant retinal/optic nerve disease otherwise unrelated
             to Diabetes Mellitus, which in the opinion of the examiner is responsible for two or
             more lines of reduced BCSVA (macular degeneration, optic neuritis, glaucoma,
             amblyopia, etc.) in the study eye.

          2. Subject is known to have macular ischemia, which in the opinion of the examiner, is
             responsible for two or more lines of reduced BCSVA in the study eye.

          3. Subject has a significant corneal or cataract opacity, which in the opinion of the
             examiner, is responsible for two or more lines of reduced BCSVA (corneal scar,
             ectasia, etc.) in the study eye.

          4. Subject has had a previous vitrectomy (anterior or PPV) in the study eye.

          5. Subject has uncontrolled neovascular glaucoma (intraocular pressure &gt; 30 mmHg despite
             medical/surgical treatment) in the study eye.

          6. Subject has uncontrolled hypertension (systolic &gt; 200 mmHg or diastolic &gt; 120 mmHg)
             despite adherence to a multiple anti-hypertensive medication regimen.
