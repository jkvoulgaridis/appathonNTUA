  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomized study comparing a monitored ketogenic diet intervention
      using standard ketogenic diet (SKD) and standard of care (SOC) dietary recommendations for 16
      weeks. Subjects enrolled in the standard of care group will receive a voucher to Weight
      Watchers after study completion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim is to assess the safety of ketogenic diet as compared to standard of care
      approach for weight loss in patients with compensated cirrhosis due to NASH. The safety
      endpoints captured in the study include liver decompensation events, measured through several
      questionnaires, fasting blood glucose, serum creatinine, fasting lipid profile and other
      adverse events. The tolerability of the ketogenic diet will be assessed by study compliance
      and by administering a questionnaire.

      Secondary aims include weight loss, changes in body composition via serial use of
      bioelectrical impedance via an Inbody Machine, changes in liver fat and liver stiffness using
      MRI and proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF), liver biochemistries, changes in
      Child-Turcotte-Pugh and MELD scores measured via labs and changes in liver steatosis and
      stiffness via serial measures of VCTE by FibroScan®.

    <description>MRI-PDFF is a convenient method for liver fat quantification and currently used in most clinical trials, as it only requires a single 20-second breath hold and an estimated time of about 5 minutes in an MRI scanner suite. MRI in the study will be used to quantify liver steatosis, stiffness, and body composition.</description>

    <description>For participants randomized to the ketogenic diet arm, a consultation with the providers of medically supervised weight loss clinic of Indiana University Health will be arranged. Subjects will be educated on the concepts of ketosis, symptoms associated with it, and dietary manipulation to achieve ketosis. Participants in this arm will use the suggested recipes in combination with strict carbohydrate monitoring though checking for urine ketone bodies. These recipes were gathered and vetted by the dietitian at the medically supervised weight loss clinic. We anticipate that this approach will allow for more calorie intake and easier carbohydrate restriction. The follow up visits will be determined by the providers of the medically supervised weight loss clinic based on the symptoms reported and subject's compliance with carbohydrate restriction.</description>
