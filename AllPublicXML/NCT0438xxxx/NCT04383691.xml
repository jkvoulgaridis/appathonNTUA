    <textblock>
      The study evaluates the efficacy and safety of lurasidone compared with placebo in treating
      Bipolar I Depression.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to compare the efficacy of lurasidone (20-120 mg/day) monotherapy
      with that of placebo in patients with Bipolar I Depression by assessing the change from
      baseline in the MADRS total score at Week 6.

    <description>Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)is a clinician-rated assessment of a subject's level of depression. The MADRS total score ranges from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 60. For the MADRS total score, low scores indicate a better outcome and high scores indicate a worse outcome. When change from baseline is considered, a negative (decrease in score) value is considered a better outcome, and a positive (increase in score) value is considered a worse outcome. The MADRS contains ten (10) items. The total score is computed as the sum of the scores for the 10 items.</description>
