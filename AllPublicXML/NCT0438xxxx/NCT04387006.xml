  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteopathic Manipulative Treatment (OMT) is a whole-body intervention mainly focused on
      correcting the somatic dysfunctions present in different regions of the body. Osteopathic
      research to date has mostly been concerned with various clinical conditions such as
      musculoskeletal disorders and primary headache. The neurophysiological effects underlying
      clinical improvements are still under debate. Although models explaining the therapeutic
      effects of OMT include the potential for higher brain mechanism, OMT effects on functional
      brain connectivity is not fully understood and still lacking in healthy adults. Magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) research includes several different approaches to estimate cortical
      functions. Several of these approaches have demonstrated functional brain changes associated
      with OMT. Using Arterial Spin Labeling MRI, recently was demonstrated that the treatment of
      somatic dysfunctions induces cerebral perfusion changes in asymptomatic young participant.
      Thus, the aim of this study is to explore the neural correlates associated with OMT effect in
      terms of cerebral functional connectivity, as derived by complex network analysis of resting
      state fMRI data recorded in asymptomatic young volunteers with somatic dysfunctions

    <description>Changes in correlation of brain activity in different regions of brain as assessed by Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) signal.
fMRI data are collected using gradient-echo echo-planar imaging at 3T (Philips Achieva) using a (T2*)-weighted imaging sequence sensitive to BOLD (TR = 3 s, TE = 30 ms, matrix = 80 x 80, FOV=224x224, slice thickness = 3 mm, flip angle = 90°, 50 slices, 240 vol).</description>

    <measure>De-Blinding questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>immediately after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The questionnaire consists of three consecutive questions about subjects' perception of the treatment received. After being questioned on whether according to their perception, they thought they have received OMT or MP treatment, subjects were asked on a 0-10 numeric rating scale (NRS), where 0 represented absolutely uncertainty and 10 represented absolutely certainty, how certain they were regarding group allocation. Finally, they were asked to rate the perceived usefulness of the treatment received, based on a 0-10 NRS, where 0 represented absolutely useless and 10 represented absolutely useful</description>

    <description>MP treatment was performed by the same osteopaths who performed OMT and was carried out in the same hospital setting. P treatment consisted of a passive touch without joint mobilization in a protocolled order. The osteopaths were standing next to the bed, they touched lumbar and dorsal spine of the subjects in prone position for 10 minutes, and then in supine position, they touched for 10 minutes the shoulders, the hips, then the neck, the sternum and the chest were touched for 5 minutes each. Another researcher on the placebo protocol specifically trained the osteopaths.</description>
