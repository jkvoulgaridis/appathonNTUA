      PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of the vitreous in response to intravitreal (IV) injections
      of ranibizumab 0.5 mg/0.05ml (Lucentis; Genentech, South San Francisco, CA) for the treatment
      of diabetic macular edema (DME).

      METHODS: Prospective, observational, multicenter study, conducted at Centro Hospitalar e
      Universitário do Porto, Portugal. Best-corrected visual acuity and central foveal thickness
      will be evaluated at baseline and every month until the end of follow-up. OCT biomarkers such
      as retinal layers thickness will also be analyzed.

      A p value of 0.05 or less will be considered to be statistically significant. HYPOTHESIS:
      Vitrectomized patients will improve less than non-vitrectomized patients.

      Patients will be included in two different groups according to the vitreous status: group 1 -
      non vitrectomized eyes; group 2 - vitrectomized eyes. Patients will be followed-up according
      to the standard of care and a final analysis of the results will be performed at 12+/-1
      months of follow-up, which is the minimum follow-up period required for each patient. In
      group 1 the effect of VMA existence and PVD status will also be analyzed. The recruitment
      period will be of 6 months.

      Treatment All patients will be treated with IV ranibizumab injections (0.5 mg/0.05ml)
      following a PRN regimen. The injections will be performed in the operating room following the
      standard intravitreal injections protocol. When required, adjunct treatment, with macular
      and/or peripheral LASER (rescue LASER), will be also admitted at or after 24 weeks if
      persistent DME not improving after at least 2 injections.

      Treatment Schedule Repeat injections at every 4-week visit if eye &quot;improves&quot; or &quot;worsens&quot;
      (defined as ≥5 letter change from last injection or ≥10% CST change on OCT from last
      injection or CSF&gt;300 μm at any timepoint).

      Defer injections if either BCVA of 85 letters and OCT CSF &quot;normal&quot; (CSF≤300 μm and
      non-existent intra- or sub-retinal fluid); or OCT CSF &quot;normal&quot; (CSF≤300 μm) and stable BCVA
      (defined as &lt; 5 letters change from last injection) after two consecutive injections during
      the first 24 weeks, or after one injection if the initial stability period has already been
      achieved (OCT CSF &quot;normal&quot; and stable BCVA).

      Resume injections if BCVA or OCT worsens.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>assess the number of IV injections needed to control DME between groups</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>DME control is defined as 1) BCVA of 85 letters and OCT CFT &quot;normal&quot; (CFT≤300 μm and non-existent intra- or sub-retinal fluid); or 2) OCT CFT &quot;normal&quot; (CFT≤300 μm) and stable BCVA (defined as &lt;5 letters change from last injection) after two consecutive injections during the first 24 weeks, or after one injection if the initial stability period has already been achieved (OCT CFT &quot;normal&quot; and stable BCVA).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>compare the functional changes at the end of follow-up between groups</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Functional change will be measured by the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Scale (ETDRS) which measures the best-corrected visual acuity with an ETDRS-like chart at 4 meters in number letters or at 1 meter when patients are unable to read any letters on the ETDRS chart at 4 meters. The ETDRS scale varies from 1 to 85 letters (85 letters correspond to a 20/20 in the Snellen scale).
The higher the value the better the outcome. A clinical significant functional improvement will be considered for a gain of ≥5 EDTRS letters.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>compare the anatomical changes at the end of follow-up between groups</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Anatomical change will be measured by central foveal thickness (CFT), measured by Optical Coherence Tomography, automatically measured by the software in the central 1 mm. A CFT &lt;240µm or &gt;300 µm is considered pathological. A CFT between 240 and 300 µm is considered physiological. CFT has no defined minimum or maximum values.
Since patients with diabetic macular edema usually have CFT &gt;300 µm the goal of treatment is to lower the CFT to values between 240 and 300 µm. A clinical significant anatomical improvement will be considered for a change in CFT≥10%.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>compare the percentage of type of responder during the follow-up period between groups</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Type of responder is defined as follows:
good responder: when beyond the 24th week of follow-up (maximum 7 injections) there was a complete anatomical response (CFT≤300μm) with an increase in BCVA ≥5 letters;
non-responder: 13 injections and final CFT &gt;400 um or ≤10% of CFT reduction and BCVA decrease (or BCVA gain &lt;5 letters)
incomplete responder: between good and non-responder criteria.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>access the percentage, in group 2, of focal VMA and PVD status and type of response</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>to access the percentage, in group 2, of focal VMA and PVD status, and if those changed during the follow-up period influenced the type of response</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>assess retinal layers thickness as prognostic and pathophysiological biomarkers of DME treatment response</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>

to assess the influence of the variation of retinal layers thickness (baseline versus final) on final BCVA
to assess differences between groups according to the above points;
