  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cannabis is the most frequently consumed drug in France and its use continues to increase.
      Over the 18-64 age group as a whole, experimentation with cannabis at least once in a
      lifetime increased from 33% in 2010 to 42% in 2014, confirming the upward trend observed
      since the 1990.

      Cannabis, like all drugs, disrupts the reward circuit whose neurons originate in the ventral
      tegmental area and project into the mesolimbic and cortical structures.

      Acute cannabis use is thought to increase mesolimbic dopamine by affecting the Gabaergic or
      Glutamatergic system.

      Chronic cannabis use usurps the reward system and leads to changes in the mesolimbic circuit
      (nucleus accumbens, ventral tegmental area, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex), inducing
      increased craving, with persistent craving for the substance and vulnerability to relapse.

      Cognitively, addiction is associated with increased impulsivity, with a propensity to take
      risks leading to impaired decision-making.

      There is currently no validated drug treatment for cannabis addiction. Non-invasive brain
      stimulation could be an interesting therapeutic alternative.

    <description>The tDCS is a device for modulating cortical excitability. It consists of passing a low intensity direct electrical current over the scalp via two electrodes: an anode and a cathode soaked in a saline solution. Although there is a short-circuit effect through the scalp, a significant amount of electrical current enters the brain and changes the transmembrane potential.</description>
