  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of measured and induced negative
      feelings on glucose, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and cortisol levels in healthy participants
      and participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

    <textblock>
      Depression and Diabetes are two pathologies that are frequently comorbid. Stress and negative
      thoughts are part of both. The biological correlates of psychological and emotional life are
      not yet fully clarified, so in this study we wonder about the association between tumor
      necrosis factor alpha, cortisol, and peripheral glucose levels with depression stress,
      measured negative thoughts, and induced guilt.This is a randomized intervention study. At
      baseline, participants complete the Beck Depression Inventory, the Automatic Negative
      Thoughts Scale (ATQ-N), and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-14). The intervention consists of
      a written task about situations that involved feelings of guilt or neutral situations. Saliva
      and dextrostix samples are taken before the 20-minute written task, at the end, dextrostix
      and saliva samples are performed again, finally a blood sample is taken.

    <time_frame>This variable is measured in a single day and represents the week prior to the study.</time_frame>
    <description>Perceived stress scale (PSS-14), range 0-40.Higher scores indicating higher perceived stress. Scores ranging from 0-13 would be considered low stress. Scores ranging from 14-26 would be considered moderate stress. Scores ranging from 27-40 would be considered high perceived stress.</description>

    <time_frame>This variable is measured in a single day and represents the month prior to the study.</time_frame>
    <description>Automatic negative thoughts scale (ATQ-N), range 0-90. Higher scores mean a worse outcome (more negative thoughts).</description>
