    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI)/Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) (0/1)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>DLQI is a validated, dermatology-specific, patient reported measure that evaluates participant's health-related quality of life. It consists of 10 items that are grouped in 6 domains: symptoms &amp; feelings, daily activities, leisure, work &amp; school , personal relationships, &amp; treatment. The recall period of this scale is over the &quot;last week.&quot; Response categories and corresponding scores are:
Very much = 3, A lot = 2, A little = 1, Not at all = 0, Not relevant = 0. A DLQI total score is calculated by summing all 10 items responses, and has a range of 0 to 30 (higher scores are indicative of greater impairment). CDLQI questionnaire is designed for use in children (4 to 16 years of age). It consists of 10 items that are grouped into 6 domains: symptoms &amp; feelings, leisure, school or holidays, personal relationships, sleep, &amp; treatment. A CDLQI total score is calculated by summing all 10 items responses, and has a range of 0 to 30 (higher scores are indicative of greater impairment).</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline on the Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>NAPSI is a numeric, reproducible, objective tool for evaluation of nail psoriasis. This scale was used to evaluate the severity of nail bed psoriasis &amp; nail matrix psoriasis by area of involvement in the nail unit. Both fingernail &amp; toenail involvement were assessed.The nail is divided with imaginary horizontal &amp; longitudinal lines into quadrants. Each nail is given a score for nail bed psoriasis (0 to 4) &amp; nail matrix psoriasis (0 to 4), depending on the presence (score of 1) or absence (score of 0) of any of the features of nail bed &amp; nail matrix psoriasis in each quadrant:
0 = None
= present in one quadrant of nail
= present in two quadrants of nail
= present in three quadrants of nail
= present in four quadrants of nail NAPSI score of a nail is the sum of scores in nail bed &amp; nail matrix from each quadrant (maximum of 8). Each nail is evaluated, &amp; the sum of all the fingernails and toenails is the total NAPSI score ranging from 0 to 160 (No to Severe nail Psoriasis)</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline on the Psoriasis Scalp Severity Index (PSSI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The scalp was assessed for erythema (redness), induration (hardness), and desquamation (shedding of skin) and percentage of area affected as follows:
Erythema, Induration and Desquamation:
0 = Absent
= Slight
= Moderate
= Severe
= Severest Possible
Percent of Scalp Involved:
= &lt;10%
= 10% - 29%
= 30% - 49%
= 50% - 69%
= 70% - 89%
= 90% - 100%
The PSSI score is a composite score derived from the sum of the scores for erythema, induration and desquamation multiplied by the score for the extent of scalp area involved (percent of scalp involved). The range is 0 (no psoriasis) to 72 (Most severe Disease).
LSMean was calculated using treatment, region, baseline sPGA score, baseline weight category, baseline value, visit, treatment-by-visit, and baseline-by-visit interactions as fixed factors.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline on the Palmoplantar Psoriasis Severity Index (PPASI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>PPASI was used if the participant has palmoplantar psoriasis at baseline. Both the palms &amp; soles on each hand &amp; foot was assessed for erythema, induration, desquamation &amp; percentage of area affected as follows:
Erythema (E), Induration (I), &amp; Desquamation (D):0 = None, 1 = Slight, 2 = Moderate, 3 = Severe, 4 = Very Severe
Percent of Palm and Sole Area Covered:
0 = None, 1 = &lt;10%, 2 = 10% - 29%, 3 = 30% - 49%, 4 = 50% - 69%, 5 = 70% - 89%, 6 = 90% - 100% PPASI score is a composite score derived from the sum scores for E, I, &amp; D multiplied by a score for the extent of palm &amp; sole area involvement. The range is 0 (no psoriasis) to 72 (most severe disease).</description>

Severity is rated for each index (R, S, T) on a 0-4 scale (0 for no involvement up to 4 for severe involvement): 0 = none, 1 = slight, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, 4 = severe Fraction of total body surface area affected is graded on a 0-6 scale (0 for no involvement to 6 for 90% - 100% involvement).
Overall score ranges from 0 (no psoriasis) to 72 (most severe disease).</description>

Severity is rated for each index (R, S, T) on a 0-4 scale (0 for no involvement up to 4 for severe involvement): 0 = none, 1 = slight, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, 4 = severe Fraction of total body surface area (BSA) affected is graded on a 0-6 scale (0 for no involvement to 6 for 90% - 100% involvement): 0 = 0% (clear), 1 = &gt;0% to &lt;10%, 2 = 10% to &lt;30%, 3 = 30% to &lt;50%, 4 = 50% to &lt;70%, 5 = 70% to 90%, 6 = 90% to 100%.
Overall score ranges from 0 (no psoriasis) to 72 (most severe disease).</description>

        <description>DLQI is a validated, dermatology-specific, patient reported measure that evaluates participant's health-related quality of life. It consists of 10 items that are grouped in 6 domains: symptoms &amp; feelings, daily activities, leisure, work &amp; school , personal relationships, &amp; treatment. The recall period of this scale is over the &quot;last week.&quot; Response categories and corresponding scores are:
Very much = 3, A lot = 2, A little = 1, Not at all = 0, Not relevant = 0. A DLQI total score is calculated by summing all 10 items responses, and has a range of 0 to 30 (higher scores are indicative of greater impairment). CDLQI questionnaire is designed for use in children (4 to 16 years of age). It consists of 10 items that are grouped into 6 domains: symptoms &amp; feelings, leisure, school or holidays, personal relationships, sleep, &amp; treatment. A CDLQI total score is calculated by summing all 10 items responses, and has a range of 0 to 30 (higher scores are indicative of greater impairment).</description>

          <description>DLQI is a validated, dermatology-specific, patient reported measure that evaluates participant's health-related quality of life. It consists of 10 items that are grouped in 6 domains: symptoms &amp; feelings, daily activities, leisure, work &amp; school , personal relationships, &amp; treatment. The recall period of this scale is over the &quot;last week.&quot; Response categories and corresponding scores are:
Very much = 3, A lot = 2, A little = 1, Not at all = 0, Not relevant = 0. A DLQI total score is calculated by summing all 10 items responses, and has a range of 0 to 30 (higher scores are indicative of greater impairment). CDLQI questionnaire is designed for use in children (4 to 16 years of age). It consists of 10 items that are grouped into 6 domains: symptoms &amp; feelings, leisure, school or holidays, personal relationships, sleep, &amp; treatment. A CDLQI total score is calculated by summing all 10 items responses, and has a range of 0 to 30 (higher scores are indicative of greater impairment).</description>
          <population>All randomized participants in placebo and Ixekizumab arms. Missing values were imputed by Nonresponder imputation.
Participants who do not meet the clinical response criteria or have missing clinical response data or without at least 1 post-baseline observation are considered as nonresponders for NRI analysis.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline on the Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI)</title>
        <description>NAPSI is a numeric, reproducible, objective tool for evaluation of nail psoriasis. This scale was used to evaluate the severity of nail bed psoriasis &amp; nail matrix psoriasis by area of involvement in the nail unit. Both fingernail &amp; toenail involvement were assessed.The nail is divided with imaginary horizontal &amp; longitudinal lines into quadrants. Each nail is given a score for nail bed psoriasis (0 to 4) &amp; nail matrix psoriasis (0 to 4), depending on the presence (score of 1) or absence (score of 0) of any of the features of nail bed &amp; nail matrix psoriasis in each quadrant:
0 = None
= present in one quadrant of nail
= present in two quadrants of nail
= present in three quadrants of nail
= present in four quadrants of nail NAPSI score of a nail is the sum of scores in nail bed &amp; nail matrix from each quadrant (maximum of 8). Each nail is evaluated, &amp; the sum of all the fingernails and toenails is the total NAPSI score ranging from 0 to 160 (No to Severe nail Psoriasis)</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline on the Psoriasis Scalp Severity Index (PSSI)</title>
        <description>The scalp was assessed for erythema (redness), induration (hardness), and desquamation (shedding of skin) and percentage of area affected as follows:
Erythema, Induration and Desquamation:
0 = Absent
= Slight
= Moderate
= Severe
= Severest Possible
Percent of Scalp Involved:
= &lt;10%
= 10% - 29%
= 30% - 49%
= 50% - 69%
= 70% - 89%
= 90% - 100%
The PSSI score is a composite score derived from the sum of the scores for erythema, induration and desquamation multiplied by the score for the extent of scalp area involved (percent of scalp involved). The range is 0 (no psoriasis) to 72 (Most severe Disease).
LSMean was calculated using treatment, region, baseline sPGA score, baseline weight category, baseline value, visit, treatment-by-visit, and baseline-by-visit interactions as fixed factors.</description>
