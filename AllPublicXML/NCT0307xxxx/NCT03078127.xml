  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study investigating the effectiveness and clinical efficacy of airway
      clearance therapy (ACT) in cystic fibrosis (CF). Enrolled subjects will undergo measurements
      of mucociliary clearance (MCC) and exhaled biomarkers at baseline and after 3 different forms
      of ACT: high frequency chest wall oscillatory vest, oscillatory positive expiratory pressure
      device, and whole-body vibration.

    <measure>Mucociliary Clearance-274</measure>
    <time_frame>274 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>As described in the protocol, gamma scintigraphy was used to measure clearance of particles from the whole right lung region of interest over 274 minutes. The primary outcome for this study was the area under the particle clearance curve from time 0 to 274 minutes post-inhalation (normalized to time by dividing by 274) and expressed as a percent, representing total average rate of mucociliary clearance (MCC).</description>

      <recruitment_details>Patients were screened and recruited from the adult CF clinic at UNC from January 2017 to December 2017.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Following screening, patients performed a baseline study visit prior to randomization into the study arms which determined which order to complete the other three interventions would be performed. Baseline (or &quot;huff-cough&quot;) was completed prior to randomization to ensure comparator data if a patient was unable to complete the study.</pre_assignment_details>

Thus, the investigators estimated a mean change of 20% for effective ACT with the same estimate for variability (Std Dev of 15.1%).
