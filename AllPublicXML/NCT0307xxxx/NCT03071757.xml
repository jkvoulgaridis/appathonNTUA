  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this Phase 1, open-label study is to evaluate the safety,
      pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of ABBV-368 as a monotherapy and in combination
      with ABBV-181 in participants with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. The study
      will consist of 3 parts: ABBV-368 dose escalation, ABBV-368 tumor-specific dose expansion
      (triple negative breast cancer [TNBC] cohort and head and neck cancer cohort) and 18F-AraG
      Imaging Substudy.

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. The investigator assessed the relationship of each event to the use of study drug as either reasonable possibility or no reasonable possibility. A serious adverse event (SAE) is an event that results in death, is life-threatening, requires or prolongs hospitalization, results in a congenital anomaly, persistent or significant disability/incapacity or is an important medical event that, based on medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed above. Treatment-emergent events (TEAEs/TESAEs) are defined as any event that began or worsened in severity after the first dose of study drug. For more details on adverse events please see the Adverse Event section.</description>
