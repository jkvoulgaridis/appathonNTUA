  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study includes an inclusion visit, 2 visits to the Rennes University Hospital and the
      filling of two on-line questionnaires.

      The first visit to the University-Hospital of Rennes, during which a blood sample will be
      taken, morpho-anatomic measures (height, weight, hip and size), impedancemetry and resting
      energy expenditure by indirect calorimetry will be carried out in the Clinical Investigation
      Unit.

      During this visit, the volunteers will also have to bring a sample of urine and faeces
      previously collected at home.

      The two on-line questionnaires (hedonic and caloric evaluation of foods and beverages on
      photos) will have to be completed by the volunteers between the first and the second visit to
      the University-Hospital.

      Finally, the volunteers will go to the University-Hospital of Rennes for the second visit, on
      the Neurinfo platform, during which they will be subjected to a cognitive two-choice test
      based on food and drink pictures, during fMRI. Before and after the fMRI session, an
      assessment of the state of hunger, thirst, and general status of the volunteer will be
      carried out using a numerical scale ranging from 1 to 10.
