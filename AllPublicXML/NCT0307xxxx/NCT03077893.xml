      A study to demonstrate the effectiveness of PEMF treatment compared to sham treatment in
      changing Vibration Perception Threshold (VPT) and Thermal Sensory (QST) in patients with
      diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) when treatment is administered twice daily through
      120-day period.

      Multi-center, sham-controlled, double-blind, enriched enrollment, randomized withdrawal
      clinical trial conducted on subjects with bilateral symmetrical diabetic peripheral
      neuropathy. Eligible subjects will include those between 22 and 80 years of age with Type 1
      or Type 2 diabetes having persistent pain, numbness, tingling, or burning in both feet
      despite treatment. Eligible subjects will receive two active treatment devices (one for each
      foot, to allow simultaneous treatment) and treat at home, twice daily for 60 days after which
      they will return to the clinic at Day 61 for a response assessment. Subjects that are
      determined to be responders at Day 61 (subjects that achieve a 1-point decrease in the
      average pain score over the last 24 hours using the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS)) will be
      randomized 1:1 to either active treatment or inactive sham devices and will continue treating
      through Day 120. Subjects that are determined to be non-responders at Day 61 will continue
      treating with the active devices given at enrollment and will return to the clinic at Day 75
      and Day 91 for a response assessment. If a subject is determined to be a responder at Day 75,
      they will be randomized 1:1 to receive either active treatment or inactive sham and will
      continue treating through Day 120. If a subject is determined to be a responder at Day 91,
      they will be randomized 1:1 to receive either active treatment or sham and will continue to
      treat through Day 120. If a subject continues to be a non-responder at Day 91 they will be
      terminated from the study.

A global fatigue score was calculated by averaging all of the values on the questionnaire and results for the change from Baseline to Day 121 are displayed below. The scale ranged from 0 (no fatigue/does not interfere) to 10 (as bad as you can imagine/completely interferes).</description>

        <description>A patient reported 14 question assessment that detects the status of depression and anxiety. Subjects completed the assessment at the Enrollment Visit, Days 30, 61, 91, and end of study visit (Day 121). The total score for anxiety and the total score for depression was calculated at Day 121. Low scores represent normal (0-7) while high scores represent abnormal (11-21).</description>

        <description>A validated set of health-related quality of life measures that are domain specific.Subjects will completed 6 domains: (1) Pain, (2) Lost/Reduced Feeling, (3) Diffuse Sensory Motor Symptoms, (4) Restrictions in Activities of Daily Living, (5) Disruptions in Social Relationships, and (6) Emotional Distress.The short forms were completed by the subject at the Enrollment Visit and end of study visit (Day 121). Each question in the domain was rated on a symptom scale from 1 (never) to 5 (all the time) and a bothersome scale from 1 (none) to 3 (very much).
The total score for the domain was calculated by multiplying the symptom score by the bothersome score. The scale range is from 1 to 15 where the minimum (best/least symptomatic) score is 1 and the maximum (worst/most symptomatic) score is 15.</description>
