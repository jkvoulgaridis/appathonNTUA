  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of
      BIIB067 in participants with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and confirmed superoxide
      dismutase 1 (SOD1) mutation. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the pharmacokinetic
      (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD), and efficacy of BIIB067 administered to participants with ALS and
      confirmed SOD1 mutation.

    <measure>Number of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 248</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product. A SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, life-threatening event, requires inpatient hospitalization, significant disability/incapacity or congenital anomaly.</description>

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must have diagnosis of SOD1-ALS, and must have completed the End of Study Visit for

             the last dose of study treatment received in Study 233AS101 and the first dose of
             BIIB067 received in the current Study 233AS102.

          -  If taking edaravone, participant must have initiated edaravone ≥60 days (2 treatment

             but are not limited to, anatomical factors at or near the LP site (e.g., vascular
             abnormalities, neoplasms, or other abnormalities) and underlying disorders of the
             coagulation cascade, platelet function, or platelet count (e.g., hemophilia, Von
             Willebrand's disease, liver disease).

          -  Presence of an implanted shunt for the drainage of CSF or an implanted central nervous
             system (CNS) catheter.

          -  Prior or current treatment with small interfering ribonucleic acid (RNA), stem cell
             therapy, or gene therapy.

          -  Treatment with another investigational drug, biological agent (excluding BIIB067), or
             device within 1 month or 5 half-lives of study agent, whichever is longer.

          -  Current or anticipated need, in the opinion of the Investigator, of a diaphragm pacing
             system (DPS) during the study period.

          -  Female participants who are pregnant or currently breastfeeding.

          -  Current enrollment in any other interventional study.

          -  Current or recent (within 1 month) use, or anticipated need, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, of copper (II) (diacetyl-bis(N4-methylthiosemicarbazone)) or
             pyrimethamine.
