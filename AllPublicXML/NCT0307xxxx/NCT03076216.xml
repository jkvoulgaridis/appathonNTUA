  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety of OncoSil™ in a patient population undergoing standard chemotherapy
      treatment for pancreatic cancer. This study has been designed to satisfy FDA regulatory
      requirements.

      The clinical investigation will be conducted at approximately 5 sites in the United States
      involving 20 patients.

  <detailed_description>

      The purpose of this research study is to investigate the safety of an active implantable
      (radiological) medical device OncoSil™, when implanted into patients with pancreatic cancer,
      in conjunction with Standard chemotherapy. OncoSil™, is an experimental treatment and carries
      the active treatment &quot;radioactive Phosphorous (32P)&quot; inside inactive silicon particles. Once
      implanted, the OncoSil™ Microparticles will stay in the tumour permanently. The purpose of
      OncoSil™, is to deliver the action of 32P directly into a targeted tumour to destroy cancer
      cells.

      20 Patients will be taking part in a single arm open label research study - which means that
      everyone in the research study will receive the investigational treatment OncoSil™, plus
      their prescribed standard chemotherapy regimen which will be either Gemcitabine or
      Gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane).

      Endpoints: Primary Endpoint:

      • Safety and Tolerability

      Secondary Endpoints:

      Efficacy

        -  Local Progression Free Survival (LPFS), within the pancreas

        -  Progression Free Survival (PFS), all sites

        -  Overall Survival (OS)

        -  Body weight

        -  Impaired function

        -  Pain Scores

      The screening period will be performed within a 2 week period, followed by a treatment period
      of investigational visits which will occur weekly from Day 0 (Visit 1) until week 12, then 4
      weeks later at week 16, and then at 8-weekly intervals until study participants reach
      documented progression of disease criteria for both LPFS and PFS which marks the end of study
      participation i.e. EOS visit.

      8 weekly telephone contact will be used to monitor device or late radiation related adverse
      events, and oncology treatments/procedures administered for up to 12 months post OncoSil™
      implantation. Overall survival will be conducted via 8 weekly medical record reviews and or
      telephone contact until subject death, or until 104 weeks post the last subject enrolled.

      Overall survival will be conducted via 8-weekly medical record reviews until study
      participant death, or until 104 weeks post the last study participant enrolled.

      Activity (Dose): The intended average absorbed radiation dose per treated tumour is 100 Gy
      (+20%).

      Risks associated with OncoSil™ and/or implantation procedure

      The following adverse events, considered to have a causal relationship with OncoSil™ or
      procedure, were recorded during previous clinical studies:

        -  Procedure-related pain

        -  Abdominal pain and discomfort

        -  Lethargy

        -  Fever

        -  Nausea and vomiting

        -  Abnormal liver function tests

          2. Stage III unresectable locally advanced pancreatic carcinoma. Patients with
             technically resectable tumors (T1-T3) will also be eligible, if they are deemed
             unresectable due to medical comorbidities or refusal of surgery.

          3. Pancreatic target tumor diameter of ≥ 2.0 cm (shortest axis) to ≤ 6.0 cm (longest
             axis), as qualified by the central reading center.

          4. An ECOG Performance Status of 0 to 1 and Karnofsky Performance Status of 80 - 100.

          5. Study participants' ≥ 18 years of age at screening.

          6. To commence first-line standard gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel chemotherapy, or
             gemcitabine alone, (per standard of care (SoC) according to the approved prescribing
             schedule), within 14 days post enrollment, with OncoSil™ implantation to occur during
             the fourth (4th) week of the first chemotherapy cycle.

          7. Provide signed Informed Consent.

          8. Willing and able to complete study procedures within the study timelines.

          9. Adequate renal function: serum creatinine less than 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN).

         10. Adequate liver function: serum liver transaminases ≤ 3 × ULN and serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5
             × ULN*.

             * For study participants with recent biliary obstruction treated by drainage (e.g.
             stent), serum bilirubin of &gt; 1.5 x ULN will be accepted for study entry provided that
             serial levels demonstrate clear improvement. In addition, chemotherapy should not be
             commenced until serum bilirubin is ≤ 1.5 × ULN.

         11. Adequate bone marrow function: white blood cells (WBCs) ≥ 3,000/mm3, absolute
             neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,500/mm3, hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL, and platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3.

         12. Life expectancy of at least 3 months at the time of screening as judged by the
             investigator.

         13. Treated with or eligible to commence prophylactic treatment with a proton-pump
             inhibitor prior to implantation, and to continue to receive treatment for at least 6
             months post implantation.

         14. Not pregnant, and if of childbearing potential, agrees to use adequate birth control
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control or abstinence) prior to study entry and
             during the study and agrees not to donate sperm or ova, for the duration of the study
             and 12 months post implantation of the investigational device.

             -

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Evidence of distant metastases, based on review of baseline CT scan, as determined by
             the central reading center.

          2. More than one primary lesion.

          3. Any prior radiotherapy or chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer.

          4. Use of other investigational agent at the time of screening, or within 30 days or five
             half-lives of Screening Visit 1, whichever is longer.

          5. Pregnant or lactating.

          6. In the opinion of the investigator, EUS directed implantation posing undue study
             participant risk. This includes:

               -  where previous EUS-FNA was considered technically too difficult to perform;

               -  imaging demonstrates multiple collateral vessels surrounding or adjacent to the
                  target tumor within the pancreas;

               -  presence (or significant risk) of varices near to the target tumor. Note: The
                  feasibility of implantation of the target tumor and assessment of risk can be
                  conducted at any time between Screening Visit 1 and the implantation date. A
                  study participant should be considered for withdrawal prior to and including at
                  the time of OncoSil™ treatment, if any of the above risk features become apparent
                  following study participant screening and/or enrolment.

          7. History of malignancy, treated or untreated, within the past five years whether or not
             there is evidence of local recurrence or metastases, with the exception of basal cell
             carcinoma of the skin and cervical carcinoma in situ.

          8. Evidence of radiographic invasion into stomach or duodenum (if not certain,
             confirmation must be obtained prior to enrolment).

          9. A known history of hypersensitivity to silicon or phosphorous, or any of the OncoSil™
             components.

         10. Any other health condition that would preclude participation in the study in the
             judgement of the investigator.
