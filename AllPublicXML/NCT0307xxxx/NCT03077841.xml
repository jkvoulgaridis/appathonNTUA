  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well hypofractionated partial breast irradiation works in
      treating patients with early stage breast cancer. Hypofractionated radiation therapy delivers
      higher doses of radiation therapy over a shorter period of time and may kill more tumor cells
      and have fewer side effects. Treating only the part of the breast where the cancer started
      may lead to fewer side effects than standard treatment.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. The risk of grade 2 or higher toxicity occurring during radiation and through the 6 month
      post-radiation follow up visit in patients treated with Optimizing Preventative Adjuvant
      Linac-based Radiation (OPAL) regimen.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To measure patient-reported cosmetic outcome, functional status, and breast pain with the
      OPAL regimen at 6 months, one year, two years, three years, four years, and five years after
      completing the OPAL regimen.

      II. To measure physician-reported and photographically-assessed cosmetic outcome at 6 months,
      one year, two years, three years, four years, and five years after completing the OPAL
      regimen and to compare this to the best performing arm of 2010-0559.

      III. To determine the 5-year risk of pathologically-confirmed invasive and/or in situ
      ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) for patients with ductal breast carcinoma in situ
      (DCIS) and early invasive breast cancer.

      IV. To determine the 5-year risk of any recurrence of breast cancer, disease-free survival,
      and overall survival.

      V. To determine maximal late (within 5 years) toxicities using the National Cancer Institute
      (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v) 4.0 scale.

      VI. To establish the feasibility of conducting multi-center radiation therapy trials within
      the MD Anderson Network.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo hypofractionated partial breast irradiation daily for 10 days.
      Patients may then receive 3 additional boost fractions at the discretion of the doctor.

      ARM II: Patients undergo standard breast irradiation daily for 15 days. Patients may then
      receive 5 additional boost fractions at the discretion of the doctor.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 months, and at 1.5, 3.5,
      and 5.5 years.

    <description>Patient-reported cosmetic outcome, functional status, and breast pain will be measured using the Breast Cancer Treatment Outcomes Scale (BCTOS) and will be compared for the IMPORT Low versus OPAL regimens. Each outcome will be evaluated both as a continuous variable and as a dichotomous variable with a cutpoint of &gt;= 2.5, indicating a moderate or greater average change in the treated breast compared to the untreated breast which serves as an internal control. Will use descriptive statistics to summarize patient-reported cosmetic outcome, functional status, and breast pain over time. Box plots and graphical measures will be used to display the distribution of these outcomes over time and by treatment arm. Will conduct linear mixed models to assess changes in patient-reported cosmetic outcome, functional status, and breast pain scores over time. A random intercept will be included to account for within-subject correlations.</description>

    <description>For this analysis, the primary outcome is grade 2 or higher breast fibrosis measured using the Subjective, Objective, Management, Analytic/Late Effects Normal Tissue Task Force scale at the 3.5 year follow up visit. The exposure of interest is the presence of at least one copy of the C-509T allele in germline deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).
