  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effects of delivering training services via telehealth to educators
      in rural schools. The investigators hope to increase the accuracy with which educators
      implement functional behavior assessments in schools. During the study, participants will
      receive training on functional behavior assessments at different periods. When one school is
      receiving training, other schools will not be receiving training. The purpose will be to show
      increased accuracy of functional behavior assessments only occur following training.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Training services for educators typically occurs in-vivo with experts providing immediate
      feedback and modeling to shape behavior. These types of training experiences may not be
      accessible for all educators though. The current study will evaluate delivering behavioral
      skills training (e.g., feedback and error correction) via telehealth for educators conducting
      functional behavior assessments. The components of the functional behavior assessment that
      will be targeted are open-ended interviews, stimulus preference assessments, direct
      observations of problem behavior, and a functional communication training program. With at
      least three different schools, the investigators will introduce training delivered via
      telehealth one at a time to show that increases in acquisition of the various components of
      the functional behavior assessment only occur following telehealth-based training.
