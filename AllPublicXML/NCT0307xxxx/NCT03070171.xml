  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to establish the bioequivalence of tablet formulation
      of dabigatran etexilate compared to commercial capsule formulation following oral
      administration under fasted condition.

      The secondary objective is the evaluation and comparison of several pharmacokinetic
      parameters between the treatments.

PK exclusion criteria: 1) The subject experienced emesis at or before 2 times median Time from (last) dosing to the maximum measured concentration of the analyte in plasma (tmax). Median tmax was to be taken either from the median tmax for reference product or test product, depending on whether the subject had experienced emesis after taken the test or reference product. Median tmax was to be determined excluding the subjects experiencing emesis. 2) Time deviations 3) Use of restricted medications 4) A pre-dose concentration was &gt;5% of the Cmax value of that subject.</description>

          -  Healthy male subjects according to the investigator's assessment, based on a complete
             medical history including a physical examination, vital signs (blood pressure (BP),
             pulse rate (PR)), 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), and clinical laboratory tests

             measurements are allowed.

          -  Participation in another trial where an investigational drug has been administered
             within 60 days prior to planned administration of trial medication, or current
             participation in another trial involving administration of investigational drug

          -  Smoker (more than 10 cigarettes or 3 cigars or 3 pipes per day)

          -  Inability to refrain from smoking in-house confinement at the trial site

          -  Alcohol abuse (consumption of more than 30 g per day: e.g., 750 mL of beer, 1.5 gous
             [equivalent to 270 mL] of Sake)

          -  Drug abuse or positive drug screening

          -  Blood donation of more than 100 mL within 30 days prior to administration of trial
             medication or intended donation during the trial

          -  Intention to perform excessive physical activities within one week prior to
             administration of trial medication or during the trial

          -  Subject is assessed as unsuitable for inclusion by the investigator, for instance,
             because considered not able to understand and comply with trial requirements, or has a

PK exclusion criteria: 1) The subject experienced emesis at or before 2 times median Time from (last) dosing to the maximum measured concentration of the analyte in plasma (tmax). Median tmax was to be taken either from the median tmax for reference product or test product, depending on whether the subject had experienced emesis after taken the test or reference product. Median tmax was to be determined excluding the subjects experiencing emesis. 2) Time deviations 3) Use of restricted medications 4) A pre-dose concentration was &gt;5% of the Cmax value of that subject.</description>
