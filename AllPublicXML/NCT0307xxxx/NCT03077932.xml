    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to develop a smartphone app (called BetterOFF) that will help
      patients manage opioid withdrawal during opioid medication taper and detoxification. The
      BetterOFF smartphone intervention will be a resource patients can access anytime and
      anywhere. If the BetterOFF intervention were to be effective in helping patients discontinue
      opioid medication, it could be integrated into the standard of care of office-based clinical
      practices, as well as substance use programs, thereby having a substantial public health
      impact.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many of the growing number of patients prescribed long-term opioid medication (for a variety
      of reasons including a history of illicit opioid use or management of chronic pain) will
      express an interest in discontinuing medication. However, many patients, physically dependent
      on opioids, fear the withdrawal symptoms that inevitably occur with opioid medication
      discontinuation and will experience a decrease in their self-efficacy for abstinence at the
      end of a taper. As a result, tapering is often slow and done hesitantly, and relapse rates
      after an opioid taper are high and associated with broad consequences, including significant
      negative physical, mental, and social problems. Even with optimal tapering protocols,
      patients need novel approaches to manage the discontinuation of opiate agonist treatment.
      Given this important gap in opioid treatment delivery, we propose to develop a
      theoretically-driven, smartphone-delivered intervention (Better Off app) to help patients
      effectively manage the experience of opioid medication discontinuation.
