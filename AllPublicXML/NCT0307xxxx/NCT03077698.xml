  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-center, single-arm, two-period Phase 2 study. The study will
      investigate the efficacy of Sodium Cridanimod in conjunction with progestin therapy in a
      population of subjects with recurrent or persistent endometrial cancer, who have failed
      progestin monotherapy or who have been identified as PrR negative. All patients must have
      endometrial cancer PrR status determined from an archival sample at Screening. The PrR status
      (positive or negative) will be determined by central laboratory by IHC testing.

      There are two treatment periods and a follow-up period within the study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment Period 1 (Progestin Monotherapy): During Treatment Period 1, all subjects
      determined to be PrR positive will receive progestin monotherapy, megestrol acetate, for up
      to 24 weeks. Subjects will have an MRI or CT scan after 12 and 24 weeks of progestin
      monotherapy, with response to treatment being assessed according to RECIST 1.1 criteria. All
      subjects that achieve disease control confirmed by tumor assessment after Treatment Period 1,
      will be ineligible to enter Treatment Period 2. These subjects will be terminated from the
      trial and treated according to local standards of practice, which may include continued
      progestin therapy.

      Subjects determined to be PrR negative at Screening will not enroll into Treatment Period 1.
      These subjects will enroll directly into Treatment Period 2.

      Treatment Period 2 (Combination Treatment): All subjects determined to be PrR negative at
      Screening and those who received at least 4 weeks of progestin monotherapy and who
      experienced disease progression at the conclusion of Treatment Period 1 will enter Treatment
      Period 2 of the study. During Treatment Period 2, subjects will receive Sodium Cridanimod in
      combination with continued progestin treatment, megestrol acetate. Subjects will receive
      treatment until disease progression as defined according to RECIST 1.1 criteria, with
      response assessments performed at 12-week intervals.

      Follow-up Period: Once subjects progress during Treatment Period 2, they will return for a
      Safety Follow-up Visit 4 weeks following the last treatment, and then continue to be followed
      for an additional 12-month period for overall survival.
