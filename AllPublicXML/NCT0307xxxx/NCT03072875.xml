    <textblock>
      This Phase I feasibility study endeavors to create a prototype of a tool to determine its
      feasibility with suicidal patients in emergency departments (EDs). This is not a clinical
      trial. The overarching goal of this research is to create a tool that could reduce suicide
      rates, increase delivery of efficacious suicide interventions, and decrease overall costs
      associated with suicidal behaviors. SBIR Phase I project aims include: (1) creating an
      advisory board to guide the development of CAMS-RAS; (2) iteratively design and develop
      relational agent (&quot;Dr. Dave&quot;) modeled after the gestures, expressions, and mannerisms of CAMS
      treatment developer, David Jobes, PhD; and (3) conduct feasibility tests to determine whether
      CAMS-RAS is acceptable, easy to use, and liked by target end-users: acutely suicidal patients
      admitted to hospital EDs, psychiatric inpatient units, and medical floors for treatment of
      injuries sustained during a suicide attempt; hospital medical personnel, administrators, and
      other stakeholders including peer advocates; and outpatient suicidal patients, clinicians and
      administrators.

    <time_frame>up to one day</time_frame>
    <description>A brief face-valid, self-report measure that the PI derived from the System Usability Scale and has been successfully used in previous studies. Items are rated on a 5-point Likert Scale (1=poor; 3=good; 5=excellent). Includes open-ended questions to better understand what was most and least helpful with respect to each category and also measures users' acceptance.</description>

    <measure>Number of ED Patient Participants Who Completed Semi-Structured Interview</measure>
    <time_frame>After interacting with the technology (length: approximately 1 hour), subjects were then asked to complete the semi-structured interview conducted by the research assistant. On average, the interview lasted approximately 15 minutes.</time_frame>
    <description>A semi-structured interview was conducted following use of the CAMS-RAS tool to assess users' likes, dislikes, and other preferences. Questions included: &quot;What were your experiences in using 'Dr. Dave' and the CAMS-RAS system?&quot; and &quot;What suggestions would you have for improvement?&quot; All subjects indicated that they found the tool helpful to them. They described the tool using adjectives similar to those used to describe &quot;Nurse Louise&quot; - a &quot;discharge nurse&quot; avatar on which the investigator's avatar was based: &quot;He's kind and asks me really practical, helpful questions&quot;; &quot;He speaks to me directly in a compassionate way&quot;; and &quot;He is kind and invested&quot;.</description>

        <title>Number of ED Patient Participants Who Completed Semi-Structured Interview</title>
        <description>A semi-structured interview was conducted following use of the CAMS-RAS tool to assess users' likes, dislikes, and other preferences. Questions included: &quot;What were your experiences in using 'Dr. Dave' and the CAMS-RAS system?&quot; and &quot;What suggestions would you have for improvement?&quot; All subjects indicated that they found the tool helpful to them. They described the tool using adjectives similar to those used to describe &quot;Nurse Louise&quot; - a &quot;discharge nurse&quot; avatar on which the investigator's avatar was based: &quot;He's kind and asks me really practical, helpful questions&quot;; &quot;He speaks to me directly in a compassionate way&quot;; and &quot;He is kind and invested&quot;.</description>
        <time_frame>After interacting with the technology (length: approximately 1 hour), subjects were then asked to complete the semi-structured interview conducted by the research assistant. On average, the interview lasted approximately 15 minutes.</time_frame>
        <population>The qualitative information from the semi-structured interviews tells us subjects' general opinions and preferences concerning the avatar.</population>
