  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a multicenter, open-label safety study to determine the dose regimen of SYNT001
      (ALXN1830) administered intravenously in participants with pemphigus (vulgaris or foliaceus).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study planned to evaluate 2 cohorts: up to 8 participants to receive 5 weekly
      intravenous (IV) doses of ALXN1830 at 10 milligram/kilogram (mg/kg) (Cohort 1) and up to 12
      participants to receive 3 x 30 mg/kg weekly doses of ALXN1830 IV (loading) followed by 5 x 10
      mg/kg doses of ALXN1830 IV every other week or 10 weekly doses of ALXN1830 IV (maintenance)
      (Cohort 2).

      This study was terminated after the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK),
      pharmacodynamics (PD), and efficacy were characterized in participants with pemphigus at a
      single dose level (10 mg/kg) in Cohort 1, before any participants were enrolled in Cohort 2.

      The study consisted of 3 periods: Screening, Treatment, and Follow-Up.

    <measure>Count Of Participants Reporting Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (after first dose) through Day 112</time_frame>
    <description>A TEAE was defined as any adverse event (AE) that starts on or after the first dose of study drug or occurs prior to the first dose and worsens in severity on or after the first dose of study drug, during the Treatment Period and Follow-up Period. A TEAE was considered &quot;serious&quot; (Grade 3) if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, it resulted in any of the following outcomes: death, life-threatening adverse drug event, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, congenital anomaly/birth defect, or an event that may have jeopardized the participant and may have required medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the previously listed outcomes. A summary of serious and all other non-serious adverse events, regardless of causality, is located in the Reported Adverse Events module.</description>

    <measure>Maximum Percent Reduction Of Mean Total Immunoglobulin G (IgG) Levels From Baseline</measure>

    <measure>Maximum Percent Reduction In Mean Pemphigus Disease Area Index (PDAI) Total Activity Score From Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through Day 112</time_frame>
    <description>Pemphigus severity and disease activity was measured using the PDAI in regions where a validated questionnaire was available. The PDAI was administered during Treatment Period and Follow-up Period. PDAI total activity was comprised of scores for the skin, mucous membrane, and scalp subscales. The investigator determined a PDAI score as 0 to 250 points for total activity score (0 to 120 for skin, 0 to 10 for scalp, and 0 to 120 for mucosa). A higher score indicated higher impact on skin disease. The maximum percent reduction in PDAI total activity score from Baseline observed during the study is presented.</description>

        <description>A TEAE was defined as any adverse event (AE) that starts on or after the first dose of study drug or occurs prior to the first dose and worsens in severity on or after the first dose of study drug, during the Treatment Period and Follow-up Period. A TEAE was considered &quot;serious&quot; (Grade 3) if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, it resulted in any of the following outcomes: death, life-threatening adverse drug event, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, congenital anomaly/birth defect, or an event that may have jeopardized the participant and may have required medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the previously listed outcomes. A summary of serious and all other non-serious adverse events, regardless of causality, is located in the Reported Adverse Events module.</description>

        <description>Pemphigus severity and disease activity was measured using the PDAI in regions where a validated questionnaire was available. The PDAI was administered during Treatment Period and Follow-up Period. PDAI total activity was comprised of scores for the skin, mucous membrane, and scalp subscales. The investigator determined a PDAI score as 0 to 250 points for total activity score (0 to 120 for skin, 0 to 10 for scalp, and 0 to 120 for mucosa). A higher score indicated higher impact on skin disease. The maximum percent reduction in PDAI total activity score from Baseline observed during the study is presented.</description>
