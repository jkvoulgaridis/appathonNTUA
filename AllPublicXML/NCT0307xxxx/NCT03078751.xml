    <textblock>
      This is an open label, multi-center protocol for U.S. patients enrolled in a study of
      ribociclib with endocrine therapy as an adjuvant treatment in patients with hormone
      receptor-positive, HER2-negative, high risk early breast cancer
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While adjuvant endocrine therapy (ET) is effective in reducing risk of recurrence in patients
      with hormone receptor (HR)-positive early breast cancer (EBC), recurrences are still common,
      especially in patients with unfavorable clinical, pathological and/or molecular features.
      Ribociclib, a CDK4/6 inhibitor, demonstrated clinical efficacy with tolerable toxicity when
      added to ET in patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer. The purpose
      of this study is to evaluate the preliminary safety and tolerability of ribociclib to
      standard adjuvant ET in patients with HR+, HER2- high-risk EBC.
