  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infliximab and other TNF-inhibitors have revolutionised the treatment of several
      immunological inflammatory diseases. Still, more than half of the patients either do not
      respond sufficiently to infliximab therapy or loose efficacy over time. The large individual
      variation in the serum drug concentrations on standard doses and the development of anti-drug
      antibodies are thought to be main reasons for these treatment failures. An individualised
      treatment strategy based on systematic assessments of serum drug concentrations, therapeutic
      drug monitoring, has been proposed as a clinical tool to optimise efficacy of infliximab
      treatment. Therapeutic drug monitoring seems reasonable both from a clinical and an
      economical point of view, but the effectiveness of this treatment strategy still remain to be
      shown. The NOR-DRUM study is planned as a national, randomised controlled multicentre trial
      in two parts aiming to assess the effectiveness of therapeutic drug monitoring in order to
      achieve remission in patients with immunological inflammatory diseases starting infliximab
      treatment (part A) and in order to maintain disease control in patients on maintenance
      infliximab treatment (part B). The results of the NOR-DRUM study will hopefully contribute to
      an implementation of a personalised medicine approach to treatment with infliximab and other
      biological drugs.

Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions.
