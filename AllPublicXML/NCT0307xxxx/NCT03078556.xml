  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare the bioequivalence of two experimental fixed dose combination
      (FDC) tablets versus single entity products of dolutegravir (DTG) and lamivudine (3TC) in
      healthy adult subjects. The study will be carried out in two parts. Part 1 of the study will
      be open label, up to 3 periods design with a wash out period of at least 7 days between
      treatment periods. Subjects will be randomized to receive either single entities or
      formulation 1 FDC of DTG and 3TC in a crossover manner in first 2 periods. The first 16
      subjects who complete the first two treatment periods and consent to continue will receive a
      single dose of FDC formulation 1 tablet administered with a high fat meal for a third
      treatment period. In Part 2 of the study, subjects will be randomized to receive either
      single entities or formulation 2 FDC of DTG and 3TC in a crossover manner in first 2 periods.
      Similarly the first 16 subjects will then receive FDC formulation 2 tablets with high fat
      meal in treatment period 3. Subjects will have a follow-up visit within 7-14 days after the
      last dose of study drug. Approximately 76 healthy subjects will be included in Part 1 of the
      study and if Part 2 of the study is conducted, another 76 healthy subjects will be included.
      The total duration will be approximately 11 weeks.

    <description>HR was measured in the supine or semi-supine position after 5 minutes rest. The Baseline value was considered to be the participant's last available assessment prior to time of the first dose. Change from Baseline was defined as post dose visit value minus Baseline value. Data for HR for Part 1 and 2 is presented.</description>

    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. Any untoward event resulting in death, life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly/birth defect, any other situation according to medical or scientific judgment or all events of possible drug-induced liver injury with hyperbilirubinaemia were categorized as SAE. Participants having any AE or SAE are presented.</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected at indicated time points to study the PK profile of DTG and 3TC when administered as FDC tablet compared to co-administration of separate tablet formulations of DTG and 3TC in fasted state. The 4-hour post-dose sample was drawn prior to the participant's first post-dose meal. At each time point, 2 mL of blood was collected. PK parameters of bilayer FDC tablet formulation of DTG and 3TC was evaluated under fasted condition in Periods 1 and 2 of Part 2.</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected at indicated time points to study the PK profile of DTG and 3TC when administered as FDC tablet compared to co-administration of separate tablet formulations of DTG and 3TC in fasted state. The 4-hour post-dose sample was drawn prior to the participant's first post-dose meal. At each time point, 2 mL of blood was collected.

        <description>Blood samples were collected at indicated time points to study the PK profile of DTG and 3TC when administered as FDC tablet compared to co-administration of separate tablet formulations of DTG and 3TC in fasted state. The 4-hour post-dose sample was drawn prior to the participant's first post-dose meal. At each time point, 2 mL of blood was collected. PK parameters of bilayer FDC tablet formulation of DTG and 3TC was evaluated under fasted condition in Periods 1 and 2 of Part 2.</description>

The 4-hour post-dose sample was drawn prior to the participant's first post-dose meal. At each time point, 2 mL of blood was collected. The effect of food on DTG and 3TC bilayer FDC tablet formulations was assessed in Period 3 of Part 2.</description>

        <description>SBP and DBP were measured in the supine or semi-supine position after 5 minutes rest. The Baseline value was considered to be the participant's last available assessment prior to time of the first dose. Change from Baseline was defined as post dose visit value minus Baseline value.
