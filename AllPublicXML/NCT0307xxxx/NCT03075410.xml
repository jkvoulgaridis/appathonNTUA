  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK3036656 is being developed by GSK for the treatment of tuberculosis (TB). This is the FTIH
      study for GSK3036656 to evaluate the safety, tolerability and PK of single ascending and
      repeat oral doses of GSK3036656 in healthy adult subjects. The results of this study are
      intended to be used to identify appropriate and well-tolerated doses of GSK3036656 to be used
      in further studies. A food effect assessment will also be undertaken to investigate the
      influence of food on the PK of GSK3036656. The study will be conducted in two parts: Part A
      (single dose) and Part B (repeat dose). Up to two cohorts will be included in Part A. 9
      healthy adult subjects will be included in each cohort. Each cohort will participate in up to
      4 treatment (dosing) periods including a food effect treatment period. During each treatment
      period, GSK3036656 will be administered to 6 subjects and placebo will be administered to 3
      subjects. The starting dose in Part A will be 5 milligrams (mg), and the maximum dose will be
      1500 mg. The two cohorts in Part A will be dosed sequentially (i.e., dosing in Cohort 2
      starts after dosing in Cohort 1 is completed). Initially, there will be a 14 day wash out
      period for individual subjects between each dose level. Study progression to Part B from Part
      A will be based on an acceptable safety, tolerability and PK profile in Part A. Part B will
      comprise up to 4 cohorts (Cohorts 3, 4, 5, and 6) each containing 10 (8 active: 2 placebo)
      healthy adult subjects to examine the safety, tolerability and PK of a repeated daily dose of
      GSK3036656 over a period of up to 14 days. Appropriate doses and dose regimens for Part B
      will be selected based on available safety, tolerability and PK data from Part A and/or any
      preceding repeat dose cohorts from Part B. Dividing the total daily dose into 2 or 3 smaller
      doses may be done in both Part A and Part B. Up to 18 subjects will be enrolled into Part A
      and up to 40 subjects will be enrolled into Part B. The total duration of the study for each
      subject recruited into Part A and Part B will be approximately 12 weeks and 8 weeks,
      respectively.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>This was a double blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of single and repeat doses of GSK3036656 in healthy adult participants. The study was conducted at 1 center in United Kingdom from 02-April-2017 to 04-August-2017. Part A was a crossover design, Part B was a parallel group design..</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>20 participants screened, 8 were screen failures (SF). 9 were randomized at the beginning of Part A. During Part A, 2 of the 3 participants who withdrew were replaced, hence 11 randomized. 30 participants screened, 7 were SF, 4 passed screening but were kept in reserve, hence 19 randomized in Part B.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>12-lead ECGs were collected during the study using an ECG machine that automatically calculated the heart rate and measures PR, QRS, QT, and QT interval corrected for heart rate using Fridericia's formula (QTcF) intervals. At each time point at which triplicate ECGs were required, three individual ECG tracings were obtained as closely as possible in succession, but no more than 2 to 5 minutes apart. ECG findings were categorized as normal, abnormal not clinically significant (A-NCS) and abnormal clinically significant (A-CS). Only A-NCS and A-CS worst case post-Baseline values have been presented. Only those participants with data available at the indicated time point were analyzed.</description>

        <description>Urinalysis included dipstick urine test which was used to screen for glucose, ketones, occult blood and protein up to 72 hours post dose. The dipstick test gives results in a semi-quantitative manner, and results for urinalysis parameters of urine glucose, ketones, occult blood and protein can be read as negative, trace, trace-intact, trace-lysed,1+ and 2+ indicating proportional concentrations in the urine sample. Only categories with non-negative values have been presented. Only those participants with data available the indicated time points were analyzed.</description>

        <title>Urine Potential of Hydrogen (pH) Analysis by Dipstick Method for Part A</title>
        <description>Urinary pH measurement is a routine part of urinalysis. Urine pH is an acid-base measurement. pH is measured on a numeric scale ranging from 0 to 14; values on the scale refer to the degree of alkalinity or acidity. A pH of 7 is neutral. A pH less than 7 is acidic, and a pH greater than 7 is basic. Normal urine has a slightly acid pH (5.0 - 6.0). Urine samples were collected for the measurement of urine pH by method up to 72 hours in Part A. Only those participants with data available at the indicated time points were analyzed.</description>

        <description>Urinalysis included dipstick urine test which was used to screen for glucose, ketones, occult blood and protein up to 14 days post dose The dipstick test gives results in a semi-quantitative manner, and results for urinalysis parameters of urine glucose, ketones, occult blood and protein can be read as negative, trace, trace-intact, trace-lysed, 1+ and 2+ indicating proportional concentrations in the urine sample. Only categories with non-negative values have been presented. Only those participants available at the specified time points were analyzed represented by n=x in the category titles.

        <title>Urine pH Analysis by Dipstick Method for Part B</title>
        <description>Urinary pH measurement is a routine part of urinalysis. Urine pH is an acid-base measurement. pH is measured on a numeric scale ranging from 0 to 14; values on the scale refer to the degree of alkalinity or acidity. A pH of 7 is neutral. A pH less than 7 is acidic, and a pH greater than 7 is basic. Normal urine has a slightly acid pH (5.0 - 6.0). Urine samples were collected for the measurement of urine pH by method up to 8 weeks in Part B. Only those participants available at the specified time points were analyzed represented by n=x in the category titles. Period 1 = Cohort 1 in Part B, Period 2 = Cohort 2 in Part B.</description>
