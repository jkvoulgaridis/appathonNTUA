  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation study designed to evaluate the
      efficacy, safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of a novel T-Cell bispecific (TCB),
      glofitamab, administered by intravenous (IV) infusion as a single agent and in combination
      with obinutuzumab, following pre-treatment with a one-time, fixed dose of obinutuzumab. This
      entry-to-human study is divided in 3 parts: dose escalation (Parts I and II) and dose
      expansion (Part III). Single-participant dose-escalation cohorts will be used in Part I,
      followed by conversion to multiple participant dose-escalation cohorts (Part II), in order to
      define a tentative maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or optimal biological dose (OBD). The
      expansion cohorts (Part III) will be initiated when the tentative MTD/OBD is defined, to
      further evaluate the safety, PK and therapeutic activity of glofitamab.
