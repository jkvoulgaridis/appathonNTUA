    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to look at the amount of cancer cells in the blood of
      participants who are being treated with denosumab. The other purpose is to look at how long
      it takes for cancer to get worse when participants are being treated with denosumab.
      Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in the blood of patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC)
      have been associated with shorter survival than when CTCs are absent, especially in patients
      whose cancer has spread to their bones. In this study, we want it see if denosumab (the study
      drug) will decrease the number of CTCs measured in patients with MBC and cancer that has
      spread to their bones. We also plan to get blood from participants to study other research
      markers of interest.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the effect of denosumab in Her2/neu negative ER+ and/or PR+ metastatic breast
      cancer patients who are in partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) after starting
      systemic therapy with bone metastases and &gt;= 5 circulating tumor cells (CTCs) by measuring
      the fraction of patients with reduction in CTCs after 3 cycles of denosumab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the effect of denosumab on CTCs enumeration considered as a continuous variable
      (percent change from baseline) in this population.

      II. To evaluate median progression-free survival (m-PFS).

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. CTC enumeration after enrichment. II. To assess the effect on CTC profiling and
      characterization of stem cell phenotype (CTC-EMT).

      III. To evaluate the type of progressive disease (new site versus [vs.] progression of
      lesions in previous sites).

      IV. To analyze the expression of RANKL.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive denosumab subcutaneously (SC) on day 1. Treatment repeats every 28 days for
      up to 3 courses in the absence of disease progression, unexpected toxicity, or patient
      withdrawal or death.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 12 weeks for up to 2
      years.

          -  Patients with clinically symptomatic brain metastases or who required treatment for
             brain metastases within 4 weeks of registration (stable sequelae acceptable if
             treatment has been completed; these lesions cannot be used as target lesions)

             chemical or biologic composition to denosumab are not eligible (i.e. same class of
             drugs) (Note: prior bisphosphonates are allowed; patients could have received
             bisphosphonates or be bisphosphonate-naive; patients who were previously on

          -  No known prior history or current evidence of osteonecrosis/osteomyelitis of the jaw

          -  No known prior history or current evidence of untreated local gum or oral infection
