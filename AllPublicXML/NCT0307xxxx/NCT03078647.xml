      Clinical Study to Evaluate the Performance of the Profound System for the Treatment of
      Cellulite.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 60 healthy female volunteers, seeking cellulite treatment, 18 to 60 years of age from
      up to 3 investigational sites.

      Prospective, open-label, baseline-controlled, two arms, randomized, clinical study to
      evaluate the Profound device using the Dermal and SubQ Cartridges for minimally-invasive
      treatment of the upper thighs and buttocks cellulite appearance.

      The treatment areas of the study subjects will be divided into two arms:

        1. Arm 1 - the upper thigh/buttock on the left or right side of the body will undergo a
           single Profound treatment utilizing the Dermal and SubQ Cartridges

        2. Arm 2 - the contralateral upper thigh/buttock side of the body will undergo a single
           Profound treatment utilizing the SubQ Cartridge only.

      Methodology described in protocol to evaluate efficacy of treatments will be carried out at
      each visit.

    <description>Evaluate the improvement in global aesthetic appearance of cellulite in treated areas following a single dermal and/or subcutaneous treatment with Profound, as assessed by study investigators at 1,3 and 6 months post treatment visit. Investigators used the following scale: 0=No Change; 1= 1-24% improvement; 2=25-49% improvement; 3=50-74% improvement; 4=75-100% improvement.
The analysis calculates the improvement over 25% (grades 2-4)</description>

    <description>Evaluate the improvement in skin tightening in treated areas following a single dermal and/or subcutaneous treatment with Profound, as assessed by study investigators at 1 and 6 months post treatment visit. Investigators used the following scale: (0) No tightening/firmness; (1) Slightly visible tightening/firmness; (2) Visible tightening/firmness; (3) Very visible tightening/firmness.
The analysis calculates the skin tightening improvement graded: (2) Visible tightening/firmness and (3) Very visible tightening/firmness</description>
