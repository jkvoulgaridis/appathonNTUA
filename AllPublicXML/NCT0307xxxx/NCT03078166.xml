  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure (HF) is a major health problem worldwide but there is no global HF study that
      documents demographics, socioeconomic and clinical factors, diagnostic and management
      patterns, etiology, biomarkers, co-morbidities, treatments, quality of life, barriers to care
      and outcomes in all parts of the world. Such knowledge is essential in the prevention and
      treatment of this global disease. The Global Congestive Heart Failure Registry (G-CHF) is a
      global registry of approximately 20,000-25,000 HF patients enrolled over approximately 5
      years to study these risks and causes of HF.

      The G-CHF Registry is a prospective global cohort study of approximately 20,000-25,000 HF
      patients enrolled over approximately 5 years. Baseline data will be obtained on demographic
      and socioeconomic data, clinical and laboratory variables, co-morbidities, biomarkers,
      echocardiography, HF causes, medication use, management patterns, quality of life, and health
      systems. Six-month, 12-month, 18-month and 24-month follow-up data will be obtained to
      document patient outcomes and factors associated with outcomes.

      A sub-study of approximately 4000 patients (a subset of the main study population) will be
      performed to measure frailty, cognitive and lung function, mental health, medication
      adherence, patient-reported barriers to care, dietary assessment, and collection of blood and
      urine samples for central storage and analysis.

    <description>The main objective of G-CHF is to obtain reliable estimates of mortality and other non-fatal clinical outcomes in HF patients overall and in 6 global regions. Factors associated with outcomes will be explored. All outcome events will be recorded and summarized individually as rates and proportions, with two-sided confidence intervals calculated.</description>

      Approximately 4000 patients (a subset of the main G-CHF study population) will have blood and
      urine collected. Anonymized specimens will be sent to a central laboratory in Hamilton,
      Ontario, Canada for further storage and analysis.

        Patients with HF will be recruited from approximately 200-300 centers in North America,
        South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and Australia over approximately 5
        years (approximately 4,000-5,000 patients per year), resulting in an initial sample
        estimate of approximately 20,000-25,000 patients. In each country, approximately 2/3 of
        patients will be recruited from the outpatient clinic setting (chronic HF) and 1/3 from the
        hospital inpatient setting (acute HF or acute exacerbation of chronic HF). At least one
        site in each country will be rural.
