    <textblock>
      This study will describe the current medical care given to men who discuss their lower
      urinary tract symptoms with a HCP. It will document the primary reasons for the visit, the
      baseline characteristics of these men, the treatment received, and the practice patterns of
      specifically a primary care physician managing these patients.

This included any medications prescribed by PCP for urinary symptoms according to medical records within 12 months prior to telephone survey as described below:
Medications already prescribed by PCP for urinary symptoms prior to the 1st visit/contact for urinary symptoms within 12 months prior to telephone survey.
Medications newly prescribed by PCP upon visit(s)/contact(s) for urinary symptoms within 12 months prior to telephone survey (i.e., medications prescribed for urinary symptoms on or after the 1st visit/contact).
