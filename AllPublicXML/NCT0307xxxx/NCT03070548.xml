         12. Any condition or reason that interferes with ability to participate in the study,
             causes undue risk, or complicates the interpretation of safety data, in the opinion of
             the Investigator or Sponsor (e.g. non-compliance, excessive alcohol consumption,
             intake of drugs of abuse unless these drugs are medically indicated [e.g. opiates for
             pain relief]).

      <pre_assignment_details>This is a mass balance study with 14C-radiolabeled talazoparib in at least 6 participants with advanced solid tumors who qualified for treatment with talazoparib. Participants who completed the mass-balance part in this study had the option to continue treatment on an open-label extension protocol.</pre_assignment_details>
