  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      DHANI-2 is an extension to DHANI (NCT01580345) which proposes to extend maternal
      supplementation (DHA or Placebo) from &lt;20 weeks of gestational age through 6 months
      postpartum and infant follow-up through 12 months. Leveraging the RCT design, DHANI-2 aims to
      assess the role of maternal DHA supplementation on infant neurodevelopment and body growth.
      It also intends to enhance the mechanistic understanding by the addition of repeated
      biochemical measures from mother-child dyads.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A double-blinded, randomized, placebo controlled trial would be conducted among pregnant
      women in India to test the effectiveness of supplementing pregnant Indian women with 400 mg/d
      algal DHA compared to placebo from mid-pregnancy through delivery. Eligible participants
      would be randomized to receive either 400 mg of DHA or a placebo baseline measures would be
      taken before the enrollment of the participant in the study. The mother-child dyads would be
      followed through infant age 1 year and anthropometric measurements and biochemical
      investigations would be used to assess the effect of maternal DHA supplementation on infant
      neurodevelopment at ages 6- and 12-months using validated the Development Assessment Scale
      for Indian Infants (DASII).

    <measure>Infant neurodevelopment as measured by his/her Development quotient scores (DQS) at 12 months of age</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months (± 4 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The development quotient (DQ) among infants at 12 months of age assessed using the standardized Development Assessment Scale for Indian Infants (DASII). DASII is the Indian modification (done in 1970 and 1977) of the Bayley Scale of Infant Development (BSID) using Indian norms for 67 motor and 163 mental items of the BSID. DASII provides a measure of DQ among Indian infants below 30 months of age. DQ is defined as the ratio of functional to chronological age. Third, 50th and 97th percentile norms are given. A higher score indicates a better outcome. The maximum DQ score is 100; ≥85 is normal; 71-84 is mild to moderate delay and developmental delay is defined as DQ ≤70 (≤2SD). Median reliability index for motor and mental scales based on correlation between consecutive months is noted to be 0.88 for motor scales and 0.91 for mental scales.</description>

    <time_frame>6 (± 4 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Mean Difference in the motor score as measured by the Development Assessment Scale for Indian Infants (DASII) at 6 months. DASII is the Indian modification (done in 1970 and 1977) of the Bayley Scale of Infant Development (BSID) using Indian norms for 67 motor and 163 mental items of the BSID.

    <description>Mean Difference in the mental score as measured by the Development Assessment Scale for Indian Infants (DASII) at 6 months. DASII is the Indian modification (done in 1970 and 1977) of the Bayley Scale of Infant Development (BSID) using Indian norms for 67 motor and 163 mental items of the BSID.

    <measure>Mean difference in infant APGAR (Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity, Respiration) score at birth.</measure>
    <time_frame>At delivery</time_frame>
    <description>Mean difference in APGAR (Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity, Respiration) score between the Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and placebo group at birth. The APGAR score is a way to quickly measure and simply the health of an infant immediately after birth by adding the scores of the five criteria- Appearance (skin color), Pulse (heart rate), Grimace (reflex irritability/ response), Activity (muscle tone) and Respiration to come up with a single number. This test is done at 1, 5 minutes. A low score on the 1-minute test may show that the neonate requires medical attention but is not necessarily an indication that there will be long-term problem.</description>

             serious bleeding episode in the current pregnancy, and/ or physician referral); and/or
             diagnosed chronic degenerative disease(s) such as diagnosed heart disease, cancer,
             stroke or diabetes (as omega-3 could raise blood sugar and lower insulin production).
