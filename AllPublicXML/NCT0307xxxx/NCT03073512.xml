  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preterm birth still remains a major cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. The
      exact mechanism stimulating term and preterm births in humans is still unknown.
      Prostaglandins, by mediating cervical ripening and early stimulation of myometrial
      contractions, are likely to play a major role in the parturition process. Much of the unique
      fetal circulation is facilitated by the ductus arteriosus. Patency of the ductus arteriosus
      in utero is primarily maintained via prostaglandins which are highly expressed by smooth
      muscle cells located in the media of the ductus arteriosus. The primary objective of this
      study is to prospectively assess whether any changes in the fetal ductus arteriosus
      parameters exist at 32 weeks' gestation. The secondary objective is to investigate whether
      there is an association between the ductus arteriosus parameters and the time to delivery
      interval at 32 weeks' gestation.

      The rationale is to assess whether physiological responses that occur around the time of
      delivery, in both the mother and the fetus (elevated prostaglandins level), can be quantified
      using ultrasound of the fetal ductus arteriosus.

      Whether or not the ductus arteriosus plays an active physiological role in the initiation of
      parturition is unknown. Since prostaglandins are physiologically highly expressed within the
      fetal ductus arteriosus and also linked to some critical steps throughout parturition, it is
      hypothesized that structural and doppler flow pattern variations of the ductus arteriosus
      exist in the period surrounding the birth. These changes might occur before or after the
      intrinsic rise of prostaglandins and could be quantified using prenatal ultrasound of the
      fetal ductus arteriosus.

      Identifying new physiological based variables that can assist in predicting the onset of
      labour, especially surrounding preterm birth, as the one suggested in the current study, is
      thus of great importance and may provide invaluable information into the overall future care
      and decision making during pregnancy, especially around the time of delivery. It may assist
      in creating future recommendations for pregnant women and improved healthcare standards
      during the delivery process.
