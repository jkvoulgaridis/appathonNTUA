      Multicenter, multinational, randomized, 3-arm, double-blind, phase II clinical study with

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, multinational, randomized, 3-arm, double-blind, phase II clinical
      study with 2400mg mesalamine (5-ASA), 1200mg mesalamine (5-ASA) or placebo in LS patients for
      a 2-year treatment. 540 tumor free carriers of a known genetic mutation in a major MMR gene
      (including patients in which the polyps are endoscopically removed) will be randomized 1:1:1
      (180 each) to receive 2400mg mesalamine, 1200mg mesalamine or placebo. Patients will be
      identified through local or national registries and through collaboration with sites. Tumor
      free patients, assessed by white light high resolution colonoscopy, will be randomized to the
      study. A serum and stool sample will be taken to identify for mesalamine compliance and
      potential biomarkers. Biopsies of the normal tissue of ascending colon and rectum will be
      taken at the first and the last colonoscopy.

      The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of regular treatment with mesalamine
      (5-ASA) on the occurrence of any colorectal neoplasia, tumor multiplicity (the number of
      detected adenomas/carcinomas) and tumor progression in LS patients.

      A 50% reduction of the occurrence of colorectal neoplasia in mesalamine-treated patients is
      expected. Tumor multiplicity and tumor progression (severity of the neoplastic lesions) will
      be investigated.

    <time_frame>End of treatment at 24 months +/- 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>• Occurrence of any colorectal neoplasia (both benign and malignant tumors) between groups is described by absolute frequencies and percentages with 95 % confidence intervals. A logistic regression is used to assess differences between active treatment and placebo for the occurrence of any colorectal neoplasia, adjusted for country and history of cancer before randomization. Treatment effects are assessed by odds-ratios and corresponding 95 % confidence intervals.</description>

  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tumor multiplicity</measure>
    <time_frame>End of treatment at 24 months +/- 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The number of colorectal neoplasia (both benign and malignant tumors) per patient will be tested between groups by an analysis of variance, adjusting for country and history of cancer before randomization. In case of non-normally distributed residuals a suitable transformation to achieve normal distribution is considered.
It will be tested whether 5-ASA (low- and high-dose together) reduces the number of any colorectal neoplasia (both benign and malignant tumors; tumor multiplicity) compared to placebo in LS patients at the end of treatment and end of study. Advanced adenomas are defined by a diameter above 1 cm villous or tubulo-villous histology or high grade dysplasia.
All tests are two-sided and a significance level of 5 % is used.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tumor progress</measure>
    <time_frame>End of treatment at 24 months +/- 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The tumor progress in 4 ordered stages will be tested between groups by a chi-square trend test stratified for country and history of cancer before randomization and modelled by an ordinal logistic regression.
It will be tested whether 5-ASA (low- and high-dose together) reduces tumor progression (compared 4 ordinal stages: no colorectal neoplasia / non-advanced adenoma / advanced adenoma / carcinoma) compared to placebo in LS patients at the end of treatment and end of study. Advanced adenomas are defined by a diameter above 1 cm villous or tubulo-villous histology or high grade dysplasia.
All tests are two-sided and a significance level of 5 % is used.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment effects</measure>
    <time_frame>End of treatment at 24 months +/- 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The dependence of treatment effects on history of colorectal cancer, sex and patients age (&lt;45 years and ≥45 years) will be assessed by modelling interactions between these factors and treatment in the corresponding regression models.
If differences between 5-ASA (low- and high-dose together) effects and placebo effects on the occurrence of colorectal neoplasia, tumor multiplicity or tumor progression depend on the history of colorectal cancer, sex and patients age (LS patients below 45 years of age or 45 years of age and older) will be investigated.
All tests are two-sided and a significance level of 5 % is used.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>High and low dose ASA</measure>
    <time_frame>End of treatment at 24 months +/- 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Differences between high and low dose ASA for the occurrence of colorectal neoplasia, tumor multiplicity and tumor progression will be analysed by the same methods as for the comparison between ASA and placebo to investigate differences between low and high dose 5-ASA with respect to the occurrence of colorectal neoplasia, to tumor multiplicity and tumor progression.
All tests are two-sided and a significance level of 5 % is used.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Significant findings &amp; illnesses - adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>End of treatment at 24 months +/- 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Safety data are described and compared between groups in an exploratory manner to determine the safety concerning 5-ASA in LS patient. Therefore significant findings/illnesses, reported after the start of the study and which meet the definition of an AE, will be recorded in the CRF.
Intention to treat set: This analysis set includes subjects who were randomized (and received at least one dose study drug). This analysis set will be chosen for safety assessment.
All tests are two-sided and a significance level of 5 % is used.</description>
