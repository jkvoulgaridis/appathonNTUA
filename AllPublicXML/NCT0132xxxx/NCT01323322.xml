      The Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span study (HANDLS) is a
      multidisciplinary, community-based, prospective longitudinal epidemiologic study examining
      the influences of race and socioeconomic status (SES) on the development of age-related
      health disparities among socioeconomically diverse African Americans and whites in Baltimore.
      This study investigates whether health disparities develop or persist due to differences in
      SES, differences in race, or their interaction. This study is unique because it will assess
      over a 20-year period physical parameters as well as evaluate genetic, biologic, demographic,
      and psychosocial parameters of African American and white participants in higher and lower
      SES. It also employs novel research tools, mobile medical research vehicles, in hopes of
      improving participation rates and retention among non-traditional research participants. The
      domains of the HANDLS study include: nutrition, cognition, biologic biomarkers, body
      composition and bone quality, physical function and performance, sociodemographics,
      psychosocial, neighborhood environment and cardiovascular disease. Utilizing data from these
      study domains will facilitate understand the driving factors behind persistent black-white
      health disparities in overall longevity, cardiovascular disease, and cognitive decline.

      HANDLS recruited a fixed cohort as an area probability sample of Baltimore City from August
      2004 through November 2009 as Wave 1. HANDLS Wave 2 entitled The Association of Personality
      and Socioeconomic status with Health Status - An Interim Follow-up Study began in June 2006
      under a separate protocol. It was designed as a follow-up telephone interview approximately
      18 months after the initial examination (Wave 1) was complete. Wave 2 provided interim
      contact with study participants, and important interim information regarding their health.
      Now completed, waves 3 and 4 were the first and second follow-up examinations and
      participants second and third visit to our mobile Medical Research Vehicles (MRVs). The
      current protocol outlines Wave 5, the third follow-up examination and participants fourth
      visit to our mobile Medical Research Vehicles (MRVs). Planned as a follow-up after 3-4 years,
      Wave 5 consists of health examinations, questionnaires, a telephone dietary-recall interview,
      sensory assessments (visual, olfactory), health literacy assessment, skin color analysis,
      renal function assessments, environmental assessments and structural MRIs.

        The baseline HANDLS sample consists of 3720 community - dwelling African American and white
        adults aged 30-64. Participants were drawn from 13 neighborhoods (groups of contiguous
        census tracts) in Baltimore City, sampling represently across a wide range of socioeconomic
        and income circumstances.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Verified HANDLS participants (age 30-64 at baseline recruitment)

          -  Able to give informed consent (or has a legal designee)

          -  Must have valid picture identification

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Pregnancy (for the MRV examination visit and the HANDLS Scan sub-study a urine
             pregnancy test is performed with women of child bearing potential during the medical
             screening prior to any testing or procedures. If positive, participant will not be
             eligible for the MRV examination visit until they are no longer pregnant. Participants
             with a positive pregnancy test will be invited to return for the MRV examination visit
             and/or the HANDLS Scan once pregnancy is resolved (pregnancy testing is repeated at
             each encounter, if indicated). The Diabetes sub-study home visit protocol does not
             pose increased risk so pregnancy status is not required or obtained)
