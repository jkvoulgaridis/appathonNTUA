  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the persistence of anti-poliovirus antibodies in toddlers aged 18
      months who were primed with oral polio vaccine (OPV) or inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) in
      the primary study. The study will also assess the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of a
      booster dose of IPV in subjects primed with three doses of IPV.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All subjects will also receive a booster dose of GSK Biologicals' DTPa/Hib vaccine
      (Infanrix+Hib) at Day 0. This vaccine will be provided as part of the local standard of care
      and will not be associated with any study endpoint.

    <measure>Number of Subjects With Any and Grade 3 Solicited Local Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 4-days (Days 0-3) post Poliorix™ booster vaccination.</time_frame>
    <description>Solicited local symptoms assessed were pain, redness and swelling. Any = occurrence of the symptom regardless of intensity grade. Grade 3 pain = Cry when limb was moved/spontaneously painful. Grade 3 redness/swelling = redness/swelling spreading beyond 30 millimeters (mm) of injection site. This outcome measure concerns subjects in the Poliorix Group only.</description>

    <measure>Number of Subjects With Any, Grade 3 and Related Solicited General Symptoms.</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 4-days (Days 0-3) post Poliorix™ booster vaccination.</time_frame>
    <description>Solicited general symptoms assessed include drowsiness, irritability, loss of appetite and fever [defined as axillary temperature ≥ 37.1 degrees Celsius (°C)]. Any = occurence of any general symptom regardless of their intensity grade or relationship to study vaccine. Grade 3 drowsiness = drowsiness that prevented normal activities. Grade 3 fever = fever (axillary temperature) &gt;39.0°C. Grade 3 irritability = crying that could not be comforted/ prevented normal activity. Grade 3 loss of appetite = not eating at all. Related = symptom assessed by the investigator as causally related to the vaccination. This outcome measure concerns subjects in the Poliorix Group only.</description>

    <time_frame>Within the 31-day (Days 0-30) follow-up period after the Poliorix™ booster vaccination.</time_frame>
    <description>An unsolicited AE covers any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. Any was defined as an adverse event (AE) reported in addition to those solicited during the clinical study. Any solicited symptom with onset outside the specified period of follow-up for solicited symptoms was reported as an unsolicited adverse event. This outcome measure concerns subjects in the Poliorix Group only.</description>

        <description>Solicited general symptoms assessed include drowsiness, irritability, loss of appetite and fever [defined as axillary temperature ≥ 37.1 degrees Celsius (°C)]. Any = occurence of any general symptom regardless of their intensity grade or relationship to study vaccine. Grade 3 drowsiness = drowsiness that prevented normal activities. Grade 3 fever = fever (axillary temperature) &gt;39.0°C. Grade 3 irritability = crying that could not be comforted/ prevented normal activity. Grade 3 loss of appetite = not eating at all. Related = symptom assessed by the investigator as causally related to the vaccination. This outcome measure concerns subjects in the Poliorix Group only.</description>
