  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies provide important information on the structure and
      function of various body systems, including the brain, muscles, joints, heart, and blood
      vessels. Scientific applications of MRI scans often use techniques that need to be modified
      or refined before they are used in clinical studies. To develop and modify these techniques
      for the new Philips 3T Achieva whole-body MRI scanner, researchers are interested in
      conducting trial MRI scans on healthy individuals and individuals with conditions that
      require imaging studies.

      Objectives:

      - To conduct preliminary trials of the 3T MRI facility to develop and refine MRI scanning
      procedures.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who are able to have magnetic resonance imaging.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a full medical history and physical examination, as
           well as blood and urine tests.

        -  Participants will have an MRI scan using the 3T scanner. Some scans may require the use
           of a contrast agent or radiotracer, which is a small amount of radioactive substance
           that will be injected before the start of the scan. Some participants may be asked to
           perform tasks of thinking and movement while in the scanner, in order to test the
           procedures required for a functional MRI scan.

        -  No treatment will be provided as part of this protocol.

      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies yield important information on the structure and
      function of various body systems including the brain, muscles, joints, heart, blood vessels
      and other body areas. Unlike clinical MRI imaging, scientific applications often utilize
      techniques that either requires de-novo development or modification of existing research or
      commercially available protocols before implementation in clinical studies. The proposed
      protocol is intended to allow MRI scanning on human subjects for the development and
      refinement of MRI scanning procedures before implementation in larger scale clinical National
      Institute on Aging (NIA) research studies. We will evaluate a variety of MRI pulse sequences
      on normal volunteers and individuals with a variety of medical conditions to determine
      optimal protocols for use in normal volunteers and patient populations. In addition,
      participants can be recruited and scanned to provide additional data for already approved NIA
      studies.
