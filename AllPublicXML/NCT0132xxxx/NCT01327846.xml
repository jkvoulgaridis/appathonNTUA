    <textblock>
      Main Study (CACZ885M2301): The purpose of the pivotal phase of this trial was to test the
      hypothesis that canakinumab treatment of patients with myocardial infarction (MI) at least
      one month prior to study entry and elevated hsCRP could prevent recurrent cardiovascular
      events.

      The purpose of the extension phase of the main study is to collect additional long-term
      safety data on continued exposure to canakinumab in patients who participated in the pivotal
      phase.

      Sub-study 1 (CACZ885M2301S1): The purpose of this sub-study was to evaluate the effect of
      quarterly subcutaneous canakinumab treatment for 24 months comparted with placebo on the
      carotid plaque burden measured by integrated vascular MRI in patients enrolled in the
      CACZ885M2301 study (CANTOS).

      Sub-study 2 (CACZ885M2301S2): The purpose of this CANTOS sub-study was to determine whether,
      in patients with type 2 diabetes participating in the CANTOS main study, canakinumab compared
      to placebo, on top of standard of care could increase insulin secretion and insulin
      sensitivity.

      Sub-study 1 and 2 were terminated prior to data collection from subjects. However, there is
      an ongoing extension trial where patients are receiving open-drug label.
