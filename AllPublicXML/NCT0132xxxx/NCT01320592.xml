    <textblock>
      This study is a phase I, single arm, open-label trial of PD0332991 in combination with
      Paclitaxel in patients with Rb-expressing metastatic breast cancer. Up to 20 patients are
      anticipated to be enrolled to reach the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of PD0332991 in
      combination with Paclitaxel. Once the MTD is established, an additional expanded cohort of 10
      patients will be enrolled at that dose to establish the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D),
      obtain additional safety data and perform exploratory biomarker studies.

      This study is a phase I, single arm, open-label trial of PD0332991 in combination with
      paclitaxel in patients with Rb-expressing metastatic breast cancer. Patients will be treated
      as shown in the schema below. Up to 20 patients are anticipated to be enrolled to reach the
      MTD of PD0332991 in combination with Paclitaxel. Once the MTD is established, an additional
      expanded cohort of 10 patients will be enrolled at that dose to establish the RP2D, obtain
      additional safety data and perform exploratory biomarker studies. The primary endpoint will
      be assessed after one cycle of therapy. Patients will remain on study until dose limiting
      toxicity, disease progression or physician/patient discretion. Safety assessment will
      continue for the duration of patient participation.

             Any ER, PR or Her2 status is allowed.

          -  Tumor must express Retinoblastoma (Rb) protein, as defined as any measureable staining
             by immunohistochemistry

          -  Male or female and &gt; 18 years of age on the day of signing informed consent.

          -  Patient must have received &lt; prior cytotoxic regimens for metastatic breast cancer.
             This does not include cytoxic regimens used in the adjuvant setting.

          -  Performance status of 0-1 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Scale
             and life expectancy &gt; 3 months.

          -  patient on the dose-escalation portion of the trial must have evaluable disease,
             defined as either measurable (by RECIST) or non-measurable disease (e.g. bone mets,
             pleural effusion or lymphangitic spread). Measurable disease is required for patients
             in the expanded RP2D cohort.

          -  The subject must have adequate organ function, defined as follows:

        Bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x upper normal limit or calculated creatinine clearance &gt; 60 mL/min, and
        for subjects without liver metastases: alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate
        aminotransferase (AST) &lt; 2.5 x upper normal limit

          -  For subjects without extensive bone metastases: alkaline phosphatase levels &lt; 2.5 x
             upper normal limit .

          -  For subjects with extensive bone metastases: alkaline phosphatase levels &lt; 5 x upper
             normal limit .
