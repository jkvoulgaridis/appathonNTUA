  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted in two stages. In the diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (DTP)
      booster phase, subjects will receive a booster dose of Tritanrix-HepB/Hib-MenAC or
      Tritanrix-HepB/Hiberix (active control) at 15 to 18 or 24 months in a single-blind manner so
      that the subjects' parents will not know which vaccine was administered to their child. In
      the Mencevax ACWY phase at 24-30 months, a dose of Mencevax ACWY will be given in an open
      manner to only those subjects who received less than 4 doses of Tritanrix-HepB/Hib-MenAC. No
      blood samples will be taken in this safety study.

      Subjects previously primed with Tritanrix-HepB/Hib-MenAC will receive
      Tritanrix-HepB/Hib-MenAC or Tritanrix-HepB/Hiberix vaccine (at 15-18/24 m), respectively,
      without or with Mencevax ACWY vaccine at 24 to 30 months of age. Subjects previously primed
      with Tritanrix-HepB/Hiberix will receive Tritanrix-HepB/Hib-MenAC or Tritanrix-HepB/Hiberix
      vaccine (at 15-18/24 m) with Mencevax ACWY vaccine at 24 to 30 months of age.

    <time_frame>During the 4-day (Day 0-3) follow-up period after booster vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>Among solicited general symptoms fever [defined as rectal temperature equal to or above (≥) 38 degrees Celsius (°C )] was assessed, post vaccination. Grade 3 fever = fever &gt; 39.0 °C.</description>

    <measure>Number of Subjects With Any, Grade 3 and Related Solicited General Symptoms, Other Than Fever &gt; 39.0°C</measure>
    <time_frame>During the 4-day (Day 0-3) follow-up period after vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed solicited general symptoms were drowsiness, irritability, loss of appetite and fever [defined as axillary temperature equal to or above 38 degrees Celsius (°C)]. Any = occurrence of the symptom regardless of intensity grade. Grade 3 symptom = symptom that prevented normal activity. Related = symptom assessed by the investigator as related to the vaccination.</description>

    <measure>Number of Subjects With Any and Grade 3 Solicited Local Symptoms.</measure>
    <time_frame>During the 4-day (Day 0-3) follow-up period after booster vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed solicited local symptoms were pain, redness and swelling. Any = occurrence of the symptom regardless of intensity grade. Grade 3 pain = pain that prevented normal activity. Grade 3 redness/swelling = redness/swelling spreading beyond 30 millimeters (mm) of injection site.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Subjects With Any Unsolicited Adverse Events (AEs).</measure>
    <time_frame>During the 31-day (Day 0-30) following booster vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>An unsolicited AE covers any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product and reported in addition to those solicited during the clinical study and any solicited symptom with onset outside the specified period of follow-up for solicited symptoms. Any was defined as the occurrence of any unsolicited AE regardless of intensity grade or relation to vaccination.</description>

    <measure>Number of Subjects With Serious Adverse Events (SAEs).</measure>
    <time_frame>From 15 to 18 months or 15 to 24 months of age and up to 25 to 31 months of age post vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>Serious adverse events (SAEs) assessed include medical occurrences that result in death, are life threatening, require hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization or result in disability/incapacity.</description>
