      The purpose of this study is to determine if Raptiva will have beneficial effects in the
      treatment of patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atopic dermatitis is a common, highly pruritic, inflammatory skin disease that affects up to
      17% of school-aged children. Most cases of childhood atopic dermatitis improve or resolve by
      adulthood. However, the majority of patients retain some features of atopic dermatitis and
      some continue to have severe disease that continues to adulthood. Moderate to severe atopic
      dermatitis cannot be adeuately controlled with topical agents. Consequently many patients are
      treated with systemic corticosteroids, cyclosporine, azathioprine, methotrexate, and other
      immunosuppressants that carry the risk of severe atopic dermatitis is greatly needed. The
      chronic use of current immunosuppressive agents is limited by cumulative end-organ
      toxicities. We propose inhibition of T cell trafficking to the skin with Raptiva will have
      beneficial effects in the treatment of patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Ability to provide written informed consent and comply with study assessments for the
             full duration of the study

          -  If a female of child bearing potential, a negative pregnancy test and commitment to
             birth control for the duration of the study are necessary.

          -  Diagnosis of atopic dermatitis using the Hanifin-Rajka criteria

             methotrexate, ultraviolet light or other immunosuppressant. Specifically, patients are
             considered candidates for systemic therapy when their disease is not adequately
             controlled using topical therapies or side-effects prevent the further safe use of
             topical therapies.
