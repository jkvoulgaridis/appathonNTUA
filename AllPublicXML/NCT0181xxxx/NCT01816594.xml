    <textblock>
      This randomized, parallel cohort, two stage, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluated
      the oral PI3K inhibitor BKM120 in combination with trastuzumab and paclitaxel in
      HER2-positive, PIK3CA wild-type and PIK3CA mutant primary breast cancer prior to surgery
      (neo-adjuvant setting).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      NeoPHOEBE evaluated the efficacy (as defined by pCR) of BKM120 (an oral PI3K inhibitor) in
      combination with trastuzumab and paclitaxel in a randomized, placebo-controlled, neo-adjuvant
      study in women diagnosed with primary breast cancer &gt;1.5 cm (by US or MRI) with centrally
      confirmed HER2 overexpression or amplification, who have not previously undergone treatment
      for invasive breast cancer.

      Prior to the initiation of paclitaxel, there was a 6-week &quot;biologic window&quot; with trastuzumab
      plus BKM120 or placebo only. The study was conducted separately in two cohorts (PIK3CA
      mutated and PI3K3CA wild-type) using a two-stage approach. Within each cohort patients were
      randomized into one of the following treatment arms:

      Arm 1: BKM120 plus trastuzumab for 6 weeks followed by BKM120 and trastuzumab plus weekly
      paclitaxel for an additional 12 weeks.

      Arm 2: BKM120 placebo plus trastuzumab for 6 weeks followed by BKM120 placebo plus
      trastuzumab plus weekly paclitaxel for an additional 12 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients were to have undergone definitive surgery.

    <description>Rate of pCR (as defined by NSABP criteria - absence of invasive disease in the breast [ypT0]) is the number of of participants with pathological complete response (pCR) at the time of surgery. Participants were to be considered in pCR if there was no invasive cancer in the breast or only non-invasive in situ cancer in the breast specimen. NSABP guidelines do not take into account the histological nodal status to define the pCR.</description>

CR: Complete disappearance of all tumor signs in the breast as assessed by ultrasound or MRI. The response of the axillary nodes was not to be considered. PR: Reduction in the product of the two largest perpendicular diameters of the primary tumor size by 50% or more assessed by ultrasound or MRI.
