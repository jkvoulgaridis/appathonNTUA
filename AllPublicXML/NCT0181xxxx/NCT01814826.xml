    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and to assess the
      safety and tolerability of MLN4924 (pevonedistat) in combination with azacitidine in
      treatment naive participants with AML who were 60 years of age or older.

    <ipd_description>Takeda makes patient-level, de-identified data sets and associated documents available for all interventional studies after applicable marketing approvals and commercial availability have been received (or program is completely terminated), an opportunity for the primary publication of the research and final report development has been allowed, and other criteria have been met as set forth in Takeda's Data Sharing Policy (see www.TakedaClinicalTrials.com for details). To obtain access, researchers must submit a legitimate academic research proposal for adjudication by an independent review panel, who will review the scientific merit of the research and the requestor's qualifications and conflict of interest that can result in potential bias. Once approved, qualified researchers who sign a data sharing agreement are provided access to these data in a secure research environment.</ipd_description>

        <title>Best Overall Response Rate</title>
        <description>Disease response was based on best overall response as determined by an investigator based on revised recommendations of the International Working Group (IWG) Response Criteria for AML. Best overall response rate was defined as percentage of participants who had complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or CR/remission with incomplete blood count recovery (Cri). CR: free of leukemia-related symptoms, absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than (&gt;)1.0*10^9 per liter (/L), platelet count greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 100*10^9/L, normal bone marrow with &lt;5 percent (%) blasts and no Auer rods. CRi: As per CR but with residual thrombocytopenia (platelet count &lt;100*10^9/L) or residual neutropenia (ANC &lt;1.0*10^9/L). PR: &gt;=50% decrease bone marrow blasts to 5 to 25% abnormal cells, or CR with less than or equal to (&lt;=) 5% blasts if Auer rods present.</description>
        <time_frame>Cycle(C)1Day(D)22 and at C2 between D20 and 28 and at C4 and beyond C4 after completion of every 3rd C between D15 and 28 up to 30 days after last dose of study drug/before start of subsequent antineoplastic therapy, if that occurred sooner(up to 5 years)</time_frame>
        <population>The response-evaluable population was defined as all participants who received at least 1 dose of study drug, had measurable disease at baseline, and had at least 1 post baseline disease assessment. Participants who were evaluable at a particular time point for this outcome measure were included in the assessment.</population>
