  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study about an experimental (investigational) oral Shigella sonnei -
      Walter Reed S. sonnei (WRSS1). WRSS1 is a live vaccine that is being made to prevent disease
      from Shigella, which causes bloody, watery diarrhea. Infants and children living in
      developing countries experience the greatest consequences of this disease. The purpose of
      this study is to find a dose of the vaccine that is safe, tolerable, and develops an immune
      response. About 39 healthy adults, ages 18-39, and 48 healthy children, ages 5-9, will
      participate in this study. Once the vaccine is proven safe and tolerable in adults, then it
      will be tested in the children. This study will require volunteers to stay in the research
      facility for several nights for the first dose; they will not be required to stay overnight
      for the second and third doses. Participants will be assigned to receive 1 of 3 vaccine dose
      levels by mouth. Study procedures include: stool samples, blood samples and documenting side
      effects. Participants will be involved in study related procedures for about 8 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single site, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation,
      age-descending study that will start testing the vaccine in healthy adults and move
      subsequently into school-age children. The study is designed as 2 parts, each part comprising
      3 cohorts. The cohort receiving the lowest dose in Parts A and B will receive only one
      administration of vaccine or placebo; the subsequent two higher dose cohorts in Parts A and B
      will receive three administrations of vaccine or placebo. In each cohort, the first dose and
      immediate safety evaluation will be conducted at the International Centre for Diarrhoeal
      Disease Research (icddr,b) Inpatient Unit, where the participants will be admitted for
      observation for 72 hours. Follow-up visits for participants in A1 and B1 will take place on
      an outpatient basis at the Mirpur, Bangladesh (Mirpur) Field Office. Second and third
      vaccinations within A2, A3, B2, and B3 cohorts and all follow-up visits will take place on an
      outpatient basis at the Mirpur Field Office. Before enrolling participants in subsequent
      cohorts to receive a higher vaccine dose, or to move to the lower age group, the safety data
      from the previous cohort(s) (through Study Day 7) will be evaluated and reviewed by the
      Internal Protocol Safety Team (IPST) comprised of the study physician, the Medical Monitor
      from GVK Biosciences (GVK), the principal investigator, and the Medical Monitor from PATH
      Vaccine Solutions (PVS). Upon completion of the last adult cohort, the Data Safety Monitoring
      Board (DSMB -an advisory body to the Ethical Review Committee) will convene to review the
      cumulative safety data and IPST recommendation, and determine whether to proceed to Part B
      (children). Adverse events (AE)s will be graded according to standardized criteria. The
      immunogenicity outcome measures of interest include serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) and
      immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies by Antibodies in Lymphocyte Supernatant (ALS) assay against
      S. sonnei2a lipopolysaccharide (LPS), shedding profile of WRSS1, and vaccine-specific mucosal
      IgA responses.

      The proposed study builds upon successful preliminary observations with this vaccine in the
      US, Israel and Thailand. While secondary objectives include studying the immunogenicity of
      the WRSS1 vaccine, the primary goal of the current trial is to establish a clear safety
      profile for the WRSS1 vaccine in adults and children 5-9 years old.The primary objective of
      the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the vaccine; the secondary objective
      is to evaluate vaccine immunogenicity.

        <description>Adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in humans, whether or not considered drug related, that occurs during the conduct of a clinical trial. A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) , including serious suspected adverse reaction or serious adverse reaction as determined by the Investigator or the sponsor, was any event that results in any of the following outcomes: Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization , life-threatening AE that in the opinion of the investigator or sponsor put the participant at immediate risk of death, persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption, congenital abnormality or birth defect, a medically important event that may have jeopardized the participant or may have required intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed or death. Causality of the AE/SAE to the study drug was assessed by the Investigator as reasonable possibility that the study product caused the reported event.</description>

        <description>The mucosal immune response to WRSS1 was evaluated by assessing specific immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibody responses to S. sonnei 2a LPS (lipopolysaccharide) and a novel composition comprising invasin proteins and LPS from gram-negative bacteria (Invaplex) using the 'antibodies in lymphocyte supernatant' (ALS) assay on culture supernatants of cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells from different study days before and after vaccination to determine LPS- and Invaplex-specific IgA responses from circulating lymphocytes. Proportion of participants with a &gt;= 4-fold increase in antibody titer beyond baseline (mean + 3 standard deviation) was determined.

Proportion of participants with a &gt;= 4-fold increase in antibody titer beyond baseline (mean + 3 standard deviation) was determined. For those with a zero titer at baseline, fold-rise was defined as the follow-up titer.</description>
          <population>The overall number of participants analyzed (N) were those who received at least one study vaccination and for whom research blood was collected and analyzed. Adult Cohort A1 and Child Cohort B1 received a single dose of study vaccine and had research blood collected only on Day 7.</population>

        <title>Number and Percentage of Child Participants With a 4-fold Rise From Baseline in IgM Antibodies in ALS: LPS</title>
        <description>The mucosal immune response to WRSS1 was evaluated by assessing specific IgM (immunoglobulin M) antibody responses to S. sonnei 2a LPS (lipopolysaccharide) using the 'antibodies in lymphocyte supernatant' (ALS) assay on culture supernatants of cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells from different study days before and after vaccination to determine LPS- specific IgM responses from circulating lymphocytes. Proportion of children with a &gt;= 4-fold increase in antibody titer beyond baseline (mean + 3 standard deviation) was determined. For those with a zero titer at baseline, fold-rise was defined as the follow-up titer.</description>

        <description>The systemic immune response to WRSS1 was evaluated by assessing the IgA (immunoglobulin A) antibody responses to S. sonnei 2a LPS (lipopolysaccharide) and Invaplex in serum samples at Days -1, 7, 28, 35, 56, 63 and 84. Serotype-speciﬁc LPS from the Walter Reed Army Institute was used to coat the ELISA plates. A ≥4-fold rise in serum antibody titers was considered signiﬁcant. Fold rise is the ratio of follow-up titer/baseline titer. For those with a zero titer at baseline, fold-rise was defined as the follow-up titer.</description>

        <title>Number and Percentage of Participants With a 4-fold Rise From Baseline in IgA Antibodies in Serum</title>
        <description>The systemic immune response to WRSS1 was evaluated by assessing the IgA (immunoglobulin A) antibody responses to S. sonnei 2a LPS (lipopolysaccharide) and Invaplex in serum samples at Days -1, 7, 28, 35, 56, 63 and 84. Serotype-speciﬁc LPS from the Walter Reed Army Institute was used to coat the ELISA plates. A ≥4-fold rise in serum antibody titers was considered signiﬁcant. Fold rise is the ratio of follow-up titer/baseline titer. For those with a zero titer at baseline, fold-rise was defined as the follow-up titer.</description>

        <title>Number and Percentage of Participants With a 4-fold Rise From Baseline in IgA Antibodies in Serum</title>
        <description>The systemic immune response to WRSS1 was evaluated by assessing the IgA (immunoglobulin A) antibody responses to S. sonnei 2a LPS (lipopolysaccharide) and Invaplex in serum samples at Days -1, 7, 28, 35, 56, 63 and 84. Serotype-speciﬁc LPS from the Walter Reed Army Institute was used to coat the ELISA plates. A ≥4-fold rise in serum antibody titers was considered signiﬁcant. Fold rise is the ratio of follow-up titer/baseline titer. For those with a zero titer at baseline, fold-rise was defined as the follow-up titer.</description>

        <title>Number and Percentage of Child Participants With a 4-fold Rise From Baseline in IgM Antibodies in Serum</title>
        <description>The systemic immune response to WRSS1 was evaluated by assessing the IgM (immunoglobulin M) antibody responses to S. sonnei 2a LPS (lipopolysaccharide) and Invaplex in serum samples at Days -1, 7, 28, 35, 56, 63 and 84. Serotype-speciﬁc LPS from the Walter Reed Army Institute was used to coat the ELISA plates. A ≥4-fold rise in serum antibody titers was considered signiﬁcant. Fold rise is the ratio of follow-up titer/baseline titer. For those with a zero titer at baseline, fold-rise was defined as the follow-up titer.</description>

        <title>Number and Percentage of Participants With a 4-fold Rise From Baseline in IgA Antibodies in Stool</title>
        <description>The mucosal immune response to the WRSS1 was evaluated by assessing Fecal IgA (immunoglobulin A) antibody responses in stool to S. sonnei 2a LPS (lipopolysaccharide) and Invaplex in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assays, at Days -1, 7, 28, 35, 56, 63, and 84. 4-fold increases of LPS and invaplex-specific IgA in stool beyond baseline mean + 3 SD (standard deviation) were determined. For those with a zero titer at baseline, fold-rise was defined as the follow-up titer. Pro-inflammatory cytokines (Interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β), Interleukin 8 (IL-8), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and Interferon gamma (IFN-γ)) were measured in stool extracts using commercially available ELISA kits.</description>

        <title>Number and Percentage of Participants With a 4-fold Rise From Baseline in IgA Antibodies in Stool</title>
        <description>The mucosal immune response to the WRSS1 was evaluated by assessing Fecal IgA (immunoglobulin A) antibody responses in stool to S. sonnei 2a LPS (lipopolysaccharide) and Invaplex in ELISA assays, at Days -1, 7, 28, 35, 56, 63, and 84. 4-fold increases of LPS and invaplex-specific IgA in stool beyond baseline mean + 3 SD (standard deviation) were determined. For those with a zero titer at baseline, fold-rise was defined as the follow-up titer. Pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-8, TNF-α and IFN-γ) were measured in stool extracts using commercially available ELISA kits.</description>

          <description>The mucosal immune response to the WRSS1 was evaluated by assessing Fecal IgA (immunoglobulin A) antibody responses in stool to S. sonnei 2a LPS (lipopolysaccharide) and Invaplex in ELISA assays, at Days -1, 7, 28, 35, 56, 63, and 84. 4-fold increases of LPS and invaplex-specific IgA in stool beyond baseline mean + 3 SD (standard deviation) were determined. For those with a zero titer at baseline, fold-rise was defined as the follow-up titer. Pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-8, TNF-α and IFN-γ) were measured in stool extracts using commercially available ELISA kits.</description>
          <population>The overall number of participants analyzed (N) were those who received at least one study vaccination and for whom stool was collected and analyzed. Adult Cohort A1 and Child Cohort B1 received a single dose of study vaccine and stool was collected only on Day 7 and Day 28.</population>

        <title>Number and Percentage of Participants With a 4-fold Rise From Baseline in Ratio of Specific IgA to Total IgA Antibodies in Stool</title>
        <description>Fecal antibody responses were defined as a four-fold rise for specific IgA (immunoglobulin A) or a four-fold rise for the ratio of specific over total IgA at any time point after immunization. Fecal antibody response to the WRSS1 was evaluated by assessing Fecal IgA antibody responses to S. sonnei 2a LPS (lipopolysaccharide) and Invaplex in ELISA assays at Days -1, 7, 28, 35, 56, 63, and 84 . For those participants with a zero titer at baseline fold-rise was defined as the follow-up titer.</description>

        <description>Prevalence and distribution of vaccine shedding was determined by quantitative culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The latter measured the mean relative abundance of microbiota by 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) gene sequence analysis of stool at baseline and post-vaccination days. PCR and stool results were reported as positive if a positive result was reported at any time during the testing period.</description>

      <desc>The investigator was responsible for accurate documentation of all AEs and SAEs. The Principal Investigator monitored all AEs until Day 168 (for cohort A1 and B1) and Day 224 (for cohort A2, A3, B2 B3 and B4). All SAEs were followed up until the event resolved or stabilized or the participant was lost to follow-up. Continued follow-up was at the discretion of the PI based on good clinical management or until the participant was referred to another institution for continued care.</desc>
