  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to investigate the effect of multiple doses of
      itraconazole on the pharmacokinetics of BI 1026706 given as single dose. The assessment of
      safety and tolerability of BI 1026706 is an additional objective of this trial. Furthermore,
      the pharmacokinetics of the metabolite BI 1072668 will be explored.

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Healthy male subjects according to the investigators assessment, based on a complete

             half-lives of the respective drug prior to administration of trial medication

          -  Within 10 days prior to administration of trial medication, use of drugs that might
             reasonably influence the results of the trial or that might prolong the QT/QTc
             interval

          -  Participation in another trial where an investigational drug has been administered
             within 60 days prior to planned administration of trial medication

             hypokalaemia, or family history of Long QT Syndrome)

          -  Subject is assessed as unsuitable for inclusion by the investigator, for instance,
             because the subject is considered not able to understand and comply with study
             requirements, or because he has a condition that would not allow safe participation in
             the study

        In addition, the following trial-specific exclusion criteria apply:

          -  Liver enzyme (ALT, AST, GGT) values above upper limit of normal at the screening
