      This randomized phase II trial studies how well nivolumab with or without ipilimumab or
      relatlimab before surgery works in treating patients with stage IIIB-IV melanoma that can be
      removed by surgery. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, ipilimumab,
      and relatlimab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with
      the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving nivolumab alone or in combination with
      ipilimumab or relatlimab before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of
      normal tissue that needs to be removed.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the pathologic response of nivolumab monotherapy and nivolumab and ipilimumab
      dual therapy administered in the neoadjuvant setting in patients with high-risk resectable
      melanoma. Pathologic response will be assessed by percent viable tumor cells, percent tumor
      necrosis, presence of fibrosis and melanoma proliferation as assessed by phosphohistone H3
      from baseline, to on-treatment and surgical specimens. (Arm A and Arm B) II. To assess the
      pathologic response rate of combination relatlimab with nivolumab in the neoadjuvant setting
      in patients with high-risk resectable Stage IIIB/C or oligometastatic Stage IV melanoma.
      Pathologic response will be assessed by percent viable tumor cells, percent tumor necrosis,
      presence of fibrosis and melanoma proliferation as assessed by phosphohistone H3 from
      baseline, to on- treatment and surgical specimens. (Arm C)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the immunologic response of neoadjuvant nivolumab monotherapy and neoadjuvant
      nivolumab and ipilimumab dual therapy in patients with high-risk resectable melanoma.
      Immunologic response will be determined by change in T cell infiltrate from baseline to
      on-treatment and surgical specimens in response to therapy. (Arm A and Arm B) II. To assess
      the objective response rate (ORR) of nivolumab monotherapy and nivolumab and ipilimumab dual
      therapy administered in the neoadjuvant setting as assessed by imaging (Response Evaluation
      Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] 1.1 criteria) in patients with high-risk resectable
      melanoma. (Arm A and Arm B) III. To assess the 12-month recurrence-free survival (RFS) and
      overall survival (OS) of patients with high-risk resectable melanoma treated with neoadjuvant
      nivolumab monotherapy or nivolumab and ipilimumab dual therapy followed by adjuvant
      nivolumab. (Arm A and Arm B) IV. To evaluate the safety of nivolumab monotherapy and dual
      ipilimumab and nivolumab in the neoadjuvant setting and peri-operatively as well as assess
      the safety of adjuvant nivolumab. (Arm A and Arm B) V. To evaluate safety and feasibility of
      relatlimab with nivolumab delivered in the neoadjuvant setting. (Arm C) VI. To assess the
      objective response rate (ORR) of relatlimab with nivolumab administered in the neoadjuvant
      setting as assessed by imaging (RECIST 1.1 criteria) in patients with high-risk resectable
      melanoma. (Arm C) VII. To assess the 12-month recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall
      survival (OS) of patients with high-risk resectable melanoma treated with neoadjuvant and
      adjuvant relatlimab with nivolumab. (Arm C) VIII. To evaluate immunologic and molecular
      mechanisms of response and resistance to relatlimab with nivolumab. (Arm C)

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Identification of immunologic and genomic markers correlating with clinical response or
      resistance to nivolumab monotherapy and ipilimumab with nivolumab combination therapy.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1, 15, 29, and
      43. Patients then undergo surgery on day 57. After surgery, patients receive nivolumab IV
      over 30 minutes every 2 weeks for 13 doses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. (CLOSED TO ENROLLMENT AS OF 10/3/2018)

      ARM B: Patients receive nivolumab IV over 1 hour and ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes on days 1,
      22, and 43. Patients then undergo surgery on day 57. After surgery, patients receive
      nivolumab IV over 30 minutes every 2 weeks for 13 doses in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity. (CLOSED TO ENROLLMENT AS OF 10/3/2018)

      ARM C: Patients receive nivolumab IV over 1 hour and relatlimab IV over 1 hour on days 1 and
      29. Patients then undergo surgery on day 57. After surgery, patients receive nivolumab IV
      over 1 hour and relatlimab IV over 1 hour every 4 weeks for 10 doses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 12 weeks for 2 years.

             estradiol &lt; 40 pg/mL [&lt; 140 pmol/L] is confirmatory); females on hormone replacement
             therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of
             the contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study;
             otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal status
             prior to study enrollment; for most forms of HRT, at least 2-4 weeks will elapse
             between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type
             and dosage of HRT; following confirmation of their post-menopausal status, they can
             resume use of HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive method

          -  A woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP) agrees to use method(s) of contraception;
             for a teratogenic study drug and/or when there is insufficient information to assess
             teratogenicity, a highly effective method(s) of contraception (failure rate of &lt; 1%
             per year) is required; the individual methods of contraception and duration should be
             determined in consultation with the investigator; WOCBP must follow instructions for
             birth control when the half-life of the study drug is &gt; 24 hours; contraception should
             be continued for a period of 30 days plus the time required for the study drug to
             undergo 5 half-lives; WOCBP should use an adequate method to avoid pregnancy for 24
             weeks (30 days plus the time required for study drug to undergo 5 half-lives) after
             the last dose of study drug; WOCBP must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test
             (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of human chorionic gonadotropin
             [HCG]) within 24 hours prior to the start of investigational product

          -  Women must not be breastfeeding

          -  Men who are sexually active with WOCBP must use any contraceptive method with a
             failure rate of &lt; 1% per year; the investigator shall review contraception methods and
             the time period that contraception must be followed; men who are sexually active with
             WOCBP must follow instructions for birth control when the half-life of the study drug
             is &gt; 24 hours, contraception should be continued for 90 days plus the time required
             for the study drug to undergo 5 half-lives; therefore, men who are sexually active
             with WOCBP must continue contraception for 33 weeks (90 days plus the time required
             for nivolumab and/or relatlimab to undergo 5 half-lives) after the last dose of study
             drug; in addition, male participants must be willing to refrain from sperm donation
             during this time; men who are sexually active with women who are not of childbearing
             potential (i.e., who are postmenopausal or surgically sterile and azoospermic men) do
             not require contraception
