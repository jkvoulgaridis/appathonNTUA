  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People infected with HIV often have cognitive dysfunction even if they are on antiretroviral
      therapy (ART) and have undetectable viral loads. The purpose of this study is to evaluate if
      the addition of maraviroc (MVC) and dolutegravir (DTG) (which are two antiretroviral [ARV]
      medications) to participants' existing ART regimens will improve participants' neurocognitive
      performance.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HIV-infected people often have cognitive dysfunction (HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder,
      or HAND), which includes asymptomatic neurocognitive impairment (ANI), mild neurocognitive
      disorder (MND), and HIV-associated dementia (HAD), even if they are on ART and have
      undetectable viral loads. In this study, researchers will evaluate the effectiveness of
      adding MVC and DTG to the current ART regimen of HIV-infected people with undetectable (&lt;50
      copies/mL) plasma HIV-1 RNA who have mild to moderate neurocognitive impairment and who have
      been on stable ART for at least 6 months prior to study entry. The purpose of this study is
      to evaluate if the addition of MVC and DTG to participants' existing ART regimens will
      improve participants' neurocognitive performance.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three arms. All participants will remain on
      their existing ART regimens; they will take their assigned study drugs in addition to their
      ART regimen. Participants in Arm A will receive placebo for MVC and placebo for DTG.
      Participants in Arm B will receive DTG and placebo for MVC. Participants in Arm C will
      receive MVC and DTG. Study visits will occur at entry and Weeks 2, 4, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96.
      Visits may include physical examinations, blood collection, neurocognitive testing, pregnancy
      testing, and questionnaires. Some participants may have an optional lumbar puncture
      procedure. Participants will have to return for refills of study drugs on Weeks 36, 60, and
      84.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  HIV-1 infection, documented by:

               -  a licensed rapid HIV test or HIV enzyme or chemiluminescence immunoassay (E/CIA)
                  test kit at any time prior to study entry and confirmed by a licensed Western
                  blot or a second antibody test by a method other than the initial rapid HIV
                  and/or E/CIA, or by HIV-1 antigen or plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load. NOTE: The term
                  &quot;licensed&quot; refers to a United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved
                  kit, which is required for all IND studies, or for sites located in countries
                  other than the United States, a kit that has been certified or licensed by an
                  oversight body within that country and validated internally. Non-US sites are
                  encouraged to use US FDA-approved methods for IND studies. WHO (World Health
                  Organization) and CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) guidelines
                  mandate that confirmation of the initial test result must use a test that is
                  different from the one used for the initial assessment. A reactive initial rapid
                  test should be confirmed by either another type of rapid assay or an E/CIA that
                  is based on a different antigen preparation and/or different test principle (eg,
                  indirect versus competitive), or a Western blot or a plasma HIV-1 RNA. OR

               -  Documentation of HIV diagnosis in the medical record by a healthcare provider.

          -  On current ART for at least 6 months prior to study entry with no interruption in
             treatment of greater than or equal to 7 consecutive days. Note: The following ART
             changes are allowed:

               -  Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) to tenofovir alafenamide fumarate
                  (TAF)/TAF-containing fixed-dose combination regimens

                  regimens

          -  No plans to change ART while on study. Note: The following planned ART changes are
             allowed:

               -  TDF to TAF/TAF-containing fixed-dose combination regimens

               -  RTV to COBI/COBI-containing fixed-dose combination regimens

             network-approved non-US laboratory that operates in accordance with Good Clinical
             Laboratory Practices (GCLP) and participates in appropriate external quality assurance
             programs.

             copies/mL (only one &quot;blip&quot;) in the past 6 months with a subsequent HIV-1 plasma RNA
             less than 50 copies/mL. NOTE: There should be no plasma HIV-1 RNA greater than 200
             copies/mL within the 6 months prior to study entry.

          -  HAND diagnosis (ANI, MND, or HAD) within 60 days prior to study entry. HAND is defined

                  an indinavir (IDV)- or atazanavir (ATV)-containing regimen at the time of
                  screening, total bilirubin less than or equal to 5 x ULN is acceptable.

               -  Creatinine clearance (CrCl) greater than or equal to 60 mL/min, either measured
                  or estimated by Cockcroft-Gault equation. NOTE: A calculator for estimating the

             to study entry

          -  Females of reproductive potential must agree not to participate in the conception
             process (ie, active attempt to become pregnant, in vitro fertilization), and if
             participating in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy, must use at least one
             reliable form of contraception. Female participants must use contraceptives while
             receiving study treatment and for 6 weeks after stopping study treatment. More
             information on this criterion is available in the protocol.
