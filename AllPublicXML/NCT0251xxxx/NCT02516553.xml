    <textblock>
      The aim of the phase Ia (dose escalation) part of this trial is to assess-&gt; determine the
      Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) using a continuous dosing schedule A, using an intermittent
      Schedule B (2 weeks on, one week off in 3-week cycles) and the MTD using an intermittent
      Schedule C (one week on followed by one week off treatment, repeated every two weeks in
      4-week cycles) in patients with solid tumours.

      In the phase Ib expansion part, the aim is to further evaluate the safety profile of BI
      894999 at the dose recommended by the data monitoring committee (DMC). Once the MTD has been
      determined for both schedules A and B in patients with solid tumours, the MTD will be
      determined as well in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), using the DMC
      recommended schedule for solid tumours

             unstable angina pectoris, myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to study entry,
