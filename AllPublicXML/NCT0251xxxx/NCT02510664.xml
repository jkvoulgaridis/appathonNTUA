  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a newly developed intervention is feasible
      and acceptable to adolescents with type 1 diabetes and their families and diabetes care
      providers, and to evaluate trends in whether the intervention impacts important diabetes
      outcomes. The intervention involves diabetes care providers discussing and reinforcing
      individuals' and families' diabetes management strengths during routine, outpatient diabetes
      care appointments.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to pilot test a newly developed strengths-based clinical
      intervention delivered by diabetes care providers in the context of routine ambulatory
      diabetes care, designed to promote resilience and support diabetes management among
      adolescents with type 1 diabetes and their families. The emphasis of the intervention is
      shifting the tone of clinical encounters for diabetes care to emphasize and reinforce youths'
      and families' current diabetes strengths and positive diabetes management behaviors. Youth
      with type 1 diabetes are seen routinely in clinic every 3-4 months, and this intervention
      will occur at two consecutive clinic visits. The intervention consists of (A) assessing youth
      and family diabetes strengths and adherence prior to each visit, and (B) training diabetes
      care providers to tailor their clinical encounters around reinforcing each patient and
      family's unique &quot;diabetes strengths profile&quot; generated from the strengths and adherence
      assessments.

      Outcome assessments are conducted at baseline (prior to the start of the intervention) and
      immediately following the conclusion of the intervention (approximately 6-8 months later).
      The primary outcome is feasibility and acceptability, measured by qualitative feedback from
      participants and providers, as well as quantification of recruitment and enrollment, provider
      adherence to intervention protocol, and time to completion. Secondary (exploratory) outcomes
      include diabetes regimen adherence, glycemic control, family conflict, diabetes burden,
      diabetes strengths, and satisfaction with the diabetes care provider relationship. Strengths
      and adherence assessments are also completed prior to the second clinic visit to generate the
      diabetes strengths profile.

    <description>Diabetes is typically diagnosed with an HbA1c of 6.5% or higher. At the time of this study, the American Diabetes Association generally recommended an HbA1c target of &lt;7.5% for individuals younger than 18 years (the specific target varies depending on the individual). The DCA 2000 HbA1c Analyzer (Siemens-Bayer) was used for point of care HbA1c analysis, it has an analytical measurement range for HbA1c of 2.5% to 14.0%. HbA1c values are collected via fingerstick and blood assay at routine diabetes care visits and values will be extracted from the medical record at each clinic visit during the study period.</description>

Diabetes care providers were trained to deliver the intervention and were asked to complete sets of questionnaires at various timepoints.
Diabetes Strengths Study: The intervention consists of: (A) assessing youth and family diabetes strengths and adherence prior to each visit, and (B) training diabetes care providers to tailor their clinical encounters around reinforcing each patient and family's unique &quot;diabetes strengths profile&quot; generated from the strengths and adherence assessments</description>

          <description>The Diabetes Strengths and Resilience measure is a self-report assessment of positive behaviors related to diabetes resilience for youth with type 1 diabetes, such as perceived competence to manage the demanding diabetes regimen, to adapt to the unpredictability of diabetes, and to seek help and support with diabetes challenges. The scale range from the minimum to maximum possible score is 0-48. A higher value on this scale represents a better outcome.</description>

          <title>Glycemic Control (HbA1c)</title>
          <description>The American Diabetes Association generally recommends an HbA1c target of &lt;7.5% for individuals younger than 18 years. This target varies depending on the individual, but a glycemic goal around this number reduces risk of long-term complications of diabetes. HbA1c values are collected via fingerstick and blood assay at routine diabetes care visits and values will be extracted from the medical record at each clinic visit during the study period.</description>

Diabetes Strengths Study: The intervention consists of: (A) assessing youth and family diabetes strengths and adherence prior to each visit, and (B) training diabetes care providers to tailor their clinical encounters around reinforcing each patient and family's unique &quot;diabetes strengths profile&quot; generated from the strengths and adherence assessments.</description>

The version appropriate to their child's current diabetes regimen (conventional insulin regimen, 24 items; flexible insulin regimen, 24 items) was administered. The scale ranges from 0-86, with a higher score representing a better outcome.</description>

At the time of this study, the American Diabetes Association generally recommended an HbA1c target of &lt;7.5% for individuals younger than 18 years (the specific target varies depending on the individual). The DCA 2000 HbA1c Analyzer (Siemens-Bayer) was used for point of care HbA1c analysis, it has an analytical measurement range for HbA1c of 2.5% to 14.0%. HbA1c values are collected via fingerstick and blood assay at routine diabetes care visits and values will be extracted from the medical record at each clinic visit during the study period.</description>
