    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 12 (every 28 days)
      intravitreal (IVT) injections of CLG561 as a monotherapy and in combination with LFG316 as
      compared to sham in subjects with geographic atrophy.

    <textblock>
      This study consists of an up-to 30-day screening period, an approximately 336-day treatment
      period, and a follow-up period consisting of two visits occurring 4 and 16 weeks after the
      last administered injection.

    <measure>Number of Subjects With a Serious Adverse Event That, in the Opinion of the Investigator, is Related to the Study Drug</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 421</time_frame>
    <description>A serious adverse event (SAE) was defined as any adverse experience that results in death, is life-threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or is an important medical event. All SAEs related to the study drug are reported. No statistical analysis was conducted.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Intraocular Pressure (IOP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1), Day 29, Day 57, Day 85, Day 113, Day 141, Day 169, Day 197, Day 225, Day 253, Day 281, Day 309</time_frame>
    <description>IOP (fluid pressure inside the eye) was measured by Goldmann applanation tonometry and reported in millimeters of mercury (mmHg). A higher IOP can be a greater risk for developing glaucoma or glaucoma progression (leading to optic nerve damage). Baseline is defined as the last measurement prior to first dose of treatment. A more negative change indicates a greater amount of improvement. One eye (study eye) contributed to the analysis. No statistical analysis was conducted.</description>

    <measure>Change in GA Lesion Size From Baseline to Day 337 as Measured by Fundus Autofluorescence (FAF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1), Day 337</time_frame>
    <description>Geographic atrophy, also known as atrophic age-related macular degeneration (AMD) or advanced dry AMD, is an advanced form of age-related macular degeneration that can result in the progressive and irreversible loss of retina which can lead to a loss of visual function over time. Geographic atrophy (GA) lesion size was assessed by a Central Reading Center (CRC) using FAF. Baseline is defined as the last measurement prior to first dose of treatment. One eye (study eye) contributed to the analysis.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Intraocular Pressure (IOP)</title>
        <description>IOP (fluid pressure inside the eye) was measured by Goldmann applanation tonometry and reported in millimeters of mercury (mmHg). A higher IOP can be a greater risk for developing glaucoma or glaucoma progression (leading to optic nerve damage). Baseline is defined as the last measurement prior to first dose of treatment. A more negative change indicates a greater amount of improvement. One eye (study eye) contributed to the analysis. No statistical analysis was conducted.</description>

          <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Intraocular Pressure (IOP)</title>
          <description>IOP (fluid pressure inside the eye) was measured by Goldmann applanation tonometry and reported in millimeters of mercury (mmHg). A higher IOP can be a greater risk for developing glaucoma or glaucoma progression (leading to optic nerve damage). Baseline is defined as the last measurement prior to first dose of treatment. A more negative change indicates a greater amount of improvement. One eye (study eye) contributed to the analysis. No statistical analysis was conducted.</description>

        <title>Change in GA Lesion Size From Baseline to Day 337 as Measured by Fundus Autofluorescence (FAF)</title>
        <description>Geographic atrophy, also known as atrophic age-related macular degeneration (AMD) or advanced dry AMD, is an advanced form of age-related macular degeneration that can result in the progressive and irreversible loss of retina which can lead to a loss of visual function over time. Geographic atrophy (GA) lesion size was assessed by a Central Reading Center (CRC) using FAF. Baseline is defined as the last measurement prior to first dose of treatment. One eye (study eye) contributed to the analysis.</description>

        <description>Geographic atrophy, also known as atrophic age-related macular degeneration (AMD) or advanced dry AMD, is an advanced form of age-related macular degeneration that can result in the progressive and irreversible loss of retina which can lead to a loss of visual function over time. Geographic atrophy (GA) lesion size was assessed by a Central Reading Center (CRC) using FAF. Baseline is defined as the last measurement prior to first dose of treatment. One eye (study eye) contributed to the analysis. Day 421 measurements were only summarized descriptively and did not include any statistical modeling.</description>

        <title>Change in Low Luminance Visual Acuity (LLVA) From Baseline up to Day 337 as Measured by ETDRS</title>
        <description>Low Luminance Visual Acuity (VA) was assessed using ETDRS testing at 4 meters with a neutral density filter to reduce chart luminance to 3 candelas/m2. Baseline is defined as the last measurement prior to first dose of treatment. BCVA change was defined as a change in letters read from the baseline assessment. A positive change value indicates improvement. One eye (study eye) contributed to the analysis.</description>

          <title>Change in Low Luminance Visual Acuity (LLVA) From Baseline up to Day 337 as Measured by ETDRS</title>
          <description>Low Luminance Visual Acuity (VA) was assessed using ETDRS testing at 4 meters with a neutral density filter to reduce chart luminance to 3 candelas/m2. Baseline is defined as the last measurement prior to first dose of treatment. BCVA change was defined as a change in letters read from the baseline assessment. A positive change value indicates improvement. One eye (study eye) contributed to the analysis.</description>
          <population>FAS. At each time point, only subjects with a value at both baseline and that time point are included.</population>

        <description>Low Luminance Visual Acuity (VA) was assessed using ETDRS testing at 4 meters with a neutral density filter to reduce chart luminance to 3 candelas/m2. A deficit in LLVA is defined as a loss in letters read from baseline. Baseline is defined as the last measurement prior to first dose of treatment. A negative change value indicates improvement (more letters read). One eye (study eye) contributed to the analysis.</description>
