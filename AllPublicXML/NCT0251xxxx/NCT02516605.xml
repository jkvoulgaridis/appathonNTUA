    <measure>Changes From Baseline in Total PBC-40 Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 28, Day 56, Day 84</time_frame>
    <description>Baseline is defined as the latest available predose value. The PBC-40 is a paper-based, patient-derived, disease-specific health-related quality of life (HRQOL) patient reported outcome (PRO) measure which was developed and validated for use in PBC patients (Jacoby et al 2005). It consists of 40 questions arranged in 6 domains with between 3 and 11 questions in each domain. Each question is scored from 1 to 5 in increasing order of severity. All questions within a domain are summed and all domain totals are summed to obtain a total score. The total score range is between a minimum of 40 and a maximum of 200. Higher scores represent a poorer quality of life. The median difference from baseline in total sum score for each treatment group is presented.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Itch Subdomain of PBC-40 Score</measure>

    <description>Baseline is defined as the latest available predose value. The PBC-40 is a paper-based, patient-derived, disease-specific health-related quality of life (HRQOL) patient reported outcome (PRO) measure which was developed and validated for use in PBC patients (Jacoby et al 2005). It consists of 40 questions arranged in 6 domains with between 3 and 11 questions in each domain. Each question is scored from 1 to 5 in increasing order of severity. This dataset focuses on the itch subdomain which consists of 3 questions. These 3 questions within the itch subdomain are summed to obtain a total score for the itch subdomain. The total score range is between a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 15. Higher scores represent a poorer quality of life. The median change from baseline in total itch subdomain score in each treatment group is presented.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 7, Day 14, Day 21, Day 28, Day 56, and Day 84</time_frame>
    <description>Baseline is defined as the latest available predose value. The Global Itch Visual Analogue Scale, a 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS), was used to assess the severity of patients itch (ranging from 0 = none at all to 100 = the worst imaginable itch). The score range is between a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 100. The score (distance in mm from left) on the VAS was recorded by the patient marking with a line and used to test for an effect of tropifexor over placebo. The mean change from baseline in itch VAS score in each treatment group is presented.</description>

        <title>Changes From Baseline in Total PBC-40 Score</title>
        <description>Baseline is defined as the latest available predose value. The PBC-40 is a paper-based, patient-derived, disease-specific health-related quality of life (HRQOL) patient reported outcome (PRO) measure which was developed and validated for use in PBC patients (Jacoby et al 2005). It consists of 40 questions arranged in 6 domains with between 3 and 11 questions in each domain. Each question is scored from 1 to 5 in increasing order of severity. All questions within a domain are summed and all domain totals are summed to obtain a total score. The total score range is between a minimum of 40 and a maximum of 200. Higher scores represent a poorer quality of life. The median difference from baseline in total sum score for each treatment group is presented.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Itch Subdomain of PBC-40 Score</title>
        <description>Baseline is defined as the latest available predose value. The PBC-40 is a paper-based, patient-derived, disease-specific health-related quality of life (HRQOL) patient reported outcome (PRO) measure which was developed and validated for use in PBC patients (Jacoby et al 2005). It consists of 40 questions arranged in 6 domains with between 3 and 11 questions in each domain. Each question is scored from 1 to 5 in increasing order of severity. This dataset focuses on the itch subdomain which consists of 3 questions. These 3 questions within the itch subdomain are summed to obtain a total score for the itch subdomain. The total score range is between a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 15. Higher scores represent a poorer quality of life. The median change from baseline in total itch subdomain score in each treatment group is presented.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Global Itch Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)</title>
        <description>Baseline is defined as the latest available predose value. The Global Itch Visual Analogue Scale, a 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS), was used to assess the severity of patients itch (ranging from 0 = none at all to 100 = the worst imaginable itch). The score range is between a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 100. The score (distance in mm from left) on the VAS was recorded by the patient marking with a line and used to test for an effect of tropifexor over placebo. The mean change from baseline in itch VAS score in each treatment group is presented.</description>
