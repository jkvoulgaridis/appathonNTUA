  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether a wearable robotic exoskeleton can help
      people with multiple sclerosis (MS) to walk again.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Loss of the ability to walk is one of the significant problems in persons with multiple
      sclerosis (MS). This limitation prevents the person from having an active and meaningful life
      at home and in the community. Also, more energy is needed to walk, which can cause fatigue
      and further leads to a non-active life style and poor quality of life. Unfortunately, walking
      training is often not available for this population because of the severity and progress of
      the disease; therefore, a new strategy is needed to help people with MS to walk again. A new
      technology, the wearable robotic exoskeleton, has been developed to help persons with spinal
      cord injuries stand up and walk. The robotic legs are powered by batteries and controlled by
      motors. This study will investigate the use of a wearable robotic exoskeleton to help persons
      with MS to walk. Participants will receive trainings (5 days per week for 3 weeks) to walk
      with the robotic exoskeleton (EKSO, EKSO Bionics, Richmond, CA). During the training, a
      physical therapist will teach the participant how to maintain balance, sit to stand, stand to
      sit, and walk with the wearable robotic exoskeleton. The hypothesis is that persons with MS
      will be able to use a robotic exoskeleton to walk better and with less energy costs.

    <measure>Physical Demands as Assessed by Energy Expenditure (Which is Indicated by VO2-max as Measured by the Cosmed K4b2) During the Timed 25 Feet Walk Test at Self-selected Speed (Without Exoskeleton)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Physical demands during the Timed 25 Feet Walk Test will be indicated by energy expenditure. Energy Expenditure (as indicated by VO2-max) will be measured by the K4 b2 Cosmed as follows: Oxygen cost will be calculated from oxygen consumption as the product of gait speed and body weight. Oxygen consumption will be collected on a breath-by-breath basis measured by a portable metabolic system (K4 b2 Cosmed). Prior to the testing, the system will be calibrated using room air and reference gas mixture. During the testing, the subject will wear a face mask and a heart rate monitor at all times and will be asked to breathe normally.
VO2-max, also known as maximal oxygen uptake, is the measurement of the maximum amount of oxygen a person can utilize during exercise.</description>

    <measure>Cognitive Demands as Indicated by Reaction Time in Dual Task Paradigm (Without Exoskeleton)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Cognitive demands during the Timed 25 Feet Walk Test at self-selected pace with and without exoskeleton will be determined by reaction time using a dual-task paradigm. We chose a simple reaction time (RT) task, in which the response will be biting on a pressure sensor to make the response pathways as independent as possible from the motor pathways of locomotion. The secondary RT task consists of biting a pressure transducer placed in the mouth in response to an unpredictable sensory (will not cause pain) electrical stimulation applied by an electrode on the back of the neck without changing walking speed and pattern. The stimulation intensity will be adjusted for each individual before data collection. Shorter RT indicates that reduced amount of attentional resources are required.</description>

        <description>This task will ask the subject to walk for 25 feet at comfortable pace with and without exoskeleton. Subjects will wear their exercise or walking shoes and are allowed to use assistive device such as cane or walker if necessary. The start and finish line of the 25 feet test course will be marked with tape on the floor. Additional 5 feet at the end of start and finish will be used for subject to turn around. A chair will be provided next to the start area so the subject may rest. During the test, the subject will walk at his/her comfortable pace without losing balance. A research team member will walk next to the subject for safety.</description>

        <title>Physical Demands as Assessed by Energy Expenditure (Which is Indicated by VO2-max as Measured by the Cosmed K4b2) During the Timed 25 Feet Walk Test at Self-selected Speed (Without Exoskeleton)</title>
        <description>Physical demands during the Timed 25 Feet Walk Test will be indicated by energy expenditure. Energy Expenditure (as indicated by VO2-max) will be measured by the K4 b2 Cosmed as follows: Oxygen cost will be calculated from oxygen consumption as the product of gait speed and body weight. Oxygen consumption will be collected on a breath-by-breath basis measured by a portable metabolic system (K4 b2 Cosmed). Prior to the testing, the system will be calibrated using room air and reference gas mixture. During the testing, the subject will wear a face mask and a heart rate monitor at all times and will be asked to breathe normally.
VO2-max, also known as maximal oxygen uptake, is the measurement of the maximum amount of oxygen a person can utilize during exercise.</description>

        <description>Physical demands during the Timed 25 Feet Walk Test will be indicated by energy expenditure. Energy Expenditure (as indicated by VO2-max) will be measured by the K4 b2 Cosmed as follows: Oxygen cost will be calculated from oxygen consumption as the product of gait speed and body weight. Oxygen consumption will be collected on a breath-by-breath basis measured by a portable metabolic system (K4 b2 Cosmed). Prior to the testing, the system will be calibrated using room air and reference gas mixture. During the testing, the subject will wear a face mask and a heart rate monitor at all times and will be asked to breathe normally.
VO2-max, also known as maximal oxygen uptake, is the measurement of the maximum amount of oxygen a person can utilize during exercise.</description>

        <description>Cognitive demands during the Timed 25 Feet Walk Test at self-selected pace with and without exoskeleton will be determined by reaction time using a dual-task paradigm. We chose a simple reaction time (RT) task, in which the response will be biting on a pressure sensor to make the response pathways as independent as possible from the motor pathways of locomotion. The secondary RT task consists of biting a pressure transducer placed in the mouth in response to an unpredictable sensory (will not cause pain) electrical stimulation applied by an electrode on the back of the neck without changing walking speed and pattern. The stimulation intensity will be adjusted for each individual before data collection. Shorter RT indicates that reduced amount of attentional resources are required.</description>
