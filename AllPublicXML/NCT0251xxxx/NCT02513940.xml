  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Torsades de pointes (TdP) is a potentially fatal ventricular arrhythmia associated with
      corrected QT (QTc) interval prolongation. More than 50 commonly used drugs available on the
      US market may cause QTc interval prolongation and TdP. While TdP occurs more commonly in
      women, 33-45% of all cases of TdP have occurred in men. Older age is a risk factor for
      drug-induced TdP in men, possibly due to declining serum testosterone concentrations.
      Available evidence shows an inverse relationship between QTc intervals and serum testosterone
      concentrations. In addition, experimental data, including those from the investigators'
      laboratory, suggest that both exogenous testosterone or progesterone administration may be
      protective against prolongation of ventricular repolarization and TdP. Specific Aim:
      Establish the influence of transdermal testosterone administration and oral progesterone
      administration as preventive methods by which to diminish the degree of drug-induced QT
      interval prolongation in men 65 years of age or older. Hypothesis: Transdermal testosterone
      administration and oral progesterone administration both effectively attenuate drug-induced
      QT interval response in older men. To test this hypothesis, transdermal testosterone, oral
      progesterone or placebo will be administered in a 3-way crossover study to men 65 years of
      age or older. QTc interval response to low-dose ibutilide will be assessed. The primary
      endpoints will be Fridericia-corrected QT interval (QTF) response to ibutilide, in the
      presence and absence of testosterone, and in the presence or absence of progesterone: 1)
      Effect on pre-ibutilide QTF, 2) Effect on maximum post-ibutilide QTF, 3) Effect on % change
      in post-ibutilide QTF, and 2) Area under the QTF interval-time curves.

    <description>QT interval is an electrocardiogram (ECG) measure of ventricular repolarization. Prolonged QT interval is a marker of increased risk of the ventricular arrhythmia known as torsades de pointes, which can cause sudden cardiac death. QT intervals were measured from ECG lead II by one investigator (E.T.M.) who was blinded to the subjects' assigned treatment phases. QT intervals were measured using computerized high-resolution electronic calipers (EP Calipers 1.6). QT and RR intervals at each time point were averaged over 3 consecutive complexes. The end of the T-wave was determined via the tangent method. Only clearly discernable QT intervals were measured. QT intervals vary with heart rate, and therefore must be corrected for heart rate. QT intervals were corrected using the Fridericia (QTF) method. The baseline QTF assesses the influence of testosterone and progesterone on naturally-occurring (before ibutilide administration) QTF</description>

    <description>QT interval is an ECG measure of ventricular repolarization. Prolonged QT interval is a marker of increased risk of the ventricular arrhythmia known as torsades de pointes, which can cause sudden cardiac death. Three 12-lead ECGs were obtained ~ 1 minute apart immediately at the end of the ibutilide infusion and at 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, and 45 minutes and 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours post-infusion. QT intervals were measured from ECG lead II by one investigator (E.T.M.) who was blinded to the subjects' assigned treatment phases. QT intervals were measured using computerized high-resolution electronic calipers. QT and RR intervals at each time point were averaged over 3 consecutive complexes. The end of the T-wave was determined via the tangent method. QT intervals vary with heart rate, and therefore must be corrected for heart rate. QT intervals were corrected using the Fridericia (QTF) method. Maximum QTF is the longest QTF measured following ibutilide at any time point.</description>

After a washout period of at least 13 days, they then received transdermal testosterone gel 1% 100 mg once daily in the morning and two (2) oral placebo capsules x 7 days.

        <description>QT interval is an electrocardiogram (ECG) measure of ventricular repolarization. Prolonged QT interval is a marker of increased risk of the ventricular arrhythmia known as torsades de pointes, which can cause sudden cardiac death. QT intervals were measured from ECG lead II by one investigator (E.T.M.) who was blinded to the subjects' assigned treatment phases. QT intervals were measured using computerized high-resolution electronic calipers (EP Calipers 1.6). QT and RR intervals at each time point were averaged over 3 consecutive complexes. The end of the T-wave was determined via the tangent method. Only clearly discernable QT intervals were measured. QT intervals vary with heart rate, and therefore must be corrected for heart rate. QT intervals were corrected using the Fridericia (QTF) method. The baseline QTF assesses the influence of testosterone and progesterone on naturally-occurring (before ibutilide administration) QTF</description>

        <description>QT interval is an ECG measure of ventricular repolarization. Prolonged QT interval is a marker of increased risk of the ventricular arrhythmia known as torsades de pointes, which can cause sudden cardiac death. Three 12-lead ECGs were obtained ~ 1 minute apart immediately at the end of the ibutilide infusion and at 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, and 45 minutes and 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours post-infusion. QT intervals were measured from ECG lead II by one investigator (E.T.M.) who was blinded to the subjects' assigned treatment phases. QT intervals were measured using computerized high-resolution electronic calipers. QT and RR intervals at each time point were averaged over 3 consecutive complexes. The end of the T-wave was determined via the tangent method. QT intervals vary with heart rate, and therefore must be corrected for heart rate. QT intervals were corrected using the Fridericia (QTF) method. Maximum QTF is the longest QTF measured following ibutilide at any time point.</description>

          <description>QT interval is an ECG measure of ventricular repolarization. Prolonged QT interval is a marker of increased risk of the ventricular arrhythmia known as torsades de pointes, which can cause sudden cardiac death. Three 12-lead ECGs were obtained ~ 1 minute apart immediately at the end of the ibutilide infusion and at 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, and 45 minutes and 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours post-infusion. QT intervals were measured from ECG lead II by one investigator (E.T.M.) who was blinded to the subjects' assigned treatment phases.
