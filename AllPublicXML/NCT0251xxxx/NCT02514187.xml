  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate technetium-99m (99mTc) pertechnetate produced by a
      cyclotron as a replacement for 99mTc pertechnetate obtained from a generator containing the
      parent isotope Molybdenum-99 (99Mo). 99mTc pertechnetate is currently used in nuclear
      medicine departments across the country. 99Mo is produced by a number of ageing nuclear
      reactors across the world and severe shortages of the isotope have occurred in the past few
      years. Cyclotron-produced 99mTc offers an alternative decentralized production method on a
      regional basis. Since the manufacturing process is different, the safety and efficacy of
      cyclotron-produced 99mTc pertechnetate must be evaluated in human subjects to enable its
      routine clinical use.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Agreement rate of the blinded read of scintiscans between cyclotronproduced 99mTc (CP) and the standard of care (SOC) in the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The result of the standard of care test and cyclotron-produced 99mTc pertechnetate will be compiled in a 2 x 2 table, and the corresponding proportions will be compared.
The accuracy of the thyroid examinations will be compared to a clinical standard of care consisting of a combination of physical examination, laboratory testing, ultrasound evaluation (when available) and short-term clinical follow-up at 12 weeks. The accuracy of cyclotron-produced 99mTc will be compared to the accuracy of generator-produced 99mTc or 123I, using a non-inferiority test of correlated proportions.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Blinded subjective comparison of image quality between cyclotron- and generator-produced 99mTc using a 5-point Likert scale.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>For the subjective evaluation of image quality, data will be scored on a 5-point Likert scale, evaluating independently and blindly cyclotron- and generator-produced 99mTc. The scores on this ordinal scale will be compared using a one-sided Mann-Whitney test for paired samples.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The target-to-background ratio</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>For quantitative evaluation of image contrast, the target-to-background ratio will be calculated by measuring the activity in the organ of interest (long bones). The target-to-background ratios will be compared using a one-sided paired t-test.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of participants with 99mTc-related adverse events as assessed by abnormal vital sign measurement.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>Vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate and pulse oximetry) will be measured at three time points (before and after injection, and 1 hour after the injection). All values that fall outside of the normal parameters will be assessed by a physician and reported as an adverse event.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of participants with self-reported 99mTc-related adverse event.</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be contacted by phone 24 hours after the 68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT scan to see if they experienced any adverse events. These are recorded and evaluated for severity and likelihood they are related to the study drug. All adverse events will be recorded and summarized in the final report.</description>

    <description>For the evaluation of hyperthyroidism each research subject will undergo imaging using both cyclotron-produced 99mTc and the current standard method used at the site for thyroid imaging (either 123I or generator-produced 99mTc). Each study will be performed on a separate day, with flexibility to schedule either study first.</description>
