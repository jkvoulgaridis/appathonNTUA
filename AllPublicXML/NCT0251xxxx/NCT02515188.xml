  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sedation for catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation should be performed to achieve
      analgesia, immobilization, and maintenance of airway. Various anesthetic agents such as
      propofol, dexmedetomidine, and midazolam were investigated to achieve this goal. However,
      propofol and midazolam causes respiratory depression and dexmedetomidine occasionally
      accompanies hypotension or hypertension and bradycardia. Therefore, anesthetic agent that
      does not induce respiratory depression with stable hemodynamics is needed.

      Propacetamol (Denogan®, Yungjin, Seoul, Korea) is injectable prodrug of acetaminophen and 1st
      line drug for fever and pain. In a previous study, paracetamol reduced morphine consumption
      after surgery. And paracetamol does not cause respiratory depression. Thus, the investigators
      hypothesized that addition of propacetamol to previously used sedatives
      midazolam-remifentanil will reduce opioid consumption during the catheter ablation.

      Therefore, the investigators designed this study to investigate the role of addition of
      propacetamol to previous used midazolam-remifentanil sedation. This study will compare the
      opioid consumption and respiratory effect of propacetamol with placebo-control for catheter
      ablation of atrial fibrillation.
