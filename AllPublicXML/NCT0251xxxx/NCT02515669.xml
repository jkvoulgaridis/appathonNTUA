    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Doses for this study are based upon achieving a moderate to high degree of suppression in serum free myostatin at steady-state trough across 3 dose levels. A body weight-tiered, fixed-dose strategy targeting moderate (&gt;50%), high (&gt;85%) and near complete (&gt;95%) suppression of serum free myostatin was used to select the three doses for the study.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Starting at Week 5, participants whose weight exceeded or dropped below the dosing weight tier to which they were assigned (by &gt;1kg) were assigned to the new corresponding body weight-based dose within the participants assigned panel.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>A positive ADA sample is defined as one in which the presence of detectable ADAs is confirmed to be specific to RO7239361. A participant is considered as ADA positive if, after initiation of treatment, they have an ADA positive relative to baseline sample.
Participants in Panel 1 received 4 mg RO7239361; participants in Panel 2 received either 12.5 mg (weight between 15 and 45 kg) or 20 mg (weight &gt;45 kg) RO7239361, and participants in Panel 3 and the Expansion Panel received either 35 mg (weight between 15 and 45 kg) or 50 mg (weight &gt;45 kg) RO7239361.</description>

          <description>A positive ADA sample is defined as one in which the presence of detectable ADAs is confirmed to be specific to RO7239361. A participant is considered as ADA positive if, after initiation of treatment, they have an ADA positive relative to baseline sample.
Participants in Panel 1 received 4 mg RO7239361; participants in Panel 2 received either 12.5 mg (weight between 15 and 45 kg) or 20 mg (weight &gt;45 kg) RO7239361, and participants in Panel 3 and the Expansion Panel received either 35 mg (weight between 15 and 45 kg) or 50 mg (weight &gt;45 kg) RO7239361.</description>
