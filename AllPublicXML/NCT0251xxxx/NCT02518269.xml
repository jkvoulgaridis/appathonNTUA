  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to compare three articulation options in terms of osteolysis, patient
      satisfaction, clinical and radiographic outcomes (Oxford Hip score (OHS) and Harris Hip score
      (HHS)) and safety.

      In addition, the purpose of the study is also to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of
      patients who received G7 Acetabular system in conjunction with Echo BiMetric stem in primary
      total hip arthroplasty.

      DESIGN: Prospective 3 Arm Randomized controlled trial.

      PURPOSE:To compare three commonly used contemporary bearings in Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA).
      In addition, to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the G7 Cups and Echo BiMetric Stem
      in THA.

      OUTCOME MEASURES: Osteolysis, clinical outcomes, patient satisfaction,
      intraoperative/surgical data, implant positioning, survivor ship, and adverse events.

      POPULATION: 360 hips (240 will have CT scan for analysis of osteolysis).

      ELIGIBILITY: Patients who meet inclusion and exclusion criteria defined in this protocol.

      DURATION: All patients will be followed at 3 months, 1, 2, 5, 7 and 10 year postoperatively.
      Assuming the enrollment will be completed 18 months. The total study duration will be 11.5
      years.

      STUDY GROUPS/TREATMENTS

      Group 1 - G7 Metal-on-Polyethylene (MoP) (Arcom XL) + Echo BiMetric Group 2 - G7
      Metal-on-Polyethylene (MoP) (E1) + Echo BiMetric Group 3 - G7 Ceramic-on-Ceramic (CoC) + Echo

               -  The patient has a neurologic condition in the ipsilateral or contralateral limb
                  which affects lower limb function.

        fusion of the hip to be operated.

          -  The patient has insufficient bone stock to fix the component. Insufficient bone stock
             exists (ex: Dorr type C) in the presence of metabolic bone disease (i.e.
             osteoporosis), cancer, and radiation.

          -  Estimated cup size smaller than 48 or stem size smaller than 7
