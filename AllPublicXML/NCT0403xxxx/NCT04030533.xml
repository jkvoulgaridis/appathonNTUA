    <description>Absolute bioavailability is the percentage of the orally administered dose that is systemically available. It is calculated as (AUC [0-infinity] for test)/(AUC [0-infinity] for reference [ref])*(D for ref/D for test)*100, where the reference treatment is an intravenous administration, AUC (0-infinity) is area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to extrapolated infinite time, and D is the dose of administered drug.</description>
