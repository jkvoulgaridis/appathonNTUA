  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project will evaluate cost and treatment outcomes of a simplified Hepatitis C Virus (HCV)
      testing, treatment and care model integrated with HIV testing and treatment among key
      affected populations in Ukraine.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Affected populations will be screened for HCV and HIV and those HCV positive treated with
      direct with direct acting anti-HCV agents (DAAs), a fixed-dose combination of
      sofosbuvir/ledipasvir (SOF/LDV) for 12 weeks with or without weight-based ribavirin. Before
      and after completion of the treatment course viral load assessments will be undertaken using
      low-cost laboratory monitoring for comparison to standard HCV viral load measurement. Up 800
      patients enrolled on treatment will be followed up at 4, 8, 12 and 24 weeks when Sustained
      Viral Response (SVR) will be determined. Safety monitoring will be undertaken at applicable
      visits for those on Ribavirin and all adverse events will be reported based on Good Clinical
      Practice (GCP). In addition to assessing cost outcomes, the project will assess HCV treatment
      efficacy in terms of SVR at 12 weeks after end of treatment ( defined as undetected HCV RNA
      or less than lower limit of detection), compare the cost of low cost viral assay platforms to
      standard of care, assess rates of ART initiation and virologic suppression of HIV-infected
      persons within the simplified HCV treatment model and impact of HIV co-infection in
      participants on the HCV treatment outcome of SVR12. The project will be conducted at 2
      treatment sites in Kiev.

    <time_frame>Two years. This will be after data on Viral load response is complete.</time_frame>
    <description>The average cost to the provider per patient achieving SVR-12 will be estimated, as will the average cost per other outcomes achieved, such as per patient screened and per patient remaining in care by other specified endpoints, stratified by HIV status and by any other important patient or site characteristics that are identified as drivers of cost. The investigators will also estimate the average cost to &quot;produce&quot; a successful outcome (SVR-12), which is the ratio of total costs for the intervention for the entire sample enrolled to the number of patients achieving the primary outcome. This latter estimate captures the costs incurred for patients who do not have successful outcomes and thus relates resource utilization to health outcomes.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Sustained Viral Response</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks ( 12 weeks post treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>This will be the main treatment outcome of all patients initiated on treatment. Baseline viral load is done at entry with treatment initiated for those positive and eligible. Patients initiated on treatment will be assessed for viral load response at 24 weeks ( 12 weeks post treatment). This will also help in development of a Care cascade model for HCV testing, treatment and SVR12 in key populations co-infected with HIV/HCV, HIV/HCV/HBV, HBV/HCV and HCV mono-infected.</description>

             must have haemoglobin ≥110 g/L

          9. For females of reproductive potential, a negative urine pregnancy test (urine -HCG
             with a sensitivity of &lt;25 mIU/mL) within 48 hours prior to project entry must be
             documented.

         10. Male and female participants who are able to impregnate or become pregnant (ie, of

             agree to not participate in a conception process while on treatment with ribavirin
             through at least 12 weeks post-treatment.

        Note: Acceptable contraception/birth control for this project includes one of the following
        methods:

          -  condoms (male or female) with a spermicide

          -  diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide

          -  hormonally impregnated intrauterine device (IUD)

          -  non-hormonally impregnated IUD in conjunction with spermicide

          -  Hormone-based therapy

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Child-Pugh Score corresponding to Class B or C (decompensated cirrhosis). This
             requires assessment for encephalopathy and ascites, as well as measurement of serum
             bilirubin, albumin, and international normalized ratio (Prothrombin time). For Child's
             cirrhosis severity calculator on the following link can be used:
             http://www.hepatitisc.uw.edu/page/clinical-calculators/ctp . Patients with
             decompensated cirrhosis and advanced liver disease will not be included to the
             treatment program, but they will remain under observation and will receive medical
             care within routine medical practice of the healthcare facility in such clinical
             cases.

          2. Breastfeeding or pregnancy. Pregnant or breastfeeding woman will be documented and
             provided access to HCV treatment after resolution of pregnancy and breastfeeding.

          3. Known allergy/sensitivity or any hypersensitivity to components of drug(s) or their
             formulation.

          4. Active tuberculosis (TB) infection. Given the high TB prevalence in Ukraine, every
             candidate should be screened for TB signs/symptoms with further medical evaluation for
             active TB as indicated. In the case of proven active TB infection, the participant is
             ineligible for HCV treatment (due to the adverse drug interaction of SOF/LDV and
             rifampicin) but will be followed and offered enrolment when they complete treatment
             with rifampicin.

          5. Renal impairment defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt; 30
             ml/min/1.73m2 or end-stage renal disease receiving dialysis as treatment with SOF/LDV
             is contraindicated (https://www.mdcalc.com/mdrd-gfr-equation). The participant may be
             rescreened if the renal function improves. Patients with worse renal impairment will
             not be treated but will be followed and will recive medical aid within routine medical
             practice of the healthcare facility where project is implemented

          6. Prior treatment with any HCV Direct Acting Agents (DAA).
