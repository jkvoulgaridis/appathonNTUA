      This is a first-in-human, open-label, multi-centre, phase I/IIa study to characterise the
      safety and clinical activity of autologous clonal neoantigen T cells (cNeT) administered
      intravenously in adults with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

      Patients will initially enter the study for procurement of starting materials to manufacture
      ATL001.

      Following manufacture of ATL001, the product will be given back to eligible patients
      following lymphodepletion. Patients will be followed up for a period of 24 months post ATL001
      infusion. Patients will then be requested to enter a separate long term follow up protocol
      for a further 5 years (total 84 months)
