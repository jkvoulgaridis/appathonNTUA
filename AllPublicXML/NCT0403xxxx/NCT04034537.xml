  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to build a repository of resting cardiac phase space
      signals from eligible subjects using the Phase Signal Recorder (PSR) prior to coronary
      angiography for the purposes of machine-learning and testing algorithms developed by
      Analytics 4 Life. Male and Female subjects will be uniquely and consecutively enrolled into
      one group to support populating a repository of phase signals.

      Analytics 4 Life (A4L) is a medical information technology company that uses advanced signal
      processing techniques for the purposes of assessing and diagnosing disease. A4L is currently
      focused on developing a non-invasive solution for the assessment of significant coronary
      artery disease using the cardiac Phase Space Tomography Analysis (cPSTA) System. Through
      proprietary variable extraction to define phase space signals as metrics in mathematical
      terms and machine learned formulas, A4L has developed a cost-effective solution to collect
      and analyze phase signals as data indicative of cardiac performance. The cPSTA System
      passively reconstructs and displays images from this data using topological data analysis
      (TDA) to provide a computationally tractable method of interrogating the complex
      physiological processes of the heart with the intent to understand and characterize the
      cardiac tissue properties.

      A4L has providing the Phase Signal Recorder (PSR) to the sponsor for use in this study. The
      primary objective of this study is to collect resting phase signals from eligible subjects
      using the Phase Space Recorder (PSR) prior to coronary angiography for the purpose of machine
      learning and testing an algorithm developed to assess the presence of significant coronary
      artery disease (CAD).The definition of significant CAD, which is well established in the
      literature, is either the presence of a stenosis ≥50% by angiography or reduced blood flow of
      &lt;0.80as measured by Fractional Flow Rate (FFR) or instantaneous free-wave ratio (iFR)
      &lt;0.89.Each subject's CAD status will be assessing the presence of significant CAD in the
      major coronary arteries including the left main artery (LMA), left anterior descending artery
      (LAD), circumflex artery (LCX), and the right coronary artery (RCA) and their distributions.

      Accurately assessing the presence or absence of CAD and evaluating other physiologic measures
      is vital to the assessment of cardiac health/illness. As such, the following additional
      assessments are planned to support further support goal: establishing a ROC curve for the
      primary objective to describe a full range of sensitivity and specificity trade-offs; and,
      developing and testing machine-learned algorithms to validate a clinically relevant
      sensitivity and specificity for the identification of significant CAD specific to perfusion
      regions (LAD, LCX, and RCA).

    <description>The cPSTA System is a medical device system that uses passive tomography to analyze a patient's phase space data to identify the presence of significant coronary artery disease. The cPSTA System consists of several components that work together to obtain, transmit, analyze the data, and display the results, including the Phase Signal Acquisition System (PSAQ System), which is the Phase Signal Recorder (PSR) and the Phase Signal Data Repository (PSDR); analytical software; and secure web portal. For this study only the PSAQ System is used by the clinical site for the purposes of acquiring and transmitting the signal. All enrolled patients will perform cPSTA signal recording.</description>
