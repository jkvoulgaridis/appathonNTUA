  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Priming stimulation is a highly promising tool to boost the beneficial effects of therapeutic
      repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in psychiatry. The potentiating effects
      of priming stimulation, however, depend on the time interval between the priming and the test
      stimulation. Although it is known that too short and too long intervals have no effects,
      systematic studies that identify the time needed to maximize efficacy have not yet been done.
      Thus, there is a need for studies to investigate the effects of priming stimulation in order
      to fully utilize the potential benefits and advantages of this promising new rTMS protocol.
      This study will systematically investigate the neuromodulatory process underlying priming
      stimulation to enhance metaplasticity in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) -
      one of the main targets for therapeutic rTMS - in individuals with subclinical depression.

      The brain is a highly plastic organ and its activity can be influenced using rTMS. At the
      same time, the brain also has a mechanism - called homeostatic metaplasticity - which
      counteracts extreme plastic changes. Homeostatic metaplasticity therefore can limit the
      beneficial effects of brain stimulation interventions. However, priming stimulation protocols
      that include both a priming and a test stimulation session may utilize homeostatic
      metaplasticity to increase the beneficial effects of brain stimulation, although the optimal
      treatment parameters for priming are not known. Moreover, little is known about homeostatic
      metaplasticity in the DLPFC, an area that is particularly relevant for psychiatric conditions
      given its role in the top-down control of emotions. Here, the investigators will
      systematically study metaplasticity using priming theta-burst stimulation (TBS), a potent
      form of rTMS in the left DLPFC. Changes in blood oxygenation that signal brain activity
      changes will be assessed using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) at rest and
      during engagement in an emotion discrimination task (EDT). The findings from this study will
      (1) elucidate the optimal time interval between priming and test stimulation; (2) elucidate
      the influence of priming TBS on emotion discrimination and its underlying brain activity in
      subclinical depression; and (3) validate homeostatic metaplasticity in the left DLPFC.
