  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized open-label phase 2b study of the efficacy and safety of regional
      infusion therapy with Anti-CEA CAR-T cells using the hepatic immunotherapy for metastases
      (HITM) method and the Trisalus pressure enabling drug delivery (PEDD) device alternating with
      systemic chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone in patients with CEA-expressing pancreatic
      adenocarcinoma with liver metastases.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of 5 periods: Screening/Leukapheresis Period, Bridging Therapy Period,
      Randomization Period, Treatment Period, and Observation Period (which will be the long-term
      follow-up period to monitor for overall survival and long-term safety).

      Patients in this trial with CEA-expressing pancreatic adenocarcinoma with liver metastases
      must have developed disease progression after first-line treatment with FOLFIRINOX
      (irinotecan, 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin) or gemcitabine-based chemotherapy.
      Patients will be randomized to either the &quot;anti-CEA CAR-T Cells + systemic chemotherapy
      treatment arms&quot;, or the &quot;chemotherapy alone treatment arms.&quot;

      If the patients achieve at least stable disease during the Bridging Therapy Period, they will
      be in the Second-Line Group of Treatment Arms. Patients who develop disease progression
      during the Bridging Period will be in the Third-Line Group of Treatment Arms.

      Patients in the Second-Line or Third-Line treatment arms who are randomized to the treatment
      arms of &quot;Anti-CEA CAR-T cells plus systemic chemotherapy&quot; will receive hepatic infusions of
      Anti-CEA CAR-T cells in Cycles 1 and 3 (ie, each 42-day cycle is 3 weekly doses of Anti-CEA
      CAR-T cells administered as hepatic arterial infusions using a PEDD device with low dose
      systemic IL-2 support), alternating with the systemic chemotherapy regimen they received
      during the Bridging Therapy Period in Cycle 2 and Cycles &gt;= 4. Systemic chemotherapy will be
      administered in 28-day cycles until the development of disease progression.

      Patients in the Second-Line or Third-Line treatment arms who are randomized to the treatment
      arms &quot;chemotherapy alone&quot; arms will continue to receive the same systemic chemotherapy that
      they received during the Bridging Therapy Period. Systemic chemotherapy will be administered
      in 28-day or 21-day cycles (depending on the type of systemic chemotherapy regimen the
      patient will receive) until the development of disease progression.
