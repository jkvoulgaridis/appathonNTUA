  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study is being conducted by the Sponsor to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      GV1001 (0.56 mg and 1.12 mg) administered as a treatment for Benign prostate
      hyperplasia(BPH). The investigational drug, GV1001, was first developed as a cancer vaccine
      for use as active immunotherapy of cancer forms expressing telomerase (eg, pancreatic cancer,
      prostate cancer, etc.). Subsequently, it was found that GV1001 showed efficacy in alleviating
      BPH symptoms during in vivo studies by reducing the size of the prostate gland. Based on the
      result, the effectiveness of GV1001 as a treatment for BPH has been assessed in experimental
      animals that are designed to develop BPH.

      It is considered that GV1001 acts to alleviate BPH and the results obtained from previous
      phase II study indicate that GV1001 may provide potential beneficial effects in BPH patients.

      So this study is to verify the efficacy and safety of GV1001 on BPH population, large-scale
      clinical study than phase II.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a multi-center, randomized, Double-blind, Active-controlled, parallel design, Phase
      3 study in patients with BPH. The study consisted of a Screening period, a 4-weeks
      Run-in/Washout period, a 24-week Treatment period, an Evaluation and Close-out Visit at Week
      24.

      There are a total of 3 groups in this study, which contained 2 study groups (GV1001) and 1
      placebo group (0.9% normal saline). Approximately 417 patients are planned to be randomly
      assigned into the study in a 1:1:1 ratio. All patients are randomized into 1 of 3 treatment
      groups to ensure completion of patients.

      The Screening period have a time period of 4 weeks before the beginning of Run-in/Washout
      period. Eligible patients entered into a 4-week Run-in/Washout period and receive placebo
      treatment, which will be completed before randomization on Week 0. All randomized patients
      will receive the investigational drug or a placebo via intradermal injection 12 times with a
      2-week interval at Weeks 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22 and 24. Efficacy
      evaluation will be conducted at Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24, and safety evaluation will be
      conducted throughout the 24-weeks period.
