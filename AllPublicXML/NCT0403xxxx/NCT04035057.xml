  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to test a targeted training for overcoming known barriers to the
      uptake and quality delivery of exposure therapy among community mental health providers. The
      first phase (Year 1) of the study is a case-series analysis of six therapists with the goal
      of determining whether the targeted training strategies (i.e., exposure to exposure) are
      capable of engaging therapists' reservations about exposure. Information from the first phase
      will be used to optimize the behavioral training strategies to be tested in the second phase.
      The second phase (Years 2 &amp; 3) will be a randomized trial of training conditions comparing
      Behaviorally Enhanced Training Strategies to a Standard Didactic Training. After an initial
      workshop training, therapists in the second phase will receive ongoing consultation while
      they deliver exposure therapy with their anxious patients. Sessions will be video-recorded
      and therapist behaviors will be coded to assess for differences in the manner in which
      exposure is delivered between training conditions.

      Following decades of psychosocial treatment research the field has established numerous
      evidence-based practices (EBPs) for mental disorders, but has struggled to widely disseminate
      these practices in community settings. Exposure therapy for anxiety disorders represents one
      of the most glaring examples of this research to practice gap. A well-known barrier to the
      dissemination and quality delivery of exposure therapy is therapists' negative beliefs about
      its potential danger or intolerability for patients. These beliefs are common even among
      therapists who report receiving specialized training; thus, research is needed to develop
      targeted training strategies for reducing negative beliefs and improving delivery quality.
      Preliminary research suggests specific behavioral strategies (i.e., self-exposure) may reduce
      negative beliefs above and beyond standard didactic trainings (Farrell, Kemp et al., 2016).
      Building upon these findings, the investigators propose a novel experimental therapeutics
      approach to developing and testing a targeted behavioral training for augmenting negative
      beliefs in a sample of community mental health professionals. The first phase of the study is
      a case-series analysis for establishing target engagement (i.e., belief reduction) and
      determining adequate dosing of the behavioral strategies. Phase two is a randomized trial of
      the behaviorally-enhanced training strategies (BeTS) against a standard didactic protocol.
      Therapist will complete a day-long workshop followed by weekly consultation while delivering
      exposure for children with anxiety disorders. In-session delivery behavior will be recorded
      and examined using a validated micro-analytic coding system. It is hypothesized that
      therapists in the BeTS condition will evidence significantly lower negative beliefs about
      exposure relative to the didactic condition, at 1) post-workshop, and 2) end of study. IT is
      also hypothesized that the degree of negative belief reduction following the initial workshop
      training will be associated with 1) higher rates of optimal in-session delivery behaviors,
      and 2) lower rates of suboptimal delivery behaviors as measured by both self-report and
      observational coding data. This study will establish an innovative model for developing a
      targeted training intervention capable of increasing the dissemination and quality of
      exposure therapy and other EBPs.

    <description>The Therapist Beliefs about Exposure (TBES) will be administered to assess the extent to which therapists harbor negative perceptions of exposure therapy and its tolerability among their patients. The TBES is a 21-item scale with a 0 (&quot;Disagree Strongly&quot;) to 4 (&quot;Strongly Agree&quot;) rating scale. TBES scores are summed and range from 0 to 84, with lower scores indicating less reservations.</description>

    <description>Patients with symptoms of anxiety will be administered the Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale (PARS), which is a clinician-rated measure of anxiety symptom severity for use with multiple anxiety disorders. The measure consists of a symptom checklist and seven symptom severity items. The symptom severity items are rated using a 0 to 5 scale with lower ratings indicating less severity.

    <description>Both training conditions will receive a 1.5 day training followed by ongoing supervision while they implement exposure therapy with patients recruited to the study. The first full day will consist of the same foundational information in both conditions. The two conditions will differ in their training focus during the subsequent half-day training. The Behaviorally Enhanced condition will involve therapist engagement in repeated self-exposure and partner-exposure exercises with the goal of targeting and reducing therapists' reservations about using exposure with their patients. The focus of ongoing supervision following the initial 1.5 day training workshop will also differ by condition. The Behaviorally Enhanced condition will include regular sampling and feedback on therapists' remaining reservations about exposure in additional to counseling the implementation of exposure with therapists' patients.</description>

The first full day will consist of the same foundational information in both conditions.The two conditions will differ in their training focus during the subsequent half-day training. The Standard Didactic condition will involve additional didactic instruction related to common barriers and more advanced delivery concepts than will be presented in the half-day training for the Behaviorally Enhanced condition. The focus of ongoing supervision following the initial 1.5 day training workshop will also differ by condition. The Standard Didactic condition will involve counseling on the implementation of exposure with therapists' patients without explicit focus on therapists' remaining reservations about exposure.</description>
