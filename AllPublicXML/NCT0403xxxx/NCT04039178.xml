  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study tests the efficacy of a non-invasive device with low intensity electromagnetic
      field dedicated treatment to enhance the recovery of stroke patients impaired hand motor

      The study investigates the effect of BCI based stimulation device on upper limb motor
      function of acute stroke patients.

      The BQ device (BrainQ Technologies Ltd., Israel), a Brain Computer Interface based
      stimulation device, uses machine learning tools to identify high resolution spectral patterns
      associated with motor functions in EEG measurements of healthy/non healthy subjects. These
      patterns are then translated into a tailored frequency dependent low intensity, non-invasive
      electro-magnetic treatment protocol.
