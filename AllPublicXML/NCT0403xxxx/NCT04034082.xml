  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized control pilot study to assess the effect of intermittent hypoxia therapy
      on functional capacity vs conventional care in old patients with functional impairment
      admitted to a Phase 2 in-hospital cardiac rehabilitation program.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Because the improvement of exercise tolerance reduces mortality in elderly patients affected
      by cardiovascular disease, intermittent hypoxia therapy (IHT) - defined as repeated episodes
      of hypoxia interspersed with normoxic periods delivered by an ad hoc device - might be a
      valuable tool to be associated to structured cardiac rehabilitation (CR) interventions.

      The present study is a pilot, monocentric, randomized (randomization ratio 1:1), parallel
      group study to assess the effect of IHT on functional capacity vs conventional care in old
      patients with functional impairment admitted to a phase 2 in-hospital cardiac rehabilitation
      program.

      The study will enroll cardiac patients of both genders, ≥ 75 years and with a functional
      impairment assessed by a Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) score &lt; 7.

      The effect of IHT on functional capacity will be evaluated on top of the conventional
      multidisciplinary CR intervention, by means of SPPB score variation; variations in quality of
      life and cognitive status will also be evaluated as secondary goals of the study.

      The total amount of IHT sessions per patient will be 10, 1 per day over 2 weeks, the duration
      of each single procedure will be 45 min and the Hypoxic O2 conc.% will be 14-10. The study
      was approved by local ethic committee.

    <description>Intermittent Hypoxic Therapy (further referred to as IHT). A typical IHT session consists of repeated short-term moderate hypoxia (down to 10 vol.% O2), interrupted by brief periods of reoxygenation. These periods of recovery could be either normoxic (21 vol.% O2, Hypoxia-Normoxia mode) or hyperoxic (30-35 vol.% O2, Hypoxia-Hyperoxia mode, further referred to as IHHT). The gas mixtures are supplied to a patient via facial mask.</description>
