    <textblock>
      To determine the efficacy of a novel combinatorial treatment involving early surgical
      intervention and long-term weight-bearing walking training in spinal cord injury (SCI)
      patients clinically diagnosed as complete or American Spinal Injury Association Impairment
      Scale Class A (AIS-A).

      In the present study, the investigators reported the efficacy of a novel combinatorial
      approach involving early surgical intervention and long-term weight-bearing walking training
      in SCI patients clinically defined as complete or AIS-A. The surgical intervention involves
      the intradural decompression (via durotomy), and, in some cases, intraspinal decompression
      (via myelotomy). In addition, the investigators had developed a weight-bearing walking
      training program named &quot;Kunming Locomotion Training Program (KLTP)&quot; to train the patient to
      walk actively for a duration of 6 hours per day, 6 days per week for a minimum of 6 months
      (6-6-6 KLTP). The investigators reasoned that early surgical intradural and/or intraspinal
      decompression would release the intraspinal pressure and, therefore, spare surrounding
      tissues that would otherwise degenerate during the course of secondary injury. The
      investigators further reasoned that long-term weight-bearing walking training would &quot;retrain&quot;
      the residual spinal pathways facilitating recovery of locomotor function, and that a
      combination of the two would result in even greater functional recoveries.

    <description>Kunming Locomotor Scale is a 10-grade Roman numeral locomotion scoring system. Grade I, the patient can not stand; grade II, the patient is able to stand with weight support and help in fixing the knee; grade III, the patient is able to stand with weight support; grade IV, the patient is able to walk with wheeled weight support and help in fixing the knee of the weight bearing leg; grade V, the patient is able to walk with wheeled weight support; grade VI, the patient is able to walk with the help of a light four-leg support; grade VII, the patient is able to walk with a pair of crutches; grade VIII, the patient is able to walk with a cane; grade IX, the patient is able to walk without support but staggeringly; and grade X, the patient is able to walk stably without support.</description>

    <description>American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS), as international standards for neurological classification of spinal cord injury, is a 5 point ordinal scale to identify patient's sensory and motor levels, from AIS-A (complete SCI) to AIS-E (normal sensory and motor function).</description>

    <description>All the patients were classified as AIS-A at the time of admission to the clinical center. The MRI was performed in all cases prior to and after the surgery. Surgeries were performed between 12 hours to 30 days after trauma. At 15 days after surgery, with protection of a tailored chest-waist cast made of polyurethane 8 foam for thoracic/lumbar injuries or a neck support for cervical injuries, the patients were encouraged to start weight-supported ambulation training under careful protection by the trainers.</description>

    <description>Surgeries were performed between 12 hours to 30 days after trauma. Internal fixation was implemented once instability of the injured spinal column was confirmed by radiology and exploration during operation. At 15 days after surgery, the patients were encouraged to start weight-supported ambulation training under careful protection by the trainers, the patients were encouraged to start weight-supported ambulation training under careful protection by the trainers. The training program was named &quot;Kunming Locomotor Training Program (KLTP)&quot;formulated by actively walking for a duration of 6 hours per day, 6 days per week for a minimum of 6 months.</description>
