  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More than 5 million skin cancer surgeries are performed each year in the United States with
      80% of tumors appearing on the head and neck. Facial skin cancer diagnosis negatively affects
      patient quality of life (QOL) and treatment of skin cancer creates visible scars early in the
      postoperative period, increases anxiety, and impairs social interactions. We believe that
      these negative psychosocial changes represent an unmet need for additional social support and
      practical guidance. A one-to-one peer support program designed for skin cancer patients could
      provide a focused, cost-effective, patient-centered intervention to improve quality of life
      and increase satisfaction. Comparable one-to-one peer support programs have demonstrated high
      rates of patient satisfaction and positive QOL outcomes in a wide range of conditions. This
      prospective peer support program would be the first of its kind for melanoma and
      keratinocytic skin cancers. Our pilot program was designed in consultation with leading peer
      mentorship program researchers and we will implement a structured system to match volunteer
      mentors with patients. Through qualitative and quantitative data, we will evaluate the
      program's effect on patient QOL at 3 separate intervals: at initial consultation, 1-2 weeks
      post-surgery, and 3 months post-surgery. We hope that this study will enable us to design and
      execute a larger multi-center clinical trial in order to establish a best practice for
      surgeons to usher patients through the postoperative healing process after skin cancer
      surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Skin cancer is a common, often chronic condition that negatively impacts patient quality of
      life. Currently, more than 5 million skin cancer surgeries are performed in the United States
      each year, at a cost of over $8 billion per year. Eighty percent of these tumors occur on the
      head and neck, anatomic sites most visible to society. Recent studies have demonstrated that
      patients have reduced concern about the severity and prognosis of their skin cancer in the
      period immediately following Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS). However, patient QOL related to
      appearance and social interactions is impaired in the weeks following MMS due to elevated
      distress regarding post-surgical physical appearance.

      One-to-one peer support programs benefit both the patient and the mentor. In one-to-one peer
      support programs, individuals previously affected by a disease or condition volunteer to
      provide support to current patients in a loosely structured, mentorship setting. Peer mentors
      provide mentees with social and emotional support as well as practical guidance on health
      system navigation. Similar peer mentorship programs with burn patients who had significant
      changes to outward physical appearance resulted in positive experiences for both mentee and
      mentor. Notable mentee feedback included the formation of an immediate connection with a peer
      supporter and feelings of &quot;automatic trust&quot; even after previously seeing a mental health
      professional for their care. Mentors described their participation in peer programs as a
      source for continued learning and inspiration for their own recovery.

      One-to-one peer support is a cost-effective, well-received intervention that increases
      patient satisfaction and objective QOL measures across many fields. Outcome measurements of
      one-to-one peer mentorship programs have demonstrated high rates of patient satisfaction and
      positive psychological outcomes in patients suffering from diabetes, breast cancer, prostate
      cancer, colon cancer, and gynecologic cancers. The operating cost of peer support mentorship
      is low, and these programs can further relieve the health care system by reallocating access
      to patient support services to a community level.
