  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double blind study with competitive enrolment, aimed to enroll a total
      of 70 patients with a diagnosis of primary open angle glaucoma (POAG).

      Patients, after signing the Informed Consent, will enter into a 1- week screening phase
      during which the baseline tests will be conducted.

      Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the following groups:

        -  group A of 35 patients treated with pressure lowering drugs and placebo;

        -  group B of 35 patients with pressure lowering drugs and COQUN oral formulation 100 mg
           BID.

          -  Patients with Primary Open Angle Glaucoma (POAG) stage early-moderate according to
             Hodapp-Parrish-Anderson criteria (MD less than -12 dB)

          -  Patients must be diagnosed with POAG at least 1 year before the screening visit in
             this study.

          -  Anamnesis with at least 1 value of Intraocular pressure (IOP) &gt;21mmHg documented any
             time prior the initiation of the stable treatment with anti-hypertensive topical
             drugs.

          -  Patients affected by POAG and under stable treatment with anti-hypertensive topical
             drugs in the previous 6 months prior to enrolment to maintain IOP ≤18 mmHg.

          -  Corrected visual acuity (using ETDRS tables) ≥ 8/10

          -  Transparent dioptric means to allow the examination of the OCT &gt;25 μm.

             is being considered).

          -  No surgical intervention for cataract in the previous 3 months prior to enrolment.

          -  Eye inflammatory conditions (uveitis) diagnosed any time in the patient's history.

          -  Treatment with topical or systemic neuroprotective agents different from CoQ10. These
             patients can be admitted in the study after at least a 1 month of wash-out period.

          -  Treatment with warfarin.

          -  Treatment with miotic drugs able to influence the visual field.

          -  Treatment with systemic or topical steroids.

          -  Refractive defects beyond the 5 spherical diopters, both positive and negative and
             over 3 cylindrical.

          -  Any clinically significant history of serious digestive tract, liver, kidney,
