      This research is studying the effect of Antibody-Drug Conjugate Sacituzumab Govitecan in
      Combination with the Poly (Adenosine Diphosphate [ADP]-Ribose) Polymerase (PARP) Inhibitor
      Talazoparib in Patients with Metastatic Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.

      This is a Phase I/II clinical trial. You are being asked to participate in the Phase I
      portion of the study. A Phase I clinical trial tests the safety of an investigational drug
      and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational drug to use for further
      studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.

      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved sacituzumab govitecan as a
      treatment for any disease.

      The FDA has not approved talazoparib for this specific disease, but it has been approved for
      other uses in breast cancer.

      Sacituzumab govitecan is an antibody-drug conjugate which means it's made up of an antibody
      attached to an anticancer drug. An antibody is a protein normally made by the immune system
      (the system in the body that fights off diseases). Sacituzumab govitecan is believed to work
      by binding the antibody portion of the drug to the tumor(s) while the anticancer drug portion
      works to prevent the cancer cells from growing/spreading.

      Talazoparib belongs to a group of drugs called PARP inhibitors. PARP is a protein that is
      involved with repairing damaged DNA (the genetic material of cells). Talazoparib is believed
      to work by inhibiting (stopping) the PARP proteins from working in the cancer cells so that
      the cancer cannot fix its damaged DNA.

      The investigators believe that the combination of sacituzumab govitecan and talazoparib may
      help stop the cancer from growing and spreading by administering an anticancer drug directly
      to the cancerous tumor(s) through sacituzumab govitecan and by stopping the cancer's cells
      from fixing its damaged DNA through talazoparib.

               -  On screening, inability to determine the QTcF interval on the ECG (i.e.:
                  unreadable or not interpretable) or QTcF &gt;450 screening ECG.

          -  HIV-positive participants on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible. These
             participants are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with
             marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in participants
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the safety of study medications is
             not established in pregnant women.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of
             becoming pregnant, or fertile men, unless they are using highly effective methods of
             contraception throughout the study and after study drug discontinuation (till 8 weeks
             in women and six months in males, post-study). Male patient should not donate sperm
             while on treatment and up to 6 months after last dose. Women are considered
             post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have had 12 months of
             natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age
             appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral
             oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago.
             In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has
             been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child
             bearing potential. Highly effective contraception methods include:

               -  Total abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of
                  the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
                  contraception.

               -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without
                  hysterectomy), total hysterectomy, or tubal ligation at least six weeks before
                  taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive
                  status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment

               -  Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or placement
                  of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS), or other forms of
                  hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate &lt;1%), for
                  example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception.

               -  In case of use of oral contraception, women should have been stable on the same
                  pill for a minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment. Note: While oral
                  contraceptives are allowed, they should be used in conjunction with a barrier
                  method of contraception due to unknown effect of drug-drug interaction.
