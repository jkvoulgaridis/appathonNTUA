  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lycium barbarum, a traditional Chinese herbal medicine, is a commonly used herb in the
      traditional Chinese pharmacopoeia . Its main active ingredient, lycium barbarum
      polysaccharide (LBP), is reported to have neuroprotective effects. Animal studies suggested
      that LBP has neuroprotective effect on optic ganglion cells. In animal models of depression,
      LBP can improve depressive symptom by improving synaptic plasticity. However, its clinical
      effect remains to be studied. We will conduct a 6-week double-blind, randomized,
      placebo-con-trolled trial in people with subthreshold depression.The purpose of this clinical
      trial is to investigate the efficacy of LBP in people with subthreshold depression.
