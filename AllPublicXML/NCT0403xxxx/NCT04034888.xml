  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exercise can be beneficial for older adults by promoting health, delaying or reversing
      functional decline, reducing chronic disease risk, decreasing falls, increasing strength and
      stamina, improving ability to perform activities of daily living (ADL), and improving overall
      quality of life (QOL). Developing and implementing exercise programs for homebound older
      adults for whom traveling to routine clinic-based appointments may not be feasible or safe
      becomes critical. Homebound, older adults are at increased risk for recurrent
      hospitalization, use of emergency care, nursing home placement, and death. Indeed, one study
      shows patients had significantly higher risk of being admitted into a hospital or nursing
      home, higher mortality, and higher health care expenditures compared to those in a comparison
      group. The purpose of this pilot is to develop and implement a pragmatic and feasible
      intervention to improve physical functioning in older homebound adults with chronic mobility
      disability. Unfortunately, little is known about the feasibility and utility of pragmatic
      home-based exercise rehabilitation in older adults with severe mobility limitations.

      The investigators propose to develop and implement an intervention targeting functional
      limitations in this population with mobility disability. Our overall goals are to maintain
      and restore physical functioning and QOL for older, homebound adults. This research carries
      direct benefits for these patients as even modest improvements in disabled older adults may
      translate into significantly better QOL, reduce disability, minimize or reverse gradual
      declines related to serious chronic disease, resort functional independence, and increase
      community living capacity. Thus, the specified objectives of finalizing and implementing a
      sustainable home-based exercise program have practical implications for disabled older
      adults. Were homebound patients even slightly higher in terms of functional capacity, it
      could provide a partial degree of functional independence, impacting QOL for both patients
      and caregivers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop and implement a pragmatic and feasible intervention
      to improve physical functioning in older homebound adults with chronic mobility disability.
      Unfortunately, little is known about the feasibility and utility of pragmatic home-based
      exercise rehabilitation in older adults with severe mobility limitations.

      The Specific Aims and Hypotheses of this proposal are:

      Specific Aim #1: Using human-centered design methodologies, work with providers and patients
      to develop a feasible multi-component home exercise program targeting mobility, strength, and
      performance of task-oriented ADLs. Feasibility will be determined by assessing adherence and
      retention to the developed exercise program.

      Hypothesis 1: The investigators hypothesize that a task-based exercise intervention can be
      feasibly delivered in the homes of homebound, older adults.

      Specific Aim #2: Perform a feasibility study to better assess feasibility and determine the
      effect(s) of the home-based intervention created in Aim 1 on functional outcomes (primary
      outcome SPPB), mobility, and QOL changes in homebound older adults with mobility disability.

      Hypothesis 2: The investigators hypothesize that the developed 12-week multi-component
      exercise intervention will improve performance of basic ADLs, functional mobility, and QOL;
      as well as outcomes related to patient satisfaction, emergency department visits, and
      hospitalization.

    <description>HEX is a customized exercise program with components including: 1) controlled flexibility movements; 2) progressive ADL training focusing on bed mobility, bed to chair transfers, and indoor walking; 3) task-specific seated resistance training to improve ability to get out of bed and; 4) and balance exercises. Participants will be expected to perform their HEX program at least 2 times/week in their home and all individualized exercise sessions will be supervised by an Exercise Physiologist. Each exercise has four levels of difficulty, which will be progressed as tolerated throughout the 12-weeks. Seated resistance exercises were designed to target all the major muscle groups and will include the following: arm curls, shoulder raises (lateral/front), overhead arm raise, wrist curls, leg extensions, hip flexion, hip ab/adduction, sit-to-stands, torso rotation, and marching.</description>
