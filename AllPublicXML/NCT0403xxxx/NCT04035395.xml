  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to implement a system of integrated health care that provides a
      continuum of care for those with diabetes. This study will use a randomized behavioral
      intervention trial experimental design to compare participants receiving the enhanced
      delivery of integrated behavioral care with nonparticipants receiving the usual care until
      after the study period, at which time they will be offered access to expansion services.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Rio Grande Valley (RGV), located on the northern bank of the Rio Grande River that
      separates the United States from Mexico, is home to more than 1.2 million residents,
      representing about 5% of Texas' general population. The SyV 2.0 program focuses on the system
      of health care in the lower RGV, comprised of a predominantly Mexican American, low-income,
      underserved community with chronic disease rates and related mortality that exceed those in
      most other regions of the state and the nation. Based on a cohort study of 2,000 Mexican
      American adults from this region between 2003 to 2008 called the Cameron County Hispanic
      Cohort (CCHC), researchers estimated diabetes prevalence to be 31% and 81% of the population
      were either obese (49%) or overweight (32%). Residents in this region suffer from
      disproportionate health disparities that stem from extreme poverty (40% of families live
      below federal poverty line), lower levels of educational attainment (9.9 average years of
      education), and inadequate access to basic health care needs, income, and education.

      The SyV 2.0 program is an expansion of SyV 1.0, a program for individuals with uncontrolled
      diabetes. Enhancement includes two major initiatives: clinical-based services and
      community-based services. Clinical based services will include medication therapy management
      for participants with low levels of medication adherence and care coordination which includes
      behavioral health services for participants who do not qualify for services with the mental
      health authority, but need behavioral health support. Community-based services will include
      peer led support groups and access to community-based lifestyle programs (capacity building
      cooking classes and an obesity awareness program). Clinical-based and community-based
      services will be directed by a multidisciplinary care team and will be customized to meet
      each participant's individualized needs.

      The proposed study does not pose any major risks or dangers beyond what a normal physician
      visit would present. Benefits include improved control of chronic disease (diabetes,
      hypertension, and obesity), a reduction in depression, increased access to behavioral
      healthcare services, and improved adult functioning and quality of life for current SyV 1.0
      participants.

      This study will contribute to the investigator's understanding of how to increase access to
      health care services and treatment among those individuals with diabetes, namely, low-income,
      Hispanic communities.

        -  This study was not funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). It was funded by
           two Texas foundations, Methodist Healthcare Ministries and Valley Baptist Legacy
           Foundation.

    <measure>Rate of Change in Quality of Life: Duke Health Profile</measure>
    <time_frame>12 month period</time_frame>
    <description>Participants who receive SyV 2.0 will experience a change in their quality of life, as measured by the Duke Health Profile, after 12 months compared to participants who receive SyV 1.0. The Duke Health Profile is a 17-item generic questionnaire instrument designed to measure adult self-reported functional health status quantitatively during a one-week time window. The Duke Health profile has 11 scales, six of which measure function and five of which measure dysfunction. Scores range from 0 to 100. For scales measuring function, the higher the score, the more functional the person being evaluated. For scales measuring dysfunction, the higher the score, the more dysfunctional the person being evaluated. The general health domain score, a composite of the physical health, mental health and social health domain scores, was utilized as the primary quality of life indicator in our analyses.</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to the intervention group will receive the SyV 2.0 program, which in addition to standard diabetes management services of SyV 1.0 services, could include MTM services, care coordination by a team of behavioral health care providers, and/or referrals to community-based lifestyle programs, as determined by their tailored care plan. The participant will be seen by evaluation staff to complete baseline assessment for the study. Then, an individualized care plan will be developed by SyV 1.0 interdisciplinary staff and reviewed by the chronic care case management team. The care plan will include information on additional services provided by UTHealth such as, but not limited to, behavioral health services, or pharmacy services. Each participant will receive an individualized care plan and when applicable, referrals to community-based programs. Evaluation staff and CHWs will make follow-up appointments for the participant depending on their care plan.</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to the usual care group will receive the SyV 1.0 program which includes community based program referrals (excluding intervention programs) and home-based visits from CHWs. These participants will also receive the standard follow-up from UTHealth staff such as a phone call, an information session as per their treatment plan, and /or a onetime mailing of information about the importance of following their treatment plan. Before implementation begins, additional details about standard care will be ascertained from partner organizations to better understand how these differ from the treatment conditions of the intervention group. Once the participant completes 12 months in the study, 2.0 services will be initiated.</description>

    <intervention_name>Peer-led Support Group</intervention_name>
    <description>The Viviendo Saludable pláticas (or talks) connected Salud y Vida participants living with diabetes together. These talks served as a forum for Salud y Vida participants to share their knowledge and experiences, including some that many health workers, friends, or family do not have. Viviendo Saludable helped participants develop better strategies for managing their diabetes in their daily life. The Viviendo Saludable pláticas complement and enhance the other services by helping participants create a network of emotional, social, and practical support needed to manage diabetes and stay healthy over the long term. Classes met once a week for one hour at locations central to participants' homes.</description>
