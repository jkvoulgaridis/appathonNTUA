  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, disabling disease characterized by a
      progressive and irreversible deterioration in respiratory function, resulting in impaired
      quality of life (QoL) and patient dependence.

      The factors involved in the alteration of QoL in these patients are the physical symptoms
      related to fibrosis (dyspnea, cough, fatigue) and psychological symptoms (anxiety and
      depression) as well as social, relational and financial factors, the experience of the
      disease and disability, the time required for diagnosis, the information received, and the
      initiation of a treatment such as oxygen therapy.

      Caregivers primarily in chronic diseases (so-called natural or informal caregivers) provide
      partial or total assistance to a dependent person for activities of daily living for care,
      social support and maintenance of autonomy, administrative procedures, psychological support,
      communication, domestic activities or even financial assistance, often despite their own
      exhaustion and health issues.

      Recent studies on the QoL of patient-caregiver dyads in IPF through semi-structured
      interviews highlight the role of previously identified factors in caregivers as well.

      Investigators want to confirm the data obtained in a large population of patients and their
      caregivers in order to evaluate the QoL of caregivers and confirm the impact of its various
      factors on it in order to suggest ways to improve the lives of both the caregiver and the
      patient.

      The hypothesis of investigators' work is that the QoL of caregivers of patients with IPF is
      altered, particularly by the patient's functional symptoms (cough, dyspnea, fatigue, anxiety
      and depression), the arrival of oxygen therapy in the home and the caregiver's social
      isolation.

      Investigators believe that there are links and interactions between the caregiver's and
      patient's quality of life and therefore have an impact on the patient's care.

             to the diagnostic criteria of the 2011 ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT recommendations, for which a
             follow-up is planned or is in progress

          -  Patient with a validated IPF diagnosis in multidisciplinary discussion in a Competence
