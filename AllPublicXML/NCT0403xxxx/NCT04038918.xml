  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of progressive muscle
      relaxation (PMR) exercise on pain, functional outcomes and muscle strength in patients with
      TKA. Seventy patients with TKA are going to randomly assigned to intervention group and
      control group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is applied in end-stage osteoarthritis to reduce pain, improve
      functional ability, and provide greater health related quality of life. However, evidence
      showed that presence of severe pain, impaired functional outcomes and reduced muscle strength
      continue up to 6 to 12 month after surgery. Relaxation techniques such as progressive muscle
      relaxation exercise and rhythmic breathing have long been used in treating postoperative pain
      and for various health-related purposes. Although the number of studies that include
      relaxation techniques in treating postoperative pain is increasing, there isn't any study
      that investigate the effectiveness of progressive muscle relaxation exercise on pain,
      functional outcomes and muscle strength in patients with TKA.

      The aim is to investigate the effectiveness of progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) exercise
      on pain, functional outcomes and muscle strength in patients with TKA.

    <measure>The Numeric Pain Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Postoperative three months</time_frame>
    <description>The Numeric Rating Scale (NPRS), reliable and valid instrument, is commonly used to determine for pain intensity in rehabilitation. The activity and resting pain level in the knee joints will be evaluated by NPRS from 0 to 10 (0 refers to no pain, 10 refers to worst pain).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Iowa Level of Assistance Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Postoperative three months</time_frame>
    <description>This test assesses the patient's ability to perform four functional activities, namely, supine to sitting on the edge of the bed, sitting on the edge of the bed to standing, walking 4.57 meters. The scoring of these activities is done as independent 6 points, observational aid 5 points, minimum help 4 points, medium help 3 points, maximum help 2 points, fail 1 point and untested 0 points. Higher values represent a better outcome.
Speed scoring is done by evaluating the walking speed at a distance of 13.4 meters (44 steps). 20 seconds (sec) and below are recorded as 0, 21-30 sec 1, 31-40 sec 2, 41-50 3, 51-60 sec 4, 61-70 sec 5 and 70 sec. Higher values represent a worse outcome</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Hospital for Special Surgery Knee Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Postoperative three months</time_frame>
    <description>Hospital for Special Surgery knee score. A scoring system evaluation of pain, mobility, range of motion and deforming of the knee giving 0-100 points.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>10 meter walk speed test</measure>
    <time_frame>Postoperative three months</time_frame>
    <description>10MWT testing distance require 5-m acceleration and 5-m deceleration space, with the inner 10-m zone being the distance over which gait is timed. Before the test, patients should be asked to walk as fast as possible and allowed to use assistive devices (cane, walker) if needed. Patients start to walk and accelerate in the 20-m. The stopwatch is started as soon as the patient's leg pass over the starting line and stopped the patient's leg pass over the 10-m sign.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Timed Up and Go (TUG)</measure>
    <time_frame>Postoperative three months</time_frame>
    <description>To determine fall risk and measure the progress of balance, sit to stand, and walking. The patient starts in a seated position. The patient stands up upon therapist's command walks 3 meters, turns around, walks back to the chair and sits down. The time stops when the patient is seated. The subject is allowed to use an assistive device.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Muscle Strength</measure>
    <time_frame>Postoperative three months</time_frame>
    <description>Strength of knee muscles will be evaluated by hand-held dynamometer.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Range of Motion</measure>
    <time_frame>Postoperative three months</time_frame>
    <description>Each patient's active (unassisted) range of knee extension and flexion will be measured, using a goniometer with the patient in the supine position.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Postoperative three months</time_frame>
    <description>The HADS aims to measure symptoms of anxiety and depression and consists of 14 items, seven items for the anxiety subscale (HADS Anxiety) and seven for the depression subscale (HADS Depression). Each item is scored on a response-scale with four alternatives ranging between 0 and 3. After adjusting for six items that are reversed scored, all responses are summed to obtain the two subscales. The scoring of HADS is done as normal 0-7 point, borderline case 8-10 points, abnormal case 11-21. Higher values represent a worse outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK)</measure>
    <time_frame>Postoperative three months</time_frame>
    <description>The term kinesiophobia refers to a fear of pain with movement - i.e., movements which a patient is hesitant to perform due to fear that the movement will elicit pain. The TSK has been used to assess kinesiophobia in patients with a wide variety of conditions, such as knee disorders. The TSK consists of 17 questions. A score of 17 is the lowest possible score, and indicates no kinesiophobia or negligible. A score of 68 is the highest possible score and indicates extreme fear of pain with movement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>12-Item Short Form Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>Postoperative three months</time_frame>
    <description>SF-12 Health Survey is a shorter version of the SF-36 Health Survey that uses just 12 questions to measure functional health and well-being from the patient's point of view. The SF-12 is a practical, reliable and valid measure of physical and mental health and is particularly useful in large population health surveys or for applications that combine a generic and disease-specific health survey.</description>
