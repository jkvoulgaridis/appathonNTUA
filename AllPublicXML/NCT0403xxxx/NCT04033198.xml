      Aims of this study are :

        -  Estimate the incidence of A.A. in patients above age of 30 y in 4 age groups .

        -  Correlate between different clinical aspects and histopathological results.

        -  Determine rate of negative appendectomy in those patients.

      Acute appendicitisis the clinical condition which refer to inflammation of the vermiform
      appendix1. It is the most common abdominal emergency2,3,4 .it accounts for more than 40,000
      hospital admissions in England every year 5 . Approximately 8% of the population in Western
      countries would have appendicitis during their life 6 .In the United States, the estimated
      incidenc of acute appendicitis is 11 cases per 10,000 population 5 . However, in South
      Africa, the incidencewas estimated to be less than 9 per 100,000 6 .Appendectomy is
      considered the most common emergency surgical procedure worldwide6,8 ,9. The cause of acute
      appendicitis is unknown but it is multifactorial; luminal obstruction , dietary and familial
      factors have been suggested 5 . Fecoliths are the most common cause of obstruction. It was
      demonstrated that the mean duration of abdominal pain in patients with gangrenous appendix is
      46.2 hours and 70.9 hs for perforated 7 .

      The peak incidence of acute appendicitis is at the age of 10 to 30 years 6,10. There are
      special features for appendicitis according to age 1. A.A is primarily a disease of the
      younger population, with only 5-10% of cases occurring in elderly people, but the incidence
      of acute appendicitis in elderly began to increase with the increase in life expectancy14.
      Older patients with acute abdominal pain are high-risk patients, unlike their younger
      counterparts15 . Morbidity and mortality rates are greater in elderly due to atypical
      presentations and delay in diagnosis leading to increase rate of perforation and
      intra-abdominal infection.. They need to be clinically evaluated by experienced surgeons
      within a narrow time margin14,15.

        The study includes 70 patients with age above than thirty years old. The patients are
        divided into 4 age groups :group 1 (30-39 y) , group 2(40-49), group 3(50-59) and group4
        (patients older than 60 y) .They were admitted to our emergency hospital with features of
        acute appendicitis. A detailed history was taken and clinical examination of the patient
        was carried out at the time of admission .Data was collected regarding investigations (CBC
        , GUE , US). Appendectomy done for the 70 patient,their operative findings along with any
        complications as well as histopathological findings were recorded
