  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Introduction: Clinical practice guidelines recommend shared decision making (SDM) to
      facilitate goals-of-care discussions. This study will train clinicians about how to use a
      context-adapted decision aid (DA) and SDM to conduct goals-of-care discussions with the
      elderly. The objectives of this study are to: 1) determine if the use of the DA and SDM
      training program: a) increase clinicians' engagement of patients in decision making regarding
      their goals of care; b) increase adoption of evidence-based behaviours regarding
      goals-of-care decision making; and 2) identify patients' most frequent incomprehension,
      concerns, questions and clinicians' opportunities to improve the skills in goals-of-care
      decision making.

      Methods: This study will have three phases. Phase I (May-June 2017) will be a baseline
      evaluation of the current goals-of-care decision making process with elderly patients in a
      single ICU setting (Levis, Quebec). Phase II (July-August 2017) will be an evaluation of the
      goals-of-care decision making process in the same ICU using a DA. Phase III
      (September-December 2017) will be the delivery of an online and in-person training session
      about the use of the DA and about how to conduct discussions about goals-of-care. The study
      will then evaluate the goals-of-care decision making process after completion of the training
      program and using the DA. The investigators will observe and audio- or video-record all
      eligible elderly-intensivist dyads discussing goals of care during each phase. Two
      investigators will analyse the recordings using the OPTION 12 scale (measuring the extent
      that clinicians engage patients in SDM) and the ACCEPT quality indicators (measuring the
      extent to which intensivists engage in best practice goals-of-care discussions). The
      investigators will conduct qualitative content analysis of the video and audio records to
      identify patients' most frequent incomprehension, concerns, questions and clinicians'
      opportunities to improve the goals-of-care decision-making skills.

      Deliverables: This study will produce evidence regarding the impact of a context-adapted DA
      and training program on clinicians' adoption of SDM and other best practice behaviors
      regarding goals-of-care decision making with the elderly, and evidence regarding the most
      frequent patients' incomprehension, concerns, questions and clinicians' opportunities to
      improve the goals-of-care decision-making skills.

    <measure>Observing Patient Involvement in Decision Making (OPTION) scale</measure>
    <time_frame>The OPTION scale will be measured at the earliest possible time during the patients' intensive care stay (eg., first 24 hours after admission or whenever the patient is capable of engaging in a goals-of-care discussion).</time_frame>
    <description>The OPTION scale (12 items) measures the extent that clinicians engage patients in shared decision making. For each item, a score 0 (The behaviour is not observed) to 4 (The behaviour is observed and executed to a high standard) is given. Adding each item's score will arrive at a number between 0 (minimum) and 48 (maximum). The OPTION scale will be measured by two observers rating audio- or video-recordings of goals-of-care discussions conducted by intensivists with their patients at the earliest possible time during the patients intensive care stay. These discussions will be held at the discretion of the attending intensivist when deemed appropriate. Most often these discussions are held at the time of patient admission (first 24 hours) or whenever the patient is capable of engaging in a goals of care discussion (eg., after the patient is extubated and weaned off mechanical ventilation).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Score based on the quality indicators from the Audit of Communication, Care Planning, and Documentation (ACCEPT) study</measure>
    <time_frame>The quality indicators will be measured at the earliest possible time during the patients' intensive care stay (eg., first 24 hours after admission or whenever the patient is capable of engaging in a goals-of-care discussion.</time_frame>
    <description>This measure will be based on 7 of the 34 (ACCEPT) quality indicators that measure the quality of end-of-life communication and decision making: written information provided before discussion about goals of care, poor prognosis shared with patient during the discussion, verification with patient about prior discussions or written documents about the use of life-sustaining treatments, use of information by intensivist about about goals of care to support the decision, verification by the intensivist prior to the discussion of any written advanced directives in the patient's medical record, documentation of the goals of care discussed in medical record after discussion, goals of care documented in the medical chart after discussion consistent with patient's stated preferences. Indicators will be measured by two observers rating audio- or video-recordings. Score is the sum of the quality indicator items divided by the sum of highest possible values of these items on a scale 0% to 100%.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Qualitative content analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>The audio and video recordings will be done at the earliest possible time during the patients' intensive care stay (eg., first 24 hours after admission or whenever the patient is capable of engaging in a goals-of-care discussion.</time_frame>
    <description>Each audio or video recording will be content analysed by a doctoral student and a research assistant using the R language Qualitative Data Analysis (RQDA) package for Qualitative Data Analysis. The aim of this content analysis will be to identify: 1) patients' most frequent incomprehension, concerns, questions and 2) clinicians' opportunities to improve their skills in goals-of-care discussions and decision making.</description>
