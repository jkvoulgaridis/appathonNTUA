  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center behavioral randomized trial with the aim of comparing a group-based
      lifestyle intervention with a self-directed lifestyle intervention on remission of the
      metabolic syndrome over 2 years of follow-up.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to determine the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the
      Group-Based and Self-Directed ELM lifestyle programs when offered on a national level. A
      multi-site randomized trial will be conducted on 600 patients with the metabolic syndrome
      (MetS) by five national sites, each of which will randomize 120 patients to the Group-Based
      or Self-Directed programs. The Group-Based program targets healthy eating, physical activity,
      and stress reduction and is based upon neuroscience studies showing that mindful habits
      provide resilience against the power of emotions to subvert intention, and social science
      studies showing that sustainability is enhanced by support from a health network. The
      Self-Directed program represents enhanced usual care based upon what is currently offered in
      medicine and wearable technology for treatment of adults with MetS and its components. The
      primary outcome is remission of MetS at 2 years. Secondary outcomes include
      cost-effectiveness, vegetable intake, physical activity, and mindful awareness.

    <time_frame>Measured at 24 months following treatment assignment.</time_frame>
    <description>Compare the Group-Based and Self-Directed arms on the proportion of participants who are in remission of the metabolic syndrome (MetS) at 2 years. MetS is defined by the Joint Interim Statement of the IDF, NHLBI, AHA, WHF, IAS, IASO as having 3 or more risk factors for cardiovascular disease. To be considered in remission of MetS the participant must have less than 3 of the following 5 criteria: 1) Waist circumference based on AHA/NHLBI (ATP III) cut points of ≥ 102 cm for men and ≥ 88 cm for women; 2) Fasting triglycerides ≥150 mg/dL or treatment for elevated triglycerides; 3) Fasting HDL cholesterol &lt;40 mg/dL in men or &lt;50 mg/dL in women, or treatment for low HDL; 4) Systolic blood pressure ≥130 m Hg, diastolic blood pressure ≥85 mm Hg, or treatment for hypertension; and 5) Fasting plasma glucose 100-125 mg/dL.
Analysis will be performed on pre-determined subgroups: education, sex, site, weight, BMI, MetS severity, race, income # of comorbidities, self-efficacy, and age.</description>

    <description>The Group-based Program uses an ecologically valid setting in which participants exercise, prepare foods, and eat together to facilitate the emergence of old habits and replace them with healthy alternatives. The intervention team consists of a health psychologist, registered dietitian, and health coach. They co-facilitate group meetings for 15 participants that are held weekly for 3 months, bi-weekly for 3 months, and then monthly in participant-led maintenance meetings. Each session includes: weigh-in and physical activity (20 min), cooking demonstration (20 min), and a shared vegetable dish with discussion (50 min). The maintenance phase (months 7 to 24 post randomization) consists of support and health-related topics of the participants' own choosing. Progress reports with lab results are sent to participants and primary care physicians.</description>

    <description>The Self-Directed lifestyle program represents enhanced usual care based upon what is currently offered in primary care in the United States for lifestyle treatments for adults with metabolic syndrome. Usual care is enhanced by: 1) lifestyle education for management of metabolic syndrome provided in evidence-based tip sheets from nationally recognized organizations; 2) provision of a Fitbit for self-monitoring physical activity; 3) access to a website containing all education materials; and 4) progress report letters with lab results sent to participants and primary care physicians after completion of each assessment.</description>
