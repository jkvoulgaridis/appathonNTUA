  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COPD is a common, preventable and treatable disease associated with an increased chronic
      inflammatory response of the airways and lungs to harmful gases and particles and
      characterized by progressive airflow restriction, which is usually progressive. Exercise
      intolerance is one of the most important outcomes of COPD. Dyspnea and leg fatigue are the
      main symptoms that limit exercise and patients restrict their activity to avoid these
      disturbing conditions. Exercise training is the most appropriate method for improving
      exercise tolerance and muscle function. It is considered and recommended by ERS and ATS as an
      essential component of PR. Endurance training is considered to be one of the most important
      components of the PR program. Walking, running, cycling, stair climbing, dancing are examples
      of endurance exercises. Dance-based exercise training; It is an entertaining method that
      increases physical, functional, cognitive, emotional and social integration. This alternative
      method has frequently been tried in the literature in the treatment of Parkinson's, cancer
      and psychiatric diseases and its effects on functional capacity, balance, and quality of life
      have been demonstrated. The importance of our research; This is the first study to apply
      dance based exercise training in chronic respiratory diseases.

      The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of creative dance based exercise training
      on respiratory, balance and cognitive functions, respiratory and peripheral muscle strength
      and functional capacity in COPD patients.
