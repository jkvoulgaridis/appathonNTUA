  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physicians in charge of medical regulation within French SAMU have to take difficult
      decisions regarding patient's orientation (in or out-of hospital care) but suffer from lack
      of information. Such information usually consist in a simple phone conversation without any
      visual information. Visual assesment of the situation would be of great help, especially for
      traumatized patients.

      Private Ambulance societies all over territory in charge of SAMU 86 now work with
      teletransmission devices allowing photography transmission.

      The objective of the study is to determine if routine use of teletransmitted photography help
      SAMU 86's physians for a better orientation of non-severe traumatized patients, especially by
      avoiding unnecessary transportations to Emergency Departments.
