    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 study to assess safety and tolerability of a single subcutaneous dose of
      Dengusiil in healthy adults of 18 to 45 years of age. In this study, immune response to
      Dengusiil will also be assessed over a period of 6 months and vaccine viremia will also be
      assessed over a period of 12 days after administration of vaccine.

             infection

          3. Seronegative for dengue IgG at screening

          4. Participants who are willing to comply with the requirements of the study protocol and
             attend scheduled visits.

          5. Participants who give written informed consent approved by the Human Research Ethics

          8. Satisfactory baseline medical assessment as assessed by physical examination and
             normal laboratory values or minor variations those are acceptable for study entry.

          9. Participants should agree to not:

               1. donate blood for the purpose of blood transfusion

               2. donate an organ for the purpose of transplantation

               3. to share needles with other people

               4. allow their blood to come in contact with another person's mucous membranes for

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Previous dengue vaccination.

          2. Presence of acute infection in the preceding 14 days or presence of a temperature ≥
             38.0°C, or acute symptoms of infection greater than of &quot;mild&quot; severity on the

             450 mL of blood within the past three months.

          4. Evidence or history of substance abuse including alcohol or previous substance abuse
             within the last year.

          5. Participation or planned participation in a study involving the administration of an

          6. Planned administration of any vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol 4 weeks
             before and after dosing.

          7. History of allergic disease, allergic reactions or known hypersensitivity to any
             component of the study vaccines.

          8. Confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immune-deficient condition.

          9. A family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency.

         10. Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days) of immune-suppressants or other
             immune-modifying agents within six months prior to administration of study vaccine.
             (For corticosteroids, this means prednisone, or equivalent, ≥ 0.5 mg/kg/day; topical
             or inhalable steroids are allowed.)

         11. Laboratory confirmed infection with either hepatitis B virus (HBs Ag positive),
             hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV positive), or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) at
             screening.

         12. Known bleeding disorders.

         13. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months
             preceding the administration of study vaccines or planned administration during the
             study period.

         14. Women who are pregnant, breast-feeding, or considering becoming pregnant.

         15. Any other condition, which in the opinion of the investigator, might interfere with
