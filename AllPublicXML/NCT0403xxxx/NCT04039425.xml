  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the investigator's graduate student research study is to investigate if there
      are significant changes in hair mineral levels in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.

      Visit 1 - Before the start of chemotherapy

        -  Complete a questionnaire about demographics, health, and diet.

        -  Weight and height will be measured.

        -  A small sample of the participant's hair will be collected from the back side of the
           head near the base of the neck. Only the hair in the first inch closest to the scalp
           will be included in the sample. This hair sample will weigh 0.25g to 1g, which is about
           the same weight as one to two regular paper clips.

        -  The participant will be given a food frequency questionnaire

      Visit 2- Approximately 2 months after start of chemotherapy

        -  The participant will complete a questionnaire about their health and diet.

        -  weight and height will be measured

    <intervention_name>Hair cut</intervention_name>
    <description>Use only head hair. Cut samples of hair from back of head (see illustration). Cut hair as close to the scalp as possible. As each piece of hair is cut from the head, save only 3.7 square inches of hair closest to the scalp. According to the Doctors Data Lab, this amount is about enough hair to fill a tablespoon. Cut off and discard the rest. Place the saved hair on the scale. Keep cutting and adding hair to the scale until it tips. Hair collection will be about the weight of one to two paper clips (about 3800 strands). Remove the hair on the scale and put it in the plastic bag. Label the plastic bag with the patient's unique random identification and the date collected. Put the hair into the plastic bag, seal, and send to The Doctor's Data Lab.</description>
