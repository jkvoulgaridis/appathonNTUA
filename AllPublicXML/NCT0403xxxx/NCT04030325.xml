  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study evaluates the relative merit of a multi-component PFI presented in the traditional
      simultaneous delivery (i.e., all components at once) versus a sequential format, wherein
      individual PFI components are delivered one at a time over several weeks to minimize time and
      attention demands for each component.

    <textblock>
      This study builds upon the latest alcohol intervention literature to develop and test the
      next wave of personalized feedback interventions (PFIs) to address harmful alcohol use among
      college students. The purpose of this research is to determine optimal configuration of PFIs
      to take advantage of the clarity and initial impact of single-component PFIs and greater
      effect size and duration of personalized multi-component PFIs. The Investigators seek to
      increase and evaluate engagement with the PFI and text-message materials and boost innovation
      of both content and process of the intervention. In addition to PFI content and delivery, the
      investigators will use qualitative and quantitative methods to determine personal relevance
      of the chosen high-risk events among a sample of students who engage in heavy episodic
      drinking to better understand duration of PFI effects impacted by fluctuations in drinking
      associated with high-risk events. Prior interventions have targeted drinking in general or a
      single high-risk drinking event (e.g., Spring Break), but have not targeted both general and
      event-specific drinking together. These enhanced intervention effects, could have a
      significant impact on risks associated with college student drinking, and can be rapidly
      disseminated and implemented on campuses nationwide to address the public health problem
      posed by heavy episodic drinking among college students.

    <measure>Change from Baseline Alcohol Use at 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months of assessment</time_frame>
    <description>The first primary outcome of this program of research is to assess change in alcohol use from baseline to 6 months utilizing the Daily Drinking Questionnaire. The Daily Drinking Questionnaire assesses typical number of drinks on each of day of a typical week in the past month.
Participants are allowed to enter the number of drinks for each day of the week. Values for each day will be summed together to create a composite score of typical weekly drinking. Minimum value is zero (0) and there is no maximum for the scale. Data will be assessed for outliers.</description>

Participants are allowed to enter the number of drinks for each day of the week. Values for each day will be summed together to create a composite score of typical weekly drinking. Minimum value is zero (0) and there is no maximum for the scale. Data will be assessed for outliers.</description>

    <description>The third primary outcome of this program of research is to assess change in alcohol use from baseline to 18 months utilizing the Daily Drinking Questionnaire. The Daily Drinking Questionnaire assesses typical number of drinks on each of day of a typical week in the past month.
Participants are allowed to enter the number of drinks for each day of the week. Values for each day will be summed together to create a composite score of typical weekly drinking. Minimum value is zero (0) and there is no maximum for the scale. Data will be assessed for outliers.</description>

    <description>The fourth primary outcome of this program of research is to assess change in alcohol use from baseline to 24 months utilizing the Daily Drinking Questionnaire. The Daily Drinking Questionnaire assesses typical number of drinks on each of day of a typical week in the past month.
Participants are allowed to enter the number of drinks for each day of the week. Values for each day will be summed together to create a composite score of typical weekly drinking. Minimum value is zero (0) and there is no maximum for the scale. Data will be assessed for outliers.</description>
