  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lesions of herpes labialis are caused by the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and cause
      pain and aesthetic compromise. It is characterized by the formation of small vesicles that
      coalesce and rupture forming extremely painful ulcers, that evolve to crusts, dry
      desquamations until their complete remission. Currently, the treatment of these lesions is
      done with acyclovir. Although it diminishes the symptomatology, it causes viral resistance
      and does not prevent the recurrence of the lesions. It is known that photodynamic therapy
      (PDT) has numerous advantages, among them: the reduction of the time of remission, and does
      not cause resistance.

      A total of 30 patients with herpes labialis in the prodromal stage of vesicles, ulcers, and
      crusts will be selected to participate in the study and randomized into two groups: G1
      control and G2 experimental. After signing informed consent, patients in group G1 will
      undergo the standard gold treatment for cold sores with acyclovir and simulated PDT
      treatment. Patients in the experimental G2 group will be treated simulating the gold standard
      treatment of herpes labialis (placebo) and PDT.

      Lesions of herpes labialis are caused by the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and cause
      pain and aesthetic compromise. It is characterized by the formation of small vesicles that
      coalesce and rupture forming extremely painful ulcers, that evolve to crusts, dry
      desquamations until their complete remission. Currently, the treatment of these lesions is
      done with acyclovir. Although it diminishes the symptomatology, it causes viral resistance
      and does not prevent the recurrence of the lesions. It is known that photodynamic therapy
      (PDT) has numerous advantages, among them: the reduction of the time of remission, and does
      not cause resistance.

      Materials and methods: A total of 30 patients with herpes labialis in the prodromal stage of
      vesicles, ulcers, and crusts will be selected to participate in the study and randomized into
      two groups: G1 control and G2 experimental. After signing TCLE and TA, patients in group G1
      will undergo the standard gold treatment for cold sores with acyclovir and simulated PDT
      treatment. Patients in the experimental G2 group will be treated simulating the gold standard
      treatment of herpes labialis (placebo) and PDT. In all patients will be collected saliva
      samples for analysis of cytokines, and will be performed exfoliative cytology in the lesions.
      The pain will be assessed through a pain scale and a questionnaire of quality of life-related
      to oral health (Ohip- 14) will be given to them. Patients will continue to be followed up
      after 7 days, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year and, if there is a recurrence of the
      lesion, they will contact the researchers.

    <masking>Double (Participant, Investigator)</masking>
    <masking_description>Only the researcher responsible for performing the treatments (which will open the envelopes of the randomization) will know which treatment was assigned to each patient. The identification of each group will be revealed only after the statistical analysis of the data for all those involved in the study by this researcher. Therefore, the researcher responsible for data collection, the microbiologist and the statistician will be blind regarding the treatments assigned to the groups. The patient will also be blind to the type of treatment performed, since the treatment of the lesion will be identical in both groups and the treatment with PDT will be simulated in the control group. Aciclovir placebo will be used in the experimental group, so the patient will not know which treatment will be effective.</masking_description>

    <description>The patients will receive an agent with the same vehicle as methylene blue to mimic irrigation with the photosensitizer and the laser will be switched off at the time of application. The placebo PDT procedures will be performed on the lesion: Application of methylene blue placebo with a carpule syringe and needle (with stop and without bevel) inside the lesions; 1 minute of pre-irradiation will be expected. The irradiations will be performed with the same device positioned in the same way and at the same time of application, however, the laser will be turned off. The beep sound will be recorded and turned on during application to blind treatment to the patient. The patient will receive a catheter with acyclovir cream and will be advised to spread on the lesions four times a day for 7 days, which will be their return for reevaluation. It will be washed in abundance with saline (saline solution) until the total removal of the placebo from the photosensitizer.</description>

    <description>Patients will be treated with photodynamic therapy and will receive a placebo ointment simulating acyclovir cream. If the lesions are in the vesicle phase, they will be ruptured with a sterile needle. The methylene blue solution at 0.005% concentration will be gently placed on the lesions. Application of methylene blue on the lesions.1 minute of pre-irradiation will be expected. The irradiations will be performed with the Laser Duo® with a wavelength of 660 nm, with a power of 100 mW(milliwatts), the energy density of 300 J / cm², with the energy of 3 J (joules) in the center of the lesion for 30 seconds. The laser will be positioned in direct contact with the lesion, perpendicular, applied centrally to each lesion with energy per point of 3J. Wash in abundance with saline solution until the removal of the photosensitizer is complete. Patients will receive a tube with a placebo cream simulating aciclovir and the same will be advised to spread the cream 4 times per day for 7 days.</description>

    <description>Patients will receive Photodynamic Therapy (PDT), irradiations will be performed with the Laser Duo® red laser diode (MMOptics, São Carlos, SP, Brazil) with a wavelength of 660 nm, with a power of 100 mW, the energy density of 300 J / cm², with energy of 3 J in the center of the lesion for 30 seconds. The laser will be positioned in direct contact with the lesion, perpendicular, applied centrally to each isolated lesion that presents with fixed energy per point of 3J. Wash in abundance with saline solution until the removal of the photosensitizer is complete. All treatment proposed in group 1 (simulation of PDT + delivery of aciclovir cream) in each patient will be concluded in a single session. Treatment for group 2 (PDT + placebo cream) will also be completed in a single session. All possible adverse effects will be noted and qualified during the treatment protocol and maintenance period (3/3 months) using the questionnaire developed for this protocol.</description>
