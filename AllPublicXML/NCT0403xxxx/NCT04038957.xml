      A clinical study to investigate the effect of an investigational drug as an added medication
      to an antipsychotic, in adults with schizophrenia, as measured positron emission tomography
      (PET) imaging . This study is accepting male and female participants between 18 years old -45
      years old who have been diagnosed with schizophrenia. This study will be conducted in 2
      locations in the UK. The study will last approximately 14 months.

      This is a single-site, open-label, flexibly-dosed study evaluating the effect on brain
      dopamine synthesis capacity as measured by 18F-DOPA PET imaging of adjunctive open-label
      administration of SEP-363856 (50 to 75 mg/day) over 2 weeks in adults with schizophrenia. The
      study will consist of 3 periods: Screening (up to 28 days), Treatment (2 weeks), and a
      Follow-up visit

             (hematology, serum chemistry urinalysis, lipid panel, coagulation panel, thyroid
             panel, and serum prolactin).

          -  Subject has had a stable living arrangement at the time of screening and agrees to
             return to a similar living arrangement after discharge. This criterion is not meant to
             exclude subjects who have temporarily left a stable living arrangement (eg, due to
             psychosis). Such subjects remain eligible to participate in this study. Chronically
             homeless subjects should not be enrolled.

          -  Subject must agree to comply with all medication restrictions for the required length

             specific plan and intent) on the C-SSRS at or during the Screening period (ie, in the
             past one month) and/or Day 1 (ie, since last visit).

             2. Subject does not tolerate venipuncture or has poor venous access that would cause

             3. Subject is currently participating in, or has participated in, a study with an

                  8 Subject has a presence or history of a medically diagnosed, clinically
                  significant psychiatric disorder (including intellectual disability, major
                  depressive disorder with psychosis, and bipolar disorder) other than
                  schizophrenia (medically diagnosed schizoaffective disorder or schizophreniform
                  disorder will be allowed).

                  9. Subject tests positive for drugs of abuse at screening, however, a positive
                  test for barbiturates, opiates, benzodiazepines or methadone may not result in
                  exclusion of subjects if the Investigator determines that the positive test is as
                  a result of prescription medicine(s). In the event a subject tests positive
                  cannabinoids (tetrahydrocannabinol), the Investigator will evaluate the subject's
                  ability to abstain from using this substance during the study. This information
                  will be discussed with the Medical Monitor prior to study enrollment.

                  the Investigator's judgment.

                  to antipsychotic treatment defined as a failure to respond to 4 or more marketed
                  antipsychotic agents, given at an adequate dose as per labeling and for an
                  adequate duration (lifetime).

                  14. Subject is receiving an antipsychotic medication at a dose above the maximum
                  labeled dose (country-specific) dose at or during the 3 for less than 12 weeks
                  prior to the PET scan at the screening visit

                  15. Subject has received clozapine treatment within 120 days of planned PET scan
                  at screening.

                  16. Subject has received electroconvulsive therapy treatment within the 3 months

                  contained in the study drug formulation or to carbidopa or entacapone.

                  18. Subject has any clinically significant abnormal laboratory values as
                  determined by the Investigator (hematology, serum chemistry, urinalysis, lipid
                  panel, coagulation panel, thyroid panel, and serum prolactin). (Note: abnormal
                  findings of questionable significance will be discussed with the Medical Monitor
                  prior to including subject).

                  19. Subject demonstrates evidence of acute hepatitis, clinically significant
                  chronic hepatitis, or evidence of clinically significant impaired hepatic

                  20. Subject has bilirubin greater than or equal to 1.5 x upper limit of normal
                  (ULN) with the exception that isolated bilirubin greater than 1.5 x ULN is
                  acceptable if bilirubin is fractioned and direct bilirubin less than 35% at
                  screening.

                  21. Subject has a serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN) or serum creatinine (Cr) value

                  is longer, or anticipates the need for any disallowed medication during their
                  participation in this study (exception: female subjects who are taking oral,
                  patch, or intrauterine device [IUD] hormonal contraceptives, or progestin implant
                  or injection).
