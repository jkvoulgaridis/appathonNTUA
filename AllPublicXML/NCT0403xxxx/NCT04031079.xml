      The aim of this project is to evaluate whether use of wearable tech increases physical
      activity in patients participating in inpatient rehabilitation for overweight and obesity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a global epidemic with profound consequences for individuals and societies.
      Physical exercise is important for weight reduction and weight loss maintenance. Use of
      wearable tech might facilitate physical activity. Here it will be evaluated whether use of
      wearable tech that gives feedback about the user`s activity level, increases physical
      activity in people participating in inpatient rehabilitation for overweight and obesity. The
      control group will be wearing the same wearable tech as the intervention group, but they will
      not receive any feedback about their activity level.

      The feedback application will give participants in the intervention group information about
      the number of PAI they earn each week. PAI is short for Personal Activity Intelligence. One
      earns PAI points every time heart rate increases: The higher heart rate, the faster one earns
      PAI. Previous research have shown that those who achieve 100 PAI or more every week over
      time, live for an average of more than eight years longer than others.

      During the study all participants will take part in a traditional inpatient rehabilitation
      program (lifestyle modification program). The program consist of three periods at the
      rehabilitation center with time at home in-between. The study will take place during two
      periods at the center and one period at home. Time spent on physical activity and number of
      earned PAI's will be counted during the period at home.
