  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates an association between different dosage and the antidepressant efficacy
      of theta burst stimulation in patients with treatment-resistant depression. In a double-blind
      design, All patients are randomized to three groups, i.e. standardized dosage intermittent
      theta-burst stimulation treatment, high dosage intermittent theta-burst stimulation treatment
      or sham treatment.
