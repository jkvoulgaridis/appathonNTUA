  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postprandial glycemic excursions are major determinants of overall glycemic control in type 1
      diabetes. Carbohydrate content of ingested meals is the main determinant of post-meal glucose
      excursion. Accurate carbohydrate counting is a critical aspect of managing postprandial blood
      glucose levels. accurate carbohydrate counting is considered by patients as a significant
      burden and frustrating task.

      The closed-loop system (CLS) is composed of three components: glucose sensor to read glucose
      levels, insulin pump to infuse insulin and a dosing mathematical algorithm to decide on the
      required insulin dosages based on the sensor's readings.

      The objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of two strategies to regulate glucose
      levels in outpatient settings in adults with type 1 diabetes: 1) single-hormone CLS with
      rapid acting insulin analogue combined with carbohydrate counting; 2) single-hormone CLS with
      rapid acting insulin analogue combined with simplified qualitative meal-size estimation.

    <description>Participants will be required to enter an estimate of the carbohydrate content of their meal into the phone. Insulin boluses will be calculated based on grams of carbohydrates and participant's insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio. Carbohydrate-matching full prandial bolus will be given 5 to 10 minutes before the meal.</description>

    <description>A pre-meal partial prandial bolus will be given 5-10 minutes before the meal. The partial bolus will be based on the estimated meal size (small, regular, large and extra-large). The closed-loop system will give the remaining insulin needed based on the sensor readings. For this strategy, meal size will be defined as: small as any meal less than 30g, regular meal as any meal between 30g and 60g CHO, large meal as any meal between 60g and 90g CHO, extra-large meal for anything above 90g CHO.</description>

             appropriate ketone testing performed.

         13. Known or suspected allergy to the trial products

         14. Other serious medical illness likely to interfere with study participation or with the
             ability to complete the trial by the judgment of the investigator

         15. Anticipation of a significant change in exercise regimen between admission and end of
             the trial (i.e. starting or stopping an organized sport)

         16. In the opinion of the investigator, a participant who in unable or unwilling to
             observed the contraindications of the study devices
