  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the ADPKD Registry is to create an online patient network that includes at
      least 5,000 people with Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) who contribute
      data on their health and other topics. The ADPKD Patient Registry aims to support important
      scientific discoveries and support patient needs in the following ways:

        -  Connect ADPKD patients with opportunities to join clinical studies.

        -  Collect data for the research community to better describe the ADPKD disease experience
           and improve patient care.

        -  Engage with patients by measuring quality of life outcomes.

      The ADPKD Registry will be a patient-powered network of people with ADPKD. This data will
      inform new research to improve ADPKD patient outcomes, learn more about the patient journey
      and discover unmet medical needs. We collect data most relevant to your ADPKD diagnosis, its
      major symptoms and management, as well as key demographic data (no personally identifiable
      information is shared). A Registry keeps information in one place making it easier for
      researchers to utilize Registry information while still protecting the privacy of those who
      take part. The Registry will be hosted on a secure, online platform that patients can access
      using their home computers, tablets or phones.

      The purpose of the ADPKD Registry is to allow PKD patients to:

        -  Connect with researchers and express interest in taking part in certain clinical studies
           for ADPKD, including studies of new medications and other treatments.

        -  Take confidential health-related surveys. These surveys are aimed at better
           understanding of the health of people with PKD across their lifespans.
