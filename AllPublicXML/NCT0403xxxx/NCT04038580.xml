      The objective of the proposed work is to enhance understanding of the potential benefits of
      adjustable sockets and inform clinical decision making. The investigators will explore a
      range of outcomes that have been found to be important for prostheses users and specifically
      assess the claims made by device manufacturers. Thirty adults with a transfemoral amputation
      will participate in four test sessions; one with their clinically prescribed, laminated
      socket, and three with different adjustable sockets. This data will be used to test the
      following aims: 1) does socket design impact socket comfort and prosthetic satisfaction? 2)
      does socket design impact of prosthetic socket on patient mobility and confidence, 3) how
      does prosthetic socket design influences prosthetic use in the home?, and 4) Are individual
      characteristics associated with benefits of specific socket designs?

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Comfort between laminated and adjustable sockets using the Socket Fit Comfort Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Socket Fit Comfort Score (SCS) is a single question in which subjects are asks: &quot;On a scale from 0-10, if 0 represents the most uncomfortable socket fit you can imagine and 10 represents the most comfortable socket fit, how would you score the comfort of the socket fit of your artificial limb at the moment?&quot;</description>

    <measure>Change in Comfort between laminated and adjustable prosthesis using the Socket Fit Comfort Score</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 3 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Socket Fit Comfort Score (SCS) is a single question in which subjects are asks: &quot;On a scale from 0-10, if 0 represents the most uncomfortable socket fit you can imagine and 10 represents the most comfortable socket fit, how would you score the comfort of the socket fit of your artificial limb at the moment?&quot;</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Satisfaction and Quality of life between laminated and adjustable sockets using the Prosthetic Evaluation Questionnaire (PEQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The PEQ consists of 82 questions that describe the function of a lower-limb prosthesis and assess prosthesis-related quality of life. The questionnaire is divided into ten functional scales, addressing four major domains: prosthetic function, mobility, psychosocial experience, and well-being.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Prosthetic Satisfaction between laminated and adjustable sockets using the Prosthetic Socket Preference Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>This asks which device they prefer on a 100 mm visual analog scale from their prescribed laminated socket to the test socket. A score of 0 would be 100% preference for their prescribed socket while 100 mm represents 100% preference for the socket tested in that condition.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Confidence in different activities between laminated and adjustable sockets using the Activities Specific Balance Confidence Scale (ABC Scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The ABC scale is a 16-item self-reported measure scored on a rating scale from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicate greater balance confidence. An average score is calculated by adding all item scores and dividing by the total number of items. The ABC scale has demonstrate high internal consistency, good test-retest validity, and good construct validity in people with lower limb amputation.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in mobility as measured by the 10-meter walk test</measure>
    <time_frame>day 1 and 3 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The 10-m walk test measures elapsed time over 10 m from a standing start (Datta et al. 1996). This measure uses customary walking speed as a measure of walking ability/capacity and has shown content and metric reliability and validity (Deathe et al. 2009).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in mobility as measured by Timed Up and Go (TUG)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 3 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The timed-up-and-go (TUG) assesses several aspects of mobility including getting out of a chair, walking 3 m, turning, and sitting down (Schoppen et al. 1999). The outcome is the time from buttocks off the chair to buttocks down.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in mobility as measured by Five Times Sit To Stand (FTSTS)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 3 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>FTSTS is a measure of functional mobility, lower limb strength, and dynamic balance.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in mobility as measured by the Prosthetic Limb Users Survey of Mobility (PLUMS-M) 12-item short form</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The full PLUS-M survey has 44 items and there are two short-forms (12 and 7 items each). Here we will use the 12-item short form as it has shown excellent agreement with the 44-item score and good construct validity (Hafner et al. 2017). Additionally, normative data for 1019 people with lower limb amputation is available at (http://www.plus-m.org) to aid in interpretation of the findings.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in mobility as measured by the L-Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The L-test (Deathe and Miller 2005) is a modified version of the TUG which incorporates two transfers and four turns of which at least one would be to the opposite side (Fig 6). We will complete both tasks as the TUG has ceiling effects in fit individuals and the L-Test can be too difficult for some amputees</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Prosthetic Wear Time between laminated and adjustable sockets</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be given sensors to monitor how many times participants don and doff the prosthesis during the day. This sensor will be attached to each socket after the 3rd week of accommodation. This sensor will be worn for 1 week.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in physical activity levels at home between laminated and adjustable sockets</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will wear accelerometers to measure physical activity and step count. Participants will wear these monitors for 1 week.</description>
