    <textblock>
      The study assesses the impact on quality of care of implementing the ERAS (Enhanced Recovery
      After Surgery) protocol for colorectal cancer surgery in the network of public hospitals in
      the Regione Piemonte (North-West Italy). Every hospital is a cluster entering the study
      treating patients according to its current clinical practice. On the basis of a randomized
      order, each hospital switches from current clinical practice to the adoption of the ERAS
      protocol.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ERAS (Enhanced Recovery After Surgery) protocol is a multimodal perioperative care pathways
      designed to achieve early recovery after surgical procedures by maintaining preoperative
      organ function and reducing the profound stress response following surgery. Even if efficacy
      and safety of ERAS protocol in colorectal surgery is well-established in the literature, its
      implementation is limited to few selected centres in Piemonte. The aim of the study is to
      extend the implementation of the ERAS protocol to whole regional network of hospitals.
      Specific objectives are to estimate its impact on different dimensions of quality of care,
      including length of stay, complications and patient satisfaction, and to identify possible
      barriers or facilitating factors.
