  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: In this study, the investigators will delineate how brain network dynamics are
      modulated by experimentally induced elevated blood glucose levels and examine how glucose
      levels gate neuronal excitability measured by the response to TMS.

      Participants: Participants must be between the ages of 18 and 65 with no known diabetes, no
      known adverse reaction to finger prick blood draw, and no known neurological or psychiatric
      illness. Participants must have a body-mass index less than 30.

      Procedures: Participants will consume either a drink that contains 75 g of glucose or a
      placebo, and their response to TMS will be measured to examine the effect of glucose on motor
      cortex excitability.

      This study will be a placebo-controlled study that investigates brain function with both
      electroencephalography (EEG) and TMS. On each study visit, a drink (either glucose drink or
      water) is administered after baseline assessment of fasting glucose. Changes in brain
      activity and excitability will be measured with resting-state EEG. Periodic high-density EEG
      of resting-state brain activity and activity during a working memory task will be performed
      before the administration of the drink, immediately after the administration of the drink, as
      well as 30 minutes, 60 minutes, 120 minutes, 150 minutes, and 180 minutes after the
      administration of the drink. The spectral content of the EEG signal will be investigated to
      identify the relative presence of cortical oscillations. Primarily, there will be a focus on
      theta (4-8 Hz) and alpha (8-12 Hz) oscillations.

      Previous literature indicates that theta and alpha oscillations represent an engaged and
      disengaged cortical state, respectively [1]. Alpha and theta oscillations are implicated in
      cognitive function and are altered in depression. Therefore, this study aims to identify a
      decrease in frontal theta oscillations and an increase in left frontal alpha oscillations,
      two defining features of impaired top-down control and mood regulation, in response to the
      glucose drink contrasted with the response to the placebo.

      The study will also examine how glucose levels gate neuronal excitability measured by the
      response to TMS. Cortical excitability will be measured by applying TMS pulses to the motor
      cortex and measuring the response in the form of a motor evoked potential by electromyography
      (EMG). TMS will be applied before the administration of the drink, immediately after the
      administration of the drink, as well as 30 minutes, 60 minutes, 120 minutes, 150 minutes, and
      180 minutes after the administration of the drink. Changes in blood glucose will be monitored
      over this time interval as well.

    <description>This outcome will analyze the change in accuracy in a computerized working memory task over time. During the task, subjects will be presented with an array of colored squares. Then, they will need to hold this array in mind during a delay period. Finally, participants will be tested on their memory of the array by responding whether a presented color is the same or different as the corresponding square in the first array. Participants' accuracy will be expressed as the percentage of correct responses (from 0% correct responses to 100% correct responses). An accuracy rate of 50% indicates that the participant is performing at the same accuracy level as random chance.</description>
