  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Young pregnant and postpartum women living with HIV are at the greatest risk of disengagement
      from HIV services and suboptimal adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART). Among young
      women, stigma is a major barrier to retention in services and adherence to ART, and
      interventions are needed to combat stigma and improve ART outcomes. The investigators are
      conducting a pilot study of a peer support intervention to mitigate the negative effects of
      stigma in this population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite major reductions in mother-to-child HIV transmission (MTCT), young pregnant and
      postpartum women living with HIV remain a vulnerable group and experience the greatest risk
      of disengagement from services and suboptimal adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART).
      HIV-related and intersectional stigmas are major barriers to uptake and retention in
      prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) services and drive suboptimal adherence,
      and young women experience unique stigmas. Despite this, there are no evidence-based
      interventions to combat stigma and improve ART outcomes in this group. Peer support group
      interventions have shown promise in other populations, but have not been examined in young
      pregnant and postpartum women living with HIV. The investigators are conducting a pilot study
      of a peer support intervention to mitigate the negative effects of stigma in young pregnant
      and postpartum women living with HIV in South Africa. Participants will be allocated to the
      standard of care, in which no standardized peer support groups exist for this patient
      population, or to a peer support intervention.
