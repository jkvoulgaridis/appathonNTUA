      Alkotinib is an insulin receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor that selectively inhibits
      anaplastic lymphoma Kinase and proto-oncogene protein ROS1。Ocatinib is expected to be used in
      the treatment of ALK positive and ROS1 positive metastatic non-small cell lung Cancer and
      other cancers include patients with non-small cell lung cancer who are resistant to treatment
      with the first generation ALK inhibitor, such as kezotinib。

    <intervention_model_description>Each subject was randomly given Alkotinib capsules on an empty stomach or after a meal, and the cleaning period between the two dosages was set as 14 days. The actual dosing time was subject to the original clinical records. After admission to the ward on day -1 (1 day before drug administration), subjects will eat light dinner A 1:1 ratio was randomly assigned to 2 sequences (1=AB, 2=BA). Each subject was subject to two cycles of trials, and the study drug was taken once on an empty stomach or after meal according to the dosing sequence in the randomization table.</intervention_model_description>
