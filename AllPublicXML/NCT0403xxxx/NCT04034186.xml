  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic low back pain is one of the most common musculoskeletal disorders. In the Finnish
      Health 2000 survey the incidence of low back pain was 10% in men and 11% in women. Several
      evidence-based rehabilitation guidelines recommend exercise therapy treatment of chronic back
      pain. However, there are no studies in chronic low back pain patients concerning the
      assessment of the content and quality of exercise modalities adviced in clinical practise.

      The aim of this study is to investigate the content and quality of physiotherapy management
      and advise in chronic low back pain patients in Central Finland.

      The participants in this study are 100 working-age unspecific low back pain patients from the
      Central Health Care District, who are referred for specialised care in the outpatient clinic
      in the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation in Central Finland Hospital. The
      participants will be asked to complete health-related questionnaires and an in-house made
      questionnaire of their back rehabilitation. The main questions are:

        1. The content about applied exercise modalities,

        2. How the progression of exercises have been advised?

        3. How pain was taken into account while exercising? The research will be carried out and
           coordinated by Central Finland Central Hospital, and the research project will take
           place between November 2014 and February 2019.
