  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to improve the standard of care in case of the inhibition of
      lactation.

      The participant qualified for the study will answer the questions contained in the survey.
      The patient will have her breast palpated and then will be instructed on the possible options
      for the inhibition of lactation. The participant, who decides to inhibit lactation with
      medications, will be consulted by a doctor.

      Each patient will receive information of the possible ways to relieve the symptoms of
      overfilled breast and be able to contact with lactation consultant. The participant will also
      receive a card to assess the severity of symptoms in the following days. The investigators
      will call the patient between the third and fifth day by phone.

      Once again, after 2 weeks from the beginning of the inhibition of lactation in order to ask
      questions contained in the survey (the course of the process, problems that occurred and the
      level of satisfaction with the chosen method).
