    <textblock>
      The purpose of this graduate student research study is to compare the rise of serum lipids,
      glucose, and hs-CRP levels after consumption of a beef burger versus a vegetarian burger in
      healthy adults between the ages of 21 and 55

      Visit 1

        -  Sign an informed consent.

        -  Complete a brief questionnaire about demographics (age, gender, and race), eating
           habits, physical activity level, and medical history (known allergies, and history of
           dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, or arthritis)

        -  Will be directed to fast for 8 hours prior to Visit 2. Visit 2

        -  Be randomized into either Group 1 or Group 2. One group will eat the beef burger first
           and the other group will eat the vegetarian burger first.

        -  Fill out a questionnaire on number of hours slept and current stress level.

        -  Take a finger prick test (tiny drop of blood) to determine baseline measurements for
           serum lipids, glucose, and hs-CRP levels.

        -  Consume either a beef burger or vegetarian burger.

        -  Afterwards, remain in Nichol Hall, Room A112, for 2 hours (may study, watch a movie,
           etc.).

        -  May not consume anything except for water.

        -  After 30 min, 60 min, 120 min, finger prick tests will be used to measure
           post-consumption serum lipids, glucose, and hs-CRP levels.

        -  Will be asked to try and identify burger consumed and rate the taste of the burger.

        -  Will be directed to fast for 8 hours prior to Visit 3. Visit 3

        -  Repeat the same procedure as Visit 2. However, this time the burgers will be switched.

    <description>A finger prick test will be used to determine baseline levels measurements for serum lipids, glucose, and hs-CRP levels. Group 1 will be given vegetarian burgers to consume. Participants will need to remain in the room for 2 hours, postprandial (they may study, watch a movie, etc). They will not be allowed to consume anything except for water during this time. After consumption of burger, at 30 min, 60 min, 120 min, finger prick tests will be used to obtain blood. Participants will also be asked to try and identify the burger they consumed and rate the taste of the burger. Visit 2 will take approximately 3 hours.
Participants will be directed to fast for 8 hours prior to Visit 3 (the following week).
Visit 3: We will repeat the same procedure as Visit 2. However, this time the burgers will be switched.</description>
