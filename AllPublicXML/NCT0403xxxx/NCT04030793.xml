  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in cortical activation</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline (before stimulation) after stimulation during 30 min</time_frame>
    <description>changes in cortical activation is measured by functional Near-Infrared-Spectroscopy (fNIRS) (NIRScout, NIRx, Germany) during treadmill gait.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>10 meter walk test (10MWT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Before stimulation (baseline); After strimulation during 30 min</time_frame>
    <description>Measure of self selected speeds by measuring the time it takes an individual to walk 10 meters. To perform the test, patient walks 10 meters (33 ft) and the time is measured when the leading foot crosses the start line and the finish line. The instructions are: &quot;Please walk this distance at your normal pace when I say go.&quot;</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Timed Up and Go test (TUG)</measure>
    <time_frame>Before stimulation (baseline); After strimulation during 30 min</time_frame>
    <description>The Timed Up and Go test (TUG) is a simple test used to assess a person's mobility and requires both static and dynamic balance. It uses the time that a person takes to rise from a chair, walk three meters, turn around, walk back to the chair, and sit down.</description>

    <measure>Gait analysis using surface electromyograph</measure>
    <time_frame>Before stimulation (baseline); After strimulation during 30 min</time_frame>
    <description>Gait analysis is a process of measuring and evaluating the walking patterns of patients by using surface electromyograph.</description>
