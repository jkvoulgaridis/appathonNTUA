  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Dementia is an illness that mostly affects people of advanced age and causes
      disability and dependency. Although the difficulties, a vast number of older people with
      dementia at our context, are cared for in their own homes by a family member, usually their
      spouse/partner, son, daughter or companion, but it is well known that this could be one of
      the main factors of institutionalization. However, home care is an effective option for the
      health system. This care may be provided over months or years and can have negative effects
      on the caregivers' health. This article describes the development and implementation of a
      structured, psychoeducational intervention addressed to informal caregivers of people with
      dementia cared for at home.

      Methods: A quasi-experimental study with repeated observations at 3 and 6 months
      post-intervention was performed. Intentional sampling and convenience assignment method was
      used for intervention and control groups. The intervention was structured developed at the
      beginning of the study, which consists of a multicomponent training, information and
      emotional support programme of five, 90-minute sessions over one week. The control group
      received Usual Care. The project was approved by the ethics committee (HCB/2014/0317) and
      follows the recommendations of the Declaration of Helsinki. Evidence gathered from our
      research will be published at national and international level.

      Discussion: The results of this intervention will support other studies and contribute
      scientific evidence on the importance of promoting non-pharmacologic interventions in
      informal caregivers of people with dementia. At the same time, they can be used as the basis
      for the implementation of psycho educational interventions in home care and in long-term care
      institutions responsible for monitoring people with dementia; responding to training and
      information needs, and providing the social support that the caregivers themselves demand.

    <description>The INFOSA-DEM programme consists of five, 90-minute informational/training sessions delivered consecutively over one week. Morning or afternoon groups are offered depending on the caregiver's availability. Programme content was developed for use in small groups of 6-8 caregivers. Topics covered in the sessions include basic concepts in dementia and specific issues such as nutrition, rest, medication, physical and cognitive changes, management of behavioural symptoms, affective problems in the patient and informal caregiver, verbal and non-verbal communication techniques, caregiver self-care and information on available resources and community services.
The sessions are conducted using audio-visual material to facilitate understanding of the content and to encourage active participation among caregivers when talking about their experiences.</description>
