  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer is a leading cause of death for children. With the increasing incidence of childhood
      cancer, the mental health problems emerge in those parents struggle with their children's
      life-threatened disease. Caring for children with cancer is described as life-changing
      experience and overwhelming stress for parents. Many studies have been conducted to screen
      the psychological distress for these parents and found a considerable percentage of them
      suffering from depressive symptoms. Poorer quality of life was also found in parents of
      children with cancer when compared to parents of children without cancer. Additionally,
      parental distress interacted with children's emotions and could have detrimental effects on
      children's both physical and mental health. Therefore, it is important to take measures
      improving the mental health for parents of children with cancer.

      Although current various psychological interventions illustrated small to moderate
      improvements of mental health for parents of children with cancer, the total effect base on a
      systematic review was not statistically significant. The purpose of these interventions was
      predominantly to treat negative mental health problems such as depression and no recognized
      effective psychological interventions were available for parents of children with cancer
      until now. Along with the paradigm shift from problem-oriented approach to nurturing
      strengths in the post-modern period, instead of exclusively treating mental health problems,
      researchers payed more attention to positive therapy such as resilience promotion program.
      Resilience usually refers to the ability to adapt adverse conditions and maintain positive
      status. Resilience studies are mounting since the flourishing of positive psychology movement
      and meaningful results were gained from corresponding intervention program concentrating on
      resilience promotion in adolescent education, handling chronic disease and recovery of breast
      cancer. However, there is a lack of targeted resilience promotion program for parents of
      children with cancer. The results of our pilot study showed low levels of resilience in
      parents of children with cancer and strong associations among parental resilience, quality of
      life and depression. It indicates that the increase in resilience can benefit for the mental
      health of parents. Therefore, a resilience promotion program will be conducted to examine
      efficacy for parents of children with cancer.

    <description>Resilience Promotion Program consists of eight sessions. Except the first orientation session and the last review session, other six sessions focus on cultivating the five internal resiliency factors (physical, behavioral, cognitive, emotional and spiritual). There are two sessions for behavioral factor, including one special to deal with the relationships between parents and children.</description>
