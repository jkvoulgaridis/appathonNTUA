  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the pharmacodynamic (PD) interaction between
      steady-steady treatment with padsevonil (PSL) and Ethanol and the pharmacokinetic (PK)
      interaction between stead-state treatment with PSL and cannabidiol (CBD).

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Based on available data, UCB has decided to stop development of padsevonil as adjunctive
    treatment of focal-onset seizures
