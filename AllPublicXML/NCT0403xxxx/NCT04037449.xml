      Background Severe abdominal pain is a hallmark of acute pancreatitis (AP). A control pain is
      often difficult. Transversus Abdominis Plane (TAP) block has been used in pain control in
      patients with exacerbation of chronic pancreatitis.

      Objectives To evaluate the effect of Bilateral Blockade of the Abdominal Transverse Muscle
      Plane (TAP Block) in the analgesic control of patients with acute pancreatitis; compared to
      standard intravenous analgesia.

      Methods A randomized controlled trial of parallel groups will be conducted. The Study will
      have a multicenter development. Study population: Adult patients admitted for episode of AP,
      with uncontrolled pain (visual analogue scale (VAS) equal to or greater than 5 after the
      administration of standard analgesia. Randomization Groups: Group A: Patients who will
      undergo TAP block as analgesic procedure added to standard analgesia. Group B: Patients to
      whom morphine 2 mg / ev will be administered as analgesic procedure added to standard
      analgesia.

      Timing of pain determination (Visual Analogue Scale, VAS):

        -  Before conventional analgesia

        -  Immediately before Randomization

        -  15 minutes after the administration of the analgesic treatment object of the study.

        -  One hour after the procedure.

        -  Every 8 hours, during the next 4 days or until discharge of the patient.

        -  Whenever the patient needs a dose of supplemental rescue analgesia. Analysis of data All
           results will be evaluated according to the initial &quot;intention to treat&quot;. There will be a
           blinded assessment of the results after the last patient in the trial has completed the
           follow-up. The results will be presented as relative risks with their corresponding
           confidence intervals. P &lt;0.05 will be considered statistically significant. In case of
           imbalance between the two treatment groups, a multivariate logistic regression is used
           to correct possible confounding factors.

    <description>With the patient placed in the supine position, after asepsis of the skin with chlorhexidine, bilateral TAP blockage will be carried out under ultrasound control. We will use a high frequency linear transducer (12-15 MHz) on one side of the abdominal wall, at the level of the mid-axillary line, between the costal margin and the iliac crest. At this level we can identify three muscle layers, from superficial to deep: external oblique muscle, internal oblique muscle and transverse muscle of the abdomen. We will move the transducer more laterally to locate the most posterior border of the internal oblique and transverse muscles. It is at this level that we perform the posterior TAP blockade: we administer 10 ml of 2% Mepivacaine plus 10 ml of 0.5% Bupivacaine between the fasciae of the internal oblique muscle and the transverse muscle of the abdomen and observe an appropriate diffusion pattern of local anesthetics</description>
