      Early microRNAs (miRs) and Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR)-derived strain analysis and
      detection of genes contributing to Anthracycline-Induced Cardiotoxicity (AIC) sensitivity and
      resistance will identify pediatric cancer patients most and least likely to develop AIC.

      Plan is to enroll 110 children and adults (≥9 years old) newly diagnosed at CCMC and
      Nationwide Children's Hospital (55 per institution) who will receive anthracyclines as part
      of their chemotherapy regimen.

      The duration of study participation will be approximately a year.

      Patients will have a total of four study visits:

      Baseline

      1 week after patient's anthracycline cumulative dose hits between 60 and 100 mg/m2 After the
      patient has completed maximal therapy One year after completion of anthracycline treatments

      Study tasks for all four visits will be:

      Collection of clinical data Blood draw for micro RNA and Biomarkers Cardiac MRI
      Echocardiogram One time blood draw for genetics
