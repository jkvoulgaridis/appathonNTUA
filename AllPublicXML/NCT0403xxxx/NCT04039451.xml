  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psoriasis is a chronic, immune-mediated inflammatory skin disease, which ranges in severity
      from a few scattered red, scaly plaques to involvement of almost the entire body surface. It
      may progressively worsen with age, or wax and wane in its severity; the degree of severity
      depends on inheritance and environmental factors.

      It is a complex disease, multiple exogenous and endogenous stimuli incite already stimulated
      innate immune responses in genetically predetermined individuals. The disease process is a
      result of a network of cell types including T cells, dendritic cells and keratinocytes that,
      with the production of cytokines, generate a chronic inflammatory state.

      Vitiligo is a chronic disorder of pigmentation characterized by the development of white
      macules on the skin due to loss of epidermal melanocytes.

      Its pathogenesis is still unclear, many mechanisms and theories have been suggested including
      autoimmunity, auto cytotoxicity, biochemical and neuronal mechanisms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are multiple patterns of psoriasis including plaque, guttate, pustular, inverse and
      erythrodermic, approximately 80% of patients present with plaque psoriasis which is
      clinically characterized by well demarcated erythematous plaques with overlying scales. These
      plaques can be intensely pruritic and bleed when manipulated, referred to as the Auspitz
      sign. Lesions are usually distributed symmetrically and frequently occur on the elbows,
      knees, lower back and scalp.

      Prevalence of psoriasis is around 2-3% of the general population. A high prevalence of
      psoriasis at the rate of 11.8% has been reported from Kazach'ye, located in the Arctic region
      of the former Soviet Union.

      In Egypt, the prevalence reported is around 3%. A study was done in hospitals of Damietta
      governorate reveals that prevalence of psoriasis is about 5%. Up to the investigator's
      knowledge the prevalence of psoriasis at Assuit governorate is not known till now.

      Vitiligo can be classified into segmental or non-segmental. Non-segmental or generalized
      vitiligo is the most common clinical presentation and often involves the face and acral
      regions.

      Prevalence of vitiligo is 0.5%-2% of general population world-wide, without predilection for
      sex or race. A previous study on skin diseases I Assiut governorates reveals that prevalence
      of vitiligo was about 1.22%.
