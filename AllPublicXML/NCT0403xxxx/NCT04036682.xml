  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CLN-081-101 is a Phase 1/2a, open label, multi-center study of CLN-081 in patients with NSCLC
      (non small cell lung cancer) harboring EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) exon 20
      insertion mutations, to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase 2
      dose (RP2D), as well as to evaluate preliminary efficacy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2a, open-label, multicenter, first-in-human trial to evaluate the safety
      and tolerability, PK, PD, and preliminary efficacy of CLN-081 in patients with non-small cell
      lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 20 insertion
      mutations.

      This trial is divided into three parts: Phase 1 Dose Escalation, Phase 1 Dose Expansion, and
      Phase 2a Dose Expansion.

      The objectives of the dose escalation part are to determine the safety, tolerability, MTD,
      recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), and to evaluate the anti-tumor activity of orally
      administered CLN-081 monotherapy. Additional objectives are to determine the pharmacokinetic
      (PK) profile of CLN-081 and CLN-081's activity in patients with known central nervous system
      (CNS) disease.

      CLN-081 will be dosed once daily (QD) and twice daily (BID).
