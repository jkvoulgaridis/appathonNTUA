  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this project is:

      1. To assess the influence of physical fatigue on brain functioning during a balance and
      reaction time task in a healthy population. In a later stage, these experiments could be
      carried out in a clinical context (e.g. in an ankle sprain population).

      The researchers will use a randomized, placebo controlled, counter-balanced, cross-over
      design. Twenty healthy subjects will visit the lab 3 times. On the first visit
      (familiarisation trial), the investigators will collect the participants' characteristics.
      The participants will also be familiarized to the procedures and materials of the experiment
      during this first visit. The second and third visit contain the experimental setup and will
      proceed as follows: first, the participants will fill in a pre-test checklist, a mental
      fatigue scale (M-VAS) and motivation scale. In the mean time a little blood will be collected
      from the ear lobe to determine lactate and glucose levels; also, blood pressure will be
      checked.

      Next, the subjects will carry out a Y-balance test and a balance reaction-time test. Session
      rate of perceived exertion (SRPE) is measured to indicate how fatigued the participants feel
      due to the test battery; also, M-VAS is collected once more, as well blood lactate, glucose
      and blood pressure. These measures are followed by either a physical fatigue inducing task
      (Modified 30 seconds Wingate protocol) or time-matched control task (sitting on the bike
      without pedalling). Afterwards, researchers will collect blood lactate, glucose and blood
      pressure two times more; participants have to fill in M-VAS (2x), perform the same Y-balance
      test and balance reaction time test, and fill in the SRPE scale one more time. Heart
      frequency and EEG will be measured continuously during the trials.
