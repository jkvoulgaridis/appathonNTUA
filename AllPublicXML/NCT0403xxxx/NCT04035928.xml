  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will use a 3D scanner to print a 3D model or mold for each patient's prosthesis.
      The goal of this study to provide patients with a new, faster method of imaging and creating
      prostheses that preserves the quality of the current method while reducing time spent by both
      the patient and providers. Patients that are eligible will have a non-invasive 3D scanner
      (Artec Space Spider) to image the indicated areas of their head and face to help create their
      new prosthesis. Patients will come in for visits as needed to fit and adjust their
      prosthetic. Additionally, patients will be asked to complete questionnaires and have
      follow-up visits at certain time -points pre and post prosthetic completion.

    <description>The non-invasive Artec Space Spider 3D scanner will be used to image the indicated areas of the patients head and face. In the case of an intraoral defect, the noninvasive TRIOS intraoral 3D scanner will be used. The study may also use nasometry or nasal endoscopy to measure the amount of airflow through the patient's fistula to help guide the design. The software that will be used will create a 3D image of the prosthesis during the patient's clinic appointment. Once a model of the prosthesis is fully designed and manufactured, the patient will return to clinic for a second appointment which may involve fitting and coloring. A subsequent appointment will involve delivery of a successfully fitted and colored prosthesis that the patient will take home.</description>

             craniofacial anomaly

          -  The patient is amenable to 3D surface scanning rather than facial molding

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known allergy to silicone

          -  Poor candidate for prosthetic reconstruction

          -  Developmental concerns regarding aspiration risk
