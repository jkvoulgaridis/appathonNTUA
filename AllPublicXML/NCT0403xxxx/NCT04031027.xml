    <textblock>
      The DARWIN study is an Italian multicenter, observational, cross-sectional study involving
      both a primary data collection (at enrollment visit) and secondary use of data (retrospective
      observation period). DARWIN will describe patients' characteristics in Italian routine
      clinical practice as well as the medication utilization patterns, including needs and
      benefits form the patient's perspective.

    <textblock>
      The DARWIN study is anticipated to enroll 375 participants from 28 Italian dermatologic
      departments and recruitment is expected to take approximately 12 months. Participants must
      have started apremilast treatment 6 (Â±1) months prior enrollment in order to be considered
      eligible. The decision to prescribe apremilast falls within current practice according to the
      current decision-making process in the Italian routine clinical practice and according to
      AIFA prescribing information. No extra-procedures (diagnostic or monitoring) will be
      implemented and the assessment schedule reflects the routine clinical practice for psoriatic
      patients treated with apremilast. Patients will be consecutively enrolled in the study and
      information will be collected as recorded in the medical chart before starting apremilast (as
      close as possible to the apremilast start date/index date), and/or directly observed during
      the enrolment visit. The study variables will describe patient disease and characteristics,
      apremilast utilization patterns, psoriasis severity a, extent and impact on patient
      wellbeing, apremilast safety profile and apremilast satisfaction.

    <description>The Physician's Global Assessment is a measurement of overall involvement by the investigator at the time of evaluation. The ScPGA is a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe), incorporating an assessment of the severity of the 3 primary signs of the disease: erythema, scaling, and plaque elevation. When making the assessment of overall severity, the investigator factored in areas that had already been cleared (ie, had scores of 0), not limited to the evaluation of remaining lesions for severity; consequently, the severity of each sign was averaged across all areas of involvement, including cleared lesions.</description>

    <measure>Proportions of patients achieving DLQI score â¤5</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 7 months after treatment initiation</time_frame>
    <description>DLQI is a simple, compact, and practical questionnaire for use in a dermatology clinical setting to assess limitations related to the impact of skin disease. The instrument contains ten items dealing with the participant's skin. With the exception of Item Number 7, the participant responds on a four-point scale, ranging from &quot;Very Much&quot; (score 3) to &quot;Not at All&quot; or &quot;Not relevant&quot; (score 0). Item Number 7 is a multi-part item, the first part of which ascertains whether the participant's skin prevented them from working or studying (Yes or No, scores 3 or 0 respectively), and if &quot;No,&quot; then the subject is asked how much of a problem the skin has been at work or study over the past week, with response alternatives being &quot;A lot,&quot; &quot;A little,&quot; or &quot;Not at all&quot; (scores 2, 1, or 0 respectively). The DLQI total score was derived by summing all item scores, which has a possible range of 0 to 30, with 30 corresponding to the worst quality of life, and 0 corresponding to the best.</description>
