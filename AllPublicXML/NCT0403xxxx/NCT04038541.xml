  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized crossover-designed study to explore the immunologic effects of
      Prebiotics, as opposed to direct supplementation with beneficial bacteria (Probiotics) in the
      immune system of patients with MS and Clinically Isolated Syndrome (CIS). Eligible patients
      will take 6 weeks of two different supplements - Prebiotics and Probiotics. Participants will
      be randomly assigned to take either of two agents for 6 weeks as their first supplement.
      Then, participants enter a 6-week washout period. After the washout period, participants will
      take the second supplement for 6 weeks. After taking the second supplement, participants will
      have a 6-week washout period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Soluble fibers (prebiotics) are fermented by beneficial bacteria (probiotics) in the colon to
      produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) which are the main source of nutrition for the cells
      in the gut. It has been reported that the fermentable fiber inulin and SCFAs may exert some
      beneficial effects including anti-inflammatory effect on the immune system. To date, the
      effect of supplementation with fermentable dietary fiber, such as prebiotics in patients with
      Multiple Sclerosis (MS) has not been investigated.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a randomized, interventional trial with a crossover design, in which participants will be taking either probiotic (commercially available Visbiome) or prebiotic (prebiotin prebiotic) for 6 weeks as the first agent. Then, participants enter a 6-week washout period. After the washout period, participants take the second agent for 6 weeks. After taking the second agent, participants again have a 6-week wash-out period.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Modified Fatigue Impact Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Modified Fatigue Impact Scale assesses fatigue effects in terms of physical, cognitive, and psychosocial functioning. The total core ranges from 0 - 20 (5 item version). Higher scores suggest a greater impact of fatigue on a patient's activities.</description>
