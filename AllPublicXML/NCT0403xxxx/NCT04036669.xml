    <textblock>
      Significant increase in the levels of serum adiponectin, ADA, and hsCRP was reported in all
      RA patients compared to controls.

      Compared to patients with early RA, the increase in these markers significantly correlated
      with disease activity (DAS-ESR), lower f-BMD, radiographic scoring, pain, FFI, and functional
      limitations in patients with established RA.

      Adiponectin showed a negative correlation with serum levels of both ADA and hsCRP. By using
      ROC curve analysis, optimal cut-off values of adiponectin (28.8 µg/ml), ADA (27.3 IU/L), and
      hsCRP (1.6 mg/L) could be used to estimate early RA in 45 % of the patients. Similarly, using
      cut-off values of adiponectin (32.8 µg/ml), ADA (26.1 IU/L ml), and hsCRP (2.5 mg/L),
      established RA could be predicted in 55 % of patients with 98-99% accuracy.

      The present study attempts to evaluate the efficacy of adiponectin, ADA, and foot bone
      mineral density (fBMD) as predictors of the disease progression in patients with rheumatoid
      arthritis. A total of 80 RA patients and eighty age and sex-matched healthy controls were
      included in this study.

    <description>Foot BMD for all RH patients was performed by Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) scan method by using a Lunar DPX densitometer originally used to measure bone mass of small animals and modified to suits the measurements of hand BMD. Foot measurements were applied according to previously reported method</description>

    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Foot Function Index (FFI) is pre-validated questionnaire designed efficiently to measure the effects of foot pathologies such as Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) on foot function in terms of pain, disability and activity restriction. The FFI has three subscales of measurements; pain, disability, and activity limitation with a total of 23 questions and total score of 10. For each patients, record the respective measurements of the FFI three subscales according to the score range (0-10), whereas; patients with no pain (0); mild pain (1-3); moderate pain(4-6), and severe or worse pain (7-10).</description>
