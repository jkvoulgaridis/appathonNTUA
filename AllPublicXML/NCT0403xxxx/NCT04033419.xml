      Purpose: To conduct a one-arm phase II trial to: (1) compare changes in pre- to
      post-chemotherapy cognitive function in a cohort of patients with breast cancer receiving
      memantine to historical controls; (2) examine how depression, anxiety, fatigue, baseline
      Intelligence Quotient (IQ), and cognitive effort relate to objective and self-reported
      cognitive function; and (3) estimate the feasibility of conducting a clinical trial of
      memantine for attenuating cognitive decline in patients with breast cancer during
      chemotherapy.

      Participants: Adult patients with stage I-III breast cancer scheduled for adjuvant or
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

      Procedures (methods): Cognitive assessments will be performed within one week of initiating
      and four weeks after completion of chemotherapy. Patients will receive memantine 10 mg twice
      daily between the pre- and post-chemotherapy study assessments. Cognitive function will be
      assessed objectively using a computerized cognitive test (Delayed Matching to Sample (DMS)
      test) and a standard neuropsychological battery. To assess subjective cognitive function, the
      Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Cognitive Function measure
      will be used. Depression, anxiety, fatigue, menopausal status, and sleep will be assessed as
      covariates.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a one-arm phase II interventional study in patients with breast cancer to investigate
      whether memantine can prevent cognitive decline during chemotherapy. The investigators will
      recruit 56 participants referred to the University of North Carolina (UNC) Breast Center
      outpatient clinic for initiation of adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy, perform a cognitive
      assessment within one week of initiating and four weeks after completion of chemotherapy, and
      treat with memantine 10 mg twice daily between the pre- and post-chemotherapy study
      assessments (estimated duration: 12-26 weeks, depending on the chemotherapy regimen).
      Cognitive function will be assessed objectively using a computerized cognitive assessment
      (Delayed Matching to Sample (DMS) test) and a standard neuropsychological battery. To assess
      subjective cognitive function, the Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System
      (PROMIS) Cognitive Function measure will be used. Depression, anxiety, fatigue, menopausal
      status, and sleep are comorbidities known to affect cognitive function, and therefore will be
      assessed as covariates pre- and post-chemotherapy. Depression, anxiety, health-related
      quality of life (HRQOL) and functional status will be evaluated as secondary outcomes. The
      feasibility of the investigator's study by monitoring recruitment, retention, and adherence
      to memantine will be assessed.

    <measure>Change in visual working memory - Delayed Matching to Sample Test</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline (pre-chemotherapy) to 4 weeks post-chemotherapy</time_frame>
    <description>The Delayed Matching to Sample Test (DMS) is a computerized cognitive assessment of visual working memory. The DMS will be administered using Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) eclipse software (Cambridge Cognition, Cambridge, UK). The participant is shown an image with four patterns and asked to match patterns simultaneously or after delay. The investigators will use the percent correct (0 to 100, higher is better) at the 12-second delay on the DMS test for the primary analysis.</description>

    <measure>Change in verbal memory - Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline (pre-chemotherapy) to 4 weeks post-chemotherapy</time_frame>
    <description>The Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R) is an objective measure of verbal learning and memory. The examiner reads a list of 12 nouns to the participant, who repeats as many words as remembered. Approximately 20-25 minutes later, participants are asked to recall as many words as possible. Then, the examiner reads a list of 24 words, including the 12 words from the original list, and the participant is asked to determine which words were and were not on the original list. These tasks result in three subscales: total recall (range: 0-36; higher is better), delayed recall (range: 0-12; higher is better), and the Recognition Discrimination Index (range: 0-12; higher is better).</description>

    <measure>Change in processing speed and executive function - Trail Making Test</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline (pre-chemotherapy) to 4 weeks post-chemotherapy</time_frame>
    <description>The Trail Making Test (TMT) is an objective measure of processing speed (part A) and executive function (part B). In part A, the participant is given a diagram of 25 circles, labeled 1 - 25, and asked to connect the circles in ascending order. In part B, the diagram of 25 circles includes some with numbers (1-13) and some with letters (A-L), and the participant is asked to connect the circles alternating between numbers and letters. Performance is measured in the number of seconds required to complete each task (lower is better).</description>

    <time_frame>From baseline (pre-chemotherapy) to 4 weeks post-chemotherapy</time_frame>
    <description>The Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWA) is an objective measure of verbal fluency. The participant is asked to name as many words as possible, excluding proper nouns, in one minute. This is repeated for a total for three different letters. The score is the total number of different words produced between all three letters (higher is better).</description>

    <measure>Change in self-reported cognitive function - PROMIS Cognitive Function</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline (pre-chemotherapy) to 4 weeks post-chemotherapy</time_frame>
    <description>The National Institute of Health's Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) contains a cognitive function bank.

Scores for all PROMIS measures are reported on the T-score metric in which the mean=50 and standard deviation (SD) = 10 are centered on the general population means. Higher scores represent greater degrees of cognitive complaints.</description>

    <description>The Patient-reported Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) provides a self-characterization of functional status, ranging from severely/require continuous nursing care to normal/no complaints/no symptoms of disease. Scores range from 30 to 100. Higher scores indicate better function.</description>

    <measure>Change in quality of life - Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline (pre-chemotherapy) to 4 weeks post-chemotherapy</time_frame>
    <description>The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) is a 27-item patient-administered assessment of general quality-of-life measures in cancer patients. It has been validated in the literature and permits the measurement of a number of symptoms including nausea, pain, and insomnia. Responses to each item are on a 5-point Likert scale. The FACT-G total score (range: 0-108; higher is better) will be assessed.</description>
