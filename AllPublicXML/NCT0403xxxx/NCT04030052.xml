      This study prospectively investigates the safety, immunogenicity and hemostatic efficacy of
      prophylactic Emicizumab given with a concomitant low dose rFVIII (Nuwiq) in HA infants and
      children &lt;3 years old who have had little to no previous exposure to FVIII. In addition,the
      study investigates the safety and efficacy of a novel FVIII ITI regimen in children &lt;21 with
      existing low and high titer inhibitors (LTI and HTI)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hemophilia A (HA) is a congenital bleeding disorder caused by deficient or dysfunctional
      factor VIII (FVIII) which leads to bleeding correlating with severity. Treatment options
      depend on the age of the patient and severity of the disease. In children with severe
      hemophilia A (SHA), management is focused on FVIII replacement given prophylactically or in
      reaction to a bleed. Effective treatment with FVIII replacement is complicated by the
      development of FVIII neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors).

      This study prospectively investigates the safety, immunogenicity and hemostatic efficacy of
      prophylactic Emicizumab given with a concomitant low dose rFVIII (Nuwiq) in HA infants and
      children &lt;3 years old who have had little to no previous exposure to FVIII. In addition,the
      study investigates the safety and efficacy of a novel FVIII ITI regimen in children &lt;21 with
      existing low and high titer inhibitors (LTI and HTI).
