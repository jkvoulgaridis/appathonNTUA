  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the effectiveness of a home-based telerehabilitation program
      specifically designed for upper limbs, based on Virtual Reality (VR) in individuals affected
      by Multiple Sclerosis.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 60% of people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) suffer from upper limb
      dysfunction. The primary goal of this study is to implement a single-blind, randomized
      control trial (RCT) designed to compare the effectiveness of an 8-week home-based telerehab
      virtual reality (VR) program with conventional therapy in pwMS with manual dexterity
      difficulties. Secondary aims include; a) evaluating the impact of the programs on quality of
      life after the intervention and a follow up 1 month later; and b) evaluating the impact of
      the programs on adherence and satisfaction.

      Methodology. Twenty-four pwMS will be recruited to participate in the study which will be
      conducted at two established MS Centers: (1) The Sardinian Center for Diagnosis and Treatment
      of Multiple Sclerosis, Binaghi Hospital, Cagliari, Italy; (2) The Multiple Sclerosis Center,
      Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Israel. Participants will complete a total of three
      assessments focusing on upper limb functions. Both groups will receive 16 training sessions
      focusing on functional upper limb activities. The home-based telerehab VR intervention will
      comprise a custom-made software program running on a private computer or laptop. pwMS will
      perform several activities of daily living (ADL) functions associated with self-care,
      dressing and meal preparation.

      Conventional therapy will focus on task-related upper-limb treatments while in a sitting or
      prone position, indicative of the standard care in multiple sclerosis (MS). Following 8-weeks
      of training, participants will complete a further outcome assessment. The same tests will be
      conducted 1 month (as a follow-up) after completion of the intervention.

      Potential scientific contribution. The outcomes of this study have tremendous potential to
      improve the quality of evidence and informed decisions of functional upper limb activities in
      pwMS. If comparable results are found between the treatments in improving upper limb
      outcomes, this would suggest that pwMS can choose the program that best meets their personal
      needs, e.g., financial concerns, transportation or accessibility issues. Secondly, this
      information can be used by healthcare providers and medical professionals in developing upper
      limb exercise programs that will most likely succeed in pwMS and will then be disseminated to
      neurologists and other medical providers.

      Mode of cooperation and added value. The Italian group will be responsible for designing and
      implementing three new VR scenarios relating to functional activities of the upper limb. The
      new VR scenarios will be planned in conjunction with the Israeli group who will also play an
      active role in the quality assessment procedures of the developed elements. Both groups will
      participate equally in the pilot RCT. Roles include: recruitment and guidance of patients and
      therapists, implementing the telerehab VR system in the patient's home, assessment of outcome
      measures, data collection, analysis and interpretation of data and dissemination of the
      findings. An additional role of the Israeli team will be to prepare a user manual detailing
      how to use the system and providing clinical guidelines/recommendations for both the
      therapist and patient.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a prospective, assessor blinded, parallel group pilot RCT that will be conducted at:
The Sardinian Center for Diagnosis and Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis, Cagliari, Italy.
The Multiple Sclerosis Center, Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Israel.
Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the two intervention groups:
Telerehab VR training;
Conventional therapy
The two interventions will be comparable in length (8-weeks), frequency (twice weekly) and session duration (50-60 min).
Pre-intervention tests (T0) characterizing groups and obtaining baseline values of primary and secondary outcome measures will be performed one weekÂ±3 days prior to the intervention program.
Within one week after completion of the intervention, post-intervention tests will be performed (T1). The same tests will be repeated after 1-month of follow-up (T2). During the follow-up period (T1-T2), patients will be instructed to continue their regular activities.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>Pre-intervention (T0, baseline), post-intervention (T1, +8 weeks from baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>The NHPT was selected based on the widespread adoption and extensive data available. Furthermore, the NHPT is recommended as a gold standard for measuring manual dexterity in pwMS.31 The NHPT has excellent psychometric properties regarding reliability, discriminant, concurrent and ecological validity, can detect progression over time, is sensitive to treatment and as such, is recommended for inclusion in clinical trials. Briefly explained, the NHPT requires participants to repeatedly place nine pegs into nine holes, one at a time, as quickly as possible and then remove them from the holes. The total time needed to complete the task is then recorded. Two consecutive trials with the dominant hand are immediately followed by two consecutive trials with the non-dominant hand.</description>

    <time_frame>Pre-intervention (T0, baseline), post-intervention (T1, +8 weeks from baseline), 1 month follow-up (T2, +12 weeks from baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>The ARAT is a 19 item observational measure used by physical therapists and healthcare professionals to assess upper extremity performance in terms of coordination, dexterity and functioning in several neurologic conditions, including MS.32 Items comprising the ARAT are categorized into four subscales (grasp, grip, pinch and gross movement) and arranged in order of decreasing difficulty, with the most difficult task examined first, followed by the least difficult task. Task performance is rated on a 4-point scale, ranging from 0 (no movement) to 3 (movement performed normally).</description>

    <time_frame>Pre-intervention (T0, baseline), post-intervention (T1, +8 weeks from baseline), 1 month follow-up (T2, +12 weeks from baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>The MAM-36 is a questionnaire based on perceived ease or difficulty that a person may experience when performing unilateral and bilateral ADL tasks. During a semi-structured interview, the subject is asked to rate 36 unilateral and bilateral ADL tasks using a 4-point scale. The score of the different tasks are summed up and transformed using a Rasch-derived conversion table. The MAM-36 has adequate psychometric properties and is recommended as an outcome measure for upper limb function in pwMS</description>

    <time_frame>Pre-intervention (T0, baseline), post-intervention (T1, +8 weeks from baseline), 1 month follow-up (T2, +12 weeks from baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>A 7-point Likert-type global rating scale from both the patient and therapist's perspective will be applied. The question that will be asked will be: &quot;Compared to before treatment, at present, how would you rate your/the participant's functional upper limb activities?&quot; The responses will be rated as: 1= worse than ever, 2 = much worse, 3 = slightly worse, 4 = unchanged, 5 = slightly improved, 6 = much improved, 7= greatly improved.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The telerehab VR intervention consists of a custom-made software running on a computer connected with a commercial VR device (i.e. Oculus Rift). PwMS will be requested to reproduce several ADLs from the three main areas of self-care, dressing and meal preparation. The user can physically see his/her hands within the virtual scenario and, during the exercise, the hand coordinates are continuously recorded. Thus, data on 3D trajectory, speed, accuracy on target placement and movement smoothness, will be accessible. They will be stored in the PC and also be remotely sent to the clinical center for further analysis/processing. Both target position and task complexity will define the exercise difficulty, which can be modified automatically, on the basis of the previous performance or manually modified by the user</description>

    <description>Conventional therapy will focus on task-related upper-limb treatments while in a sitting or prone position, representing the standard care in MS. Several manual techniques, therapy tools and objects of ADL will be allowed during treatment. No restrictions will be placed on the material used (ie, ADL, reaching and grasping material). Use of additional electrical or mechanical therapy devices (ie, support arm systems, splints) will be avoided. The interventions will be conducted on a one-on-one basis in the physiotherapy or occupational therapy department of each participating center. Training and therapy content will be tailored to each participant's preferences, the agreed movement aims and the motor function level of each MS patient.</description>
