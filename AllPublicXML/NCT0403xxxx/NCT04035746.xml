  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Reperfusion is the main goal of early medical interventions after stroke, such as
      thrombolysis and thrombectomy. Recanalization works only if applied early - the earlier the
      better, but with a statistical cutoff of 4.5 hours where risk of hemorrhage outweighs the
      benefit. Recently, this cutoff has been put into perspective using standardized perfusion
      measurements by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT). Two trials have
      shown that revascularization is beneficial up to 24 hours after stroke onset if patient
      selection is based on perfusion imaging. This suggests interindividual differences in the
      temporal evolution of an infarction. One explanation for interindividual differences is the
      variability of the collateral blood supply to the brain, which in turn can maintain different
      perfusion pressures around the infarct core, also called the penumbra region. Insufficient
      recruitment of these collateral pathways is an independent negative predictor of poor
      outcome; the insufficiency may in part be explained by insufficient dilatation of arterioles
      (&quot;low dilator reserve&quot;). So far, interventions to improve collateral perfusion, e.g., induced
      hypertension, have not demonstrated effectiveness, likely because our understanding of
      collateral perfusion, demand-dependent dilatation of arteries (cerebrovascular reserve, CVR)
      and their effect on microcirculation is insufficient.

      Functional recovery after a brain lesion is based on plasticity. Plasticity involves the
      creation of new synapses, fibers (axons and dendrites) and lasting modification to synaptic
      strength as well as the formation and migration of new neurons. In the cortex surrounding an
      infarct, plasticity is facilitated by ischemia via modification of gene expression, i.e. a
      certain time window after stroke, and is stimulated by activity and training. Tissue
      microcirculatory status and perfusion surrounding the stroke lesion may play a role in the
      formation of this plasticity. The investigators will analyze the contributions of
      pre-existing vascular networks, the impact of stroke-affected vessels, timing and degree of
      recanalization success, brain excitability, and short-term intra-cortical inhibition to
      better understand how these factors relate to functional recovery after stroke.
