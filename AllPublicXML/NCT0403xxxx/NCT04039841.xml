  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At Departmental Hospital Centre, a primary and secondary screening program for osteoporosis
      was set up in 2014 in the medical services (excluding oncology), gynaecology, outpatient
      surgery and orthopaedics. Patients who consulted outpatients in the emergency room were not
      taken into account due to the 24-hour opening hours. The objective of this program was to
      identify all patients at risk of osteoporosis; i. e. not only patients with a recent or
      previous fracture history, but also patients with osteoporosis risk factors without a history
      of fracture to date. This is in order to propose a prevention strategy to referring
      physicians and thus reduce the risk of fractures. The handover of the Timed Up and Go
      designed and physically carried out was added in July 2017 to the management of patients as
      part of this screening.

      During this screening, patients are asked to perform 2 realized Timed Up and Go (rTUG),
      followed by 2 imagined Timed Up and Go (iTUG).

      The interest in preventing falls in osteoporotic patients leads investigators to propose this
      evaluation as part of this &quot;osteoporosis&quot; screening. The investigators will offer patients
      benefiting from osteoporosis screening as part of the process already in place at
      Departmental Hospital Centre to participate in the FallMi study. If agreement is reached, the
      patient's treating physician will be contacted to collect data on the occurrence of falls in
      these patients. After a request by mail, an email will be sent to the attending physicians of
      each patient at 6 months, then one year after the completion of the TUG. This email will ask
      physicians about the presence of a fall that has occurred since the TUGs were performed, as
      well as the severity of this possible fall.

      Investigators objective is to evaluate rTUG and iTUG as predictive factors of a fall with
      moderate to fatal consequences.

      Investigators hypothesize that a lower isochrony between rTUG and iTUG is predictive of a
      risk of falling.

      Fall of the elderly is a major public health problem, especially in people with fragile
      bones. Various tools are available to identify high-risk subjects. Timed Up and Go (TUG) is a
      clinical test used as a predictive test of fall. However, its real usefulness remains
      uncertain. The degradation of TUG appears to be validated after the fall, but discussed as a
      prediction of a future fall.

      On the other hand, human movement is separable into 2 phases, a programming phase
      (anticipation) and an execution phase. Movement programming can be reliably assessed through
      a simple test that evaluates the concordance between the duration of an imagined practice and
      a physical practice . Adapted to Timed Up and Go (= |realizedTUG -imaginedTUG|), the
      degradation of this Isochronic Index clinically marks a structural and functional degradation
      of cognitive abilities . In addition, the decrease in isochrony is correlated with the
      decrease in walking speed during the double task. This loss of isochrony could thus indicate
      a risk of falling due to poor anticipation of real motor skills.

      At Departmental Hospital Centre, a primary and secondary screening program for osteoporosis
      was set up in 2014 in the medical services (excluding oncology), gynaecology, outpatient
      surgery and orthopaedics. Patients who consulted outpatients in the emergency room were not

      The interest in preventing falls in osteoporotic patients leads us to propose this evaluation
      as part of this &quot;osteoporosis&quot; screening. This study wills offer patients benefiting from

    <description>Imagined Timed Up and Go (iTUG) is the imagined version of the actual Timed Up and Go (rTUG) described above). It is possible to calculate the absolute value of the difference between the time of execution of the TUG imagined and actually executed. This difference is called isochrony index. The alteration of this isochrony index is correlated with the decrease in walking speed during the double task. This test is performed during the osteoporosis screening consultation.
For patients who agree to participate in the FallMI study, the name and contact information of the attending physician will be collected during the same consultation.
Standardised email will be sent to the attending physicians to collect the presence of falls and its consequences. They will be classified as fatal, severe, moderate and inconsequential.</description>
