      Monocentric and prospective study, evaluating the benefit of self-monitoring optimized by
      therapeutic education either by the environmental Amsler or the Amsler grid according to the
      patient's choice and to determine the patient's ability to determine the reality itself
      recidivism and therefore the need for treatment.
