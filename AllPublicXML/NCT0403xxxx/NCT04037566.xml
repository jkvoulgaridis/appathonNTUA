  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human trial proposed to test CD19-specific CAR-T cells with edited
      endogenous HPK1 (XYF19 CAR-T cells) in patients with relapsed or refractory CD19+ leukemia or
      lymphoma. This is an investigational study designed as a single-center, open-label and
      single-arm clinical trial.

    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Determine safety profile of a single infusion of XYF19 CAR-T cells by monitoring the frequency and severity of adverse events assessed by the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, version 5.0). Occurrence of study related adverse events defined as NCI CTCAE v5.0 &gt; grade 3 possibly, probably, or definitely related to study treatment. Grade 1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated. Grade 2 Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate instrumental Activities of Daily Living (ADL). Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self care ADL. Grade 4 Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated. Grade 5 Death related to adverse event.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) as determined by dose limiting toxicity (DLT).</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>The MTD is defined as the dose level at which fewer than 33% of patients experience a dose limiting toxicity (DLT). The dose limiting toxicity is defined as CTCAE grades non-reversible grade 3, or any grade 4-5 allergic reactions related to the study cell infusion; CTCAE grades non-reversible grade 3, or any grade 4-5 autoimmune reactions related to the study cell infusion; or CTCAE grades non-reversible non-hematologic grade 3, or any grade 4-5 organ toxicity (cardiac, dermatologic, gastrointestinal, hepatic, pulmonary, renal/genitourinary, or neurologic) not pre-existing or due to the underlying malignancy and occurring within 30 days of study product infusion related to study cell infusion. The study will employ a standard 3+3 design to find the MTD of XYF19 CAR-T cells dose.</description>
