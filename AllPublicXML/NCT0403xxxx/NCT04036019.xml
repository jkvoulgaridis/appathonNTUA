  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a single arm, single-center, non-randomized clinical study which is designed to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of C-CAR066 in treatment of r/r B cell lymphoma who received
      CD19 CAR-T therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study plans to enroll 12 patients to assess the safety and efficacy of C-CAR066.
      Subjects who meet the eligibility criteria will receive a single dose of C-CAR066 injection.

      The study will include the following sequential phases: Screening, Pre- Treatment (Cell
      Product Preparation; Lymphodepleting Chemotherapy), Treatment and Follow-up.
