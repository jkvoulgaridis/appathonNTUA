    <textblock>
      Single-site prospective interventional study aiming to demonstrate the effect of
      spore-forming probiotics on dyspeptic symptoms and blood, saliva and stool parameters in FD
      patients with and without acid suppression, compared to placebo.

      Prospective randomized placebo-controlled study in 2 parallel FD cohorts (8 weeks) with
      open-label extension phase (8 weeks):

        -  cohort 1FD (on-PPI): study procedures at inclusion (1) and after 8 weeks on-PPI+
           sporebiotics or placebo (2) followed by 8 weeks on-PPI+ sporebiotics (open label)

        -  cohort 2FD (off-PPI): study procedures at inclusion (1) and after 8 weeks of
           sporebiotics or placebo (2) followed by 8 weeks of sporebiotics (open label)

      Clinical outcomes and blood, saliva and stool parameters will be assessed at the beginning
      and end of each treatment period (week 0, 8 and 16) with additional questionnaires after 1
      month (week 4 and 12).

    <description>Change in Leuven Postprandial Distress Scale (LPDS) on sporebiotics vs. placebo and within-groups.
LPDS is a daily diary assessing the severity of 11 upper gastrointestinal symptoms scored from 0 (none) to 4 (very severe) of which the total value is calculated (ranging from 0 to 44) with higher scores representing worse outcomes.
A minimum clinically important difference of 0.7 for the cardinal FD symptoms (average of first 3 questions) will be used as a cut-off to determine clinical response to sporebiotics by comparing pretreatment scores with the average score during the last week on treatment.</description>
