  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study was to examine the prophylactic role of repetitive transcranial magnetic
      stimulation (rTMS) on the frequency, and severity of migraine attacks in episodic migraineurs
      who failed medical treatment.

      A group received 5 rTMS sessions, delivered over one week. Each rTMS session consisted of a
      single train of 900 total pulses over 3 minutes duration given at 5-Hz frequency and 100%
      motor threshold intensity and the placebo group received rTMS with the same stimulation
      frequency at a fixed intensity of 50% of the machine output
