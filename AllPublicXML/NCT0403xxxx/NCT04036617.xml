        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who meet the following criteria will be considered eligible to participate in
             the clinical study:

               1. Healthy male and female subjects (women of non-childbearing potential) between 18
                  and 55 years of age. Note: Women of non-childbearing potential is defined as
                  being amenorrhoeic for &gt;12 months with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age
                  appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms). However, if indicated, this should
                  be confirmed by follicle-stimulation hormone (FSH) levels consistent with
                  menopause (according to local laboratory ranges). Or, have been permanently
                  sterilised (e.g. hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy or bilateral
                  oophorectomy).

               2. The subject is healthy as determined by past medical history and as judged by the
                  PI or designee.

               3. The subject voluntarily agrees to participate in this study and signs an
                  Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)-approved informed consent prior to performing
                  any of the Screening procedures.

               4. The subject has a BMI of 18-32 kg/m2, inclusive, at Screening.

               5. The subject has no clinically significant history of previous allergy or
                  sensitivity to NaQuinate or any of the excipients contained within the IMP.

               6. The subject has no clinically significant abnormal serum biochemistry,
                  haematology, coagulation and urine examination values within 28 days before the
                  first dose of IMP.

               7. The subject has no clinically significant abnormalities in 12-lead
                  electrocardiogram (QTcF â‰¤ 450 mSec and PR 120-220 mSec).

               8. Male subjects and their female spouse/partner of childbearing potential must use
                  appropriate effective methods of contraception from the time of dosing until
                  after the end-of-study (EOS) visit. See Section 7.5.2 for protocol-specified
                  contraception guidance.

               9. Male subjects must not donate sperm from first dose until at least 3 months after
                  last dose of IMP.

              10. The subject is a non-smoker, defined as a subject who has not smoked previously
                  and/or who has discontinued smoking or the use of nicotine/nicotine-containing
                  products (including snuff and similar products) at least 3 months before the
                  Screening visit.

              11. The subject must be available to complete the study (including all Follow-up
                  visits).

              12. The subject must satisfy the PI / designee about their fitness to participate in
                  the study and agree to comply with the protocol requirements, instructions, and
                  study related restrictions

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who meet one or more of the following criteria will not be considered
             eligible to participate in the clinical study:

               1. Female subjects who are breastfeeding or female subjects with a positive serum
                  pregnancy test at Screening or a positive urine pregnancy test on Day -1.

               2. Subjects who have donated blood in the 3 months prior to Screening, plasma in the
                  7 days prior to Screening or platelets in the 6 weeks prior to Screening.

               3. A positive urine cotinine result at Screening or on Day -1.

               4. Subjects who have used the following within 7 days of first dosing: any
                  non-prescribed systemic or topical medication (with the exception of paracetamol
                  to a maximum of 2 g per day), remedy or supplement, any prescribed systemic or
                  topical medication within 14 days of first dosing.

               6. Subjects who have a history of significant drug allergy (e.g., anaphylaxis) or
                  any clinically significant allergic condition (excluding hay fever), as
                  determined by the PI.

                  any study visit and while confined to the clinical unit.

               9. Subjects who received last IMP dose in a clinical study within the following time
                  period prior to dosing: 3 months or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer.

              10. Subjects who have had a clinically significant illness, medical/surgical
                  procedure, or trauma within 4 weeks of dosing, as determined by the PI.

                  (HIV-1) and/or type 2 (HIV 2) at Screening.

              12. Vulnerable subjects defined as individuals whose willingness to volunteer in a
                  clinical study may be unduly influenced by the expectation, whether justified or
                  not, of benefits associated with participation, or of a retaliatory response from
                  senior members of a hierarchy in case of refusal to participate (e.g., persons in
                  detention, minors and those incapable of giving consent).
