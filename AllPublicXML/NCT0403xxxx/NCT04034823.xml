    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single arm phase II trial to evaluate the efficacy, safety and
      tolerability of KN035 in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel. Eligible patient will be
      enrolled and receive protocol defined therapies until progressive disease, unacceptable
      toxicity or withdrawal of informed consent. Tumor assessment will be performed according to
      RECIST 1.1 criteria.
