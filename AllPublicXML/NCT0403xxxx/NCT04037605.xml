  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to 1) determine how hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA
      axis) activation occurs with sleep restriction and 2) evaluate how
      hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis (HPG axis) deactivation occurs with sleep restriction.
      The investigator will also examine the cognitive function associated with sleep restriction,
      including food intake and food cravings.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sleep restriction and its consequences are major public health problems, especially in older
      adults. Among the more severe physiological sequelae of sleep restriction is the development
      of insulin resistance. The mechanisms by which sleep restriction leads to increased insulin
      resistance are unknown, especially in vulnerable older adults; such research informs
      development of targeted interventions against the sleep loss/insulin resistance link.

      This study will administer drugs to clamp the function of each of these nodes to determine
      the regulatory changes that have occurred with sleep restriction. Even though the study is
      randomized order in design, the main comparison is before and after sleep restriction under
      each of these clamp conditions. Participants are admitted to the chronobiology laboratory
      where they are given 1 night of 10 hours sleep opportunity, followed by 4 nights of 4 hours
      sleep opportunity.

      Up to 40 participants can be enrolled. However, participants will be allowed an opportunity
      to be randomized to all 4 conditions so that as few as 10 participants may be required. We
      anticipate 5 men and 5 women will be enrolled assuming each undergoes all 4 clamp conditions.
