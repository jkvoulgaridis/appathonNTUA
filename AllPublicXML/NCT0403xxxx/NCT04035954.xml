  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with cerebral palsy (CP) have limitations in postural reactions and antigravity
      movements. Trunk control is the determinant of posture, balance, walking and functional
      activities. Core stability connects deep abdominal muscles, spine, pelvis, and shoulder
      girdle to protect the posture and provides support for extremity movements. Pilates and core
      stabilization were associated with postural control in elderly, MS and stroke individuals and
      it was concluded that pilates caused an increase in trunk stabilization. There are not enough
      studies investigating the effectiveness of pilates exercises in CP. The aim of this study was
      to investigate the effects of modified pilates exercises on body control, gait and
      functionality in children with CP.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postural control is the ability of the body to control its position in space for stability
      and orientation. Postural stability and balance are achieved by keeping the center of gravity
      of the body within the support surface. Stability can also occur with a static response when
      the body is stationary, and a dynamic response to internal or external perturbations when it
      is mobile. Antisipation of perturbation forces requires an effective core stabilization
      muscle activation as well as an effective integration of stimuli from different sensory
      systems. Trunk control is also provided by this relationship between neural systems and
      skeletal muscles. Children with CP show deficits in proximal muscle co-contraction and
      vertical posture stabilization, with limitations in postural reactions and antigravity
      movements. Trunk control is the determinant of balance, gait and functional activities from
      the early period. Core stability; it connects with deep abdominal muscles, spine, pelvis and
      shoulder girdle muscles to protect the posture and provide support for limb movement. During
      reaching out, stepping and sudden perturbations, the Transversus Abdominus muscle is
      activated primarily from other trunk and limb muscles, creating a core stability. Core
      activity includes not only spinal stability and power generation, but also many upper and
      lower extremity movements. Control is established by focusing on the transversus abdominis
      muscle by core stabilization training with Pilates, stabilization of trunk muscles. The
      proximal extremity muscles of the hip are also important to maintain the upright posture and
      maintain mobility. For example; hip abductor muscle strength compared to the knee and ankle
      muscles, walking variables and motor functions in children with CP were more correlated.
      Although the importance of walking was determined, activation patterns of trunk and hip
      muscles during walking were examined in a limited number of studies in individuals with CP.
      The effects of pilates on healthy adults, elderly, multiple sclerosis, stroke and
      musculoskeletal disorders were investigated and resulted in increased trunk
      stabilization.Therefore, it is thought that pilates can be applied in terms of muscle
      strength and postural control in children who can walk, stand independently, but need to
      develop some components for controlled movement. There are not enough studies investigating
      the effectiveness of pilates exercises in CP. The aim of this study was to investigate the
      effects of modified pilates exercises on body control, gait and function in children with CP.

    <measure>Change of Abdominal Fatigue test</measure>
    <time_frame>first day of intervention and after the 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It measures the endurance of the anterior abdominal wall by asking the person to hold a sit- up position as long as they can. The subjects are required to sit on the test bench t and place the upper trunk against a support with an angle of 60 degree from the test bench. Both knee and hip are flexed to 90 degree .Both arms are folded across the chest with the hands placed on the opposite shoulder and toes are stabilized to the bed (either by manual support or by straps). The subjects are asked to maintain the body position while the supporting back support is withdrawn. The stopwatch is started at the moment, when the support is withdrawn. The stopwatch is stopping when the upper body fell below the 60 degree position.Time duration between these two points are recorded as the endurance holding score of the anterior abdominal muscle group.</description>

    <measure>Change of Sharman's core stabilite testi (PBU=Pressure Biofeedback Unit Test)</measure>
    <time_frame>first day of intervention and after the 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It is objective and clinically feasible method to evaluate core stability in the laboratory settings which uses a stabilizer Pressure Biofeedback Unit with its inflatable pad placed in the inflatable cell was placed centrally beneath the abdomen with the lower edge at the level of the anterior superior iliac spines while the subject is lying supine, and is inflated to certain pressure of 70 mm Hg.The person is asked to pull his belly in as much as he can in a tight pants. While this is observed, the development of any other movement strategy (breast swelling, breath holding, pelvis movement) is noted and inhibited. The pressure may drop 6-10mmHg from the limit line. After the start, the test is terminated when 10 repetitions and 10 seconds of contraction are formed. Times are measured with a stopwatch. At each contraction, the onset of PBU is 70 mmHg, pressure changes and averages after 10 contraction are calculated. No feedback is given to the patient during the measurement.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of Pediatric Reach Test (PRT)</measure>
    <time_frame>first day of intervention and after the 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>PRT was developed and modified from Functional Reach Test which was originally developed for measuring standing functional reach in adult populations. Due to the consideration that many children with CP are only able to maintain the upright position in sitting, PRT is developed to measure the maximal reach distance of children with CP both in sitting and standing positions. The total score of PRT is the sum of scores of PRT during sitting and PRT during standing.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of Physician Rating Scale (PRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>first day of intervention and after the 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>One of these instruments is the Physician Rating Scale (PRS), an observational clinical evaluation of gait. This simple scale records gait in the sagittal plane only. Gait variables are recorded in the subtitle of Crouch, Knee, Foot contact scoring and general Change. Several items are geared to quantify visually the relationship between the ankle and knee position during stance. Maximum total score is 10.Also maximum scores shows the better results.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of Berg Balance Scale (BBS)</measure>
    <time_frame>first day of intervention and after the 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The BBS is a simple measure with 14 items that can be completed within 20 minutes. These items are used to test functional skills relevant to everyday tasks, progressing from stable positions to position changes and finally to the upright position with various maneuvers to challenge balance. The items are scored on a 5-point ordinal scale from 0 to 4 (0-1-2-3-4). The highest score is 56 points; a higher score indicates a better functional balance performance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of Seated Postural Control Measure (SPCM)</measure>
    <time_frame>first day of intervention and after the 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>SPCM has two sections. One section examines postural alignment and consists of 22 items; the other section examines functional movement and consists of 12 items. The SPCM can be administered and scored in 20 minutes or less. An ordinal scale of 0 to 3 is used to score each segmental posture. A given deviation, whether to the right or the left, would receive the same score. Visual observation and palpation are the only methods used to estimate postural alignment. At the beginning of the assessment, the child is placed in the seat in what the assessing therapist considers an optimal position. Verbal encouragement (without manual support) to maintain a correct posture is given. Each of the items in the function section consists of four levels, with higher grades representing better task achievement (from zero to completion). A maximum of 1 minute is allowed for motivating the child and completing each item. If more than one attempt is made, the best performance is scored.</description>
