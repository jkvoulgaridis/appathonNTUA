      Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains to be a leading cause of cancer mortality [1]. It induces a
      substantial financial burden in terms of healthcare utilization and quality-adjusted life
      years (QALY) lost [2]. Fecal Occult Blood Tests (FOBT) and colonoscopy were proven effective
      in reducing CRC mortality by 33% and 68%, respectively [3-5]. Both tests have been proposed
      as primary screening modalities for asymptomatic subjects by international guidelines and
      Asia Pacific consensus statements [6-8]. However, colonoscopy has a low compliance rate at
      approximately 20% in Chinese populations, and has been perceived by screening participants as
      invasive, expensive and inconvenient due to the need for bowel preparation [9, 10]. In
      addition, the accuracy of FOBT is limited and its adherence declined sharply over time [11,
      12]. Hence, the recent decade witnessed a rapid development of non-invasive biomarkers to
      detect CRC.

      Faecal-DNA test is a novel screening test for CRC, using molecular techniques to identify
      CRC-relevant biomarkers in stool. One of its toolkits, branded 'ColoGuard' (sDNA, Exact
      Sciences), was first approved by the FDA in 2014 for its application in clinical practice
      [13]. It consists of quantitative molecular assays for KRAS mutations, aberrant NDRG4 and
      BMP3 methylation, and β-actin, and a hemoglobin immunoassay [13], which has been widely
      promoted in US. In 2016, it was endorsed by the United States Preventive Service Task Force
      (USPSTF) as one of the recommended screening tests [14].

      Recently, a test kit named 'COLOSAFE' (or namedChang An Xin) has been developed as a
      faecal-DNA product targeted to improve diagnostic accuracy of CRC screening [15]. It is a
      stool test of methylated SDC2 for detection of CRC. This stool test of methylated SDC2
      detected 81.1% of CRC and 58.2% of adenomas at a speciﬁcity of 93.3%. SDC2 is also named
      ﬁbroglycan, encoding a type I trans-membrane heparansulfate proteoglycan. In certain cancers,
      hypermethylation of SDC2 had been reported. Recent studies showed that methylated SDC2 was
      detected at high frequency in blood from CRC patients [16, 17]. As tumor cells are exfoliated
      into the gut lumen earlier than vascular invasion when CRC develops [18], faecal sample could
      represent a more suitable specimen than plasma for detection of early cancer.

      A recent study involving 1,200 subjects from 2015 to 2017 by the Sixth Affiliated Hospital of
      Sun Yat-sen University, Nanfang Hospital of Southern Medical University and Shandong Cancer
      Hospital showed that the 'COLOSAFE' test kit attained a sensitivity of 85% while maintaining
      a specificity of 98% (unpublished data). Because of its novelty, the 'COLOSAFEtest kit was
      recognized as a 'creative medical apparatus' by the National CFDA in March 2017. In June
      2017, the project 'Screening and intervention research of Chinese CRC' (2017YFC 1308800) was
      launched with national key project for non-communicable disease control. Nevertheless, there
      are limitations with the design of the original study [15]. For instance, it involved a
      small, single-centre that recruited a homogeneous sample of individuals only. An important
      knowledge gap exists and additional clinical trials are required to further validate its
      diagnostic accuracy in other populations.

      A case-control study will be performed to assess the sensitivity and specificity of the
      faecal-DNA test in a Hong Kong Chinese population. All subjects will receive both the
      faecal-DNA test and colonoscopy to calculate the above index.

        A total of 400 individuals aged 45-79 years will be consecutively recruited for this study.
        Among them, we aim to recruit 150 subjects with known diagnosis of CRC; 150 subjects with
        normal colonoscopy findings; and 100 subjects whose colonoscopies showed other pathologies
        (e.g. inflammatory polyps, adenomas, diverticular diseases). To enhance comparability of
        the cases and the controls, we aim to recruit these subjects in the same hospital (medical
        or surgical clinics of the Prince of Wales Hospital). Stool samples will be collected
        within 8 days to 3 months after the individuals received colonoscopy, but before any
        treatments, including surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. We aim to match cases and
        controls by their age and gender.
