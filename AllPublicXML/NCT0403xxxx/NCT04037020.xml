  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test how the brain responds when enjoyable foods such as
      chocolate are consumed. The investigators know that eating certain types of foods can make an
      individual want to keep eating even when he or she is full. The chemical in the brain that
      causes this is called dopamine. The investigators can measure this response by looking at
      changes to how an individual's eye responds to light.

      The overall objective of this study is to determine dopamine (DA) neuromodulation (changes in
      b-wave amplitude as measured by electroretinography (ERG)) in response to consuming a highly
      reinforcing food (chocolate). The investigators hypothesize that orosensory stimulation with
      chocolates with increasing sugar content will increase the beta wave (b-wave) amplitude and
      the increase in the b-wave amplitude will correlate with score changes on the Psychophysical
      Effects Questionnaire (PEQ). This will be accomplished by testing different chocolates
      (extreme dark (90% cocoa), dark (70% cocoa), milk (38% cocoa), and white (0% cocoa)) on
      different days using 1.0 cdâˆ™s/m2 flash luminance energy.

    <description>A preference for dark chocolate and/or a greater habitual fat intake will positively correlate with the retinal dopamine-mediated response to the dark chocolates (90% and 70% cocoa) and a preference for milk chocolate and/or a greater habitual added sugar will positively correlate with the retinal dopamine-mediated response to the milk and white chocolates. Higher amounts of artificial sweetener intake will will positively correlate with the retinal dopamine-mediated response to the milk and white chocolates. Greater habitual chocolate intake will positively correlate to changes in b-wave amplitude.</description>
