    <textblock>
      The objective of this retrospective consecutive series PMCF study is to collect data
      confirming safety, performance and clinical benefits of the JuggerKnot Mini Soft Anchor
      (implant and instrumentation) when used for soft tissue to bone fixation in the treatment of
      temporomandibular joint (TMJ) surgery. Safety, performance, and clinical benefits will be
      evaluated at the following time points: pre op, 6 weeks, 3 months and 1-year follow-up.
      JuggerKnot Mini has been on the market since November of 2011.

      The primary objective is to confirm safety of the study products. This will be assessed by
      recording the incidence and frequency of revisions, complications, and adverse events.
      Relationship of the events to either implant or instrumentation should be specified.

      The secondary objective is the assessment of performance and clinical benefits by analyzing
      recorded patient-reported clinical outcomes measures (PROMs).

    <description>The TMJ Function portion of the Pain Assessment Survey is assessed by if the patient experiences Temporomandibular Joint Clicking or Popping Noise. The Joint Clicking or Popping noise is evaluated as a Yes the joint click when opening and closing the mouth, or No the joint does not click when opening and closing the mouth on either the left or right side.</description>

    <description>The Headache portion of the Pain Assessment Survey is evaluated as, Yes the patient has headaches, or No the patient does not have headaches. If they check yes the survey asks on which side of the headache occurs and in which location. Location options are: Front, Posterior, Temporal or Top of the head.</description>
