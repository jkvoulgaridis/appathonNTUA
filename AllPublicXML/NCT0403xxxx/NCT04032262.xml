      This study focuses on the relationship between the brain and the gut, and additionally will
      foster collaboration between Movement Disorder experts and Neurogastroenterologists to
      provide critical information and lead to innovative therapies in the future to treat GI
      dysfunction of Parkinson's Disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease affects 1 million people in the US with a rising prevalence. In addition
      to neurological problems, patients with Parkinson's Disease often suffer from debilitating
      gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms related to delayed stomach emptying, gas/bloating, and
      constipation. GI complaints of patients suffering from Parkinson's Disease are poorly
      understood. This proposal aims to characterize GI disturbance in patients with Parkinson's
      Disease and provide deeper understanding by investigating symptoms, regional and whole gut
      transit, anorectal physiology, and the brain-gut axis. The investigator believes patients
      with Parkinson's Disease will show altered GI sensation, slower GI motility and demonstrate
      deranged regulation of the brain-gut axis correlated to severity of Parkinson's disease.
      Results from this study of GI motility and brain-gut axis will define a subset of Parkinson's
      Disease patients that can benefit from tailored treatment. This study will foster
      collaboration between Movement Disorder experts and Neurogastroenterologists to provide
      critical information and lead to innovative therapies in the future to treat GI dysfunction
      of Parkinson's Disease.

    <measure>Gastrointestinal motor function and transit</measure>
    <time_frame>2 visits, 1hour</time_frame>
    <description>The measurements to be obtained are gastric emptying time (GET), small bowel transit time (SBTT), colonic transit time (CTT) and whole gut transit time (WGTT) over a period of 5 days. Tool to be used includes wireless motility capsule and corresponding recorder swallowed on initial visit and returned 5 days later. Specific measurements obtained include time in hours of GET, SBTT, CTT, WGTT. These outcome will only be measured once per subject and not be reassessed.</description>

    <measure>Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Single visit, 1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>Used to follow the longitudinal course of Parkinson's disease. The UPDRS scale consists of the following five segments: 1) Mentation, Behavior, and Mood, 2) ADL, 3) Motor sections, 4) Modified Hoehn and Yahr Scale, and 5) Schwab and England ADL scale. Some sections of the UPDRS scale require multiple grades assigned to each extremity with a possible maximum of 199 points. A score of 199 on the UPDRS scale represents the worst (total disability) with a score of zero representing (no disability).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Single visit, 1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>Screening assessment for detecting cognitive impairment. MoCA scores range between 0 and 30. A final total score of 26 and above is considered normal.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Non-motor symptoms questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Single visit, 1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>A 30-item screening patient-based questionnaire used to determine the non-motor symptoms experienced by the patient. The points should be totalled to give a score out of 30. A score of under 10 is mild, 10-20 moderate and over 20, severe.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36)</measure>
    <time_frame>Single visit, 1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>SF-36 is a set of generic, coherent, and easily administered quality-of-life measures. The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Stool diary</measure>
    <time_frame>2 visits, 1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>The measurement to be obtained is bowel pattern. Tool to be used include 2-week stool diary. Specific measurements obtained include number of complete spontaneous bowel movements (CSBMs) a week. These outcome will only be measured once per subject and not be reassessed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index (GCSI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Single visit, 1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>The GCSI is based on three subscales: post-prandial fullness/early satiety (4 items); nausea/vomiting (3 items), and bloating (2 items). A six‐point Likert response scale, ranging from 0 (none) to 5 (very severe), with a 2‐week recall period, was used to rate the severity of each symptom. The GCSI total score was constructed as the average of the three symptom sub‐scales. GCSI total scores were in the range 0-5, with higher scores reflecting greater symptom severity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Eckdart score (ESS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Single visit, 1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>The ESS is a 4 item self‐report scale measuring weight loss in kilograms, chest pain, regurgitation, and dysphagia. Each item is graded on a score of 0 to 3, with a maximum score of 12. Scores greater than or equal to 3 are considered suggestive of active achalasia. The ESS is widely used in both clinical and research settings as a gold standard for measuring achalasia symptom severity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Breath testing</measure>
    <time_frame>Single visit, 3 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The measurement to be obtained is presence of bacterial overgrowth. Tool to be used include breath testing via gas chromatography. Specific measurements obtained hydrogen and methane in parts per million (ppm) at baseline and every 30 minutes for 2-3 hours. These outcome will only be measured once per subject and not be reassessed.</description>
