  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are investigating the effectiveness of a wearable multisite transcranial
      magnetic stimulation (mTMS) device that can deliver stimuli at multiple cortical sites
      simultaneously or sequentially for the treatment of an epileptic syndrome - focal
      continuous-spike and wave during sleep.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Continuous Spike and Wave during Sleep (CSWS) is a rare neurological disease with an
      incidence of 0.2 - 0.5% of childhood epilepsy. It is often accompanied by comprehensive
      damage to brain function and associated neurodevelopmental problems. It is an epileptic
      syndrome which seriously affects the cognitive function of children. While it can be treated
      with drugs, other modalities are being sought, especially, in cases that are resistant to
      standard treatment. One such approach that is being tested is repetitive magnetic stimulation
      (rTMS). Noninvasive magnet stimulation of the cerebral cortex is an important and useful
      technique in neuroscience research, as well as in diagnostic and therapeutic clinical
      investigations. Over the last three decades the magnetic stimulation procedure is being
      carried out using a device called transcranial magnetic stimulator (TMS), which uses a large
      hand-held electromagnetic coil passing high amplitude current to induce her rapid changing
      magnetic field at a single cortical site. TMS has found clinical application several
      neurological and psychiatric conditions such as stroke, major depression, migraine, movement
      disorders and Tourette syndrome. One limitation of conventional TMS, besides the bulkiness of
      the device and large amount of current involved, is that it allows stimulation at only one
      cortical site at a time.Dr. Santosh Helekar of Houston Methodist Research Institute (HMRI)
      and Dr. Henning Voss of Weill-Cornell Medical College (WCMC) have developed a compact
      portable and wearable multisite transcranial magnetic stimulation device called Transcranial
      Rotating Permanent Magnet Stimulator (TRPMS) that can deliver stimuli at multiple cortical
      sites simultaneously or sequentially. It uses rapidly rotating small high-strength permanent
      magnets to induce currents in the brain. As opposed to conventional TMS, the TRPMS device is
      also ideally suited to conduct double blinded placebo controlled studies because undetectable
      demagnetized magnets can be intermixed with actual magnet to allow rapid rotation of either
      type of magnets to be activated and one in the same device in a randomized protocol. Under a
      previously approved HMRI study protocol this new device has been shown to induce motor-evoked
      potentials (MEPs) in the thenar muscles by highly focused stimulation of the cortical
      representation in the precentral gyrus.

      In the present study, the investigators would like to conduct a test to see the therapeutic
      effectiveness of focused TRPMS stimulation of the epileptogenic region found on scalp
      electroencephalogram (EEG) in patients with focal CSWS. The specific aim of the study are:

        1. To look at the immediate benefit obtained by CSWS patients subjected to 10 minutes of
           one-time TRPMS-ECA (epileptogenic cortical area) stimulation; evaluated as a reduction
           in Spike-Wave Index (SWI) on EEG during sleep.

        2. To look at duration of sustainability (hours) of change in SWI achieved post
           stimulation.

        3. To look at the tolerability of patients in using TRPMS.

    <description>This study will be conducted over one year in 10 focal CSWS patients ranging in age from 3 to 21 years. The patients will be recruited from the large patient population that is served by the Children's Mercy Comprehensive Epilepsy Monitoring Unit (EMU) in Overland Park, Kansas. Subjects will be identified from these EMU patient population. Those meeting inclusion criteria will be approached for possible enrollment. Inclusion criteria will be defined by patients that were diagnosed with focal CSWS in accordance with the ILAE classification with SWI &gt;85% during NREM sleep on their previous or most recent EEG. Patients and their parents/guardians will provide assent/consent for participation in the study after being briefed on the nature of the study, by reading and signing assent and assent/consent forms, respectively</description>

    <description>Each patient will receive a 10 minute treatment of one time stimulation of the Epileptogenic Cortical Area (ECA). The TRPMS cap will be worn over the previously fixed scalp EEG electrodes. The procedure during this treatment session will consist of positioning a device microstimulator component centered on an area of focal epileptiform discharges (identified with EEG electrode placement) with the patient relaxing in a chair.
The stimulus parameters used will be 120 stimulus trains of 100 ms in duration, each train delivered every 5 s for total session duration of 10 min. . The investigators will measure the subject for adequate placement of the device prior to stimulation. Once the placement of the device is confirmed, the study technician administrating the treatment will turn on the device using the app downloaded on an electronic device connected by Bluetooth to the device.</description>
