  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to evaluate whether combining medications that are FDA approved
      but have not yet been approved for combination treatment, can be an effective way to reduce
      pain. This is study 2 is a series of studies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will systematically evaluate whether a combination of pharmacotherapies can
      effectively alleviate chronic pain. Subjects will complete a screening session before
      completing 5 study sessions that will occur once weekly. Subjects will double-blind doses of
      study medications the morning of each experimental session, and will undergo standardized
      pain testing, as well as provide self-report ratings of drug effects, and cognitive tests.

    <description>This is a within-subject study so all session procedures will be identical, however the specific medications provided as part of the double-blinded study medications may change during each session. During each session, which will last up to 8 hours a day and will be conducted on an outpatient basis, participants will be asked to complete standardized pain testing procedures, as well as questionnaires about how participants are feeling and to complete cognitive tasks.</description>

    <intervention_name>Within-subject test of blinded study medications</intervention_name>
    <description>This is a double-blind within-subject Phase II trial. As such, study medications must remain blinded. Participants may receive a dose of medication from one or more of the following categories: prescription stimulants, prescription benzodiazepines, prescription opioids, prescription cannabinoids, over-the-counter medications, or placebo (sugar pill). This study will use a within-subject design, and all participants will serve as participants' own control. Study medication administration will be randomized within each participant.</description>
