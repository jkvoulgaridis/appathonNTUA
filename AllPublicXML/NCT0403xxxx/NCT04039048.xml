  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebellar ataxia is a neurologic symptom caused by damage or dysfunction in the cerebellum
      and its pathways that results in loss of coordination, balance and postural control. There is
      a high rate (93%) of fallings for this population that could limit daily life activities.
      Pharmacological interventions are not able to modify the balance, therefore, new approaches
      to rehabilitate must be studied. ctDCS is a non-invasive brain stimulation that seems to be a
      new and innovator technique to restore ataxia symptoms. The purpose of this study is to
      evaluate the effects of ctDCS associated with balance training on cerebellar ataxia patients.
      A counterbalanced crossover, sham-controlled, triple blind trial will be performed. All
      subjects will receive the real and sham ctDCS associated to balance training. The anodal
      ctDCS (2 mA, 20 minutes) or sham (2mA, 30 seconds) will be applied during balance training at
      Biodex Balance System (BBS). The balance will be the primary outcome and will be evaluated
      through Posture Control at Biodex Balance System. Ataxia' severity and functional mobility
      will be the secondary outcomes and will be evaluated by the scale for the assessment and
      rating of ataxia (SARA) and 10 meters walking test, respectively.

    <description>The change in balance will be assessed through postural control index of Biodex Balance System. This postural control index is a continuous variable where lower index means less instability and better balance.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Ataxia' severity</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes before the intervention and 15 minutes after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The ataxia' severity will be assessed by the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA). It consists of eight items (gait, stance, sitting, speech disturbance, finger chase, nose-finger test, fast alternating, hand movements, and heel-shin slide), where higher score (40) mean more severe ataxia, whereas lower score (0) means less ataxia symptoms. The score happens about the sum of the eight items.</description>

    <description>The patient will walk 10 meters and the time will be measured to determine the functional mobility. Where lower time to walk 10 meters, better functional mobility.</description>
