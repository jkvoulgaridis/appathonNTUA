  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was a single-center positive-controlled, randomized, dose-escalation study of
      HSK3486 in healthy female subjects administered as a single IV bolus dose.Subjects were
      confined to the study unit from the evening of Day -1 until the morning of Day 2, then were
      required to return for a follow up visit on Day 5. Intensive safety, PD and PK assessments
      were performed prior to dosing on Day 1 until 24 hours post-dose (Day 2).
