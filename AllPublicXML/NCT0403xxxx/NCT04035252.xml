    <textblock>
      Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a common vascular disease and associated with risk of
      rupture, but also with a high cardiovascular (CV) event rate. A key difficulty in AAA is
      predicting these life-threatening complications. Recent studies suggest that the endothelial
      function of the abdominal aorta might have a correlation with the disease development. A
      novel, easy to perform, non-invasive test can assess central artery endothelial function
      (i.e. the carotid artery reactivity (CAR)). The CAR test is based on the cold pressure test
      (CPT), which induces sympathetic stimulation by placing one hand in cold water. Using duplex
      ultrasound, central artery blood flow and diameter responses can be examined.

      Previous work has demonstrated that the CPT is associated with an increase in abdominal
      aortic diameter, whilst others found that the carotid and coronary artery diameter also shows
      dilation. Interestingly, a previous study found a strong correlation between carotid and
      coronary artery diameter responses to the CPT, whilst these artery responses show independent
      prognostic value for future cardiovascular events in patients with peripheral arterial
      disease. Possibly, similarity may be present in central artery reactivity to the CPT. To
      date, no study examined whether carotid and aorta responses are in agreement during the CPT.
      Given the potential importance of central artery vasoreactivity for AAA, the CAR-test may
      have potential in this group, especially given the relative simplicity of measuring the
      carotid artery.

      The aim of this explorative study is to investigate the correlation between the magnitude of
      the abdominal aorta and the carotid artery diameter and blood flow responses during the
      sympathetic stimulation (using the cold pressor test) between healthy young, healthy older
      and individuals with AAA.

      The present study is an explorative, observational study, which will include in total 60
      participants divided over 3 groups; healthy young adults, healthy older adults and patients
      with a stable abdominal aortic aneurysm (i.e. 30-50 mm), who are currently under threshold
      for repair. When participants meet the criteria, they will be informed about the study and
      they will be asked for their written informed consent, when they are willing to participate.
      Every participant only need to visit one time, which takes approximately 30 minutes.
      Participant characteristics will be registered, including traditional risk factors and CV
      history. Subsequently, the investigators will perform the CAR-test, which takes approximately
      15 minutes. Prior to the CAR-test, participants should follow some instructions with regard
      to food and fluid intake according to a physiological guideline, which can influence this
      test.

    <description>The CAR test will be applied to stimulate the sympathetic nervous system. This thermal stimulus is known to elevate blood pressure via sympathetic pathways, so it can be used to study the vascular response to sympathetic activation. The participant will submerge their left hand in a bucket of ice water (approximately 4 degrees celcius) for 3 minutes, which is reported to be sufficient to induce a maximal dilation in the common carotid artery. At baseline and every minute after the hand is submerged in ice water, the blood pressure will be measured to check whether a sympathetic stimulation is achieved. During this test as well the carotid artery as the abdominal aorta will be visualized using ultrasound.</description>
