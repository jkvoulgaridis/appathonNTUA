      This is a single arm, open-label, single center study to determine the safety and efficacy of
      CD19-CD22 CAR-T cells in patients with relapsed or refractory B-ALL. The study will have the
      following sequential phases: Screening, Pre-Treatment (Cell Product Preparation &amp;
      Lymphodepleting Chemotherapy), Treatment and Follow-up, and Survival Follow-up. The total
      duration of the study is 2 years from CD19-CD22 CAR-T cell infusion.
