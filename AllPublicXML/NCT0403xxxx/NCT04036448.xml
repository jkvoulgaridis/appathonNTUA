      The Drug Use Examination (DUE) is planned and designed for the safety evaluation of new
      indications after the approval of a new drug in Korea.

      This DUE is a non-interventional, observational and post-marketing surveillance, which will
      be conducted by collecting the safety information of REVLIMID® for new indications in routine
      clinical practice in Korea.

      Six-Hundred (600) adult patients, who start with REVLIMID® treatment based on the approved
      local package insert (PI) of REVLIMID® during routine clinical practice in Korea and have
      indications noted below.

        1. Patients with transfusion-dependent anemia due to IPSS low- or intermediate-1-risk
           Myelodysplastic Syndromes associated with a deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality (del
           [5q] MDS)

        2. Patients with mantle cell lymphoma who have received at least one prior therapy (rrMCL)
