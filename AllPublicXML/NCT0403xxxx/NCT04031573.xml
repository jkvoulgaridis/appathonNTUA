  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Septic shock is a major health problem, with several million cases annually worldwide and a
      mortality approaching 45%. Tachycardia is associated with excess mortality during septic
      shock. This pejorative effect could be related to the increase in cardiac metabolic demand,
      impaired cardiac diastolic function, and/or poorer tolerance of administered exogenous
      catecholamines. Recent studies suggest that controlling the heart rate with the use of beta
      blockers has beneficial effects on the morbidity and mortality of septic shock. However, the
      negative effects of beta-blockers on cardiac contractility and blood pressure complicate
      their use during septic shock, particularly because about one-half of patients exhibit a
      septic-associated systolic dysfunction, which often requires the use of inotropes.

      Ivabradine is a selective inhibitor of If channels in the sinoatrial node. It is a pure
      bradycardic agent with no deleterious effect on other aspects of cardiac function
      (contractility, conduction and repolarization) nor on blood pressure. Ivabradine can
      therefore alleviate sinus tachycardia without negative inotropic effects nor hypotension.
      Moreover, the improvement in diastolic function (ventricular filling) with ivabradine may
      increase stroke volume, even in case of severe impairment of systolic function. Controlling
      sinus tachycardia with ivabradine during septic shock would allow reducing cardiac metabolic
      demand (and potentially associated ischemic events) and improving the chronotropic tolerance
      of exogenous catecholamines. The effectiveness of ivabradine in controlling the heart rate
      was demonstrated in various clinical settings such as coronary artery disease, chronic heart
      failure and cardiogenic shock. Encouraging preliminary data are reported in critically ill
      patients.

    <intervention_model_description>Multi-centre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, multi-arm multi-stage trial. The trial investigates the efficacy and safety of 2 dosing regimens of ivabradine in order to confirm the efficacy and safety of one dosing regimen for heart rate control in adult patients with septic shock.Two dosing regimens of ivabradine will be investigated in the first part and the best-performing dosing regimen will be selected for the last part of the trial. A multi-arm multi-stage (MAMS) design with 2 stages and 3 arms will be used. The trial incorporates 2 stages: 1. Activity: an interim comparison of activity using the percentage of patients with heart rate control (80-94/min) at hour-48 as primary endpoint. At the end of this stage, an interim analysis will be used in order to select the most promising ivabradine dosing protocol and compare it to placebo in the subsequent stage (pick the winner strategy). 2. Efficacy: final comparison with 28 days mortality as the primary endpoint.</intervention_model_description>
