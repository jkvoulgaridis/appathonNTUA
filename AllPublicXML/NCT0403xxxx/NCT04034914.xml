    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well Yoga works in supporting children with cancer and their parents
      during chemotherapy infusion. Pediatric cancer and its treatment is one of life's most
      stressful events for children and their parents. Yoga is an ancient holistic healing science
      that incorporates postures, breathing, relaxation, and meditation to facilitate harmony
      between body, mind, and spirit. Participating in Yoga exercise may improve the negative
      psychosocial effects in children with cancer and their parents during chemotherapy treatment.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  To determine the feasibility of Yoga for children with cancer and their parents,
           specifically

        -  Identify possible required modifications for safe and feasible practice during
           infusions.

        -  Obtain recruitment estimates and determine barriers.

        -  Assess satisfaction.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  To determine the feasibility of administering and acceptability of measures to assess
           preliminary efficacy of Yoga for the following outcomes:

        -  Child psychological distress (stress, anxiety).

        -  Parent psychological distress (stress, anxiety, anger, depression).

        -  Child and parent physiological stress (heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood
           pressure).

        -  Parent-child communication.

        -  Child physical symptoms.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients and parents participate in up to 8 Yoga sessions consisting of check in, awareness,
      breathing practices, gentle movement, and relaxation over 30 minutes each.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Retention</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The number of the enrolled child-parent dyads who complete both the self-report assessments required at baseline (T1 - prior to first Yoga session), the Yoga protocol, and the measures at the end-of-infusion (T2 - prior to last Yoga session) will be tallied. The proportion completing will be used to inform the level of over-recruitment required in future studies of efficacy.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Barriers</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Participants who do not complete the study will be contacted and queried as to the reason for the lack of completion. A tally of the specific barriers will be maintained to determine if particular barriers are encountered more frequently than others. This information will inform possible modifications required to the protocol in future research.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Participant satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The total number of responses to the 14 satisfaction questions with a rating &gt; 4 (maximum rating = 7) will be generated for each of the 5 parent participants. It is expected that all participants will exceed that threshold for all questions. If not, frequency distributions will be used to summarize the responses to each of the 14 items to assess which produced the lower ratings. Responses to open-ended questions will be analyzed qualitatively. Findings from both components of the satisfaction survey (program satisfaction and yoga survey) will be used to revise the Yoga protocol as needed.</description>
