      The investigators aimed to retrospectively identify the association between the thermogenic
      capacity of white adipocytes and the environmental temperature, in cancer patients.

    <textblock>
      Obesity is characterized by excessive white adipose tissue (WAT) that increases risk for
      disease. About 700 million adults are obese worldwide, designating the need of reducing
      excessive WAT in humans and subsequently the risk for disease. For this reason, previous
      research focused on the thermogenic capacity of white adipocytes in response to cold
      exposure. Cold exposure represents a main stimulus for increased thermogenic capacity in
      human white adipocytes, which may have an impact on body weight loss and subsequently on
      obesity phenomenon.

      In a cohort of 202 cancer patients (male=126), who undertook a Positron Emission Tomography
      (PET/CT), we retrospectively investigated the association between Tenv and thermogenic
      capacity of subcutaneous WAT (dorsolumbar region near vertebrae L3 and abdominal region).
      These patients undertook a PET/CT examination in order to define their disease status. They
      were given instructions in advance to refrain from smoking, exercise and excessive muscle
      stressors 24-hour prior to their examination. On the day of the measurements they advised to
      transport themselves by car to the PET/CT Laboratory between 08:00 am to 12 pm, following at
      least a 6-hour fasting. Patients were first injected an appropriate dose of 18F-FDG (based on
      their body weight) and then they were remained in a sitting relaxed position within a quiet
      room of 22-24°C for 60 minutes. Following this period, patients undertook the PET/CT
      examination, which included on average eight bed positions, while four minutes scanning per
      bed position was used.

      PET/CT imaging analysis for WAT activity (dorsolumbar region near vertebrae L3 and abdominal
      region) was performed by two independent trained physicians, using previous methodology.
