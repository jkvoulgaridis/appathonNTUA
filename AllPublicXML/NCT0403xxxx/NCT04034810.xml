    <textblock>
      The FIRST study is an observational, prospective, multi-center, international, single-arm,
      study. The aim of the study is to collect safety and efficacy information on the use of the
      silk vista baby flow diverter in order to assess clinical safety and performance of the
      device for treating intracranial aneurysms.

      All patients with intracranial aneurysm ruptured or unruptured, whatever the localization of
      the aneurysm, and treated with silk vista baby, will be consecutively enrolled in the study.

      The patient's inclusion and follow up in the study will occur as part of their usual standard
      of care.

             (between the initial index procedure to the 12 months follow up visit)

          4. Patient â‰¥ 18 years, who signed an informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient presenting with contra-indications to the use of silk vista baby according to
