  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study looks into how the type 2 diabetes medicine, semaglutide, can prevent risk of
      heart disease complications and stroke. Participants will either get semaglutide or placebo
      (&quot;dummy&quot; medicine) - which treatment is decided by chance. Semaglutide is a new medicine to
      treat type 2 diabetes and can be prescribed by doctors in some countries. The study medicine
      will be in a pen, and must be injected with a needle in the stomach, thigh or upper arm once
      a week. The study will last for 57-63 weeks. Participants will have 10 clinic visits with the
      study doctor, 5 visits to the specialised clinic for imaging and at least 1 phone contact.
      Participants' health will be monitored carefully and blood samples will therefore be taken at
      the clinic visits. Women cannot take part if pregnant, breast-feeding or planning to become
      pregnant during the study period.
