  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Whole grains, non-starchy vegetables, fruit, and beans are a consistent feature of diets
      associated with a lower risk of cancer and other diet-related diseases. For cancer risk
      reduction, the American Cancer Society recommendation is to consume at least 2.5 cups of a
      variety of fruits and vegetables (FV) daily. Other than dietary choices, weight control and
      physical activity levels are important modifiable determinants of cancer risk. The proposed
      research will finalize a novel, theory-driven intervention developed in preliminary work to
      promote access to fresh, unprepared, locally grown FV and build knowledge and skills to
      increase purchases and consumption of these foods among low-income adults served by the
      Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). In New Jersey
      (the location of the study), WIC provides participants up to $30 in seasonal Farmers' Market
      Nutrition Program (FMNP) vouchers and monthly cash value vouchers or CVV (valued at $11 for
      adults and $8 for children) redeemable at farmers' markets. The intervention will be
      finalized based on lessons learned in preliminary work. The program combines
      behaviorally-focused nutrition education with the establishment of a WIC-based farmers'
      market (to be implemented in 2019 during the FMNP voucher issuance period [June 19 to August
      19]). Content to address other modifiable determinants of cancer risk will be added. To
      create additional opportunities for experiential and hands-on learning, monthly trips to an
      area farmers' market also are planned (between September 1, 2019 [after the WIC-based market
      is discontinued] and November 30, 2019 [the end of the local growing season]). The research
      will employ an experimental design to initially test the intervention in a sample of 244
      adults. Program effects on objective biomarkers of FV intake, FMNP voucher redemption, and
      the redemption of CVV at farmers' markets will be examined 3 and 6 months after intervention.
      Mediation of intervention effects by targeted secondary outcomes, participant satisfaction
      with the program, and the cost-effectiveness of the intervention also will be examined.

    <description>Assessed via a single item (the Social Support Rating Measure) querying how much others support the participant to consume vegetables (on a 7-point scale ranging from not at all to a lot). Scores can range from 1 to 7. Higher scores represent a better outcome (greater social support for vegetable consumption).</description>

    <description>Assessed with a validated measure (used to evaluate the Stellar Farmers' Market program [Dannefer et al., 2015]). Participants rate how much they agree or disagree with statements designed to measure the participant's confidence in his or her ability to prepare and consume fresh produce. Item ratings are on a 4-point scale ranging from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (4). Item ratings are summed to derive a total score. Scores can range from 5 to 20. Higher scores represent a better outcome (greater self-efficacy for vegetable consumption).</description>

    <measure>Change in whether participants are meeting current physical activity guidelines</measure>
    <time_frame>Pretest, posttest (3 months after the pretest), and follow-up (6 months after the pretest)</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed with a validated 2-item measure (the Brief Physical Activity Assessment Tool or BPATT [Marshall et al., 2005]). The instrument consists of two questions, one that assesses the frequency and duration of vigorous intensity physical activity and one that assesses the frequency and duration of moderate intensity physical activities undertaken in a usual week. A scoring algorithm is used to combine the results of the two questions to identify whether participants are meeting the current physical activity guidelines or not. Scores can range from 0 (not meeting guidelines) to 1 (meeting guidelines). Higher scores represent a better outcome (meeting current physical activity guidelines).</description>
