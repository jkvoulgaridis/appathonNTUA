      This study will investigate the behavior of preschool children who had undergone general
      surgery during early infancy and will correlate the behavioral outcomes with clinical
      perioperative variables.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several epidemiologic and observational studies found the relation between surgery in
      childhood and neurodevelopmental features in later life. However, these studies are
      criticized for retrospective design, non homogenous population, social confounders, diversity
      of surgical procedures and anesthetic management.

      Monitoring of neurological function has become standard during surgical procedures at risk
      for neuronal injury (e.g. cardiac surgery). There is also some data on possible predictive
      value of certain methods of neuromonitoring (such as cerebral near infrared spectroscopy
      (NIRS)) for neurodevelopmental outcome.

      General neonatal/infant surgery and the whole perioperative period carry the risk of
      significant physiologic disturbances, which may affect cerebral perfusion, oxygenation or
      metabolism. This study is the continuum of prospective observational trial, which
      investigated the value of the neuromonitoring measures in neonates and young infants
      undergoing general surgery. The present study will apply the behavioral assessment of these
      patients who are now between 2 and 5 years of age.

        Children, aged 1.5-5 years, who had undergone general abdominal, thoracic, genitourinary
        surgery until 93 days of life in a single University hospital and were given standard
        inhalational general anesthesia with tracheal intubation and measures for neuromonitoring
        such as cerebral NIRS and measurement of brain specific proteins during perioperative
        period was applied.
