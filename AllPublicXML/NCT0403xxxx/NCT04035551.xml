  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The HEALTH Registry is a prospective, observational, non-interventional registry study of
      patients receiving home parenteral nutrition therapy in the US for a variety of indications.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the HEALTH Patient Registry is to establish and track therapy utilization
      and outcomes of patients receiving home parenteral nutrition therapy. Data collected will
      include information on patient safety, clinical outcomes, resource utilization and
      health-related quality of life (QOL). The goals of this Registry include:

        -  To better understand the patients and populations requiring HPN in the U.S.

        -  To measure clinical outcomes associated with HPN

        -  To identify areas for focused quality improvement interventions

        -  To provide opportunity for resource allocation identification and improvement
