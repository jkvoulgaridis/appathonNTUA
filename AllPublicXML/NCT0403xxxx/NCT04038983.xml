      The study evaluates the performance criteria of abnormal PRISMA-7 score, length of stay in
      Emergency department and in hospital, and hospital admission in older Emergency department
      users.

      In Quebec, Canada, the &quot;Program of Research on Integration of services for the Maintenance of
      Autonomy&quot; (PRISMA-7) is the Ministry of Health and Social Services' reference tool for the
      frailty assessment of older Emergency department users. This tool has been initially
      developed and validated to assess disabilities in older community dwellers with the aim to
      quickly identify older individuals at risk for disabilities and who should undergo a
      comprehensive assessment. PRISMA-7 has a high sensitivity for identifying frailty in older
      community dwellers but its performance criteria for this goal has never been examined in
      older Emergency Department users. Recently, a systematic review underscored that PRISMA-7 has
      all characteristics for being a usable clinical tool in Emergency department because it is a
      brief (i.e., &lt;5 min), simple and multidimensionality assessment. PRISMA-7 is composed of 7
      questions assessing health and functionality of older adults and stratifies risk for
      disability in two levels: low versus high. PRISMA-7 is a prognostic tool for disabilities.

    <description>ER2 is a simple and standardized clinical tool composed of two sequential components: an assessment followed by recommendations for intervention. The assessment component of ER2 consists of 6 very simple closed-ended format questions (i.e., yes versus no) which are: Age category (≥ 85), male, polypharmacy (≥ 5 different medications per day), use of formal (health care or social professional) and/or informal (family and/or friend) home support, use of a walking aid regardless of its type, and temporal disorientation (inability to give the current month and/or year). A score of five points is assigned to the items &quot;use of walking aid&quot; and &quot;temporal disorientation&quot;, whereas, for the other items, the assigned score is one point. The weighting of points for ER2 items is based on the results of our previous studies (21-24). Scores range from 0 (lowest risk) to 14 (highest risk). ER2 scores stratify the risk for short-term ED adverse events into three levels: low, moderate and high.</description>

        There are two survey questionnaires that will be fill out by nurses when a patient who are
        75 years old and over arrives: Prisma-7 ( Program of Research on Integration of Services
        for the Maintenances of Autonomy) and ER2 ( Emergency Room Evaluation and Recommendation).
