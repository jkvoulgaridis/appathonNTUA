      The associations between dietary choline, genetics and anxiety/depression

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Choline, previously considered to be a vitamin, is an essential nutrient involved in a
      plethora of biological pathways. Choline status is thought to be associated with depression
      and anxiety, however, the lack of evidence regarding the exact mechanism of its action
      warrants further investigation. This study aims to explore the associations between dietary
      choline and depression and anxiety in healthy individuals and how these may differ according
      to genetics, specifically Phosphatidylethanolamine N-Methyltransferase gene involved in
      endogenous and exogenous choline metabolism. Establishing these associations could reinforce
      the need for future intervention trials that could in turn establish causality and determine
      the mechanistic effects of dietary choline and the PEMT gene activity on depression/anxiety

        To be able to detect an association between choline and depression/anxiety required number
        of participants is 40. However, to reach the adequate balance between groups of people that
        have the PEMT genetic variant and the ones that do not have it, 80 will be recruited. This
        is because the PEMT variant of interest is present in 50% of the population
