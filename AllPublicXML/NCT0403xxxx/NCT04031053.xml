  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Talaromycosis continues to be a common opportunistic fungal infection among people living
      with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) in Southeast Asia and remains a leading cause of death among this
      population. Itraconazole (ITZ) is an important component of talaromycosis treatment. In
      Thailand, the capsule formulation of ITZ is primarily used to treat talaromycosis but it is
      known to have lower bioavailability than the more expensive solution formulation. Limited
      data on the drug exposure of ITZ with the capsule formulation are available in adults PLWHA
      in Thailand. Moreover, the effect of efavirenz (EFV), which has been recommended as the first
      line antiretroviral therapy in Thailand, to ITZ level is not well understood. Thus, our aim
      is to assess ITZ pharmacokinetics with and without EFV in adult PLWHA receiving talaromycosis
      treatment with the capsule formulation. An understanding of the relationship between ITZ drug
      exposure and its active metabolite (hydroxyl-itraconazole) and treatment response is also
      planned to help optimize therapy.

    <description>After receiving the first dose of ITZ, a single blood sample will be collected 12-hours post-dose. On Day 7, the blood will be collected for intensive PK study. After 7 days of combined ITZ + EFV, a blood sample will be collected immediately (e.g. within 30 minutes) prior to administering the next ITZ dose. An identical set of intensive PK blood samples will be drawn 2 weeks after initiating the EFV based regimen.</description>
