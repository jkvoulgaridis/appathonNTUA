  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators' aim is to assess if they can complete a study measuring the effect of
      local anaesthetic gel (Instillagel) on reducing pain experienced by patients undergoing a
      common treatment for haemorrhoids (piles). This treatment is called rubber band ligation and
      is commonly performed in the investigators'clinics.

    <textblock>
      A feasibility trial assessing patient recruitment, retention, randomization, and surgeon
      acceptability of topical anaesthetic use during rubber band ligation of haemorrhoids.

      A patient and assessor blinded feasibility trial. The trial population will prospectively be
      recruited from colorectal surgery outpatients. Patients will be randomized to two groups to
      receive: lubricating gel (K-Y Jelly) and topical anaesthetic gel (Instillagel) or lubricating
      gel alone (the standard care).

      The intervention group will receive lubricating gel and topical anaesthetic gel (containing
      lidocaine active ingredient) administered rectally, whilst the control group will receive
      lubricating gel alone (standard care). This will be carried out in Colorectal Outpatients.
      The band ligation of the haemorrhoids should occur between 5-10 minutes after administration
      of the topical anaesthetic/lubricating gel. Pain scores and the use of oral analgesia will be
      measured immediately after the procedure (5 minutes), upon leaving the clinic (approximately
      30 minutes after), at 4 hours, and 72 hours following the procedure. Vasovagal symptoms or
      other complications will be recorded whilst the patient is in the clinic. At 1 month post
      procedure, patients will be phoned to determine if any adverse events have occurred.

    <intervention_model_description>The trial will be a randomised control trial blinded to patient and assessor (the clinician collecting data at 4 hours, 72 hours and 1 month after the procedure. Randomisation will be achieved by a computer software. Administrators will be aware of which group the patient being treated is in. Half of the patients (n=30) will receive the intervention treatment (Instillagel topical anaesthetic) and lubricating gel (standard of care), the other half will receive the standard of care alone (lubricating gel) (n=30) before the procedure. The standard of care is to use no form of analgesia, with K-Y gel only being used as a lubricant. Researchers will be asked to apply the allocated treatment 5-10 minutes before the procedure. The primary end points will be: patient recruitment rate, patient acceptability, surgeon acceptability, patient retention. The secondary endpoints will be: pain scores using the 10-point visual analogue scale.</intervention_model_description>
