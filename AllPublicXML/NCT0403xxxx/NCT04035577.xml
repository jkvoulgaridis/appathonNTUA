    <textblock>
      This study is an 8-week usability and feasibility trial of the smartphone student
      stress-management app IntelliCare for college students. This intervention will be tested with
      University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) and Northern Illinois University (NIU) students.
      During this period, research surveys assessing depression and anxiety can be completed on the
      app. Also, user feedback interviews will be conducted viatelephone at four weeks and at eight
      weeks to gain insight on the user experience of IntelliCare for College Students.

      In this study, students will be recruited for an 8-week trial in which they will be given the
      IntelliCare Hub app and encouraged to use it daily. To ensure a sample representative of
      likely end users, 10 students from each site will be recruited: 5 with elevated distress as
      measured by scores &gt; 10 on either the PHQ-9 or GAD-7 and 5 without elevated scores on either
      measure, for a total of 20 participants. The rationale for 10 participants in each group is
      based on past usability research indicating saturation is typically reached within 10
      participants. This trial aims to identify software bugs and usability problems that emerge
      over extended use and to examine preliminary effects of program use. During the trial,
      participants will be prompted to complete the PHQ-8 and GAD-7 every week. At baseline, 4
      weeks, and 8 weeks, participants will be prompted within the app to complete the Depression
      Literacy Questionnaire and Anxiety Literacy Questionnaire to measure mental health literacy,
      the Knowledge and Beliefs about Services scale to measure knowledge of campus mental health
      services, the Barriers to Mental Health Help-Seeking questionnaire to measure treatment
      barriers, and the Cognitive and Behavioral Response to Stress Scale to measure cognitive and
      behavioral coping skills. At 4 and 8 weeks participants will be asked to participate in a
      user-feedback interview via the telephone. This is to gain insight on the user's experience
      with the app.

    <measure>Patient Health Questionnaire - 9 (PHQ-9) - Depression Severity Module</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The PHQ-9 measures degree of depression severity. Possible range of scores for the PHQ-9 is 0-27. Higher values represent a worse outcome.
Specifically, scores of 0-4 indicate minimal or no depression; 5-9 is mild; 10-14 is moderate; 15-19 is moderately severe; and 20-27 is severe.</description>

    <measure>GAD-7 (Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The GAD-7 is a self-administered 7 item instrument that uses some of the DSM-V criteria for GAD (General Anxiety Disorder) to identify probable cases of GAD along with measuring anxiety symptom severity. GAD-7 total score for the seven items ranges from 0 to 21. Higher values represent a worse outcome. Specifically, scores of 1-4 indicate minimal anxiety symptoms; 5-9 is mild anxiety symptoms; 10-14 is moderate anxiety symptoms; and 15-21 is severe anxiety symptoms.</description>

    <description>During the trial, participants will use Intellicare apps for up to 8 weeks and will be invited to provide feedback about their experience at two follow-up time points: weeks 4 and 8. All participants will first undergo initial assessments that will include a series of online questionnaires about their mood. Eligible participants will receive up to 8 weeks of access to the IntelliCare system, which consists of apps with a variety of resources, including lessons and tools designed to teach skills for mood management. It is suggested that participants utilize the mobile phone tools every day</description>
