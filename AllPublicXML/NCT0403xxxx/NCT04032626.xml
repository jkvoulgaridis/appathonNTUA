  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Accumulating evidence indicates that inflammation is prominent both in the blood and central
      nervous system (CNS) of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. These data suggest that systemic
      inflammation plays a crucial role in the cause and effects of AD neuropathology. Capitalizing
      on the experience from a previous clinical trial with thalidomide, here, the investigators
      hypothesize that modulating both systemic and CNS inflammation via the pleiotropic
      immunomodulator lenalidomide is a putative therapeutic intervention for AD if administered at
      a proper time window during the course of the disease.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are currently no approved treatments to treat the neuroinflammatory aspects of AD.
      While inflammation is pervasive to many neurological disorders, no clinical trial has yet
      demonstrated the efficacy of anti-inflammatory agents for AD. Interestingly, chronic
      peripheral low-grade inflammation is associated with aging and increases the risk for disease
      and mortality, including AD. Accumulating evidence indicates that nuclear factor-kappa B,
      tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), interleukins (e.g. IL-1beta, IL-2, and IL-6), and
      chemokines (e.g. IL-8) are found elevated both in the blood and central nervous system (CNS)
      of AD patients. These data confirm that inflammation plays a central role in the cause and
      effect of AD neuropathology.

      The immunomodulator, anti-cancer agent lenalidomide is one of the very few pleiotropic agents
      that both lowers the expression of TNFα, IL-6, IL-8, and increases the expression of
      anti-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-10), to modulate both innate and adaptive immune
      responses.

      In the current project the investigators aim to test the central hypothesis that lenalidomide
      reduces inflammatory and AD-associated pathological biomarkers, and improves cognition. For
      this, the investigators designed an 18-month, Phase II, double-blind, randomized, two-armed,
      parallel group, placebo controlled, and proof-of-mechanism clinical study in early
      symptomatic AD subjects (i.e. amnestic mild cognitive impairment; aMCI). The effects of
      lenalidomide treatment will be assessed after 12 months of treatment and 6 months washout
      (month 18).

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  In order to be eligible for this study, subjects must meet the following inclusion
             criteria:

               1. Male or female outpatients.

               2. At least 50 years of age, but less than 90 (89 at time of screening).

               3. Females must be surgically sterile (bilateral tubal ligation, oophorectomy, or
                  hysterectomy) or postmenopausal for 2 years (no women at risk of pregnancy will
                  be accepted in this study).

               4. Must have been diagnosed with amnestic MCI based on the most recent NIA-AA
                  criteria (Albert et al., 2011), i.e. at both the screening and baseline visits
                  (visits 1 and 2) have a documented Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE) score between
                  22-28.

               5. CT or MRI scan of the brain obtained during the course of the dementia must be
                  consistent with the diagnosis and show no evidence of significant focal lesions
                  or of pathology which could contribute to dementia. If neither a CT nor an MRI
                  scan is available from the past 12 months, a CT scan fulfilling the requirements
                  must be obtained before randomization.

               6. Vision and hearing must be sufficient to comply with study procedures.

               7. Be able to take oral medications.

               8. Hachinski ischemic score must be ≤ 4.

               9. Geriatric depression scale must be ≤ 10.

              10. Can be on stable doses of a cholinesterase inhibitor and/or memantine as long as
                  it is stable for at least 90 days before screening and is expected to remain on a
                  stable dose for the remainder of the study period; or have demonstrated
                  intolerance to or lack of efficacy from these medications.

              11. Must have a collateral informant/study partner who has significant direct contact
                  with the patient at least 10 hours per week and who is willing to accompany the
                  patient to all clinic visits and to be present during all telephone
                  visits/interviews.

              12. If the patient has a legally authorized representative (LAR), the LAR must review
                  and sign the informed consent form. If the patient does not have an LAR, the
                  patient must appear able to provide informed consent and must review and sign the
                  informed consent form. In addition, the patient's informant/study partner (as
                  defined above) must sign the informed consent form. If the LAR and the patient's
                  informant /study partner is the same individual, he/she should sign under both
                  designations.
