    <textblock>
      Multicenter US registry study to assess procedure success and long-term (10-year) performance
      of the HAART 200 and HAART 300 Aortic Annuloplasty Devices when used during aortic valve
      repair in a routine cardiovascular practice setting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The HAART Aortic Annuloplasty Devices are three-dimensional annuloplasty rings designed to be
      implanted intra-annularly in the aortic valve to correct annular dilatation and/or maintain
      annular geometry of the aortic valve in patients with trileaflet valve morphology (HAART 300)
      or bicuspid valve morphology (HAART 200) with moderate to severe aortic insufficiency who are
      undergoing aortic valve repair due to symptoms or as part of a repair for an aortic aneurysm.

      The study is a multicenter registry study enrolling both retrospective and prospective
      participants. Investigators are cardiothoracic surgeons specializing in surgery of the aortic
      valve and aorta at facilities with suitable infrastructure to support collection of the
      registry study data. Patients who underwent or will undergo aortic valve repair using either
      the HAART 300 or HAART 200 Device will be enrolled. All patients known to have received the
      HAART 300 or HAART 200 Device at participating centers will be contacted and offered the
      opportunity to enroll in this registry study. Prospective participants will have evaluations
      prior to surgery, intraoperatively, immediately following surgery, at discharge (or within 90
      days), and at 1, 3, 5, and 10 years. In addition to the follow-up clinic visits, phone
      contacts are scheduled at years 2,4,6, 7, 8, and 9 to maintain participant engagement as well
      as to ascertain if any safety events have taken place. Retrospective participants who have
      already received the HAART 300 or HAART 200 Device prior to study enrollment will undergo
      safety assessment at the time of enrollment in the study.

    <description>New York Hospital Association (NYHA) class:
Class I: cardiac disease but without resulting limitation of physical activity. Ordinary physical activity does not cause undue fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea, or anginal pain.
Class II: cardiac disease resulting in slight limitation of physical activity. Comfortable at rest. Ordinary physical activity results in fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea, or anginal pain.
Class III: cardiac disease resulting in marked limitation of physical activity. Comfortable at rest. Less than ordinary activity causes fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea, or anginal pain.
Class IV: cardiac disease resulting in inability to carry on any physical activity without discomfort. Symptoms of heart failure or the anginal syndrome may be present even at rest. If any physical activity is undertaken, discomfort is increased.</description>

    <description>The severity of aortic valve regurgitation expressed as the aortic regurgitation (AR) Grade (or Aortic insufficiency (AI) Grade). The grades are defined by the American Society of Echocardiography guidelines based on regurgitant volume (RVol), regurgitant fraction (RF), and effective regurgitant orifice area (EROA), and expressed as:
0 (None/trace)
I (Mild: RVol &lt;30 mL, RF &lt;30%, EROA &lt;0.1 cm**2)
II (Mild-Moderate: RVol 30-44 mL, RF 30-39%, EROA 0.1-0.19 cm**2)
III (Moderate-Severe: RVol 45-59 mL, RF 40-49%, EROA 0.20.29 cm**2)
