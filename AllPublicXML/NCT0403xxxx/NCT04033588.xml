  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, multi-centre, non-comparative, post-market clinical follow-up study to
      evaluate the survivorship, safety and performance of the Freedom® Total Knee System in the
      treatment of approximately 450 subjects who in the surgeon's opinion require a primary total
      knee replacement due to severe knee joint pain and loss of mobility due to osteoarthritis,
      rheumatoid arthritis or post-traumatic arthritis at upto 15 centers in the United Kingdom
      (UK). The primary objective of this study is to obtain implant survivorship and clinical
      outcomes data for commercially available Freedom® Total Knee System used in total knee
      replacement. Subjects must meet all the study inclusion / exclusion criteria before enrolment
      in the study. Subjects will be requested to attend out-patients clinic for clinical follow-up
      (CFU) or approached for telephonic follow-up (TFU) post-operatively as mentioned below.

      Clinical &amp; Telephonic Follow-up details:

        -  6-8 weeks ± 1week (Clinical follow-up)

        -  1 year ± 1 month (Clinical follow-up)

        -  3 years ± 6 months (Clinical follow-up)

        -  5 years ± 6 month (Clinical follow-up (optional) / Telephonic follow-up)

        -  10 years± 6 month (Clinical follow-up (optional) / Telephonic follow-up)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At all the clinical/telephonic follow-up visits i.e. at 8 weeks ± 1week, 1 year ± 1 month, 3
      years ± 6 months, 5 years ± 6 months and 10 years ± 6 months implant survivorship and vital
      signs such as weight, heart rate etc including blood pressure will be recorded. Physical
      examination, lab measurements (optional), Radiographic assessment, concomitant
      medication/surgery and AE/SAE should be recorded. Also at all clinical follow ups OKS, KSS,
      range of motion will be recorded. The post-operative radiographic evaluations will be
      conducted at 0-8 weeks ± 1 week (which is considered as standard of care), 1 year ± 1 month,
      3 years ± 6 months and optionally at 5 years ± 6 months, 10 years ± 6 months and Unscheduled
      visits, if required. The unscheduled visit is expected in some patients based on the fact
      that such patients might prone to complications like surgical site infections, venous
      thrombotic events, acute blood loss causing anaemia, nerve injury, and pain unresponsive to
      oral analgesics.

    <measure>Oxford Knee Score which consists of 12 questions</measure>
    <time_frame>At 1 year and 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Oxford Knee Score is a patient-reported validated outcome measure scoring from 0 - 48. It consists of 12 questions related to patient's own perception of pain and function in the knee being evaluated. Higher the score better the functioning of the knee.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Range of Motion using a standard goniometer</measure>
    <time_frame>At 1 year and 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Range of motion will be assessed using a standard goniometer. It will measure the angle between maximum extension and maximum flexion that a patient can achieve in the operated knee.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Knee Society Score</measure>
    <time_frame>At 1 year and 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>This score consists of points given for pain, range of motion, and stability. It Consists of points given for the ability to walk on level surfaces, and the ability to ascend and descend stairs.Score range of the KSS is from 0 to 100 points for each portion, with higher scores indicating better outcome</description>
