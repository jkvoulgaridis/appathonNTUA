  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Part I of this study is designed to identify the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of the
      combination regimen of LY3200882/capecitabine as second line treatment in patients with 5-FU
      or capecitabine resistant CRC. Part II is designed to obtain proof of principle of the
      LY3200882 plus capecitabine combination in patients with chemo-resistant CRC. The combination
      of LY3200882 plus capecitabine will be given as second line therapy in the phase II part of
      this study.

      Patients with chemotherapy resistant activated TGF-β signature-like tumors will have received
      a fluoropyrimidine (5FU or capecitabine) in the first line of chemotherapy, usually combined
      with oxaliplatin and, depending upon local hospital preferences or national guidelines, also
      bevacizumab, or cetuximab/panitumumab if the tumor is KRAS wild type. Addition of LY3200882
      to capecitabine should thus result in reversal of unresponsiveness, which is the first step
      in exploring this concept in the clinic. Capecitabine can be used as single agent in advanced
      CRC and is thus attractive for this study concept. If proof of principle is achieved also
      other tumor types can be explored with this genetic makeup, such as non-small cell lung
      cancer (NSCLC) in second line of treatment after platinum doublet therapy in first line,
      usually cisplatin/carboplatin-pemetrexed in non-squamous and
      cisplatin/carboplatin-gemcitabine or cisplatin/carboplatin-paclitaxel in squamous type NSCLC.
