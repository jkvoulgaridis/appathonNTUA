  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mouthrinses have been in used for centuries as breath fresheners, medicaments, and
      antiseptics. Recently, propolis has caught the eyes of dentists worldwide and researches are
      being carried out to infuse the usage of propolis in the dental health care treatments. There
      is belief that propolis may have a role as a tooth decay prophylaxis and help heal oral
      ulcers. Propolis is used as mouthwash, toothpaste, oral gel, and throat lozenges because of
      its proclaimed antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. Propolis has shown activity
      against common periodontal microorganisms, such as Candida species and the Streptococci
      mutans in vitro studies. Till date, no study has evaluated the clinical and microbiological
      effects of Malaysian Propolis as a mouthwash. Thus, the present study is designed to evaluate
      the effectiveness of Propolis as a mouthwash in the reduction of Plaque and gingivitis.The
      aim of the study is to assess and compare the effectiveness of Propolis mouthrinse with
      Chlorhexidine mouthrinse.

      The Randomized Controlled Clinical study with latin-square cross-over design would be used to
      assess and compare the effectiveness of Propolis and Chlorhexidine mouthrinse on gingivitis.
      Subjects with chronic generalized gingivitis with age group of 18-30 years will be selected
      for the study as the target population. Subjects who meet the inclusion and exclusion
      criteria will be selected and screened for the plaque and gingival status before including
      them in the study. They will be randomly divided into three groups.

      Group 1: 15 subjects (Placebo mouthwash) Group 2: 15 subjects (Propolis mouthwash) Group 3:
      15 subjects (Chlorhexidine mouthwash)

    <description>The primary outcome variable was the differences for the mean gingival score from baseline to 21 days.
The gingival index ranges from 0-3 which is a continuous scale. '0' indicates normal healthy gingiva without inflammation (better score) ; and score '3' indicates severe gingival inflammation (worst score).
The index teeth of each participant were examined and gingival status is scored. The score for each subject is added and divided by the total number of teeth examined.
The average/mean gingival score obtained from each subject is added for all the subjects and divided by the total number of participants. Higher score indicates worst score.</description>

    <description>The primary outcome variable was the differences for the mean plaque score from baseline to 21 days.
The plaque index ranges from 0-3 which is a continuous scale. '0' indicates no plaque on teeth (better score) ; and score '3' indicates abundance of plaque on the teeth (worst score).
The index teeth of each participant were examined and plaque score is recorded. The score for each subject is added and divided by the total number of teeth examined.
The average/mean plaque score obtained from each subject is added for all the subjects and divided by the total number of participants. Higher score indicates worst score.</description>
