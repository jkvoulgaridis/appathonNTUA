    <textblock>
      The Fr1da study aims to assess whether early staging of type 1 diabetes (1) is feasible at a
      population-based level, (2) prevents severe metabolic decompensation observed at the clinical
      manifestation of type 1 diabetes and (3) reduces psychological distress through preventive
      teaching and care.

      Type 1 diabetes can be diagnosed at an early presymptomatic stage by the detection of islet
      autoantibodies. Within the Fr1da-study, 100 000 children aged 1.75-5.99 years are tested for
      the presence of multiple islet autoantibodies. Screening is performed by primary care
      paediatricians. Islet autoantibodies are measured in capillary blood, and if positive,
      confirmed by venous blood in a second follow-up blood sample. Children with confirmed
      multiple islet autoantibodies are diagnosed with presymptomatic type 1 diabetes. These
      children and their parents are invited to participate in an education and counselling
      programme at a local diabetes centre. Depression and anxiety, and burden of early diagnosis
      are also assessed. The Fr1da-Plus-Study starts in 2019, after the enrollment of 100000
      children into Fr1da, and extends screening to ages 9.0-10.99 years, and follows children with
      single islet autoantibodies for up to 3 years for progression to multiple islet autoantibody
      positivity.

      The aims of the Fr1da- and Fr1da-Plus studies are:

        -  to prevent life-threatening diabetic ketoacidosis at clinical onset of diabetes

        -  to minimize psychological burden and uncertainty by training and intensive support of
           affected subjects

        -  to evaluate feasibility of a comprehensive screening

        -  to examine the prevalence of a pre-stage of Type 1 Diabetes

        -  to assess geographic differences and association with environmental conditions for
           development of Type 1 Diabetes

      The predefined criteria for the feasibility and clinical benefit of the study are &gt;80%
      participation in the education and staging program, a diabetic ketoacidosis frequency of &lt;5%
      in children with stage 3 diabetes, and &lt;10% of parents with a Patient Health Questionnaire-9
      (PHQ-9) sum score &gt;15.
