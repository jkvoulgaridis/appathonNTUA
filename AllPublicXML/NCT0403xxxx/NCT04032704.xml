  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial will study ladiratuzumab vedotin (LV) to find out if it works to treat different
      types of solid tumors. It will also find out what side effects may occur. A side effect is
      anything the drug does besides treating cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial is designed to assess the antitumor activity, safety, and tolerability of LV for
      the treatment of solid tumors. Participants with the following advanced solid tumors will be
      enrolled:

      Cohort 1: small cell lung cancer (SCLC) Cohort 2: non-small cell lung cancer-squamous
      (NSCLC-squamous) Cohort 3: non-small cell lung cancer-nonsquamous (NSCLC-nonsquamous) Cohort
      4: head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) Cohort 5: esophageal squamous cell carcinoma
      (esophageal-squamous) Cohort 6: gastric and gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma

      Participants will continue to receive study treatment until disease progression, unacceptable
      toxicity, investigator decision, consent withdrawal, study termination by the sponsor,
      pregnancy, or death, whichever comes first.
