  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is looking to assess the use of an audio-video technology called 'LIFEView' using
      a laptop and large-screen TV. This tool intends to support life review or reminiscence of
      past experiences, escape from current surroundings using virtual travel, or virtual visits to
      a location that one might have liked to visit in their lifetime but could not. We hope that
      by using this technology, we can support better wellbeing and quality of life for patients
      receiving palliative care services within the community and on an inpatient palliative care
      unit, or for patients at the end-of-life within Bruyère long-term care homes.

      Due to the potential for disorientation and reduced physical mobility, patients receiving
      palliative and end-of-life care may be unable to fully enjoy an immersive experience using a
      virtual reality (VR) headset. To reduce the possibility of disorientation that may arise from
      using a VR headset with 'LIFEView', our research team will use the 'LIFEView' prototype
      software loaded on a laptop and connected to a mobile high-definition 50&quot; TV for inpatient
      PCU and LTC facility use, or to a patient's personal TV within their residence in the
      community. This setup will also improve accessibility to 'LIFEView' as a result of its
      relatively low-tech requirements (i.e. TV + laptop), and allows for an opportunity for
      patients and their loved ones to share cherished memories and stories.

      This project is designed to address the psychosocial and existential suffering commonly
      experienced by palliative care patients. Technology-based reminiscence and dignity therapy
      interventions have been demonstrated to improve well-being and quality of life in older
      adults (Lazar et al, 2014), although little evidence exists to support the use of these
      technology-based interventions in a palliative care context.

      These technologies may require modification to meet the needs of PEOLC patients that are at
      risk for delirium, a neuropsychiatric condition characterized by fluctuating disruptions in
      awareness, focus and cognition (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Delirium can be
      experienced by up to 88% of patients at the end of life (Hosie et al., 2013). Moreover,
      patients in PEOLC settings may also have limited mobility or may be bedbound. Due to the
      potential for disorientation and reduced physical mobility, patients receiving PEOLC may be
      unable to fully enjoy an immersive experience using a virtual reality (VR) headset. To reduce
      the possibility of disorientation that may arise from using a VR headset with 'LIFEView', our
      research team plans to use the 'LIFEView' prototype software loaded on a laptop and connected
      to a mobile high-definition 40-42&quot; TV for inpatient PCU and LTC facility use, or to a
      patient's personal TV within their residence in the community.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in psychological and physical symptoms measured by the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System-revised (ESAS-r) (Bruera et al., 1991; Watanabe et al., 2011)</measure>
    <time_frame>At least 24 hours before using 'LIFEView', and directly after and 48 hours after using 'LIFEView' (pre- and post-'LIFEView')</time_frame>
    <description>The ESAS-r is a 9-item symptom assessment tool that assesses pain, tiredness, drowsiness, nausea, lack of appetite, shortness of breath, depression, anxiety, and feeling of wellbeing. Each item is rated by patients on a 0-10 scale (0= best possible, 10= worst possible).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in quality of life measured by the McGill Quality of Life-Revised questionnaire (Cohen et al., 2017)</measure>
    <time_frame>At least 24 hours before using 'LIFEView', and 48 hours after using 'LIFEView' (pre- and post-'LIFEView')</time_frame>
    <description>The MQOL-R will be used to assess patient quality of life. There are 4 parts to the questionnaire on overall quality of life, physical symptoms, feelings and thoughts, and social aspects of the participant's life. Each statement is rated on a 0-10 scale (0= worst possible,10= best possible).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>Psychosocial effects and aspects of quality of life as determined by semi-structured interviews for consenting participants and their consenting family member(s) or caregiver(s).</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 24 hours of using 'LIFEView' (post-'LIFEView')</time_frame>
    <description>These interviews will explore the impact of the 'LIFEView' intervention on patient quality of life, patient-family and patient-caregiver interactions, perceptions of the 'LIFEView' intervention as a tool to improve well-being and quality of life in palliative care settings, and feasibility of using volunteer services to support the long-term sustainability of this intervention across care settings.</description>

    <measure>Change in heart rate</measure>
    <time_frame>At least 24 hours before using 'LIFEView', and directly after using 'LIFEView' (pre- and post-'LIFEView')</time_frame>
    <description>Heart rate (beats per minute; bpm) will be measured using a wireless cuff.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in blood pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>At least 24 hours before using 'LIFEView', and directly after using 'LIFEView' (pre- and post-'LIFEView')</time_frame>
    <description>Blood pressure (mm Hg) will be measured using a wireless cuff.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Aspects of participant's level of general well-being as per the Greater Cincinnati Chapter Well-Being Observation tool (Rentz, 2002; Kinney &amp; Rentz, 2005) during the 'LIFEView' session, and other observable phenomena</measure>
    <time_frame>From initiation of the 'LIFEView' session and directly after using 'LIFEView' (during and post-'LIFEView')</time_frame>
    <description>The Greater Cincinnati Chapter Well-Being Observation tool will be used by the research team members to assess each patient's state of general well-being. There are 6 domains, for which each statement is rated on a 0-4 scale (0= never, 1= rarely, 2= some of the time, 3= most of the time, 4= always).
Observational field notes will be taken by the Research Coordinator during the course of study participation on observable phenomena before, during, and after the 'LIFEView' session (e.g. verbalized reminiscence, feelings… etc.). Patients and their family members will only be identified by their participant study ID in field notes.</description>

    <description>The 'LIFEView' session(s) involves the use of audiovisual software by Motitech AS (technology provided by and used with permission from Motitech AS). For its primary uses as Motiview, the audiovisual software was coupled to a mobile user-adapted cycle-trainer. Since a secondary benefit of the virtual cycle trip may include reminiscence which may in-turn facilitate conversation of past experiences, the audiovisual software is being adapted for use in reminiscence therapy for a palliative care population.
As there is an extensive library available to participants and 'LIFEView' sessions could potentially be longer than feasible for research personnel to conduct, each 'LIFEView' session will be limited to up to 3 videos per session or up to 1 hour of videos per session, whichever is a shorter duration. Additional post-study 'LIFEView' sessions can be provided upon request from participants.</description>
