  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inhibitors of sodium-dependent glucose-transporter 2 (including dapagliflozin) represent
      intensively investigated drugs in the field of diabetes. SGLT-2 inhibition limits glucose
      reabsorption in renal tubular cells, hereby increasing the amount of glucose excreted via
      urine in the hyperglycemic state. Its mechanisms of action are independent of insulin, the
      indispensable standard of care in Type 1 Diabetes (T1D). Several international diabetes
      experts highlighted the need for adjunct therapies in T1D.

      Subcutaneous application of insulin is non-physiological. Most significant, subcutaneous
      insulin substitution does not address the bi-hormonal character of T1D. The loss of
      pancreatic beta cells and subsequent endogenous insulin production uncouples alpha cell
      derived glucagon secretion from its paracrine suppressor. Consequently, excess glucagon
      concentrations occur in the fasting and the postprandial state, which promotes hyperglycemia,
      requires higher doses of subcutaneous insulin, and promotes glycaemic variability.

      Recent studies on SGLT-2 inhibition in T1D showed better glycemic control compared to
      placebo, whereas a higher risk for the development of diabetic ketoacidosis was observed.
      Knowledge about the underlying mechanisms is scarce. Studies showed that SGLT-inhibition
      increased Glucagon-like-peptide 1 (GLP-1) in T1D, an incretin hormone capable of suppressing
      glucagon. On the other side, total concentrations of ketone bodies were higher following
      SGLT-2 inhibition, irrespective of ongoing subcutaneous or intravenous insulin substitution.
      The present study aims to investigate the effect of SGLT-2 inhibitor dapagliflozin on
      hormonal regulators of glucose homeostasis and ketogenesis in T1D. The primary endpoint is
      the difference of GLP-1 during oral glucose tolerance test clamps (OGGTc). Secondary
      endpoints comprise total ketone body concentrations, free fatty acids, glucagon, and
      somatostatin during OGTTc and hyperinsulinemic, euglycemic clamps (HEC) following
      dapagliflozin and placebo. The study recruits male and female patients with T1DM in a
      randomized, open label, cross-over intervention study.
