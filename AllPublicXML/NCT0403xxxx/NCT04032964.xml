      Open-label, phase 1 dose confirmation study in patients with advanced, unresectable and/or
      metastatic soft tissue sarcoma.

      Six (6) Patients will be enrolled sequentially and will be treated according to the following
      scheme:

      • Doxorubicin 75 mg/m2 i.v. on day 1 of each 21-day cycle L19TNF 13 µg/kg i.v. on day 1,3 and
      5 of each 21-day cycle Initiation of the study treatment for an individual subject will occur
      no less than 3 days after initiation of the study treatment for the previous patient. Not
      more than 2 patients are to be treated simultaneously in Cycle 1.

      Should unacceptable toxicities occur in ≥ 2 patients during the observation period from Day 1
      to Day 21 (first cycle), enrollment will be stopped.

      If a patient is not evaluable for unacceptable toxicity, he/she will be replaced.

      Patients will be treated in repeated cycles until the treatment or when one of the following
      criteria are met:

        -  Unacceptable toxicity

        -  Disease Progression or relapse

        -  The patient or the investigator requests the treatment discontinuation

        -  The patient meets a withdrawal criterion. Patients with SD or PR (according to Response
           Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v.1.1 evaluation) after the maximum of 6
           cycles of study treatment, will receive maintenance therapy for up to 18 maintenance
           cycles from start of treatment, toxicity or until disease progression occurs.
           Maintenance can start immediately after the end of cycle 6 and consists infusions of
           L19TNF on Day 1 of each maintenance cycle (every 3 weeks) and doxorubicin on Day 1 of
           maintenance cycle 1 and 2 (if appropriate).

      The primary objective is to evaluate the safety of L19TNF in combination with doxorubicin and
      to establish a recommended dose (RD), assessed as follows:

        -  Adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAE) and drug induced liver injury (DILI)
           assessment based on Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v.5.0

        -  Standard laboratory (hematology, biochemistry and urinalysis) parameters.

        -  Electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiogram (ECHO) findings. In particular, data about
           QT/QTc intervals will be collected and analyzed for QT/QTc prolongation potentially
           caused by treatment.

        -  Physical examination findings including assessment of vital signs and physical
           measurements.

      The secondary objective of the study is to evaluate signs of efficacy measured as
      progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 3, 6, 9, 12 and 18 months.

      The other secondary objectives of the study are as follows:

        -  Efficacy of L19TNF in combination with doxorubicin:

        -  Overall response rate (ORR, consisting of CR and PR).

        -  Disease Control Rate (DCR, i.e. complete response (CR), partial response (PR) and stable
           disease (SD))

        -  Assessment of the formation of human anti-fusion protein antibodies (HAFA) against
           L19TNF.

        -  Characterization of pharmacokinetics (PK) of L19TNF and doxorubicin

             documenting previous exposure to HBV (i.e., anti-HBs Ab with no history of vaccination
             and/or anti-HBc Ab), negative serum HBV-DNA is required. For HCV: HCV-RNA or HCV
             antibody test. Subjects with a positive test for HCV antibody but no detection of
             HCV-RNA indicating no current infection are eligible.

          7. Female patients: negative serum pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential
             (WOCBP)* within 14 days of starting treatment. WOCBP must agree to use, from the
             screening to six months following the last study drug administration, highly effective
             contraception methods, as defined by the &quot;Recommendations for contraception and
             pregnancy testing in clinical trials&quot; issued by the Head of Medicine Agencies'
             Clinical Trial Facilitation Group (www.hma.eu/ctfg.html) and which include, for
             instance, progesterone-only or combined (estrogen- and progesterone-containing)
             hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation, intrauterine devices,
             intrauterine hormone-releasing systems, bilateral tubal occlusion, vasectomized
             partner or sexual abstinence. Male patients: Male subjects able to father children

                  menarche, are not postmenopausal (12 months with no menses without an alternative
                  medical cause) and are not permanently sterilized (e.g. tubal occlusion,
                  hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy or bilateral salpingectomy)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of GIST or Kaposi sarcoma.

          2. Prior therapy (except surgery and radiation) for this presentation of unresectable or

             as clinically significant by the investigator. Subjects with current, or a history of
             QT/QTc prolongation would be excluded. In particular:

               -  patients with a marked prolongation of QT/QTc interval (e.g., repeated
