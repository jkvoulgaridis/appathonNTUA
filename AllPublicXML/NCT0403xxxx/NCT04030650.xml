  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with lower limb amputations are equipped with prostheses that can be mechanical
      and/or electronic. These prostheses can be mono-articular (only the ankle) or bi-articular
      (knee and ankle for example). For amputee patients, situations that may seem trivial, such as
      climbing and descending stairs, become complex. Thus during the descent of stairs, an
      unamputated person will slow down the descent by contracting the thigh muscles, which are
      obviously lacking in the amputee patient. Current prostheses, known as &quot;intelligent&quot; (or
      &quot;microprocessor&quot;) prostheses, make it possible to adjust the locomotion only once the first
      step has been taken and to assist the patient during ascent/descent situations on slopes and
      stairs. The next technological challenge in the development of lower limb equipment is to be
      able to anticipate these complex environmental situations, in order to secure and facilitate
      movement even before the obstacle is crossed or the terrain changed.

      This project plans to use the locomotor expectations commonly made during walking as a means
      of regulating the locomotor pattern. We believe that these expectations will depend on the
      situation, i.e. a particular anticipation when climbing or descending a slope, or when
      approaching a staircase, etc. To understand and describe these locomotor expectations, we
      plan to use recent techniques called supervised machine learning. These will make it possible
      to classify locomotor behaviour when walking on a slope or stairs. In the second phase, we
      would like to describe precisely the characteristics of the movements of the joints, and of
      the muscles during these adaptations. The final objective of this work is to create an
      autonomous sensor system to control the anticipatory behaviour of a lower limb prosthesis.
