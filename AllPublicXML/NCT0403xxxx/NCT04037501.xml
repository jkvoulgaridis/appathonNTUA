      caregivers of people with dementia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The identification of care needs of informal caregivers of people with dementia (PwD) at home
      is of particular importance to provide timely appropriate support and health care services to
      this vulnerable group. Family doctors and specialists have a key role in identifying the
      burden and care needs of informal caregivers. However, this often remains a challenge in
      everyday practice. In addition, the regionally available support and health care offers are
      often unknown. A computer-assisted care management system (CMS) can support the
      identification of unmet care needs and suggest individual, regional offers via a constantly
      updated database. On the basis of a standardized self-assessment, the VMS identifies
      personal, social, nursing and medical care needs of informal caregivers of PwD. The
      investigators apply the system in family and specialist practices as well as in memory
      clinics where it generates modularized recommendations for interventions based on predefined
      algorithms. The aim of the study is to test the effectiveness of a CMS to reduce the number
      of unmet care needs and to improve quality of life of informal caregivers of PwD. The study
      design is a cluster-randomized, controlled intervention study with two arms and two
      assessment times. The setting includes family and specialist practices for neurology and/ or
      psychiatry as well as memory clinics. The CMS will be used in the practices of the
      intervention group. Informal caregivers of PwD answer a self-administered questionnaire on a
      tablet PC. From the input, the system generates a list of unmet care needs based on
      predefined algorithms, and assigns these to individual intervention recommendations. The
      doctor evaluates each recommendation and forwards a validated list and possibly further
      intervention recommendations to a study assistant (Care Manager, CM). In a subsequent home
      visit, the care manager systematically collects additional information, specifies and
      concretizes the intervention recommendations and supports the informal caregivers of PwD in
      the implementation of the recommendations. In subsequent telephone contacts, the status of
      the implementation of the intervention recommendations will be discussed and the care manager
      coordinates the informal caregivers individual support. Patients of the control group will
      receive Care as Usual (CAU). After 6 months, a blinded, systematic, computer-based follow-up
      assessment will be conducted in both groups by hitherto uninvolved study assistants

    <description>A standardized assessment implemented as computer-assisted intervention management system (CMS) addresses caregiver burden, medical needs, home care needs, psychosocial needs (depression, sleep quality, pain, hearing, seeing, teeth problems, dementia related problems caused by PwD, medical aids). Based on predefined algorithms the CMS will generate a list of recommended intervention to address each of the unmet needs.</description>

    <description>The questionnaire SF-12 (Short form of SF-36) will be used to assess quality of life. The SF-12 is a physical scale score that represents general health perception, physical functioning, physical role functioning, and pain. The mental health score represents emotional role functioning, mental well-being, negative affectivity, and social functioning. The mean score is set to 50. Scores higher than 50 indicate better physical or mental health than the mean while scores lower than 50 indicate worse physical mental health than the mean.</description>

    <description>Informal caregiver burden will be assessed using the 7-item (short) version of the Zarit-Burden Interview; ZBI-7. The short version ZBI is a caregiver self-report measure to examine burden which is associated with functional/behavioural impairments in the social, psychological and physiological context and home care situation.It contains 7 items using a 5-point scale. Response options range from 0 (Never) to 4 (Nearly/Always). Total scores range from 0 indicating low burden to 88 indicating high burden.</description>

    <description>Social support will be assessed using the Lubben Social Network Scale (LSNS). This scale is a self-report measure of social engagement including family and friends on a 12 item scale. Total scores ranging from 0 to 90. High scores indicate strong social networks.</description>

    <description>A computerized Care Management System (CMS) will identify unmet needs of the informal caregiver of PwD and generates suggestions for interventions. Based on these, the treating physician develops an individualized treatment and care plan and assigns specific tasks to the care manager. Upon a home visit in the caregivers' home the care manager evaluates the need for additional tasks. Based on the complete list of tasks, the care manager initiates the implementation of respective actions. Via monthly telephone calls and optional home visits the care manager monitors the status of implementation and actively coordinates the support and care for the informal caregiver recommended intervention</description>
