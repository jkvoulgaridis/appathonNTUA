  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will follow a randomised, double-blind, cross-over design. Participants will use
      mouth rinses containing plant extracts and/or fluoride, as well as a mouth rinse containing
      only water (placebo). They will use oral appliances containing sterilized enamel and dentine
      slabs, which will be later collected for analyses.

      The cross-over design will allow participants to use all rinses, allowing for a comparison
      between the rinses within each individual.

      This study will be made in three in situ parts. Participants will wear an oral appliance
      containing sterilized enamel and dentine slabs. During this experimental phase, they will use
      the designated mouth rinse. After this period, the investigators will remove the enamel and
      dentine slabs, and will also collect salivary pellicle and any bacterial biofilm forming on
      the participant's teeth. Participants will also donate saliva for proteomic analysis (protein
      profile) to verify if there are any differences in proteins in saliva to proteins in the
      pellicle. Throughout the whole study, all participants will use standardized oral hygiene
      products.

      The experimental mouth rinses contain plant extracts that could interact with salivary
      proteins and influence the salivary pellicle and oral biofilm, thus bringing positive results
      against tooth (enamel and dentine) demineralisation.
