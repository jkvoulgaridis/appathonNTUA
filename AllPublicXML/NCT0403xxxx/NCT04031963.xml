  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a proposal to establish a Bioengineering Research Partnership (BRP). The major
      objective of the BRP is to refine and provide comprehensive, definitive multi-center
      validation of these novel methodologies for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening, thus providing
      a quantum leap in population screening.

      Background and Significance highlights the impracticality to provide total colonic evaluation
      for the entire population. Risk-stratification via exploitation of the &quot;field effect&quot; is an
      attractive approach. However, all existing methodologies (e.g FOBT, fecal DNA, flexible
      sigmoidoscopy) are clearly suboptimal underscoring the need for novel tools for identifying
      the field effect.

      1) We have developed ELF/LEBS for depth-selective (from ~30 to hundreds of microns)
      spectroscopic assessment of living tissue. 2) We tested these novel techniques in two animal
      models of CRC (the AOM-treated rat and MIN-mouse) and in human subjects (n=190). We
      demonstrated that ELF/LEBS has the potential to detect precancerous changes in the colon at a
      time point that precedes the formation of adenomas and other histological/molecular markers
      of CRC. 3) We demonstrated that rectal ELF/LEBS can detect field effect alterations in
      histologically normal rectal tissue changes due to the presence of adenomas anywhere in the
      colon. In our pilot studies, the diagnostic accuracy of rectal ELF/LEBS far exceeded any
      other currently known markers of CRC. Therefore, assaying ELF/LEBS in the rectum has the
      potential to provide accurate risk-stratification for colon carcinogenesis without the need
      for bowel preparation and colonoscopy. 4) We have developed prototypes of ELF and LEBS
      fiber-optics probes for in vivo use.
