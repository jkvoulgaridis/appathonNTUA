  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Age-related hearing loss is a substantial national problem due to its high prevalence and
      significant psychosocial consequences. Although hearing aids (HAs) are the primary
      intervention for the management of age-related hearing loss, only 15-30% of those who could
      benefit from HAs actually seek them out. HA adoption rates are even worse for people with
      lower income and for racial and ethnic minorities. One of the most commonly reported reasons
      for people not seeking HA intervention is the high cost of HAs and the associated
      audiological fitting services. Because HAs fitted using the audiologist-based
      service-delivery model are unaffordable, more and more Americans (1.5 million in 2010)
      purchase amplification devices via over-the-counter (OTC) service-delivery models to
      compensate for their impaired hearing.

      Although OTC amplification devices are gaining popularity and are regarded as an important
      option for promoting accessible and affordable hearing healthcare, it is unclear if they are
      viable solutions for age-related hearing loss as OTC models exclude professional services.
      Further, although there is some evidence supporting the effectiveness of OTC HAs, all
      previous studies measured short-term outcomes (e.g., 6 weeks). It is unknown what the
      long-term outcomes of OTC HAs would look like. The outcomes could improve across time because
      users may eventually figure out how to use HAs. On the other hand, the outcomes of OTC HAs
      could become poorer across time because, unlike traditional HA fitting, users do not have
      professionals to support them. Therefore, the overall goal of this project is to examine the
      longitudinal changes in OTC HA outcomes over 3 months.

      Although hearing aids (HAs) are the first treatment of choice for age-related hearing loss,
      only 15-30% of those older Americans who could benefit, actually seek HAs out and use them.
      HA adoption rates are even lower for people with lower income and for racial and ethnic
      minorities. Although the answer to why so few older adults seek or use amplification is
      multidimensional, one common thread is that many people believe that HAs fitted using the
      audiologist-based model cost too much. Therefore, it is not surprising that there has been
      increased advocacy for a variety of over-the-counter (OTC) service-delivery models, which
      have increasingly been identified as important options for managing mild-to-moderate
      age-related hearing loss.

      Is the amplification intervention delivered using the OTC model an appropriate solution for
      age-related hearing loss? Although there is some evidence supporting the effectiveness of OTC
      HAs, all previous studies measured short-term outcomes (e.g., 6 weeks). It is unknown what
      the long-term outcomes of OTC HAs would look like. The purpose of this project is to examine
      the longitudinal changes in OTC HA outcomes over 3 months. Older adults with age-related
      hearing loss will be recruited. Pre-configured hearing aids (that simulate OTC hearing aids)
      will be provided to subjects. Subjects will take the full initiative and responsibility for
      learning and using hearing aids. HA outcomes will be measured at 6-week and 12-week post
      intervention.

    <measure>Change of Hearing aid benefit as measured by the Glasgow Hearing Aid Benefit Profile (GHABP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change between 6-week post intervention and 12-week post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Glasgow Hearing Aid Benefit Profile (GHABP) is a questionnaire that measures hearing aid users' listening experience in four situations (TV listening, small conversation in quiet, conversation in noise, and group conversation). The GHABP will be administered using a smartphone-based ecological momentary assessment methodology. The name of the smartphone app is AudioSense2. The score ranges from 0 (no benefit) to 5 (lots of benefit). The change in the score between 6-week and 12-week post intervention is the primary outcome.</description>

    <description>The PHAP is a questionnaire designed to measures the performance of hearing aids in speech communication. The score ranges from 1 (good performance) to 99 (poor performance).
