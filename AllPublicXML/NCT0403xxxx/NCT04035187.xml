  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For tablets to be absorbed, the drug must dissolve after being swallowed. Drugs with low
      solubility sometimes require the inert ingredients in tablets to help the drug dissolve after
      being swallowed. This study uses itraconazole as an example drug with low solubility.
      Itraconazole tablets with different inert ingredients and manufacturing will be administered
      to healthy volunteers to see if the different inert ingredients and manufacturing impact drug
      absorption.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is an acceptable candidate for venipuncture.

          -  Subject is willing to stop all non-routine OTC medications, as well as vitamins,
             dietary supplements, and herbals, for 24 hours prior to study drug administration and
