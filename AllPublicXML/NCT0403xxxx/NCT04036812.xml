  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of postoperative pain after craniotomy is high. Severe postoperative pain can
      lead to a series of complications that are detrimental to the recovery of craniotomy
      patients. Compound local scalp nerve block is a good choice for analgesia after craniotomy.
      However, the scalp nerve block commonly cannot cover the area of suboccipital retrosigmoid
      approach craniotomy, leading to incomplete block. Superficial cervical plexus block (SCPB) is
      theoretically promising to solve the analgesia requirements of such surgical approach. At the
      same time, ultrasound guidance can not only accurately locate, ensure the effect of block and
      avoid accidental injury during puncture. The purpose of this study is to explore whether
      ultrasound-guided superficial cervical plexus block can safely and effectively reduce the
      requirement of analgesic drugs and pain after craniotomy via suboccipital retrosigmoid
      approach.
