  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this randomized trial is to compare a specially designed children's book to
      brochures for safe sleep education via clinical providers at a third trimester prenatal
      obstetric visit. Mothers in the control group will receive a specially designed children's
      book regarding the importance of reading with their infant at this visit, compared to
      brochures. Knowledge of safe sleep and home literacy orientation will be assessed at baseline
      prenatally, and their first postpartum obstetric visit.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving 2 groups of pregnant women from
      low-socioeconomic status (SES) backgrounds at-risk for adverse cognitive and health outcomes
      for their infant. Mothers will be randomly assigned to intervention and control groups during
      a third-trimester prenatal visit at a hospital-affiliated obstetric clinic, via convenience
      sampling. Mothers in the intervention group will receive education on American Academy of
      Pediatrics (AAP) safe sleep recommendations using a specially-designed children's book (Sleep
      Baby, Safe and Snug), while those in the control group will receive this guidance via a
      brochure endorsed by the AAP.

      In a &quot;mirror&quot; design, mothers in the control group will receive guidance on reading with
      their infant using a specially designed children's book (Read Baby, Every Day), and mothers
      in the intervention group will receive guidance on reading with their infant using a brochure
      created and endorsed by the AAP.

      Clinical research coordinators (CRCs) will obtain consent and collect data at two time
      points: 1) a 3rd trimester prenatal visit (approximately 36-38 weeks estimated gestational
      age; baseline), and 2) at the first, regularly scheduled postpartum visit (4-6 weeks after
      delivery for an uncomplicated vaginal delivery, and 2 weeks for cesarean section). Data will
      be collected in 4 categories, which will be compared between groups: 1) demographics, 2)
      maternal knowledge of AAP safe sleep recommendations, 3) maternal attitudes about reading
      with infants, 4) maternal impression of the printed educational materials provided, and 4)
      clinician impression of the feasibility and usefulness of the printed materials provided for
      obstetric prenatal care.

      Educational materials will be shared with mothers by obstetric providers (obstetric attending
      physicians and residents) during this visit, who will be provided with a brief summary of
      content and to conduct the visit as they see fit. Mothers will be blinded to the aims of the
      study, other than that it is to &quot;share information about safe sleep and reading with your
      baby.&quot;

    <measure>Safe Sleep Knowledge</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline prenatal (&gt;= 32 weeks) and postpartum (&lt;= 6 weeks).</time_frame>
    <description>The safe sleep assessment is based on a version developed by the PI and used in a recent published study, reflecting current AAP guidelines. Three questions are adapted from a published survey, gauging the mother's familiarity with SUID/SIDS (and briefly explaining if unfamiliar), whether she personally knows anyone who has lost a child to SUID/SIDS, and level of worry about SUID/SIDS for her baby. Our primary knowledge question utilizes an open-ended format, as no established tool for measuring SIDS knowledge was available: &quot;Name as many things as you can think of to help keep your baby safe from SUID/SIDS (dying while asleep).&quot; Maternal responses will be compared to an 11-item checklist of AAP safe sleep recommendations which are each referenced at least once in the book and brochures used, with 1 point awarded for each correct response.</description>

    <measure>Maternal impression of educational materials</measure>
    <time_frame>Postpartum (&lt;= 6 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Mothers will be administered a brief survey (Likert scale) regarding how useful the respective book or brochure were to help them understand safe sleep practices and the importance of infant reading. They will also be asked if they still have the materials and how often they have reviewed them at home.</description>

    <description>Obstetric attending and resident physicians will be administered a brief survey (Likert scale) after the prenatal visit regarding how useful the respective book or brochure was to catalyze discussion of safe sleep and infant reading with the mother, with emphasis on feasibility in clinical practice.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Home Literacy Orientation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline prenatal (&gt;= 32 weeks) and postpartum (&lt;= 6 weeks).</time_frame>
    <description>Prenatally, the mother will be administered a brief survey regarding the age at which the mother plans to begin reading with her infant (open-ended), planned frequency of reading (days per week), estimated number of children's books in the home, impression of the usefulness of reading to infants before 2 months old, and the value of discussing reading during prenatal visits (Likert scales). At the postpartum visit, this survey will be expanded to involve access to books, actual reading frequency, home reading routines, and the child's interest in being read to. An additional item regarding attitudes towards reading at home adapted from published research (&quot;What are your 3 favorite things to do with your child these days?&quot;, noting if reading is mentioned) will also be asked.</description>

    <description>This is an 10-item parental report assessment of shared reading quality created by the principal investigator for caregivers of children under 18 months, based on a conceptual model of practices thought to enhance the reading experience and benefit child development. Score is 0-30 points, with higher score suggesting more nurturing reading behaviors.</description>
