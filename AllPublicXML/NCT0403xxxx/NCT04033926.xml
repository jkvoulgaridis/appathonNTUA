  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      &quot;This is a Phase 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover, multicenter study
      to evaluate the safety, tolerability, efficacy, Pharmacokinetics (PK) and Pharmacodynamics
      (PD) of treatment with KZR-616 in patients with active Polymyositis (PM) or Dermatomyositis
      (DM). Patients will be evaluated for eligibility during the Screening Period. Eligible
      patients will be randomized 1:1 to Arm A or Arm B of the study.

      During the 32-week treatment period, patients will receive study drug subcutaneously (SC)
      once weekly with 2 treatment periods of 16 weeks each.

      This study will be conducted on an outpatient basis.
