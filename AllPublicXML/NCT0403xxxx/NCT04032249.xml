  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to analyze the effectiveness of introducing behavioral elements in a weight
      loss program, in this case, comparing the difference between self-weighing versus not doing
      so.

    <description>Baseline mean BMI values will be measured and compared at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months. BMI will be assessed on a monthly basis during nutritional consultation through a Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis method using a Tanita BC-418 Segmental Body Composition Analyser/Scale</description>

    <measure>Changes from baseline Fatty mass</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline (0 years) and followed for 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Baseline mean Fatty mass values will be measured and compared at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months. Fatty mass will be assessed on a monthly basis during nutritional consultation through a Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis method using a Tanita BC-418 Segmental Body Composition Analyser/Scale. Fatty mass is measured as a percentage.</description>

    <measure>Changes from baseline Free-fatty mass</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline (0 years) and followed for 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Baseline mean Free-fatty mass values will be measured and compared at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months. Free-fatty mass will be assessed on a monthly basis during nutritional consultation through a Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis method using a Tanita BC-418 Segmental Body Composition Analyser/Scale.

    <time_frame>At baseline (0 years) and followed for 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Baseline mean Muscular Mass values will be measured and compared at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months. Muscular Mass will be assessed on a monthly basis during nutritional consultation through a Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis method using a Tanita BC-418 Segmental Body Composition Analyser/Scale. Fatty mass is measured as a Kg.</description>

    <measure>Changes from baseline Corporal Water</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline (0 years) and followed for 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Baseline mean Corporal Water values will be measured and compared at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months. Corporal Water will be assessed on a monthly basis during nutritional consultation through a Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis method using a Tanita BC-418 Segmental Body Composition Analyser/Scale. Fatty mass is measured as a Kg.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Adherence to dietary pattern will be also measured through personal interview</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline (0 years) and followed for 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be subjected for an intervention based on nutritional (control group) and physical education (two intervention arms) during 24 months. Partial measures will be also taken every week. In the end of the trial, changes in dietary patterns will be measured comparing means differences between baselines, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months.</description>
