  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) accounts for about 20% of intracerebral hemorrhage, but its
      mortality rate is as high as 50%-80%. External ventricular drainage (EVD) can rapidly reduce
      intracranial pressure, but clinical practice found that drainage catheters are often blocked
      by blood clots and long-term thrombolytic therapy is likely to cause secondary bleeding. The
      application of neuroendoscopy in IVH has attracted more and more attention in recent years.
      Studies have shown that the use of neuroendoscopy for IVH evacuation (with EVD) has
      advantages over EVD alone. However, the cases of most current research are small and all of
      them are retrospective studies, which means lacking prospective clinical studies to provide
      high-quality evidence. Based on this, we intend to conduct a randomized, controlled,
      multi-center clinical trial to compare the prognosis of patients who undergo endoscopic IVH
      evacuation surgery versus those who undergo external ventricular drainage for moderate to
      severe IVH.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Spontaneous Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) is defined as bleeding into the cerebral
      ventricular system caused by spontaneous rupture of brain arteries, veins and capillaries
      instead of trauma. IVH accounts for about 20% of cerebral hemorrhage, but its mortality rate
      is as high as 50%-80%. According to the results of the STICH trial, the prognosis of patients
      with IVH is worse than that of patients without IVH (p&lt;0.00001); if patients with IVH have
      hydrocephalus, the prognosis is the worst.

      According to the edition of 2015 Chinese multidisciplinary experts' consensus for spontaneous
      cerebral hemorrhage diagnosis and treatment and 2015 AHA/ASA spontaneous cerebral hemorrhage
      diagnosis and treatment guidelines, for patients with small amount of IVH without obstructive
      hydrocephalus, conservative treatment or continuous lumbar drainage can be effective. For
      patients with large amount of IVH (hematoma occupying more than 50% of the lateral ventricle,
      secondary obstructive hydrocephalus or obviously increased intracranial pressure), the
      occupancy effect is dramatic and patients are prone to suffering from hydrocephalus and
      cerebral palsy, in which circumstances urgent evacuation of hematoma is required, but it is
      controversial whether it is beneficial for the patients and whether it can improve the
      prognosis of patients.

      As the regular treatment for IVH, external ventricular drainage (EVD) can rapidly reduce
      intracranial pressure, but clinical practice found that drainage catheters are often blocked
      by blood clots, and long-term thrombolytic therapy is likely to cause secondary bleeding.
      Usually, the catheters need to be removed or replaced one week after placement as for the
      increasing risk of infection.

      The application of endoscopy in IVH has attracted more and more attention. Studies have shown
      that the use of endoscopy for IVH evacuation (with EVD) has advantages over EVD alone. The
      incidence of postoperative hydrocephalus and the need for ventricular-peritoneal shunt
      surgery is lower. However, the cases of most current research are small and all of them are
      retrospective studies. There are no such clinical trials registered at home and abroad, and
      that is, there is a lack of prospective high-quality clinical studies to further demonstrate
      the effect of endoscopic treatment for IVH.

      Based on this, we intend to conduct a randomized, controlled, multi-center clinical trial to
      compare the prognosis of patients who undergo endoscopic IVH evacuation surgery versus those
      who undergo external ventricular drainage for moderate to severe IVH.

    <description>Endoscopy was performed using a rigid endoscope. The hematoma was removed by a technique using irrigation and aspiration. The ventricular drainage catheter was placed on the surgical side. Six hours after surgery, we administered 20,000 U urokinase with 5 ml saline every 8 hours through the catheter and the catheter was closed for 1 hour to allow drug-clot interaction and then reopened to allow for gravitational drainage. Subsequent CT scans were done for any safety concern or every 24 hours. Administration of urokinase was stopped when the CT scans showed that the circulation of cerebrospinal fluid is unobstructed. When CT scans showed that the intracerebral hematoma was significantly reduced and the circulation of cerebrospinal fluid is unobstructed, the catheter could be clamped for 24 h. If there was no acute intracranial pressure increase, the catheter could then be removed.</description>

    <description>The surgeons used a soft catheter to puncture in depth of about 5 cm. The next step was to fix the drainage catheter. Postoperative CT was done immediately to confirm positioning of the soft catheter and stability of the hematoma. Six hours or more after catheter placement, we administered 20,000 U urokinase with 5 ml saline every 8 hours and the catheter was closed for 1 h to allow drug-clot interaction and then reopened to allow for gravitational drainage. Subsequent CT scans were done for any safety concern or every 24 hours. Administration of urokinase was stopped when the CT scans showed that the circulation of cerebrospinal fluid is unobstructed. When CT scans showed that the intracerebral hematoma was significantly reduced and the circulation of cerebrospinal fluid is unobstructed, the catheter could be clamped for 24 h.
