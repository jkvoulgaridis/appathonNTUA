  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to develop and pilot test a behavioral weight control intervention
      for adolescents from a low-income background that combines facets of mindfulness training
      with behavioral weight control. We aim to examine biological (e.g., weight, stress hormone)
      and behavioral (e.g., emotional eating, mindfulness) changes as a result of a 16-session
      mindfulness-based weight control intervention compared to a 16-session standard behavioral
      weight control intervention.

      The overarching aim of this study is to pilot and refine a novel Mindfulness Based Weight
      Control (MBWC) intervention to improve weight management outcomes among adolescents (ages
      13-17) who are overweight or obese and from a low-income background. First, we will pilot
      (open-trial) the 16-session MBWC intervention, with a focus on decreasing emotional eating,
      in an adolescent population. Second, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial of the
      16-week MBWC intervention vs. a 16-week standard behavioral weight control intervention among
      adolescents who are overweight or obese and compare outcomes of the MBWC and control
      interventions. We are interested in examining change in biological and behavioral variables
      (e.g., body mass index normed for age and biological sex; perceived stress; physiological
      stress biomarkers; eating and activity patterns; psychological function related to weight
      management) post-intervention and at three-month follow-up. Treatment satisfaction/treatment
      acceptability will be evaluated at the end of treatment.

    <description>All participants will be randomly assigned to a 16-session group-based Mindfulness-Based Weight Control (MBWC) intervention or a Standard Behavioral Weight Control (SBWC) intervention. Participants assigned to the MBWC intervention will receive mindfulness curriculum informed by Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction plus the standard behavioral weight control components. Group sessions will be approximately 90 minutes each week. Outside of group sessions, participants will be asked to engage in dietary self-monitoring (MBWC and SBWC groups) and practice mindfulness skills (MBWC only).</description>

    <description>Mindfulness-Based Weight Control will be administered over 16 group-based sessions with weekly home practice (mindfulness exercises, dietary self-monitoring, physical activity). Sessions will include Standard Behavioral Weight Control (SBWC) and mindfulness components. SBWC components include: 1) a dietary plan based on a balanced, reduced caloric deficit diet; 2) incrementally increasing physical activity; 3) behavioral components (e.g. self-monitoring, goal setting, stimulus control); and 4) minimal parent involvement (i.e., 3 parent sessions). Participants will be taught core mindfulness exercises (e.g. breath-awareness, body scan, mindful eating) while focusing attention on the present moment and non-judgmentally acknowledging thoughts, emotions, or sensations. Participants will learn informal mindful strategies for daily living, which are designed to increase awareness of pleasant and unpleasant emotions and the relation to habitual behaviors (e.g. emotional eating).</description>
