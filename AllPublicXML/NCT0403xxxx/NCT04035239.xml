  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label trial of 20 study participants with glaucoma or ocular hypertension.
      Participants with qualifying study eye(s) after screening and baseline evaluations will
      receive the Balance Goggles System. After a baseline evaluation (prior to negative pressure
      application through the BGS), study eyes will be treated for one hour in the clinic and be
      evaluated again. They will then use the BGS for the next 3-6 weeks and be evaluated again.
      The goal is to determine whether the intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering effects of BGS is
      accompanied by changes in retinal thickness measured by optical coherence tomography (OCT),
      retinal vascular density measured by OCT-angiography, or retinal fluorescence measured by a
      fundus camera.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Participant must be medically able to undergo the testing required in the schedule of
             events (SOE).

          2. Participant's clinical diagnosis must be consistent with glaucoma characterized by
             clinical evidence of progressive retinal ganglion cell dysfunction and degeneration
             using at least one visual field and at least one structural modality, OR with ocular
             hypertension with intraocular pressure above 21 mm Hg.

          3. If a participant has two eyes meeting study criteria, both may be enrolled.

          4. Subjects with orbital anatomy that permits a proper seal in both eyes when goggles are
             placed over eyes and can tolerate measurements with goggles in place

          5. Participant must understand and sign the informed consent. If the participant's vision
             is impaired to the point where he/she cannot read the informed consent document, the
             document will be read to the participant in its entirety.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects with a history of allergy to primary study device material (i.e., silicone)

          2. Subjects with a history of any ocular disorder or condition (e.g., corneal transplant)
             in either eye that would likely interfere with the interpretation of the study results
             or compromise subject safety

          3. Subjects with a prior retinal detachment, active retinal detachment, an untreated
             retinal detachment, unresolved cystoid macular edema, or any other fundus findings
             that may prevent visualization of the retina in either eye; subjects with macular
             degeneration are not excluded from participation in the study

          4. Subjects with a history of prior penetrating glaucoma surgery (e.g. trabeculectomy,
             tube shunt, etc.) in either eye

          5. Subjects with narrow anterior chamber angle anatomy in either eye as visualized by
             gonioscopy with a Shaffer angle grade of â‰¤ 2 in any of the four quadrants

          6. Subjects with eyelid edema, festoons or excessive skin laxity in either eye

          7. Subjects with conjunctival chemosis in either eye

          8. Subjects with best corrected visual acuity of 20/200 or worse in either eye due to
             glaucoma

          9. Subjects who have had intraocular surgery in the study eye within 12 weeks prior to
             the screening visit , or who, in the opinion of the investigator, may require any
             ocular surgery (e.g., cataract extraction or glaucoma procedure) in either eye during
             the course of the study

         10. Subjects who do not wish to or cannot comply with study procedures, including home use
             of the study device

         11. Subjects with any physical or mental condition that would, in the opinion of the
             investigator, increase the risk of participation in the study or may interfere with
             the study procedures, evaluations and outcome assessments
