  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multinational, multi-center medical record review to describe the treatment patterns,
      clinical outcomes, and EGFR / T790M testing practices in EGFR-mutated advanced NSCLC patients
      receiving first-line EGFR TKI therapy in Europe.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim is to generate real-life data on treatment patterns of the EGFR-mutated advanced
      NSCLC patients receiving first- or second-generation EGFR TKI in first line of therapy as
      provided per routine practice in eight countries. An approximate number of 820 patients will
      take part in the REFLECT study.

      It is anticipated that data, generated from the proposed large cohort across centers in
      Europe, will facilitate a better understanding of unmet medical needs in first line of
      treatment and will provide a platform for improving patients' management.
