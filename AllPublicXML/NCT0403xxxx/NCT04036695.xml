  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients receiving dialysis for kidney failure suffer from very high rates of sudden cardiac
      death due to abnormal heart rhythms and perfusion defects associated with HD treatment. It
      has previously been recognized that patients suffer heart injury during the dialysis
      procedure which may be an important factor for investigation. The study uses a simple
      implantable device that can monitor heart rhythms over time to gather information on the type
      of abnormal rhythms that occur in dialysis patients. This information will be combined with
      ultrasound and x-ray scans of the heart that will also be collected. The goal is to
      understand the relationship between the abnormal rhythms and injury to the heart during
      dialysis and what causes these injuries. The information gathered in this study will be used
      to compare the accuracy of an in house personalized computational model to predict potential
      cardiac injuries when patients undergo HD treatment.

      This is an exploratory, single group, observational study involving patients recruited from
      the dialysis patient population of London Health Science Centre (LHSC) Renal Program.
      Recruited patients will undergo insertion of the Reveal LINQ insertable cardiac monitoring
      system and continuously examined over a time period up to three years to gather data on
      incidence of arrhythmia.

      Participants will have a study session on a mid-week dialysis treatment day (Wednesday or
      Thursday) prior to the insertion procedure at St. Joseph Hospital. During the first study
      session, participants will have an external multichannel ECG, CT scan, 2D echo, and blood
      work will be drawn. Also, all participants will then undergo an insertion procedure of the
      Reveal LINQ insertable cardiac monitoring system on a non-dialysis treatment day. The
      implantable loop recorder will be monitored weekly up to 12 months. Then, 12 months after the
      initial insertion of the device, a follow-up will be completed.

      Bloodwork will be obtained pre and post dialysis, as well as at peak stress of each study
      session. Results will be used to determine relevant biomarkers of oxidative stress,
      myocardial ischemia, and volume overload.

    <description>a small implantable cardiac monitor (Reveal LINQ device) will be inserted under local anaesthetic in an outpatient procedure. The Reveal LINQ device is composed of two electrodes and is used to continuously monitor electric activity temporally. It can detect arrhythmic episode and record up to 27 minutes of electrocardiographic (ECG) activity. This device is capable of continuous monitoring of patient's ECG activity for up to three years and will be utilized in this study to obtain initial information on the timing and nature of the arrhythmia suffered by hemodialysis patients leading to SCD.</description>
