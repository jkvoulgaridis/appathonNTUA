  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes is an increasingly common condition which affects millions of people in the United
      Kingdom. Patients with type 2 diabetes are at increased risk to develop severe heart disease
      and vascular complications and these can result in death. A cornerstone of the treatment is
      lifestyle and diet.

      The number of travellers is increasing quickly and there are more people than ever travelling
      by airplane. During a commercial flight the pressure of the air is lower than the pressure on
      the surface and that results in lower concentration of oxygen in the air we are breathing
      while flying. Also the humidity is very low inside an aircraft.

      The aims of this study are to show if we can use a simulated flight as a method to look at
      how the endothelial cells react and to see if this is different between patients with type 2
      diabetes mellitus and healthy volunteers.

      A sub-study is also incorporated to look at different dietary interventions in type 2
      diabetes.
