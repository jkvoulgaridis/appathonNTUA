  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to evaluate the effectiveness of an injury prevention
      intervention delivered primarily using headset virtual reality for collegiate soccer players.
      The hypothesis is that measures of sensorimotor control will improve, injury incidence rate
      will decrease and on-field soccer performance will improve.

    <description>Participants will receive multi-modal sensorimotor training interventions, including activities training the vestibular system, oculomotor control and visual perception, neuromotor control and strengthening of the cervical spine, postural control/ balance exercises, and exercises integrating the use of multiple types of sensory information for controlled motor output, including speed and accuracy. Novel headset virtual reality (VR) games/activities; compliant balance surfaces; resistance bands/weight; and biofeedback devices will be utilized to deliver the training intervention. The exercises delivered at each intervention will be delivered in a group format, using a circuit of exercises that each athlete will complete in a session. Subsequent sessions will build upon previous sessions to work the sensorimotor control system in progressively more challenging and sport-specific scenarios. This present study will complete 12 sessions over 6 weeks.</description>
