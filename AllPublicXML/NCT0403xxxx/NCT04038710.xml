      This is an observational study of people with severe cystic fibrosis that are eligible for
      Vertex's triple combination therapy through its expanded access. Pulmonary health, intestinal
      health, and the overall health of individuals will be tracked for a year to see how effective
      triple combination therapy is in these people with severe cystic fibrosis disease.
