  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Three-fourths of people diagnosed with gastric cancer will die from it. Researchers want to
      see if giving cancer drugs in a new way can help people live longer and delay the time it
      takes for the cancer to grow.

      Objective:

      To find a better way to treat advanced stomach cancer.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 18 and older with stomach cancer that has spread throughout their belly.

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with:

      Medical history

      Physical exam

      Blood, urine, and heart tests

      Scans

      Cancer sample: If they do not have one, they will have a biopsy.

      Tests of performance of normal activities

      Dietary assessment

      Participants will have a laparoscopy. Small cuts are made into their abdomen. A thin camera
      with a light is inserted. Small instruments are used to take biopsies. This will be repeated
      during the study to monitor the cancer. During the first laparoscopy, a port with a catheter
      attached will be put into the abdomen.

      Participants may also have an endoscopy: A thin tube with a camera is inserted through the
      mouth and into the stomach. The tube collects samples to monitor the cancer.

      Participants will get paclitaxel every 3 weeks through the abdominal port and through a small
      plastic tube in an arm vein. They will also take capecitabine by mouth twice daily for the
      first 15 days of a 21-day cycle.

      After participants finish 3 cycles, they will have scans to see how they are doing. They may
      get another course of therapy.

      Participants will have visits every 3 weeks during treatment. Then they will have follow-up
      visits for 5 years. Then they will keep in touch with researchers for the rest of their life.

      Background:

        -  An estimated 28,000 cases of gastric adenocarcinoma are diagnosed annually in the U.S.

        -  Peritoneal metastasis is a common finding at diagnosis, making curative surgical
           resection possible in an estimated 25% of patients.

        -  Systemic chemotherapy is the recommended treatment for patients with metastatic gastric
           cancer to the peritoneal cavity, however selective use of cytoreductive surgery and
           intraperitoneal chemotherapy has been associated with improved overall survival.

        -  Multiple chemotherapeutic agents and delivery systems have been described for
           intraperitoneal therapy, but no standard regimen exists.

      Objective:

      -Determine the progression free survival (PFS) in patients with peritoneal metastases from
      gastric cancer after repeated intraperitoneal chemotherapeutic infusion (IPC) and systemic
      paclitaxel administration with concomitant capecitabine therapy.

      Eligibility:

        -  Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the stomach.

        -  Radiographic evidence of peritoneal carcinomatosis and/or sub-radiographic evidence of
           peritoneal carcinomatosis found at staging laparoscopy.

        -  Medically fit for systemic chemotherapy and intraperitoneal chemotherapy.

        -  Men and women agegreater than or equal to 18 years.

      Design:

        -  Phase II, nonrandomized, open label study.

        -  Patients will enroll in two cohorts: those with prior systemic chemotherapy and those
           who are treatment naive.

        -  Patients will undergo staging laparoscopy and placement of peritoneal access port.

        -  Intraperitoneal paclitaxel (20 mg/m2 weekly), intravenous paclitaxel (80 mg/m2 weekly),
           and capecitabine (825 mg/m2 twice daily for 14 days of each cycle) for 12 weeks.

        -  Treatment response will be assessed with imaging and laparoscopy.

        -  It is expected that 16-20 patients per year for total 4 years will be enrolled. The
           accrual ceiling is set at 70 patients.

             intralumenal heparin) for venous or arterial access devices is allowed.

         10. Pregnant women are excluded because paclitaxel and capecitabine can cause fetal harm
             when administered to pregnant women. Because there is an unknown but potential risk
             for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with
             paclitaxel and capecitabine, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is
             treated with paclitaxel and capecitabine.
