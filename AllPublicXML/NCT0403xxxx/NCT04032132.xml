      The turmeric (Curcuma longa) plant, a herb belonging to the ginger family. The most active
      component of turmeric is curcumin, which makes up 2 to 5% of the spice. Curcumin showed has
      antibacterial effect against periodontal pathogen and positive result regarding conventional
      treatment of periodontal disease due to its anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and wound healing
      properties. This study will be carried out to examine the effect of curcumin when used in
      conjunction with open flap debridement treating deep periodontal pockets. (suggesting that it
      may have positive effect)

      The present study entailed twenty four patients having stage II or stage III, Grade A
      periodontitis with 24 intrabony defects. Patients were divided into two groups; group I was
      subjected to open flap debridement only. Group II was subjected to curcumin paste
      (2%curcumin)in conjunction with open flap debridement Clinical parameters including plaque
      index, sulcus bleeding index, probing depth and clinical attachment level were recorded
      pre-surgical. Moreover, radiographic examination was performed by cone beam computed
      tomography (CBCT) just before the surgery . Vertical bone defects were exposed by full
      thickness mucoperiosteal flap following intrasulcular incision and thorough debridement was
      performed. Group II received local application of curcumin paste.The same initial clinical
      parameters were recorded three and six months postoperatively. Radiographic measurements were
      recorded six months post surgically.
