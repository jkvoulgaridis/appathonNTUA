    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is evaluate the breastmilk transfer and pharmacokinetics (Part 1)
      and effectiveness (Part 2) of a post-cesarean delivery intravenous ketamine
      bolus-and-infusion strategy, as a preventive analgesic modality to reduce pain and opioid
      requirements. Physiochemical, PK/PD, and breastmilk transfer of ketamine and its metabolites,
      as well as calculated estimations for neonatal exposure will be assessed in Part 1. In Part
      2, PK/PD assessments will continue in a larger cohort. Endpoints will also include postpartum
      pain, depression scores, central sensitization measures, patient-reported postpartum recovery
      scores, breastfeeding, and parent-infant bonding, assessed in the acute post-cesarean period
      and up to 12 weeks postpartum.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postpartum pain management strategies currently permit opioids for breakthrough pain, but
      strategies focused on minimizing or eliminating opioids are lacking. In the non-obstetric
      surgical population, modalities such as intravenous ketamine are well-recognized as effective
      adjuncts in opioid-reduction strategies for postoperative pain. Although there have been some
      studies of ketamine exposure in postpartum women without deleterious outcomes noted, these
      studies in pregnant and lactating women are limited by a lack of information on maternal
      pharmacokinetics, breastmilk secretion, and clinical effectiveness when used with standard
      multimodal analgesic approaches. There is also a lack of information on intermediate and
      long-term outcomes in this setting. This two-part trial will address these knowledge gap by
      advancing understanding of the safety and efficacy of ketamine and its metabolites in
      perinatal populations.
