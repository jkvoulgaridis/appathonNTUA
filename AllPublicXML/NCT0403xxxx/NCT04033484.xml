  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Perineal wound healing is a significant challenge after extralevator abdominoperineal
      excision (ELAPE) due to a high rate of wound breakdown. And it was proved that neoadjuvant
      radiotherapy significantly increases perineal wound problems after abdominoperineal resection
      for rectal cancer. Negative pressure therapy has proven benefits in open wounds, and recently
      a negative pressure system has been developed for use on closed wounds at high risk of
      breakdown. A systematic review suggested a significant decrease in perineal wound
      complications when using incisional negative pressure wound therapy was demonstrated, with
      surgical site infection rates as low as 9% (vs 41% in control groups). The review suggested
      that incisional negative pressure wound therapy decreases perineal wound complications after
      abdominoperineal resection. Prospective study also suggested that after ELAPE the application
      of a negative pressure system to the perineal wound closed with biologic mesh may reduce
      perineal wound complications. The aim of the present study was to determine whether negative
      pressure therapy combined with biological mesh compared with biological mesh alone after
      ELAPE could improve wound healing.

    <description>The perineal wound was reconstructed with biologic mesh after ELAPE. The subcutaneous adipose layer was closed with 2/0 vicryl sutures, and a suction drain was left in the deep layer. The subcuticular layer and skin were closed with 3/0 vicryl mattress sutures and the negative pressure system applied at 80 mmHg</description>
