      Q MOLI is an alongside qualitative study, for the 'Misoprostol or Oxytocin for Labour
      Induction' (MOLI) pragmatic, open-label, randomised controlled trial, comparing a
      misoprostol/misoprostol regime vs the standard misoprostol/oxytocin induction of labour
      regime.1000 patients with hypertensive disease in pregnancy will be recruited, over 24
      months, in Nagpur, India.

      Qualitative study involving semi-structured interviews, with participants (pregnant women
      with hypertension/pre-eclampsia participating in the 'Misoprostol or Oxytocin for Labour
      Induction' (MOLI) study who consent to enter the qualitative study) in a randomised trial,
      pre and post induction of labour and focus group discussions with healthcare professionals
      involved in the study (MOLI study staff; practitioners who are involved in screening,
      recruiting, randomising and consenting participants to the MOLI study).

      The investigators aim to assess the priorities, experiences and acceptability of women being
      induced for hypertension in pregnancy in India, and clinician's views on the feasibility,
      usability, acceptability and barriers to implementation of various induction protocols.

        1. Explore patients' perceptions, expectations, priorities, understanding of and concerns
           around induction of labour, prior to induction.

        2. To explore the experiences, acceptability and satisfaction of patients post induction
           and any differences between the two RCT groups; misoprostol/misoprostol vs
           misoprostol/oxytocin regimes.

        3. To better understand the feasibility, usability and acceptability of the different
           induction regimes to health care professionals. To explore potential barriers for
           implementing research findings into clinical practice and potential solutions.

        4. To explore patients' and staff perspectives of the fetal monitoring regimens during the
           induction process.
