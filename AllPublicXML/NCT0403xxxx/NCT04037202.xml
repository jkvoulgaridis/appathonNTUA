      postpartum comfort and pain status of the mothers who had vaginal delivery.Materials and
      methods: The study was completed with 66 mothers. As data collection tools, a questionnaire,
      Postpartum Comfort Scale (PCS), Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and Drug Follow-up Card (DFC)
      were used.

      Background and purpose: This study aims to investigate the effect of foot massage in the
      postpartum period on the need of receiving analgesic medication after assessing the
      postpartum comfort and pain status of the mothers who had vaginal delivery.

      Materials and methods: In order to keep the number of people in balance between the groups,
      &quot;block randomization&quot; method which is one of the fixed probability randomization types was
      preferred. The research was completed with 66 persons, 33 in the study group and 33 in the
      control group. As data collection tools, a questionnaire, Postpartum Comfort Scale (PCS),
      Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and Drug Follow-up Card (DFC) were used.

      Research inclusion criteria include (i) primipara mothers (who had their first birth), (ii)
      mothers who had normal vaginal delivery, (iii) those who had undergone episiotomy, (iv) who
      were volunteered to participate in the study, (v) who were on the first day of delivery
      (first 24 hours), (vi) who had no complications in the infant and the baby, (vii) age of whom
      ranged from 18 to 35, (viii) those who did not apply or receive any other complementary
      therapy, (ix) mothers who did not have any wound, infection or discomfort etc. on their feet,
      and those who can read and write.

    <intervention_model_description>The researcher prepared the mother for foot massage (foot care, proper position, etc.) and gave a total of 20-minute massage of foot massage, 10 minutes for each foot. VAS was repeated immediately after the first session (in the 20th minute) and after 30 minutes (in the 50th minute). The second session was performed on the second day, 20-24 hours after the first session (before the discharge). The VAS was analyzed before the second (last) session (0th minute), and the VAS was repeated immediately after the application (20th minute) and 30 minutes (50th minute), and the PCS was administered for the last time. Administered analgesics were recorded in the DFC and the administration made with package leaflet was supported.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Postpartum Comfort Scale (PCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>5-10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>In accordance with the comfort theory developed by Katharine Kolcaba in 1994, the PCS developed by Karakaplan and Yıldız (2010) consists of 34 items.A 5-point Likert-type scoring system was used to evaluate each item.Expression and scoring were made for each item ranging from &quot;totally agree&quot; (5 points), and &quot;strongly disagree&quot; (1 points).In positive sentences, &quot;I fully agree&quot; indicates the best comfort (5 points) and in negative sentences low comfort (1 points).Accordingly, the lowest score to be taken from the scale is 34 and the highest score is 170.</description>

    <time_frame>Less than 1 minute</time_frame>
    <description>It is a single-item continuous scale consisting of a horizontal or vertical line and is usually 10 centimeters (100 mm) in length. For example, the severity of pain a patient feels ranges from &quot;no pain&quot; with 0 points on a line to &quot;severe pain&quot; with 10 points.Scoring is achieved by measuring the point the patient has marked with a ruler.Pain relief points in VAS;
Absence of pain (0-4 mm),
Slight pain (5-44 mm),
Moderate pain (45-74 mm)
Severe pain (75-100 mm)</description>

    <description>The first session of the foot massage was performed after mothers were taken to the postpartum service and after the effect of the first analgesia had elapsed (4-6 hours after birth).
The researcher prepared the mother for foot massage (foot care, proper position, etc.) and gave a total of 20-minute massage of foot massage, 10 minutes for each foot. VAS was repeated immediately after the first session (in the 20th minute) and after 30 minutes (in the 50th minute). The second session was performed on the second day, 20-24 hours after the first session (before the discharge). The VAS was analyzed before the second (last) session (0th minute), and the VAS was repeated immediately after the application (20th minute) and 30 minutes (50th minute), and the PCS was administered for the last time.

    <intervention_name>Foot massage</intervention_name>
    <description>Foot massage includes classical massage techniques such as effleurage, petrissage and friction techniques. Effleurage is the movement of stroking and lubricating superficial tissues. Therefore, it is performed at the beginning and ending of the massage. Petrissage is the slow and rhythmic movement to apply direct pressure to the soft tissue underlying the skin with the balls of the fingers and thumbs. Friction is the application of pressure through small circular movements only in small areas, using hand or fingers. While muscle tissue is compressed and relaxed, blood and lymph circulation increases. Thus, lactic acid in the muscle fibers is diminished and fatigue and stress are decreased.</description>
