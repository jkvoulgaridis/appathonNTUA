  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate if daily feedback on food-derived metabolites in
      stool enhances an individual's ability to make and/or sustain a dietary change.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study to find out how people respond to information about food-derived
      compounds measured in their stool.

      This study will take place over a three-week period. For these three weeks, participants in a
      medical weight loss program will be asked to collect samples of their stool daily from Monday
      to Friday, with optional sampling on weekends. We will measure the amount of butyrate, a
      breakdown product of fiber, in each sample provided and return this measurement by text
      message. Participants will be randomized into two groups: one group will have new
      measurements returned the day after providing each stool sample, and another will have their
      measurements returned all at once, at the end of the study. Both groups will also receive a
      daily text message report of their fiber intake, based on the foods they ordered at the
      weight loss facility cafeteria.

      The greatest risks of the study include the possibility of infection while sampling stool,
      possible gastrointestinal discomfort from changes to the diet, and potential loss of
      confidentiality.
