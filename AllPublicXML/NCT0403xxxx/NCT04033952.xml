    <textblock>
      Method: Participants with a diagnosis of acquired brain injury (ABI) will be randomly
      assigned to the intervention group and the attention control group at a 1:1 ratio.
      Participants received 2 sessions per week for 10 to 20 sessions.

      Outcome measures including the Participation Measure- 3 Domains, 4 Dimensions (PM-3D4D),
      Canadian Occupational Performance Measure(COPM), Activity Measure for Post-Acute Care (AMPAC)
      Outpatient Short Forms, Wisconsin Card Sorting Task (WCST), and Participation Strategies Self
      Efficacy Scale (PS-SES) will be administered at baseline (T1), post-intervention (T2),
      3-month follow-up (T3), 6-month follow-up (T4), and 12-month follow-up (T5).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This proposed study aims to examine the efficacy of a strategy training intervention program
      on improving executive functions and lessoning disability among community-dwelling people
      with ABI, and to determine whether the effects of the intervention persist 1 year following
      the intervention.

      To address these purposes, a double-blinded, parallel-group randomized controlled trial will
      be implemented to assess the efficacy of the strategy training intervention program in
      comparison to the control group. An expected sample of 180 adults with ABI-related cognitive
      impairments and are undergoing outpatient rehabilitation services will be recruited.

      These participants will be blinded and randomly assigned to the intervention group and the
      attention control group at a 1:1 ratio. The primary outcome measures, including Wisconsin
      Card Sorting Task (WCST), Stroop Test, Trail-Making Test, and Montreal cognitive assessment
      (MoCA), will be administered at baseline (T1), post-intervention (T2), 3-month follow-up
      (T3), 6-month follow-up (T4), and 12-month follow-up (T5). Data will be analyzed
      quantitatively andqualitatively.

      Findings of this study will provide important evidence on whether the strategy training
      intervention has immediate and long-term effect on executive functions. These findings will
      together support the application of the program in rehabilitation practice and inform future
      study development.

    <measure>Participation Measure- 3 Domains, 4 Dimensions (PM-3D4D)</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 12-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The PM-3D4D is a 19-item measure that was designed to evaluate three domains of participation: Productivity, Social, and Community. Respondents are asked to rate each item on four dimensions: (1) 'Diversity of participation' (yes [1] vs. no [0]); (2) 'Frequency'(5- and 7-point scales, from &quot;never&quot; to &quot;everyday or almost everyday&quot;); (3) 'Desire for change' (yes [1] vs. no[0]); and (4) 'Perceived difficulty' (4-point scale, from &quot;very difficult&quot; [1] to &quot;not difficult at all&quot; [4]). Each dimensional score of the PM-3D4D can be separately summed for each domain. Psychometric properties of the PM-3D4D were established in rehabilitation populations.</description>

    <measure>Activity Measure for Post-Acute Care (AMPAC) Outpatient Short Forms</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 12-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The AM-PAC consists of three subscales that assesses three activity domains: basic mobility (18 items), daily activity (15 items), and applied cognitive (19 items). Each item asks the respondent to rate the difficulty to perform specified activities using a 4-point scale. The summary scores for each subscale will be transformed into standardized scores on the t-score scale.</description>

    <measure>Participation Strategies self-efficacy Scale (PS-SES)</measure>

    <description>The PSSES was developed to measure self-efficacy in managing home participation, community participation, productivity, communication, staying organized, and advocating for resources. The scale consists of 35 items. Each item is rated using a 1-10 Likert scale, with higher score indicating greater self-efficacy.</description>

    <measure>Stroop Test</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 12-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked to read out the ink color of the word as accurately and as soon as possible. The ink color of the word could be congruent or incongruent with the written color name. Each participant's time to complete the task will be calculated and recorded. Construct validity of the Stroop Test in the TBI population has been published.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Trail-Making Test (TMT A and B)</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 12-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Trail-Making Test (TMT A and B) will be used to measure sustained attention, sequencing, mental flexibility, and visual tracking. TMT-A requires the individual to link in an ascending order a series of 25 numbered circles distributed randomly on a test paper as quickly as possible. TMT-B is similar, although it requires the individual to link switching alternatively between a set of numbers (1-13) and a set of letters (A-L) in an ascending order (1-A-2-B-3-C...). The Time to complete TMT A and B will be calculated, in which a longer completion time will indicate poorer outcome. This instrument was validated in healthy people, patients with head injury, vascular disorders, and other diverse populations.</description>

    <description>The OPASS program will be delivered to the intervention group. The intervention protocols of the OPASS program were developed based on the strategy training guidelines developed by Skidmore et al. and based on the findings identified from the feasibility study. Trained research therapists will take the responsibility for delivering the intervention to participants. The program consists of four critical ingredients: self-selected goals, self-evaluation of performance, strategy development, and implementation, and therapeutic guided discovery.</description>

    <intervention_name>Strategy Training</intervention_name>
    <description>This approach is different from traditional direct skill training, which emphasizes clinicians' responsibility on identifying their patients' challenges in performing activities and teaching patients task-specific problem-solving strategies. Strategy training, on the other hand, requires clinicians to take a role as a facilitator, guiding participants to learn through prompts and questions. In the training process, participants learn to develop their own problem-solving strategies and work through the problems they have, through which they can develop self-efficacy and confidence to manage participation challenges. Participants can also generalize the strategies they learn to other similar problems they encounter in daily life.</description>
