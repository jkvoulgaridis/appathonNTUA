  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying the usefulness of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to screen
      for brain metastases (spread of the breast cancer to the brain).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials examine the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention, in this case magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI) of the brain, to learn whether it is helpful in managing a specific disease.

      In this research study, the investigators are utilizing screening MRIs of the brain to
      evaluate breast cancer patients for metastases to the brain. The investigators hope to
      understand whether screening MRIs of the brain can be implemented into the standard of care
      to earlier detect brain metastases in a population where screening MRIs of the brain are not
      currently recommended or systematically performed.

      This trial will contain 4 cohorts:

      1. Those with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) will undergo screening MRI of the brain as
      part of a single arm, non-comparative study

      2+3. Those with hormone receptor positive/(human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)
      negative (HR+/HER2-) and HER2 positive (HER2+) subtypes will be randomized to receipt of
      screening MRI of the brain or no screening MRI of the brain to definitively test the value of
      MRI screening.

      4. Patients with inflammatory breast cancer being treated with curative intent will undergo
      screening MRI of the brain as part of a single arm, non-comparative study.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants must have histologically or cytologically confirmed breast cancer with
             pathologic assessment of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and
             (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status. If subtype has changed over
             the course of a patient's disease, the treating clinician and/or study PI is
             responsible for selecting the subtype that most likely reflects the preponderance of
             oncologic disease at the time of enrollment.

          -  Participants must have radiographic evidence of extracranial, distant metastases or
             unresectable, locally recurrent breast cancer and be initiating (within 8 weeks of
             registration) first-line or second-line chemotherapy for their metastatic/recurrent
             disease OR inflammatory breast cancer being managed with curative intent within six
             months of diagnosis.

          -  Participants must be age 18 years or older.

          -  Participants must have a life expectancy of greater than 12 weeks.

          -  Participants must be willing to undergo study procedures.

          -  The effects of gadolinium / other magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based contrast
             agents on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, women of
             child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier
             method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of
             study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while
             she is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician
             immediately.

          -  Participants must possess the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a
             written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants who have a contraindication to MRI (e.g. noncompatible implanted metallic
             device for which MRI is absolutely contraindicated).

          -  Participants who have chronic kidney disease stage IV-V or end stage renal disease.

          -  Participants with a history of anaphylactic reactions to gadolinium.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because gadolinium-based agents have not
             been proven to be safe to administer to a developing fetus. Similarly, breastfeeding
             women will be excluded from this study.

          -  Patients with a prior diagnosis of brain metastases
