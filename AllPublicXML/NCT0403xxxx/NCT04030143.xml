  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to determine the safety and tolerability of multiple-dose
      administrations of aripiprazole in adult participants with schizophrenia or bipolar I
      disorder. To establish the similarity of aripiprazole concentrations following the final
      administration of aripiprazole into the gluteal muscle site, and to establish the similarity
      of aripiprazole exposure following the final administration of aripiprazole into the gluteal
      muscle site.

    <description>To assess the extrapyramidal symptoms. The SAS consists of a list of 10 symptoms of Parkinsonism (gait, arm dropping, shoulder shaking, elbow rigidity, wrist rigidity, head rotation, glabella tap, tremor, salivation, and akathisia).

    <description>To assess the extrapyramidal symptoms. The AIMS assessment consists of 10 items describing symptoms of dyskinesia. Facial and oral movements (items 1 through 4), extremity movements (items 5 and 6), and trunk movements (item 7) will be observed unobtrusively while the participant is at rest (eg, in the waiting room), and the investigators will also make global judgments on the participants dyskinesias (items 8 through 10). Each item will be rated on a 5-point scale, with a score of 0 representing absence of symptoms (for item 10, no awareness), and a score of 4 indicating a severe condition (for item 10, aware/severe distress). The cumulative score will range from 0 to 40.</description>

The BARS consists of 4 items related to akathisia: objective observation of akathisia by the investigator, subjective feelings of restlessness by the participant, participant distress due to akathisia, and global evaluation of akathisia. The first 3 items will be rated on a 4-point scale, with a score of 0 representing absence of symptoms and a score of 3 representing a severe condition. The global clinical evaluation will be made on a 6-point scale, with 0 representing absence of symptoms and a score of 5 representing severe akathisia.</description>
