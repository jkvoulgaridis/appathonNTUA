  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rectal cancer represents 14,000 new cases a year in France. At diagnosis, 70% of patients
      have a locally advanced tumors T3-T4 and / or N + evaluated mainly by rectal MRI. These
      patients will benefit from a neo-adjuvant treatment by radio-chemotherapy. The complete
      histologic response rate (ypT0N0) after this neo-adjuvant treatment ranged from 15 to 27% and
      improved recurrence-free survival, remotely relapse-free survival, overall survival, and
      decreased local recurrence rate. In the case of full response diagnosis after neoadjuvant
      chemoradiotherapy 3 theoretical solutions exist:

        1. Total excision of the rectum and mesorectum (TME) This is the classic attitude with a
           low risk of local recurrence (5%) but functional complications occur in 25 to 60% of
           cases

        2. A simple monitoring (&quot;Watch and Wait&quot;) by MRI, biopsy, rectoscopy ... This strategy was
           initially proposed to elderly patients considered inoperable but it has also been
           proposed in younger patients, operable, with a view to decreasing morbidity and
           sequelae. This attitude poses a likely overall risk of local recidivism. However, this
           higher risk of recurrence may be the result of imperfect identification of ypT0N0
           patients.

        3. Local excision of the post-radiation scar also called closure lumpectomy with
           pathological analysis and possible secondary TME if no complete response. This last
           attitude has the advantage of allowing an anatomopathological verification of the
           treated lesion and to complete the treatment if necessary. In the case of ypT0 the local
           recurrence rate is low and in this case it is possible to consider rectal savings.

      The choice of the last two attitudes is therefore based on the correct identification of
      patients in complete response. The performance of the diagnosis of no complete response after
      radiochemotherapy is therefore fundamental and is the subject of this project wich consist of
      comparing he diagnostic performance for the identification of a complete lack of response
      [18F] -FDG-PET / MRI ypT0N0 to that of the classic attitude (MRI) 6 to 9 weeks after the end
      of a neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy treatment of low and mid-rectal cancers in patients in
      whom clinical and endoscopic examination favor a complete response.

      The MRI examination to evaluate the response to routine Radio-Chemotherapy Neoadjuvant (RCT)
      will be replaced by an MRI-PET scan in all patients included. Firstly, only the MRI portion
      of the examination will be interpreted (sequences identical to that performed in conventional
      MRI), without the PET part of the examination. An evaluation of the answer will be done. The
      results of the MRI will be transmitted to the surgeon in accordance with the conventional
      attitude of treatment of rectal cancer treated with RCT.

      In a second step the complete examination associating the merged MRI and PET sequences will
      be reinterpreted. A new evaluation of the response will be done. The results of the MRI and
      PET MRI will be read without the gold standard, which will be available after the
      intervention. The results of this second analysis will not be transmitted to the
      Multidisciplinary Concertation Meeting and will not influence the management. The patients
      will then be operated. The histological stage ypTN will be established on the operative
      specimen.

      Thus all patients will have the 2 tests under study (MRI and [18F] -FDG-PET / MRI, as well as
      the gold standard (pathological analysis) .These results will meet the main objective
      evaluation of the diagnostic performances by comparing them with the results of the gold
      standard (anatomopathological analysis of the operative specimen)
