  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The majority of endometrial cancer patients with disease spread beyond the uterus will
      progress within 1 year. Platinum-based chemotherapy was used as the first-line treatment in
      metastatic or advanced endometrial cancer. There is no standard protocol for the second-line
      option when tumors persist or recur. In vitro and in vivo studies showed Crizotinib, an
      approved drug for the treatment of ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer, demonstrated
      activities in endometrial cancer with c-MET kinase and Sema domain mutations. As a
      consequence, a phase 2 clinical trial to investigate the efficacy of Crizotinib in
      endometrial cancer patients with MET mutation is initiated.

      In this phase 2 study, the target population is patients with recurrent or persistent
      metastatic endometrial cancer. The mutation status of c-MET gene will be tested and only
      patients with c-MET mutation will be enrolled. After enrollment, Crizotinib 250 mg bid will
      be used orally. CT scan or MRI will be used to determine the response. Crizotinib will be
      continued till disease progression. Primary end is objective response rate. The secondary
      endpoints include progression-free survival, overall survival and safety profiles.
