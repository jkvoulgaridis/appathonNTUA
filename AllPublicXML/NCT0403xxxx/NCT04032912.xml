      Eliminating the need for conventional histopathological assessment of diminutive colon polyps
      - The Non-Optical Resect and Discard (NORD) study

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Implementation of this approach by community-based gastroenterologists has failed to reach
      the required quality benchmarks and studies evaluating optical biopsy have not shown
      diagnostic test performance results that meet standards set by society guidelines in order to
      promote its widespread clinical adoption. Optical polyp diagnosis and the current resect and
      discard approach are too complex for clinical adoption. Thus, clinical implementation of this
      valuable concept has not been achieved to date and its cost-saving potential has not been
      realized. In order to effectively operationalize a resect and discard strategy, one must find
      a different way to distinguish neoplastic from non-neoplastic polyps. There exist differences
      in the proportion of polyps found to be adenomatous in the left and right colon. One recent
      study reported that 30% of left-sided polyps and 76% of right-sided polyps were found to be
      adenomas on histology. Since polyps located in the proximal colon are more likely to be
      adenomas and polyps in the recto-sigmoid colon are more likely hyperplastic we hypothesized
      that a model based on polyp location might be able to replace optical biopsy and
      histopathology. Such an approach would be very simple to adopt by every clinician and would
      allow for easy adoption into clinical practice.

        All 45-80 year old patients scheduled for an elective colonoscopy with the potential of a
        polyp removal will be considered for the study. This includes patients hospitalized that do
        not require an emergency colonoscopy (defined as colonoscopy in the emergency or intensive
        care unit or patients with active upper or lower gastrointestinal bleeding). Potential
        study subjects are approached to participate: 1) during an outpatient clinic; 2) at their
        arrival at the endoscopy clinic on the day of the colonoscopy; or 3) on the hospital ward
        (for patients hospitalized).
