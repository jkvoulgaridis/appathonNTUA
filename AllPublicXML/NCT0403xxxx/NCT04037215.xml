    <textblock>
      In order to explore the cognitive treatment of patients with early onset anorexia nervosa
      (AM) in front of images of silhouettes and food, we will use the eye-tracking method. While
      we hypothesize a judgment disorder in these patients, the exploration of implicit cognitive
      treatment without desirability bias is essential. Eye-tracking is a method of recording the
      eye path that provides qualitative and quantitative information on the visual exploration of
      subjects. The visual pathway depends on how the subject's attention is directed to a given
      stimulus, but also on certain cognitive traits (e.g., excessive attention to details) or
      symptoms (e.g., avoidance of caloric food images or attraction to thin images). It is
      therefore a non-invasive exploration tool, which provides information on how patients look at
      food images and silhouettes. This project will describe the cognitive treatment of dietary
      stimuli and body image in young patients with early onset AM. It could identify a biomarker
      of AM in the pediatric population and improve the diagnosis of the disease. A better
      diagnosis of AM in patients under 15 years of age is essential and will improve medical care
      and develop personalized medicine.

      Monocentric, prospective cohort, case-control type study. The population concerned is
      composed of patients with early onset anorexia nervosa (AM) and control subjects (two
      groups).

      The objectives of this study are to:

      Describe the cognitive treatment of early-onset AM patients with specific stimuli of the
      disorder (eating and body images) compared to age- and sex-matched control subjects:

        -  children controls not achieved with normal body mass index(BMI);

        -  children with unbalanced insulin-dependent type 1 diabetes, therefore subject to a
           strict diet that requires good nutritional knowledge and no weight judgment disorders.

      Describe the links between cognitive treatment and clinical phenotype in patients with early
      onset AM, in particular severity of eating behaviour trouble symptomatology (TCA),
      psychiatric and somatic comorbidities, neuropsychological profile.

      30 patients with early-onset AM. Two groups of control subjects (matched for age and gender):
      30 subjects from the general population with a normal Body Mass Index (BMI) and 30 subjects
      with chronic somatic pathology (type 1 diabetes) without weight variation (good knowledge of
      dietary caloric values without impaired judgment about the caloric value of foods and
      representation of the body image of self and others) A total of 90 participantsPatients and
      controls without eating disorders will be recruited at Robert Debré Hospital, after signature
      of the authorization by the holder(s) of parental authority present at the time of
      hospitalization All patients treated in the department benefit from extensive phenotypic
      exploration, carried out in routine care.

      For controls, phenotypic exploration will require a half-day evaluation.

    <intervention_model_description>All assessments in patients with AM are performed as part of routine care and do not require additional monitoring modalities added by research.
For controls, phenotypic exploration will require a consultation with clinical examination including the search for psychiatric comorbidities and the completion of standardized questionnaires, exploration of the neuropsychological profile (with eye tracking, overall cognitive exploration, executive functions, social cognition and self-esteem).
Test results will not be returned except for screening requiring specific management. The information will then be returned to the child's parents by the investigating doctor, who will be responsible for organizing specific care whenever it is necessary.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>In order to explore the cognitive treatment of patients with early onset anorexia nervosa in front of images of silhouettes and food, it is currently used in the child psychiatry department of the Robert Debré Hospital, the eye-tracking method. Eye tracking is a non-invasive and painless method of recording the path of vision on images presented on a computer screen. In order to understand the specificities of the eye path in sick patients, we will compare the data with those of controls without eating disorders.</description>
