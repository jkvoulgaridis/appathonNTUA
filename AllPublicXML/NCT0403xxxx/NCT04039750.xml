  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will investigate whether antibiotic irrigation using a
      gentamicin/clindamycin solution during laparoscopic appendectomy is superior in preventing
      postoperative wound infections and IAA in perforated appendicitis compared to suction without
      irrigation. This will be the first prospective study to compare these two options in
      pediatric PA.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is for pediatric patients who are having an appendectomy and have a perforated
      appendix. The purpose of this study is to see whether antibiotic irrigation using gentamicin,
      clindamycin and suction during the surgery works better when compared to suction alone when
      cleaning the stomach cavity.

      Arm A patients will have their abdomen irrigated with the antibiotics, gentamycin and
      clindamycin, and then the wound will be suctioned out. Arm B patients will not have the
      antibiotic irrigation but will have their wound suctioned.
