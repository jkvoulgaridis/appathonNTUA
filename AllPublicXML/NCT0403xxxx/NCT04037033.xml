  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sedentary behavior, which is characterized by too much sitting, is an epidemic in the United
      States. It is estimated that 4 out of every 10 Americans never engage in physical activity,
      and approximately 60% of an adult's non-sleeping hours are spent in sedentary behaviors. This
      equates to approximately 9-10 hours per day. As sedentary behavior increases, so do diagnoses
      of chronic illnesses such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and kidney
      disease. Older adults are particularly at risk for sedentary behavior and the related chronic
      illnesses.

      The aims of this study are to investigate the effectiveness of the Everyday Meaningful
      Activities (EMA) Intervention in forming active lifestyle behavior habits, in improving
      perceived performance of and satisfaction with active lifestyle behaviors, in decreasing
      sedentary time during the times for the selected active lifestyle behaviors, and in
      decreasing an individual's perceived sedentary time.

      This prospective study will examine the ability of medically stable older adults to decrease
      sedentary behavior by creating new, active lifestyle behavior habits using the Everyday
      Meaningful Activities intervention. The EMA Intervention is based in Habit Formation Theory.
      It is an individualized, client-centered intervention that aims to increase adherence to
      active lifestyle behaviors in older adults' lives. Participants will engage in the EMA
      Intervention that is designed to create new active lifestyle behavior habits by attaching
      these new active lifestyle behaviors to currently existing daily routines.

      During six intervention sessions over six weeks, participants will select two new active
      lifestyle behaviors to make habitual and will create action plans to create the habits. The
      first behavior will be implemented at the first intervention session, and the second behavior
      will be implemented at the fourth session. The participants will be assessed three times over
      their 8 to 10-week study participation. Participants should (1) be 65 years of age and older,
      (2) have intact cognition, (3) have no self-reported physical activity limitations, (4) have
      a sedentary lifestyle, and (5) have no acute illnesses or unstable medical conditions.

      The results of this study may provide evidence for the occupational therapy intervention to
      decrease sedentary behavior in older adults in the community. The results may also broaden
      the scope of occupational therapy practice through demonstrating the potential for
      occupational therapy services in preventive health care.

    <description>Participants will wear the ActiGraph GT9X Link (a medical grade activity tracker) watch at three different time points during the study. The participants will wear the watch for approximately 10 consecutive days before the first intervention session, before the fourth intervention session, and before the post-intervention session. During these three periods, the watch will be worn for 24 hours per day.</description>

    <time_frame>1) intervention session 1 at Week 1; 2) intervention session 4 at Week 4, and 3) posttest at Week 7</time_frame>
    <description>The Self-Report Habit Index (SRHI) measures features of habits including repetition, automaticity, and expressing identity. This 12-item assessment assesses the strength of habits by differentiating habit strength from behavior frequency. The participants will choose two active lifestyle behaviors to incorporate into their daily lives. The SRHI will generate pretest and posttest data for each behavior. The items in the SRHI began with the stem &quot;Behavior X is somethingâ€¦&quot; and is then followed by 12 statements rated on a scale from 1 (very strongly agree) to 7 (very strongly disagree). A total score ranges from 1 to 84 with lower scores indicating stronger habits.</description>

    <measure>Changes in the subjective report of sedentary behaviors with minimal recall bias</measure>
    <time_frame>1) Approximately 10 consecutive days before the first intervention session of Week 1, 2) for 8-10 consecutive days between intervention sessions at Week 3 and Week 4, and 3) for 10 consecutive days between Week 6 and Posttest at Week 7</time_frame>
    <description>During the time participants wear an activity tracker (ActiGraph GT9X Link), participants will be asked to answer the following question daily: How would you rate your sedentariness today (1-not at all sedentary; 10-extremely sedentary)?</description>

    <measure>Changes in Canadian Occupational Performance Measure</measure>
    <time_frame>1) intervention session 1 at Week 1; 2) intervention session 4 at Week 4, and 3) posttest at Week 7</time_frame>
    <description>The Canadian Occupational Performance Measure will be used to assess the participants' rating of performance of their active lifestyle behaviors (Performance Scale) and their satisfaction with their performance of their active lifestyle behaviors (Satisfaction Scale). Performance is rated on a 1 (not able to do it at all) to 10 (able to do it extremely well) scale. Satisfaction is rated on a 1 (not satisfied at all with the way I do this activity) to 10 (extremely satisfied with the way I do this activity) scale. Therefore, higher ratings indicate better perceived-performance and higher satisfaction with their performance.</description>

    <measure>Changes in Sedentary Behavior Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>1) intervention session 1 at Week 1, and 2) posttest at Week 7</time_frame>
    <description>The Sedentary Behavior Questionnaire (SBQ) is a self-report questionnaire about time spent in sedentary behaviors both on weekdays and weekends. There are 9 identical items on the weekday form and the weekend form. Participants will complete both forms at both time points. The SBQ is used to assess the participants' perceived sedentary time. A total score ranges from 0 to 54 for each (weekday and weekend), with higher scores indicating more sedentary behaviors.</description>

    <description>The EMA intervention will include 6 intervention sessions. At session 1, the interventionist and participant will identify 2 meaningful active lifestyle behavior goals using COPM. Last, an action plan will be created for behavior 1. Participants will be asked to implement the action plan everyday.
At session 2, the interventionist and participants will review the daily activity log and the action plan.
At session 3, the interventionist and the participants will review the daily activity log and the action plan.
At session 4, an action plan will be created for behavior 2. Participants will be asked to implement the action plan for behavior 2 everyday.
At session 5, the participants and interventionists will discuss the participant's daily activity log and action plan.
At session 6, the participants and interventionists will discuss the participant's daily activity log and action plan.</description>
