  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The reason for the study is to find out if an experimental combination of an oral medication
      called osimertinib (TAGRISSO®) when used in combination with chemotherapy is more effective
      than giving osimertinib alone for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic non-small
      cell lung cancer. Some lung cancers are due to mutations in the Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)
      which, if known, can help physicians decide the best treatment for their patients. One type
      of mutation can occur in the gene that produces a protein on the surface of cells called the
      Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR).

      Osimertinib is an Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)
      that targets Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) mutations. Unfortunately, despite the
      benefit observed for patients treated with osimertinib, the vast majority of cancers are
      expected to develop resistance to the drug over time. The exact reasons why resistance
      develops are not fully understood but based upon clinical research it is hoped that combining
      osimertinib with another type of anti-cancer therapy known as chemotherapy will delay the
      onset of resistance and the worsening of a patient's cancer.

      In total the study aims to enroll approximately 586 patients, consisting of approximately 30
      patients who will participate in a safety run-in component of the trial, and approximately
      556 who will receive osimertinib alone or osimertinib in combination with chemotherapy in the
      main trial. In the main part of the trial there is a one in two chance of receiving
      osimertinib alone, and the treatment is decided at random by a computer.

      The study involves a Screening Period, Treatment Period, and Follow up Period. Whilst
      receiving study medication, it is expected patients will attend, on average, approximately 15
      visits over the first 12 months and then approximately 4 visits per year afterwards. Each
      visit will last about 2 to 6 hours depending on the arrangement of medical assessments by the
      study centre.

    <description>Progression-free survival (PFS) using Investigator assessment as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1).
Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from randomization until the date of objective disease progression or death (by any cause in the absence of progression), regardless of whether the patient withdraws from randomized therapy or receives another anti-cancer therapy prior to progression. Patients who have not progressed or died at the time of analysis will be censored at the time of the latest date of assessment from their last evaluable Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) assessment.
The primary efficacy analysis of progression-free survival will be performed by investigator assessment Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1). An additional sensitivity analysis will be performed for Progression-free survival (PFS) by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) assessment.</description>
