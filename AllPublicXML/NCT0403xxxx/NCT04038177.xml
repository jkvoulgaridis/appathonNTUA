  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical inactivity is a global challenge and there is an urgent need to find strategies to
      increases people's activity levels. Strength training is one of the activities that is
      recommended to engage in regularly by both the American College of Sports Medicine and the
      World Health Organization. Understanding how strength training can be done effectively
      without spending much time could potentially increase people's involvement in strength
      training, as lack of time often is reported as barrier to training. Superset strength
      training can potentially be a time-efficient way of strength training, as this training
      method has been found to take half the time of the traditional ways of training.

      The aim of the present study is therefore to compare the effects of superset strength
      training and traditional strength training on muscular strength, body composition and
      fatigue.
