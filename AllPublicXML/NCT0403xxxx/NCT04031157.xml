  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will compare two groups of patients: a control group of patients treated per the
      Standard of Care when prescribed with a medication for their Major depression disorder,
      versus a group of patients that used the Predictix Antidepressant tool when prescribed with a
      medication for their Major depression disorder by their treating physician. Success will be
      measured by the number (proportion) of responders per group.

      The study will be comprised of two arms:

        1. PGT arm - Predictix Antidepressant-guided treatment condition

        2. SOC (control) arm - Standard of Care condition Eligible subjects will be assigned to one
           of the study arms at a 1:1 ratio and will be followed for a period of 12 weeks.

      An assigned psychiatric expert will review and approve subject's eligibility prior to
      entrance to the study, as well as, the medication/s prescribed based on the Predictix report
      prior to treatment start.

      During the 12 weeks of follow up , data will be collected at the following timepoints:
      Screening, Baseline (start of treatment) and at 4, 8 and 12 weeks.

      Visits will include the completion of several questionnaires designed to answer the study
      objectives, either as self-reported by the patients and/ or by the physician.

      Depression scores by the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS 16) questionnaire
      and evaluation of all safety related endpoints will be analyzed following the completion of
      the 12 weeks visit procedures. In case of a change in treatment, as per the treating
      physician's decision, a new 12 weeks cycle of data collection will start. Two independent
      cycles are permitted per patient.

      In addition, retrospective (6 months prior to enrollment) and long-term follow up period data
      (12 months post enrollment) will be analyzed, in order to evaluate the device use effect on
      patients care outcomes in terms of economic burden and Social impact, on patients, employers,
      the health care system and payers.

      The analysis will be based on both the work productivity and activity impairment
      questionnaire and the patient's electronic medical data record.
