  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this research is to determine the clinical benefits of an innovative and
      lightweight powered leg controlled using our intent recognition framework in laboratory and
      community environments.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this study is that using the Hybrid Leg with seamless, automatic
      transitions will result in participants choosing to become more active and improve their
      community participation compared to when using their own passive prosthetic leg.

      The Hybrid Leg is an an innovative and lightweight powered leg that has 2 operating modes:
      active and passive. When in active mode, the Hybrid Leg is capable of supplying 120 NM of
      knee torque and actively repositioning the ankle during non-weight bearing phases of gait.
      When in passive mode, the motor and transmission are decoupled from the knee, which then
      behaves like an Ottobock 3R95 passive prosthetic knee, and the non-backdriveable mechanism of
      the ankle allows it to behave as an energy return foot. Allowing the device to behave
      passively if the battery becomes depleted or the actuators become damaged is an important
      enabling safety factor that will allow us to complete our study.

      Phase 1: We will enroll 20 subjects a clinical trial of the leg and control system who will
      be fit with the Hybrid Leg and receive in-lab therapy to learn how to ambulate with the
      device.

      Phase 2: Subjects will be randomized into a clinical trial of the leg and control system with
      an AB-BA design; condition A - subjects own device; condition B - Hybrid Leg. Subjects will
      complete an extensive ambulation and community mobility training to learn optimal use of
      their own passive device or the Hybrid Leg. After training the subjects will complete a full
      biomechanical analysis for each device as they complete ambulation circuits that include
      standing, level-ground walking, walking on slopes and on stairs, sit-stand transitions and
      transitions between these activities.

      Phase 3: After completing phase 2 subjects will complete 4-week trials using their assigned
      prosthesis (Condition A or B) at home and within their community. During the trials subjects
      will be monitored using mobile phone based sensors and socket mounted activity monitor to
      determine how often the user performs the ambulation activities.

    <time_frame>4 weeks - data collected during 4 week home trial of each device, analyzed upon completion of 4 week home trial</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome will be assessed using an accelerometery data measured using a mobile phone during the entire 4-week home trial of each device (Hybrid Leg and prescribed home device), resulting in a pair of outcomes for each subject. Statistical analysis will be done , first using a paired t-test (which assumes no carry-over and no device sequence effects), followed by the analysis using a linear mixed model with device and sequence group as fixed effects, and subject as the random effect. We expect that sequence will not be a statistically significant predictor, but that average daily steps will be significantly different between devices, with subjects taking significantly more steps when using the Hybrid Leg.</description>

    <description>The Hybrid Knee uses an actively variable transmission in combination of a passive spring/damper system. This allows the motor torque output to be adapted to the requirements of active dynamic tasks - changing the effective transmission ration from zero (fully passive) for level ground walking to a maximum value (fully active) for sit-to-stand transfers. This provides physiological knee torque and speed with a small motor and primary transmission system while also maximizing electrical efficiency, which minimized battery weight. The knee prototype weights 1.7kg. The Semi-active ankle can actively reposition during non-weight bearing phases of gait and uses a non back driveable transmission to maintain its set point during weight bearing activities.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A unilateral or bilateral lower limb amputation

          -  K2/K3/K4 ambulator with a prosthesis

          -  English speaking

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Significant new injury that would prevent use of a prosthesis: The ability to
             consistently wear a prosthesis and perform activities of daily living and specific
             performance tasks is necessary to evaluate the relative benefits of the interventions.

          -  Cognitive impairment sufficient to adversely affect understanding of or compliance
             with study requirements, ability to communicate experiences, or ability to give
             informed consent: The ability to understand and comply with requirements of the study
             is essential in order for the study to generate useable, reliable data. The ability to
             obtain relevant user feedback through questionnaires and informal discussion adds
             significant value to this study.

               -  Significant other comorbidity: Any other medical issues or injuries that would
                  preclude completion of the study, use of the prostheses, or that would otherwise
                  prevent acquisition of useable data by researchers.
