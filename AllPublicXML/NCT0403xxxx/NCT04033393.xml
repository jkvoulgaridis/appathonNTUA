  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to investigate the effects of Game based dual-task training with treadmill
      on executive function and dual-task performance in individuals with early-onset PD and
      discuss the correlation between the change values of executive function and dual-task
      performance after training. Besides, investigate cortical activation after training.
