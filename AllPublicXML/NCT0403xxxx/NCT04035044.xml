  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A new analyser has been developed (Allegro™) which allows the tests to be undertaken at the
      clinic, with the results available in a few minutes. This means that patients can get
      immediate feedback and that the doctors/nurses can adjust treatment before the patient leaves
      the clinic. It is obviously important that this analyser performs to a similar degree of
      accuracy to the laboratory analyses.

    <textblock>
      Blood and urine tests are used in the assessment of diabetes and to guide clinical
      management. In the traditional model of care, blood samples are taken from patients at the
      clinic and are sent to the laboratory for analysis and the results may not be available for a
      number of hours/days after the clinic visit.

      A new analyser has been developed (Allegro™) which allows the tests to be undertaken at the
      clinic, with the results available in a few minutes. This means that patients can get
      immediate feedback and that the doctors/nurses can adjust treatment before the patient leaves
      the clinic. It is obviously important that this analyser performs to a similar degree of
      accuracy to the laboratory analyses.

      The aim of this research study is to assess the accuracy of the Allegro™ analyser compared to
      laboratory analyses on finger prick capillary blood samples and urine samples. Fifty (50)
      patients with diabetes will be invited to give a venous blood sample, finger prick capillary
      blood sample and urine sample. The venous blood sample, finger prick capillary blood sample
      and urine sample will be analysed by both the Allegro™ analyser and laboratory analyses and
      the results compared. The Allegro™ results will not be used in the management of the
      patients' diabetes.
