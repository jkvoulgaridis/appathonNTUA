  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is strong evidence that specific types of exercise can improve health and physical
      function in older adults. While community exercise classes exist, many older adults with
      chronic conditions may need guidance from credentialed exercise professionals to ensure
      sufficient dose and progression and to address fears or low exercise self-efficacy.
      Furthermore, low protein intake among older adults is common and initiating exercise when
      nutrition is inadequate may cause weight loss and limit gains in muscle strength. The primary
      goal is to determine the feasibility of implementing the MoveSTroNg program under real-world
      conditions, measured through referral and recruitment to the program and study retention and
      adherence rates.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The MoveStrong trial is a 1-year pilot closed cohort stepped wedge randomized control trial
      (RCT) to evaluate the feasibility of implementation of the MoveStrong program. This program
      includes a functional exercise and nutrition program that teaches older adults with chronic
      diseases how to perform functional resistance and balance exercises and promote adequate
      protein intake and nutrition. Four sites (1 Northern and 3 Southern Ontario sites) will be
      cluster-randomized to implement MoveStrong at one of four start times, each three weeks
      apart. The primary outcome will be to determine the feasibility of recruitment and referral
      from diverse settings (i.e., retirement homes, community centers, and family health teams)
      and establish the retention and adherence to the program. Secondary objectives will determine
      the following: What are the participant's and provider's experience with the MoveStrong
      program? What is the short-term responsiveness (i.e., ability to detect change) of frailty
      indicators (Fried Frailty Index components), protein intake, or quality of life? Who agrees
      to participate? What adaptations need to be made to MoveStrong, or study methods in each
      setting? What is the cost relative to the benefit? Is behaviour change maintained in the
      maintenance period? Our long term goal is to use the information from this project to
      develop, implement, and evaluate a sustainable, scalable and pragmatic model to deliver
      strength and balance training and promote adequate protein intake among older adults with
      chronic diseases.

    <description>Exercise:A kinesiologist-led twice-weekly program. Prior to attending the program, each attendee gets a 1:1 session with the kinesiologist to decide exercise starting levels. Group exercises start with a warm-up stepping game. Participants then perform 2 sets of 8 repetitions of each exercise, gradually progressing to an intensity of 3-8 repetitions maximum. Exercises include one each of a push, pull, squat, reach/press, lunge/step-up, lift and carry movement. After, there is a 10-minute group discussion to prompt making exercise routine at home. Nutrition:Two dietitian-led interactive group seminars to promote strategies to increase protein intake and sampling of protein-rich snacks and protein supplements. Seminar topics consider the cost to prepare high protein foods, the ability of retirement home residents to alter diet, how and why to spread protein intake through the day, how much protein is in their usual choices, and easy-to-consume protein-rich snacks.</description>
