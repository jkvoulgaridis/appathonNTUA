    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well pembrolizumab given every 12 weeks works compared to
      every 3 weeks in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Immunotherapy with
      monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body?s immune system attack the
      cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving
      pembrolizumab every 12 weeks may provide similar disease control with fewer treatments for
      patients with non-small cell lung cancer when compared to every 3 weeks. Demonstrating that
      12 week dosing is as effective as 3 week dosing may also have a significant impact when
      considering the cost required for these medications.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the 1-year progression-free survival rate with pembrolizumab administered
      every 3 weeks compared to pembrolizumab administered every 12 weeks.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess overall survival between the two treatment groups. II. To assess the serious
      adverse event profiles between the two treatment groups.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate circulating biomarkers of treatment response and resistance. II. To
      characterize fecal microbiotic profile and to correlate those results with tumor
      characteristics and antitumor immune responses.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes every 3 weeks for up
      to 24 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes every 12 weeks for up to 24 months
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, and then every 12
      weeks for at least 12 months.
