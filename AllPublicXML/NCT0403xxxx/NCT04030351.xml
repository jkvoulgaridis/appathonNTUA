  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most adults consume acid-producing diets because their high intake of protein and/or cereal
      grains in relation to their intake of fruits and vegetables. This study is being done to
      determine whether acid-base balance can be restored by the addition of dried fruits to the
      diet. In this study adults with low usual fruit intake will be provided with either 100 g per
      day of a mix of dried fruits or no dried fruit. Participants will be followed for 1 year.
      Acid-base status will be assessed by measuring the acid content in 24-hour urine collections.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most adults consume acid-producing diets because their intake of protein and/or cereal grains
      is high in relation to their intake of fruits and vegetables. Supplementation with alkaline
      salts such as potassium bicarbonate and potassium citrate have been shown to reduce 24-hr
      urinary net acid excretion (NAE) in healthy adults. This approach requires taking many
      capsules daily, in split doses after each meal with a full glass of water. An alternative and
      perhaps more acceptable approach to achieving acid-base balance for most adults may be to
      modify their diet by increasing intake of alkali-producing foods, such as fruit. Maintaining
      acid base balance may be important for preserving bone and muscle and renal function and
      other outcomes but this has not been established. The investigators propose to determine
      whether adults who are provided with 100 g per day of a selection of dried fruits will
      actually consume enough of it to correct their acid-producing diets, as evidenced by a
      lowering of their urinary NAE. The investigators will also determine whether and how
      participants will alter their overall diets or their body weight when provided with the dried
      fruit. The comparator group will receive no dried fruit (or other intervention).
