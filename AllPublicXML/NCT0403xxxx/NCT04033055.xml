  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CycloMesh is a polyester visceral implant functionalized by drug delivery systems directly on
      its surface, targeting a unique intervention, a slow anesthetic release and an in situ
      activity. Based on the fact that cyclodextrins are capable of forming inclusion complexes
      with amino-amide anaesthetic agents, ropivacaine and cyclodextrins were combined on a
      commercial visceral mesh.This enables CycloMesh to release ropivacaine for a sustained period
      in order to improve patient's comfort after inguinal hernia surgery.

      The underlying hypothesis of this work is that clinical gain is achieved by adding a drug
      delivery system to visceral mesh for the local and prolonged delivery of ropivacaine. This
      should results in an improvement in quality of life, a reduction in pain and a faster
      returning to work following treatment of inguinal hernia by lichtenstein technique.
