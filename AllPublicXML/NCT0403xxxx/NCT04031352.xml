  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with disabilities can be exposed to stigma and discrimination because of poor
      attitudes. The role of peer is crucial for development of disabled children.

      The aim of the study was to investigate the attitudes of children towards their peers with
      disabilities and to identify factors associated with them.

      1305 elementary school students included to the study. The students participating in the
      study, 48.9% (534) were female, 51.1% (558) were male. The Chedoke-McMaster Attitudes towards
      Children with Handicaps (CATCH) scale was used to investigate the children's attitudes.

    <description>The Chedoke-McMaster Attitudes towards Children with Handicaps Scale The CATCH scale contains 36 items. It is divided into three components. First, the affective component contains 12 items that focus on feelings towards people with disabilities. Second, the cognitive component contains 12 items that focus on beliefs towards people with disabilities. Third, the behavioural component contains 12 items that focus on behaviours towards people with disabilities. The CATCH scale was designed for children aged 9-13 years. The highest possible mean score on the overall scale or in any component is 40. A high score represents a more positive attitude</description>
