      The Imagio® Pivotal Study is intended to evaluate if the results observed in the previous
      Feasibility Study can be confirmed for pre-specified effectiveness endpoints. Using
      Intention-to-Diagnose (ITD) masses from the PIONEER Pivotal study, 480 to 840 masses are to
      be used for the Pivotal Study, the remaining masses will be reserved for training the
      SenoGram® model.

      This will be a controlled, blinded, multi-reader, multi-case (MRMC) study using a sequential
      design. The study will include 15 readers with an additional 5 as back-up readers depending
      on qualifications and availability. Readers that participated in the Seno PIONEER Study
      (NCT01943916) or the Reader-01 Feasibility Study (NCT03708393) are not eligible to
      participate as readers in this Pivotal Study.

      Imagio® [Ultrasound (IUS) + Optoacoustic (OA)] (IUS)(IUS+OA) training will be completed prior
      to any reads taking place. Read 1 will be immediately followed by Read 2 within the same read
      session.
