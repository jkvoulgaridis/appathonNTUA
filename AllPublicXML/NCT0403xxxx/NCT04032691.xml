  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This investigator initiated, pilot study will assess the feasibility of characterizing the
      effects of an orally administered alpha-2 adrenergic (a2a) agonist, clonidine, on the
      clearance rates of Carbon-11 butanol from the ventricular cerebrospinal fluid (vCSF) with
      positron emission tomography (PET) in healthy volunteers.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be an open label pilot study of feasibility in healthy volunteers with no
      therapeutic intent. Vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters, and sleep quality will
      be measured repeatedly during a one week lead-in period. Then, the ventricular cerebrospinal
      fluid (vCSF) clearance rates of [11C]butanol will be measured with PET before and after one
      week of treatment with clonidine, 0.1 mg by mouth daily at bedtime. Safety surveillance will
      be augmented with home health monitoring devices that are wifi and blue tooth enabled.
      Surveillance for adverse events related to drug discontinuation will be monitored for one
      week during a washout period.

      Primary Objective: To assess the logistical feasibility and safety of treating normotensive
      adults with clonidine and monitoring its effects with home health devices. The primary
      outcome measure will be the number of adverse events (AEs) or serious adverse events (SAEs).
      Other measures will include changes in sleep quality, vital signs and ECG parameters, such as
      the PR and corrected QT intervals.

      Secondary Objectives: To estimate drug-induced changes in vCSF clearance rates of butanol
      with PET scans acquired before and after treatment as a function of steady-state plasma
      levels of clonidine.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Able to give informed consent. No vulnerable populations.

          -  Age 18-to-89 years old

          -  Mini-Mental Status Examination of â‰¥ 28

          -  Confirmed by the screening procedures to still be reasonably healthy and, in the
             opinion of the investigators, likely to tolerate the imaging procedures. For example,
             patients with chronic low back pain might not be able to lie still for very long.

          -  Confirmed by the screening procedures to have normal hemodynamic function. Systolic
             blood pressure and pulse must be higher than 120 mmHg and 60 beats per minute (bpm)
             while sitting. At the discretion of the investigators, athletic people who engage in
             vigorous exercise of one hour or more at least four times per week may be enrolled if
             their systolic blood pressure and pulse are higher than 100 mmHg and 50 beats per
             minute while sitting.

          -  Unremarkable electrocardiograms with PR intervals of less than 200 mSec and QT
             interval corrected with Frederica's method (QTcF) of less than 440 mSec.

          -  Willing and able to refrain from abusing any recreational drugs, including marijuana
             because of its sleep effects, and drink less than one unit of alcoholic beverages per
             day starting one week prior to the lead-in period, and avoided for the next three
             weeks while on study (the one week lead-in period, one week on drug period, and one
             week washout period).

          -  Willing to refrain from donating blood during the month of study (because of its
             potential effect of quickening pulse).

          -  Willing to refrain from participating in any other research study that requires taking
             medication during the month of study.

          -  Willing to refrain from being vaccinated during the month of study.

          -  Have not participated in research with exposure to ionizing radiation that would
             result in approaching the exposure limits for healthy volunteers described in the Code
             of Federal Regulations, Title 21 Part 361.1 (21CFR361.1)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of allergy to clonidine.

          -  History of multiple hypersensitivity reactions, as indicated by allergies to multiple
             medications, foods, and seasonal pollens.

          -  History or physical examination suggestive of a condition, disorder, or disease that
             could represent a contra-indication to taking an antihypertensive. The relative
             contraindications to clonidine listed in the package insert under the section on
             precautions will be exclusionary in this study. They include subjects with coronary
             artery insufficiency syndromes, histories of myocardial infarction, cardiac conduction
             abnormalities, cerebrovascular disease, and chronic renal failure.

          -  Women who are pregnant or breast feeding will not be eligible to participate in the
             study, as clonidine is classified as a Class C risk to a fetus. (In fact, there is a
             safety signal in pregnant animal models that justifies exclusion, even if the signal
             is weak.)

          -  History, physical examination or clinical laboratory test result suggestive of a
             condition, disorder, or disease that could affect the adsorption, distribution,
             metabolism or excretion of clonidine, including an alcohol abuse or dependence
             disorder.

          -  Positive urine toxicology screen for drugs other than cannabis.

          -  Subjects may not be a member of a vulnerable population.

          -  May not have donated blood in the 30 days prior to the start of the lead-in period.

          -  May not have participated in research administering drugs in the last 30 days.

          -  May not have been vaccinated in the 30 days prior to the start of the lead-in period.
