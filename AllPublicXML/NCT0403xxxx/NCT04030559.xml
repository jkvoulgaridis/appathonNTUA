    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well niraparib, when given before surgery, works in treating
      patients with high risk prostate cancer that has not spread to other parts of the body
      (localized) and alterations in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair pathways. Niraparib may
      stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the impact of neoadjuvant niraparib tosylate monohydrate (niraparib) therapy
      prior to radical prostatectomy (RP) on pathologic tumor stage, frequency of lymph node
      metastases and positive margin rates for patients undergoing radical prostatectomy for
      high-risk, clinically localized prostate cancer with alterations in DNA repair pathways.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess 5-year biochemical recurrence in subjects with high-risk prostate cancer and
      DNA-damage response defects after prostatectomy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive niraparib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every
      28 days for up to 3 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Following completion of treatment, patients then undergo standard of care surgery.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 3 months for
      2 years, and then every 6 months for up to 3 years.

    <description>The study will assess the impact of neoadjuvant niraparib therapy prior to radical prostatectomy (RP) on pathologic tumor stage, frequency of lymph node metastases and positive margin rates for patients undergoing radical prostatectomy for high-risk, clinically localized prostate cancer with alterations in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair pathways. Pathologic
complete response (PCR) defined as no tumor identified on hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) stained sections will be assessed; minimal residual disease (MRD) will be defined as tumor clusters limited to &lt; 5 mm and confined to prostate gland. Exact 95% confidence intervals for pRR and other binary outcomes will be calculated using the Clopper-Pearson method. Response rates will be compared between patients with biallelic and monoallelic loss using Fisher's Exact Test.</description>
