      Summary from initial protocol Goal: Validation of the HA (hydroxylapatite) coated SLPLUS

      ™ MIA stem within an observation study Study design: prospective, multicenter, observational,
      noncomparative study Study population: 300 consecutive cases (HA-coated implants), 60 cases
      per study site. Intervention (if applicable): Implantation of a total hip endoprosthesis Main
      goals/endpoints: Radiological: radiolucent lines, osteolysis, hypo- and hypertrophy of the
      cortex, loosening of the implant or migration. Clinical: Harris Hip Score, HOOS Score, EQ-5D,
      implant-related complications, revisions Type and extent of the risks associated with the
      study participation as well as benefits for the patient: All patients will benefit from the
      hip prostheses without exception. There are no increased risks for the patients participating
      in the study compared to patients who do not participate. Normal, necessary follow-up exams
      will be performed over the course of 10 years. In addition, study patients are asked to
      provide information on their general state of health and the condition of their hip in two
      questionnaires. These clinical and radiological follow-up exams will then be quantitatively
      evaluated within the scope of the study in accordance with a standardized protocol.
      Accordingly, the direct benefit for the patients from the participation in the study is
      currently not yet foreseeable.

Pain (5 items): during walking, using stairs, in bed, sitting or lying, and standing upright Stiffness (2 items): after first waking and later in the day Physical Function (17 items): using stairs, rising from sitting, standing, bending, walking, getting in / out of a car, shopping, putting on / taking off socks, rising from bed, lying in bed, getting in / out of bath, sitting, getting on / off toilet, heavy domestic duties, light domestic duties</description>
