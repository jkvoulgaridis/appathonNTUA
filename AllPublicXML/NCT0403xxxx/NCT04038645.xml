  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nasal fractures are one of the most incidental of facial traumas. Regression of nasal edema
      is necessary so that surgical reduction of the fracture can be performed. It is known that
      photobiomodulation (PBM) reduces pain, edema and modulates inflammation. Regression of edema
      in a shorter time may decrease hospitalization time, decreasing hospital costs. However,
      there are no well-designed clinical studies on this subject. Therefore, the objective of this
      study will be to evaluate if PBM is able to reduce edema in the region of fractured nasal
      bones prior to nasal reduction and nasal packing, in order to reduce the patient's ability to
      go through surgery. Thirty-six patients diagnosed with a (primary) nasal fracture admitted to
      the Mandaqui Hospital Complex whose trauma occurred in the last 48 hours will be randomly
      divided into: G1- (control) (n = 18). . G2-Light emitter diode (LED) group (n = 18) - The
      standard hospital treatment will be performed + LED nasal mask. The main variable will be the
      edema evaluated by the same researcher and with the same technique. Secondary variables will
      be pain (visual analogue scale - VAS), temperature, rescue medication count, serum C-reactive
      protein and systemic inflammatory cytokines. Afterwards, the LED or its placebo will also be
      applied. The questionnaire to assess the impact of treatment on quality of life will be
      applied at the baseline and after 8 days. Adverse effects will be recorded and reported. If
      the data is normal, they will be submitted to Student's t-test. The data will be presented by
      their means ± standard deviation (SD) and the value of p will be set at 0.05.

      the Mandaqui Hospital Complex whose trauma occurred in the last 48 hours will be randomly
      divided into: G1- (control) (n = 18). The control group will be submitted to the standard
      hospital treatment: standard drug therapy (50mg diclofenac sodium - 5 days, 8 / 8h orally and
      500mg dipyrone - 5 days, 6 / 6h , orally). Tylex 30mg orally will be given as rescue
      medication. In this group there will be simulation of the use of the mask. G2- LED group (n =
      18) - The standard hospital treatment will be performed + LED nasal mask (3 points on each
      side of the nose), λ = 830nm, radiant exposure of 9.7 Joules J / cm2 for 10 minutes.
      Treatment will be performed at patient admission (up to 24 hours after nasal trauma), and at
      intervals explained below, for approximately 08 days after hospital admission. The main
      variable will be the edema evaluated by the same researcher and with the same technique.
      Secondary variables will be pain (visual analogue scale - VAS), temperature, rescue
      medication count, serum C-reactive protein and systemic inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α,
      interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, IL-8 and IL- nasal fossa and saliva. All evaluations will be
      performed at baseline (T0) up to 48 hours after trauma, aiming at equivalence in the
      inflammatory process, (T1) 96h after trauma and (T2) 192h after trauma. Afterwards, the LED
      or its placebo will also be applied. The questionnaire to assess the impact of treatment on
      quality of life will be applied at the baseline and after 8 days. Adverse effects will be
      recorded and reported. If the data is normal, they will be submitted to Student's t-test. The
      data will be presented by their means ± SD and the value of p will be set at 0.05.

    <intervention_model>Parallel Assignment</intervention_model>
    <intervention_model_description>36 patients will be allocated in the experimental and control groups: G1 - Experimental Group (n = 18 Photobiomodulation PBM) - the treatment will be performed in a conventional manner and the patient will receive laser at low intensity.
G2 - Control group (n = 18 -placebo of PBM) - treatment will be performed in a conventional manner and simulation of PBM treatment.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Double (Participant, Investigator)</masking>
    <masking_description>Only the researcher responsible for conducting the treatments (who will open the envelopes of the randomization) will know which treatment is assigned to each patient. The identification of each group will be revealed only after statistical analysis of the data for all those involved in the study by this researcher. Therefore, the researcher responsible for data collection (evaluation of edema and all secondary variables), the microbiologist and the statistician will be blind regarding the treatments assigned to the groups. The patient will also be blinded to the type of treatment performed, since the treatment with PBM will be identical in both groups and the treatment with PBM will be simulated in the control group.</masking_description>

    <description>The patients (n=18) will receive infrared LEDs in 6 points (3 on the right side and 3 on the left side) using a mask developed for the research . The irradiations will be performed with red LED ( wavelength = 660 nm) with output power of 100 milliwatt (mW) . The LED light outputs will be positioned in direct contact with the skin. During application of the LED both patient and operator will wear goggles.
The red diode laser will be used. The power of the device is 100 mW and the wavelength used was 660nm (± 10nm). The diameter of the fiber optic of the apparatus has 600 μm, therefore a spot (area) of 0.002826cm2. The energy delivered per point is 1 Joule. 10 seconds of application is required. As 6 points are irradiated, the total energy delivered is 6 Joules. The energy density is 354 J / cm2 and the power density would be 35.4 W / cm2. The points will be determined by the same operator, obeying the protocol.</description>

    <description>The patients (n=18) will receive the LED at the same points recommended for the experimental group, but will be off. So that the patient does not identify the sound of activation of the device (beep), it will be recorded, and connected at the time of the application of the laser. The questionnaire to assess the impact of treatment on quality of life will be applied at baseline and after 8 days (by the same evaluator), as well as the evaluation of serum CRP.</description>
