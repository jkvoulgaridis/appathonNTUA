    <textblock>
      This study is expected to include 90 patients with major depressive disorder and rheumatoid
      arthritis as study subjects.Randomly divided into 3 groups: drug + VNS stimulation group,
      drug + sham stimulation group and drug group, each group had 30 patients.The treatment period
      of each group was 8 weeks.Age and sex were matched in all three groups.Scale evaluation and
      inflammatory factor test were performed before treatment (baseline), at week 4 and week 8
      after treatment.Head MRI, evoked potential, and electrocardiogram were performed at baseline
      and at the end of week 8.

      1. Drug +VNS stimulation group: both VNS and escitalopram oxalate tablets were treated for
           2 months. VNS stimulation was treated once a day for 30 minutes at the intensity of
           1-2mA. Drug treatment: the dose of escitalopram oxalate tablets was maintained at 10-20
           mg/ day

        2. Drug + sham stimulation group: the patients were treated with escitalopram oxalate
           tablets and sham VNS for 2 months. Sham VNS stimulation: the sham stimulation device
           automatically stops after 30 seconds of stimulation. Drug treatment was the same as the
           above group.

        3. Drug group: the dose of escitalopram oxalate tablets was maintained at 10-20 mg/ day
           without VNS stimulation
