    <textblock>
      This was a 6-month, randomized, single-center, parallel group, double-blinded, clinical
      research study to assess the clinical efficacy of two toothpastes containing stannous
      fluoride (SnHW and CPH) as compared to Regular Fluoride Toothpaste on the reduction of
      established dental plaque and gingivitis in adults.
