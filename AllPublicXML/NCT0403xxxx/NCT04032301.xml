  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Co-occurring post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) is the
      most common response to trauma; it is associated with poor clinical outcomes and substantial
      human disability. Veterans with both PTSD and MDD (PTSD+MDD) have been shown to be at much
      greater suicidal risk than individuals with only one of these disorders. Ketamine given as
      repeated infusions has been shown to be effective in rapidly reducing PTSD and MDD symptoms
      in treatment resistant PTSD+MDD individuals. However, knowledge about the mechanisms
      underlying comorbid PTSD and MDD remain limited. The purpose of this study is to use repeated
      ketamine infusions as a probe to validate a model of PTSD+MDD that focuses on neuroanatomy
      and executive functioning.

      This study is designed to better characterize the neurocognitive and associated functional
      connectivity mechanisms underlying comorbid post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major
      depressive disorder (MDD) among veterans. Participants will be male/female veterans (18 to 75
      years old) of any era or military background who suffer from chronic PTSD and MDD. Potential
      participants will be recruited from mental health clinics and screened for eligibility using
      a two stage process (phone/chart review, followed by interview). Participants with PTSD+MDD
      will undergo a series of baseline assessments including a baseline functional magnetic
      resonance imaging (fMRI) then be randomized to receive either 6 ketamine or 6 normal saline
      infusions on a Monday-Friday schedule over 3 weeks. On the day of infusion, participants will
      be required to stay at the clinical site for 2 hours after the infusion has been given. They
      will also be monitored via a phone call on the following day. After the infusion period has
      been completed participants will undergo a follow-up fMRI then 4 follow-up visits, up to 2
      months. Additional participants will be enrolled in healthy control, depression only, and
      PTSD only groups and will only undergo baseline assessments, including a single fMRI.
