      The study 'Mindfulness and Relaxation interventions in Individual Training Psychotherapies
      for Children and Adolescents' (MARS-CA) aims to examine the effects of short
      session-introducing interventions with mindfulness elements (SIIME) on juvenile patients'
      psychopathological symptomatology and therapeutic alliance at the beginning of the first 24
      therapy sessions.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Short session-introducing interventions with mindfulness elements (SIIME) shall be compared
      with session-introducing relaxation interventions (SIRI) and no session-introducing
      interventions (treatment as usual, (TAU)). Patients between 11 and 19 years and a primary
      diagnosis of hyperkinetic disorder, depressive disorder or anxiety disorder are invited to
      participate. Psychotherapy will be conducted by trainee therapists at a trainee outpatient
      clinic for children and adolescents. It is hypothesized that psychopathological
      symptomatology and therapeutic alliance improve more in the mindfulness condition than in the
      relaxation condition and TAU, and that mindfulness moderates the relationship between
      therapeutic alliance and psychopathological symptomatology stronger than the relaxation
      condition and TAU.

    <measure>Changes in Youth Self-Report 11-18 R (YSR 11-18 R)</measure>
    <time_frame>on first treatment day, after 3 weeks, 10 weeks, 17 weeks, 24 weeks (in each case after a 50 minutes therapy session) and at a 6-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The YSR 11-18 R measures general symptom severity in patients. Eight different subscales are differentiated across 112 items: anxious/depressed, withdrawn/depressed, somatic complaints, social problems, thought problems, attention problems, delinquent behavior, and aggressive behaviors. The three subscales anxious/depressed, withdrawn/depressed and somatic complaints are regarded as internalizing problems while the two subscales delinquent behavior and aggressive behavior are regarded as externalizing behavior. To calculate subscales as well as the total score corresponding items are summed. Items are rated on a 3-point Likert-scale (0 = not true, 1 = somewhat or sometimes true, 2 = very true or often true). Higher scores reflect higher symptom severity. T-scores are used to interpret and compare the results to the corresponding age and gender group.</description>

    <description>The FTB-KJ is a self-report instrument to measure therapeutic alliance. It contains a patient and therapist perspective with 12 items rated on a four-step scale. In addition to the items of the FTB-KJ, a two-item short version of the Therapeutic Presence Inventory will be applied. Furthermore, two items will assess if patients and therapists perceive the session-introducing intervention positively or negatively.</description>

The therapist version contains a list of 10 possible components for the session introduction (e.g. mindfulness intervention, review over the last session) that can be rated from 0 (not correct at all) to 4 (true). Also, therapists are asked to rate 3 statements about how they perceived the session introduction (0=not correct at all to 4= true).</description>

    <description>In all three treatment arms, trainee therapists perform a cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) under conditions of the German health care system. This treatment is not a manualized intervention, but rather based on individualized treatment plans that have been developed together with expert supervisors during a five session diagnostic stage. Treatment duration is 24 sessions, while on average every fourth is supervized by an CBT expert therapist.</description>
