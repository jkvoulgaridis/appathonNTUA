      Comparison of water-perfused (WP) and air-charged (AC) catheters for invasive urodynamic
      investigation (UDI) regarding consistency, features and artifacts.

      UDI is the gold standard to assess refractory lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), i.e. to
      detect and specify lower urinary tract dysfunction (LUTD). Therefore, UDI findings lead to
      diagnosis and decision-making for further non-invasive and invasive therapies. For UDI
      pressure recordings, the use of WP catheters is recommended by the International Continence
      Society (ICS).

      Currently AC catheters have been marked for pressure recording as an alternative to WP
      catheters. However, the number of comparative studies is very limited. Nevertheless, since
      release, AC catheters have gained popularity due to their omnidirectional detection of
      pressure, and claimed reduction in movement artefacts (due to weight-less air column vs
      weighted water column), lack of external reference level, and ease of set-up/use. Still,
      there is debate whether AC catheters are an acceptable alternative to fluid-filled lines for
      measuring intravesical and intra-abdominal pressure in UDI. Based on the available
      literature, an appropriate conclusion, whether both systems can be used as equivalents and
      interchangeably, cannot be drawn.

      In this study, the investigators compare both systems regarding consistency, features and
      artifacts.
