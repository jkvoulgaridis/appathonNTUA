  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Uterine fibroids are the most common benign tumors of the genital organs of women of
      childbearing age. Literature data show that more than 75% of women have fibroids.Symptomatic
      fibroids account for approximately over 200,000 hysterectomies and 50,000 myomectomies
      annually in the United States. Fibroids have a major impact on fertility, with significant
      adverse effect on implantation rate and spontaneous abortion rates when compared with
      infertile women without fibroids. The definitive treatment for uterine fibroids in a fertile
      patient is surgical excision. Although usually effective, myomectomy is not a risk-free
      operation, since the surgical procedure can cause mechanical infertility and can be
      associated with infection, injury to adjacent tissues, hemorrhage and need to convert to
      hysterectomy. A not often mentioned consequence of myomectomy is post-operative intrauterine
      adhesion formation. It has been reported that 50% of women undergoing open myomectomy are
      found to have intrauterine adhesions diagnosed by hysteroscopy performed 3 months after
      surgery. Such a high prevalence of intrauterine adhesions after open myomectomy is
      unexpected, however only few studies have addressed this topic.

      It is accepted that injury to the endometrium is generally considered to be the primary
      causative factor for the development of intrauterine adhesions. The reason for such a high
      incidence of intrauterine adhesions after open myomectomy is unclear. It is speculated that
      infection or in adverted closure of the uterine cavity may play a role in intrauterine
      adhesion formation. The relationship between the number of fibroids removed and the risk of
      adhesions suggests a traumatic etiology. In the preservation of the uterus for the purpose of
      fertility, it is essential to also understand the impact of myomectomy on the endometrium.
      Currently no guideline recommends in office hysteroscopy as follow-up after myomectomy. The
      purpose of the present study is to evaluate the frequency of uterine adhesions following
      myomectomy and the impact of number, size and location of the fibroids as well as
      intraoperative breach of the endometrial cavity at the time of the myomectomy.
