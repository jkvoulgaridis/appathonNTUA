  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to test a low-cost, simple vitamin C supplementation intervention, that is,
      comparing placebo to 500 mg/day vitamin C and 1 gram/day vitamin C daily to assess
      feasibility and acceptability of vitamin C supplementation and effects on serum vitamin C
      level, health-related quality of life (HRQOL), symptom burden, oxidative stress, and cardiac
      function.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will address feasibility from the perspective of being able to: a) to detect
      significant differences in the serum vitamin C level after supplementation (3 months) between
      the intervention groups and the control group, b) to detect significant differences in health
      related quality of life (HRQOL), symptom burden, oxidative stress, and cardiac function after
      vitamin C supplementation (3 months) between the intervention groups and the control group.

    <description>Health related quality of life is measured using the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure questionnaire (MLHFQ). The Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ) is a patient-reported outcome to measure the patient's perceptions of the influence of heart failure on physical and emotional aspects of life. The questionnaire has 21 items to assess the impact of frequent physical symptoms of heart failure and the effects of heart failure on physical and emotional functions. The response scale for all 21 items on the MLHFQ is based on a 6-point (from 0 to 5). Scores are summed to a range of 0-105, in which with higher scores indicating worse health related quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Change in MSAS-HF Scores from Baseline to Month 3</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 3</time_frame>
    <description>Symptom burden is measured using items from the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scaleâ€”Heart Failure (MSAS-HF). The MSAS-HF is an 8-item questionnaire to measure HF symptoms experienced by patients with HF. Patients will be first asked if the symptom was present during the previous 7 days. If present, three characteristics of each symptom will be rated: frequency of symptom, severity of symptom, and degree of symptom distress. Frequency is rated on a scale from 1 to 4 (1=rarely to 4=almost constantly), severity rated on a scale from 1 to 4 (1=mild to 4=very severe) and distress rated on a scale from 0 to 4 (0=not at all to 4=very severe). Burden score for each symptom can range from 0 (no burden) to 12 (greatest symptom frequency, severity, and distress). Total burden scores range from 0 to 32 with higher scores indicating higher symptom burden.</description>
