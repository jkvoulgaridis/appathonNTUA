    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of high fiber multigrain
      supplementation on the level of clinical disease severity measures, blood inflammatory
      molecules, and nutritional status changes in RA patients.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory, autoimmune rheumatic disease, resulting
      in progressive joint inflammation and destruction. At present, there is no known cure for
      this disease. As a consequence of the potential side effects, many RA patients turn to other
      alternative remedies such as specialised diets and/or dietary supplements in a bid to relieve
      their symptoms. Therefore, the current study aims to examine the effectiveness of high fiber
      multigrain supplementation on the level of clinical disease severity measures, blood
      inflammatory molecules, together with the nutritional status changes in RA patients, as
      compare with conventional drug treatments.

    <measure>Disease Activity Score-28 (DAS-28)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The DAS-28 is a system developed and validated by the EULAR (European League Against Rheumatism) to measure the progress and improvement of Rheumatoid Arthritis. DAS-28 values range from 2.0 to 10.0, while higher values mean a higher disease activity. The complex mathematical calculation is calculated by incorporating the value of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and Visual Analog Scale (VAS). ESR (mm/hr) determines the severity of inflammatory response and monitor the effect of treatment. VAS is an indicator for pain intensity and patient global health, and the following cut points have been recommended: no pain (0-4 mm), mild pain (5-44 mm), moderate pain (45-74 mm), and severe pain (75- 100 mm).
DAS-28 = 0.56 * sqrt(tender28) + 0.28 * sqrt(swollen28) + 0.70 * ln(ESR) + 0.014 * GH
The scale categorises RA manifestations as mild (DAS-28: &lt;3.2), moderate (DAS-28: 3.2-5.1) or severe (DAS-28: &gt;5.1)</description>
