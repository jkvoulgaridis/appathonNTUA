  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 non-randomized, open-label, parallel cohort study of PF-06651600 in
      subjects with severe renal impairment and subjects without renal impairment (Part 1) and in
      subjects with mild and moderate renal impairment (Part 2).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 non-randomized, open-label, parallel cohort, multi-site study to
      investigate the effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability
      of PF-06651600 after multiple oral doses of 50 mg daily. Subjects will be selected and
      categorized into normal renal function or renal impairment groups based on their estimated
      glomerular filtration rate. Part 1: A total of approximately 16 subjects will be enrolled;
      approximately 8 subjects with severe renal impairment and approximately 8 with normal renal
      function. After statistical evaluation of results from Part 1, Part 2 may be conducted with
      approximately 8 subjects each with moderate and mild renal impairment. The total duration of
      participation from Screening visit to Day 11 will be a maximum of 39 days and from Screening
      visit to Follow-up/Contact Visit will a maximum of 73 days.
