  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cross-sectional diagnostic accuracy study with 2,000 patient participants and 15 health
      worker participants. The participant population will be recruited at clinics and through a
      household survey using an enriched sample of a population with known G6PD status, established
      through previous epidemiological studies. The health worker participants will include trained
      intended users of the G6PD tests. Health workers will take capillary blood samples and
      conduct two point of care tests: 1) hemoglobin test, and 2) investigational point-of-care
      (POC) G6PD test. A thick blood slide will also be prepared for malaria microscopy. Venous
      blood will be collected and transferred to a laboratory where reference assays will be
      performed on venous samples using the Pointe Scientific G6PD Analyzer and hemoglobin tests.
      Trained health workers will also be surveyed to assess product usability through a
      questionnaire to assess label and packing comprehension as well as results interpretation.

      Primary Objective: To assess the accuracy and reliability of G6PD tests in detecting G6PD
      activity and classifying results when used by trained health care workers in Brazil.

      Component Objectives:

        -  To determine the performance of G6PD tests in detecting G6PD activity and hemoglobin
           (Hb) compared to a reference assay

        -  To assess the comprehension of the G6PD test packaging and labelling among intended
           users

        -  To assess the usability of G6PD test result outputs among intended users

    <description>The STANDARD G6PD Analyzer is designed to measure the quantitative determination of total-hemoglobin concentration and G6PD enzymatic activity in fresh human whole blood specimen based on reflectometry assays. The test is intended to aid in the identification of people with G6PD deficiency. The test is currently not licensed for use in Brazil and is considered an investigational product. PATH has conducted some initial laboratory evaluations which suggest that the test aligns to performance specifications outlined in the target product profile. The test has CE mark and is registered for use in South Korea, India, and Thailand.</description>
