      This is an unblinded, randomized clinical study comparing the efficacy of DNA damaging
      chemotherapy using carboplatin, to standard of care chemotherapy for patients who have
      metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer. This trial will use docetaxel or carboplatin
      as initial chemotherapy with crossover to the alternate or second-line drug after first
      progression for patients with tumors containing BRCA1, BRCA2 or PALB2 inactivating DNA
      mutations.

      Participants are randomized (1:1) and receive either carboplatin (AUC 5) first or docetaxel
      (75 mg/m2) every 21 days until intolerance, complete response, or progression by Prostate
      Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG3) criteria or 10 cycles (whichever is first).

      Participants then crossover from the first-line therapy to the second-line therapy with the
      opposite study medication and receive treatment to intolerance or progression or 10 cycles
      (whichever is first). Enrolled participants will be allowed to crossover to second line
      therapy if they continue to meet initial eligibility criteria, and at least three weeks have
      elapsed since last administration of either carboplatin or docetaxel. Throughout the study,
      safety and tolerability will be assessed. Progression will be evaluated with bone scan, CT of
      the abdomen/pelvis, or MRI and PSA as per PCWG3 criteria.

      BRACeD Study General Trial Over-view

      Research shows that when some changes or mutations occur in the DNA involved with repairing
      genes, the risk of cancer increases. Patients who have certain kinds of mutations in their
      DNA-repair genes have responded well to drugs which damage DNA but are not part of standard
      therapy for prostate cancer, this study is designed to help better understand treatment
      options for these patients.

      Treatment with a drug called docetaxel is one of the standard chemotherapy treatments for men
      with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Carboplatin is a DNA damaging
      chemotherapy treatment which is used for treatment of cancer, but is not commonly used for
      the treatment of prostate cancer. In early studies, the use of carboplatin has shown very
      promising activity in treatment of prostate cancer. This study is being conducted to evaluate
      patient response to treatment with docetaxel compared to carboplatin.

      Patients wishing to participate in this study are screened for safety and health eligibility
      before enrolling.

      This study is enrolling 40 male participants total, from across the VAMC nationally who have
      the following:

        -  Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC)

        -  Cancer that has gotten worse, after any number of first-line treatments

        -  Mutations in DNA-repair genes discovered as part of a patient's routine care.

      Once eligibility is determined, enrolled participants are randomized into one of two groups:

        -  Group A will start with carboplatin first, given every 21 days for up to 10 cycles, then
           have the option to switch to the second treatment with docetaxel every 21 days.

        -  Group B will start with docetaxel first, given every 21 days for up to 10 cycles, then
           have the option to switch to the second treatment with carboplatin every 21 days.

      Both study drugs in this trial are currently FDA approved, and are given intravenously (IV)
      at the participating VAMC clinical sites per institutional guidelines.

      Participants are monitored for health and body function, cancer progression, toxicity and
      life quality at every visit during the trial and at an end of treatment visit (28 days after
      completion of the trial or after withdrawal). For participants who respond well to treatment
      during the trial, additional treatment cycles may be added and the study can be extended.
      Participants who experience intolerable toxicity, cancer progression, or whose doctors decide
      to change treatment, will either be switched to the opposite study drug or withdrawn from the
      study.

      This important trial is designed to compare response rate and duration of response using
      carboplatin compared to docetaxel in patients who have mCRPC which contains DNA repair gene
      mutations.
