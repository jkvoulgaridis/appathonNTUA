      This randomized study will evaluate the effect of a brief acupuncture therapy in addition to
      a brief cognitive behavioral therapy in mitigating sleep disturbances in post-deployment
      military service members using reliable and valid measures.

      Introduction: Sleep disturbance is a hallmark symptom of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
      and an important antecedent in PTSD recovery in service members who were deployed to
      Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom. Sleep disturbances (SDs) are
      important maintainers of PTSD symptoms in service members. Yet, they remain resistant to
      treatment for many service members. To mitigate the consequences of allostatic load,
      researchers have investigated the effects of acupuncture as a promising intervention.

      Objectives/Aims: The overall goal of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and
      perceived benefits of a manual standardized acupuncture (MSSA) as an adjunct therapy to an
      abbreviated cognitive behavioral therapy (ACBT) in the treatment of SDs in post-deployment
      military service members. Specific aims include the following: a) To evaluate the
      effectiveness of MSSA as an adjunct treatment with ACBT, as compared to ACBT alone, for SDs
      using the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) in
      post-deployment military service members, b) To describe the perceived benefit of MSSA as an
      adjunct treatment with ACBT, as compared with ACBT alone, for SDs using journal log entries
      in post-deployment military service members, and c) To explore the influence of participant
      expectation on the effectiveness of acupuncture on SDs using the Acupuncture Expectancy Scale
      (AES) in post-deployment military service members in the experimental group.

      Methods and Analysis: This is a two-arm, single-center randomized controlled trial in U.S.
      Naval Hospital, Okinawa, Japan. A random assignment process will be conducted by the primary
      investigator using permutated block randomization. Service members who meet the study
      selection criteria and decide to participate will be randomly assigned to either the
      experimental or control group: 1) Experimental: MSSA and ACBT, or 2) Control: ACBT only and
      waitlist for acupuncture. Patient-reported questionnaires including ISI, PSQI, and AES will
      be administered at baseline and then at the completion of the study. Descriptive statistics,
      reliable change indices, and mixed effects generalized linear models that correct standard
      errors for repeated assessments will be used to test for the interactive effect of
      acupuncture treatment and time in the study on each outcome controlling for respective
      baseline values.

      Military Relevance: Given the role of sleep disturbances in posttraumatic stress disorder in
      the military, intervening early before service members become at risk for severe injuries,
      hospitalizations, and chronic disability could help decrease burdensome problems.

    <description>The ISI is a seven-item standardized self-report questionnaire that measures the subjective symptoms of SDs (C. Morin et al., 2011). These subjective symptoms include the respondents' concerns and distress as a result of problems with sleep. The ISI measure contains seven items including perceived difficulty with sleep-onset, sleep maintenance, and early morning awakenings; satisfaction with sleep patterns; interference of sleep problems with daily functioning; impairment as a result of a sleep problem; and degree of distress or concern with the sleep problem (Bastien, Vallieres, &amp; Morin, 2001). Each item in the ISI is rated from 0 to 4 whereby the higher number indicates more difficulty. The scores are added to yield a range of total scores from 0 to 28 in which a higher score suggests more severe SDs. This scale has good reliability and validity psychometrics and is widely used in research: Cronbach's alpha (0.91), sensitivity (78.1%), specificity (100.0%)(C. M. Morin, 2017).</description>

    <description>The PSQI is a 19-item questionnaire that includes seven areas of sleep quality and patterns in adults over the last month including the following components: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, SDs, use of sleeping medications, and daytime dysfunction (Buysse et al., 1988). Each item in the scale is scored from 0 to 3 scale (0 = no difficulty; 3 = severe difficulty). The scores are added to yield a global score ranging from 0 to 21 (0 = no difficulty; 21 = severe difficulties in all areas). This scale has good reliability and validity psychometrics and is widely used in research: Cronbach's alpha (0.77 to 0.83), sensitivity (89.6%), specificity (86.5%)(Buysse et al., 1988).</description>

    <description>Acupuncture Expectancy Scale (AES): The AES is a 4-item questionnaire that measures the participants' expected responses to acupuncture. Participants' expected improvement from acupuncture is rated in a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from not at all agree to completely agree (Mao et al., 2010). The total possible scores for AES range from 4 to 20, with higher scores indicating greater expectancy. In an initial validation, the instrument's Cronbach's alpha is .82 (Mao et al., 2007). The AES has been found to be reliable, valid, and has acceptable sensitivity to change during treatment starting at week 4 of treatment with increasing statistically significant changes with more acupuncture treatments (Mao et al., 2010).</description>

    <description>The PCL-5 is a 20-item scale that examines the degree of how an individual has been bothered by symptoms associated with a distressing event (Wortmann et al., 2016). Each item is rated from 0 (not at all bothered) to 4 (extremely bothered). Scores are summed to yield a severity score. Permissions to use the PCL-5 are not required (Keane, 1989; Weathers et al., 2013). The PCL-5 scale has good reliability and validity psychometrics (i.e., Cronbach's alpha = 0.75 to 0.95; r = 0.92 to 0.94) (Wortmann et al., 2016) and is widely used in both clinical and research settings.</description>
