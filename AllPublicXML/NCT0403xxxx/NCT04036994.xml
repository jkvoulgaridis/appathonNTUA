  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy (CT) remains an important treatment modality for breast cancer patients.
      Unfortunately, this systemic treatment comes with many quality of life impairing
      complications. Chemotherapy-induced alopecia (CIA) occurs in about 65% of the patients. Hair
      loss due to CT is reversible, but hair regrowth requires several months to a year after CT.
      Currently, the only available preventive measure is based on scalp cooling. Nevertheless,
      this treatment has a highly variable success rate and it brings along several side effects.
      Photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) is a new, preventive and therapeutic technique in the
      supportive care of cancer patients. It uses visible and (near)- infrared light produced by
      laser diodes or light emitting diodes (LED) at a low power to stimulate tissue repair and
      reduce inflammation and pain. The investigator's research team demonstrated already that PBMT
      can prevent oral mucositis and acute radiodermatitis. The aim of this project is to explore
      the use of PBMT in the management of CIA. Results of this project will lead to an improvement
      of the patients' quality of life after CT.
