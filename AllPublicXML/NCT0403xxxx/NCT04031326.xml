  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates feasibility and efficacy of adding the LENA Home program to the standard
      Every Child Succeeds (ECS) home visiting curriculum. Half of the participants will receive
      the standard ECS curriculum during normally scheduled home visits, while the other half will
      receive this plus LENA Home.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Every Child Succeeds is a program that uses home visiting as a preventive strategy to support
      low income families in providing stimulating, safe, and nurturing environments for their
      young children. Most families in home visiting have experienced adversity in their lives, and
      had inadequate parenting role models as they grew up. Home visitors visit families during
      pregnancy through the child reaching three years of age, providing information, teaching, and
      resources to help parents provide the best possible start for their children.

      LENA Home is a 13-week curriculum designed to add an early-language focus to existing home
      visiting or parent education programs for children ages birth to three. It employs LENA
      wearable audio recorder technology and targeted content to help parents and other caregivers
      increase interactive talk. There are 13 weekly one-on-one sessions, including modules on
      parent-child reading and increasing verbal interaction during typical home activities.
      Sessions include videos, practical techniques, and feedback from LENA recordings via
      intuitive reports to help parents talk more with their children. LENA Home reports provide
      data on adult words spoken to the child (AWC) and conversational turns (CTC). LENA Home has
      been shown to increase interactive talk and child language ability and informs parents how
      much they are talking with their children in an objective way.

      Upon completion of the study, we will have more information regarding whether (1) LENA Home
      can be successfully integrated into existing home visiting programs (feasibility), (2)
      children exposed to LENA have larger vocabularies than those who do not receive the
      intervention, (3) mothers using LENA engage in more literacy-promoting behaviors relative to
      controls, and (4) LENA improves parent-child interactions (utility).

    <description>The LENA Home recording device measures Absolute Word Count (AWC) over an approximately 13-hour recording period at each recording. This outcome will involve change in AWC between baseline and a Midpoint assessment (approximately 6-7 weeks) and Endpoint (13-weeks).</description>

    <measure>Change in DialogPR-I/T (shared reading quality) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Endpoint (13 weeks).</time_frame>
    <description>Dialog PR-I/T is a 10-item measure of shared reading quality (interactivity) for infants and toddlers developed by the PI that is derived from the validated DialogPR measure for older children. It involves evidence-based behaviors such as lap sitting, use of child-directed speech, and verbal responsivity. Range is 0-30, higher score suggests more interactive, nurturing reading.</description>

    <measure>Change in ScreenQ-I/T (screen-based media use)</measure>
    <time_frame>Difference in score between Baseline and Endpoint (13 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>ScreenQ-I/T is a 10-item composite measure of screen-based media use in the home referenced to current AAP guidelines for infants and toddlers, developed by the PI that is based on the validated ScreenQ measure for older children. Range is 0-23 points, higher scores suggest greater use contrary to AAP guidelines and greater developmental/health risk.</description>

    <measure>Change in StimQ-I (home cognitive environment)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Endpoint (13 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The StimQ-I is a validated assessment of parent report measure of cognitive stimulation in the home for children up to 18-months old involving 4 subscales: availability of learning materials, parental involvement in developmental advance, parental verbal responsivity, and reading. Higher scores suggest more stimulating parental behaviors.</description>
