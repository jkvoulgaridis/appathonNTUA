  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2a, nonrandomized, open-label, parallel assignment, single-dose,
      dose-escalation, and dose-expansion study to evaluate the safety and clinical activity of
      PBCAR20A in adult study participants with r/r B-cell NHL (Cohort A) or r/r CLL/SLL (Cohort
      B).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, nonrandomized, open-label, parallel assignment, single-dose,
      dose-escalation, and dose-expansion study to evaluate the safety and tolerability, find an
      appropriate dose to optimize safety and efficacy, and evaluate clinical activity of PBCAR20A
      in subjects with relapsed/refractory (r/r) Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) or r/r Chronic
      Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) or Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (SLL). Before initiating PBCAR20A,
      subjects will be administered lymphodepletion chemotherapy composed of fludarabine and
      cyclophosphamide. At Day 0 of the Treatment Period, subjects will receive a single
      intravenous (IV) infusion of PBCAR20A. All subjects are monitored during the treatment period
      through Day 28. All subjects who receive a dose of PBCAR20A will be followed in a separate
      long-term follow-up (LTFU) study for 15 years after exiting this study.

    <intervention_model_description>Part 1: In each cohort, B-cell NHL (Cohort A) or r/r CLL/SLL (Cohort B), 3 escalating dose groups will be enrolled and treated sequentially, with the possibility of a single de-escalation. Within each dose group, at least 3 and at most 6 study participants will be treated with a single dose of PBCAR20A using a standard 3 + 3 design. The starting dose of PBCAR20A will be 3 × 10^5 CAR T cells/kg body weight. Subsequent dose groups will be treated with escalating doses to a maximum dose of 3 × 10^6 CAR T cells/kg. In the absence of DLTs (as described in Section 3.7), the dose will be increased using a fixed-dose scheme.
Part 2: Upon the determination of the MTDs for Cohorts A and B, these respective doses will be used in the dose-expansion part, in which additional study participants will be enrolled and treated. Study participants in the expanded cohorts will be treated with a single dose of PBCAR20A.</intervention_model_description>
