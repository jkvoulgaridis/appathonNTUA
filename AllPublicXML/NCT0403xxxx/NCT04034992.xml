      DISCOVER CKD is an international observational cohort study in patients with CKD, comprising
      both prospective and retrospective patient cohorts. The study does not attempt to test any
      specific a priori hypotheses, is largely descriptive, and collects data only under conditions
      of routine clinical care.

      DISCOVER CKD is an international observational cohort study in CKD patients, comprising both
      prospective and retrospective patient cohorts. The study does not attempt to test any
      specific a priori hypotheses, is largely descriptive, and collects data only under conditions
      of routine clinical care. No additional invasive clinical tests or procedures are mandated
      per study protocol, and all data collected is based solely on observations of disease
      management and treatment decisions made between the treating physicians and their patients,
      and is not intended to be interventional in anyway. Patients will not receive any
      experimental intervention or experimental treatment as a result of participating in this
      study. Analyses will be conducted separately for prospective and retrospective CKD cohorts
      (via interim reports), and then in aggregate by combining prospective and retrospective data,
      to the extent possible, at the end of the study.

    <description>Prospective data refers to collection of data in a de novo manner for the purpose of addressing study objectives. Collection of patient data in the prospective cohort will be done via electronic case report form, questionnaires, and mobile phone/web-based technology. The initial aim is to identify and collect data from a minimum of 1000 (no set maximum) CKD patients enrolled over a period of 2 years, with the possibility of prospective follow-up for a minimum of 1 year. The patient specific data in the prospective cohort will be collected by utilizing Rapid Assessment of Physical Activity (RAPA) questionnaire, Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI) questionnaire, Short Form (SF)-36 questionnaires, simple food diary, and other patient reported outcomes - including a set of questions to collect patient symptoms.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Retrospective CKD cohort</arm_group_label>
    <description>Retrospective data refers to patient data extracted from existing electronic health records (EHRs)/registries/databases. It represents existing real-world data, regardless of reason for collection or location of storage and is analogous to those represented in the study protocol for which feasibility assessments are conducted. Retrospective data will be collected from registries, databases, and EHRs. The aim is to identify and extract clinical data retrospectively from a minimum of 100000 (no set maximum) CKD patients via existing databases/registries/EHRs across geographies. The retrospective data will be captured beginning 1 January 2008 through the most currently available data.</description>

        For prospective data collection, all individuals with CKD fulfilling the inclusion criteria
        but none of the exclusion criteria will be considered; attempts will be made to enrich the
        data collection of patient samples by ensuring sufficient numbers of each CKD stage with
        comorbidities including diabetes mellitus, heart failure, coronary artery disease, etc.

        For retrospective data collection, all individuals with CKD fulfilling the inclusion
        criteria and who have at least 1-year of medical history (within the selected registry,
        EHR, or database) prior to baseline (index) date will be considered.

          2. First documented diagnostic code (eg, International Classification of Diseases-10) of
             CKD (Stages 3A, 3B, 4, 5, or end stage renal disease) or two measures of eGFR of
             &lt;75mL/min/1.73 m2 recorded at least 90 days apart on or after 1 January 2008, or a
             code for chronic Renal replacement therapy (hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis),
             whichever comes first.

          3. Provision of written informed consent - specific for prospective data capture.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Concurrent participation in any interventional trial at baseline (index) (prospective
             only). To be implemented based on local regulatory requirements.

          2. The patient is undergoing treatment for active cancer, except for non-melanoma skin
             cancer.
