      The overall objective of this research is to test the effectiveness of a parenting program on
      Filipino parents living in Southern California. The sample will include 180 Filipino
      immigrant families, half of which will receive the Incredible Years® School Age Basic Parent
      Training Program (intervention) and the other half will receive the American Academy of
      Pediatrics' Bright Futures handouts (control).

      The overall objective of the proposed research is to test the effectiveness of a parenting
      program (Incredible Years® School Age Basic Parent Training Program, IYP) on Filipino parents
      recruited from multiple community-based settings and its impact on trajectories of parenting
      practices, parenting stress, and child problem behavior.

      Evidence-based parenting interventions provided in early childhood have proven to be
      effective in preventing the onset and escalation of child mental health disorders. IYP is one
      of the best-studied and most highly regarded parent training programs. As a result of pilot
      studies funded by a NIH K23 and a NCATS KL2 award, the investigators have identified IYP as a
      community-identified solution for preventing behavioral health disparities, demonstrated IYP
      efficacy in improving parenting practices and parenting stress in Filipino parents, and child
      problem behavior.

      This population was chosen because: 1) Filipinos are the second largest immigrant population
      in the U.S. with the highest concentration living in Los Angeles; 2) Filipinos are exposed to
      multiple adversities, including immigration stress and relocation, loss of social status, and
      lower self-esteem due to discrimination, placing young children at risk for future behavioral
      and mental health problems; 3) U.S.-born Filipino youth exhibit higher rates of mental health
      problems than non-Hispanic whites and attain significantly lower levels of education than
      their foreign-born counterparts and other U.S.-born Asian American populations; and 4)
      Filipinos are less likely than non-Hispanic whites to participate in mental health and
      preventive care interventions.

      The proposed study will be a randomized controlled trial involving 180 parents of children
      aged 8-12 years old. Parents will be randomly chosen to receive either a) a 12 - week
      parenting intervention called the Incredible Years (intervention group) or b) AAP bright
      future handouts with general parenting advice (control group). Due to limited funding, the
      investigators are unable to offer the Incredible Years intervention to the control group.
      Additionally, the parent's child and child's teacher will be surveyed to increase the
      validity of outcome data.

      Findings will contribute to the scientific literature on preventive and early intervention
      programs for children at high risk for future behavioral problems. The data will also provide
      important information to understand the processes underlying how IYP affects parenting
      practices and subsequent child problem behavior among Filipino families. The importance of
      this research rests on its potential to prevent behavioral health disparities in this
      understudied and high-risk population.

    <description>Child problem behavior will be measured using scores from Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Parents describe their child's behavior within the past 6 months (from baseline and from 3 month time points). Questions are rated on a scale from 0 (not true) to 2 (very true or often true). The CBCL screens for the following behaviors: Aggressive Behavior, Anxious/Depressed, Attention Problems, Rule-Breaking Behavior, Somatic Complaints, Social Problems, Thought Problems, Withdrawn/Depressed. Results for each subscale are presented as a percentile and T-score, with scores above 97th percentile considered as &quot;clinical range&quot; based on the DSM-V.</description>

    <description>The Incredible Years® School Age Basic Parent Training Program targets many of the proposed mechanisms and risk factors for internalizing distress in early childhood: harsh and unpredictable or critical parenting behaviors. Parents also learn cognitive strategies for themselves; such as self-praise, coping thoughts, how to challenge negative thoughts, and how to get support that they are encouraged to model for and teach their children. Finally, they learn how to be more positive and nurturing through academic, social and emotional coaching.</description>
