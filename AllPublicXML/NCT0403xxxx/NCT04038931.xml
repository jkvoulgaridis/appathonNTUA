  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, liver samples will be collected, processed and stored in a specialized,
      clinical grade, cell bank for potential future clinical use. A set of ex-vivo immunogenicity
      and transdiffrentiation tests will be carried to confirm the ability of this cryopreserved
      cell batch to be used as clinical grade raw material. Biopsies will be collected during TP or
      PP with the assumption that some of the patients (especially PP patients will not go through
      Islets autotransplantation) will develop brittle diabetes, thus Orgenesis therapy can provide
      them in the long run, a treatment. In terms of T1DM the purpose is to have available clinical
      grade raw material for cell replacement therapy.

      The collected liver samples will be proliferated (up to passage 4) for future use. A portion
      of the stored cells will be utilized in a small-scale process to test possible immunogenicity
      performed on the collected blood sample. The assay will provide data whether immunomodulation
      treatment will be required in the future clinical trials. Also the transdffrentiated cells
      (AIPs) will be tested according to release criteria relevant for clinical IPC production.
      Liver biopsy donors will be contacted upon approval of the consecutive study and will have
      study recruitment priority. The donors can refuse to participate in the future study or may
      not need the therapy, however, their biopsies will be stored for a potential use if required,
      after the therapy is approved.
