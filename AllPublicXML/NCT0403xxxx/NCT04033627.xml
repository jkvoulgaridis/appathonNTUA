  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center clinical study in China using CliniMACS TCRα/β+ and CD45RA+ T cell
      depleted stem cell grafts from haploidentical donors for hematopoietic stem cell
      transplantation in children.

    <textblock>
      This clinical study will the CliniMACS TCRα/β and CD45RA Systems to deplete TCRα/β+ and
      CD45RA+ cells from the mobilized peripheral blood stem cells of a haploidentical donors to
      treat pediatric patients who were suffuring form relapsed or refactory leukemia.

      Aming to evaluate the safety/tolerability and feasibility of haploidentical PBSC grafts
      depleted of TCRα/β+ and CD45RA+ cells using the CliniMACS TCRαβ/CD45RA System in pediatric
      patients with hematological malignancies diseases. And the incidence of grade II-IV acute
      graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) until Day 100 post-transplantation of this new In Vitro T
      cell depletion technology in China.

      The investigators will monitor the incidence of grade I acute GVHD until Day 100
      post-transplantation, incidence and severity of chronic GVHD after 1 year and 2 years,
      incidence of NRM at all visits throughout the study, and graft failure from Day 0 to Day 28
      at the same time.
