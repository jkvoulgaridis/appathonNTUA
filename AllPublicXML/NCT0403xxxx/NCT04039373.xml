        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy participant, defined as having no clinically significant active or ongoing
             medical condition, physical examination abnormality, abnormal ECG finding, with no
             current use of tobacco

          -  A negative QuantiFERON-TB Gold® test result at screening or documentation of a
             negative result within 3 months of the screening visit and a weight ≥ 50 kg and BMI
             between 18.0 and 32.0 kg/m2 inclusive at screening.

          -  Participants must not be current users (within 6 months before screening) of tobacco
             or tobacco- or nicotine-containing products; they must also be willing to refrain from
             using any of these products during their participation in the study.

          -  Men who are sexually active with women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must agree to
             follow instructions for method(s) of contraception (APPENDIX 4) for the duration of
             treatment with BMS-986256 or MMF, plus 5 half-lives of BMS-986256 (19 days) plus an
             additional 90 days (duration of sperm turnover) for a total of 109 days post
             treatment. In addition, participants must be willing to refrain from sperm donation
             during this time.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any significant acute or chronic medical illness or condition, in the opinion of the
             investigator in addition to prior exposure to BMS-986256

          -  Major surgery within 4 weeks before study treatment administration, drug abuse or drug
             addiction.

          -  Participants who have smoked or used smoking cessation or other nicotine-containing
             products within 6 months before the first dose of study drug.

          -  History or presence of malignancy including hematological malignancies.
             However,participants with a history of basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the
             skin that has been completely and successfully treated with no evidence of recurrence
             may not be excluded, at the discretion of the investigator.
