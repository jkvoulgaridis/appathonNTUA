  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical activity has been used for a number of years in the treatment of fibromyalgia (FM).
      The main objective of this study is to compare the effects of physical activity on two groups
      of women diagnosed with fibromyalgia (FM) in terms of pain, quality of life and the impact of
      the condition on their daily lives. Methods: this was a randomized clinical trial to assess
      the effects of physical activity performed by subjects assigned to one of two groups on the
      scores of three questionnaires (the pain Visual Analogue Scale, the FIQ questionnaire and the
      SF-36 health questionnaire) administered before and after the intervention.

    <description>The intervention group: engaged in a therapeutic physical activity program involving low-intensity exercise, strength and balance work for 2 days a week over a 12-week period, with each session lasting 90 minutes. Both the intervention group and the control group separately completed the various baseline surveys which were part of the study. Once the intervention was over, they answered them again, also separately.
The classes were led by an experienced physiotherapist who followed the physical exercise guidelines established by the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM), although the intensity of the exercises was adapted to the participants' tolerance levels</description>
