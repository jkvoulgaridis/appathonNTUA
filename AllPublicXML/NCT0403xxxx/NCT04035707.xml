  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rocuronium is a aminosteroid structured, non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents
      (NMB). Epidemiological data presents that the frequency of hypersensitivity reactions caused
      by rocuronium have been increased. Determinations of serum tryptase concentrations are
      interdisciplinary recommended in diagnosis of its adverse reactions. No studies have been
      performed to explain specific role of rocuronium doses on serum tryptase values. The aim of
      this study was to investigate the potential effect of rocuronium on serum tryptase
      concentrations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The greatest risk of hypersensitivity occurs during anesthesia for female patients and it is
      connected with the induction phase using skeletal muscle relaxants . Epidemiological data
      presents that the frequency of hypersensitivity reactions caused by rocuronium have been
      increased. Due to the multiple advantages reports of triggering allergic or hypersensitivity
      reactions caused by rocuronium create doubts about the safety of application .

    <intervention_model_description>The study included 126 women given a general volatile anesthesia: group I - 66 - using the rocuronium and group II - 60 - without neuromuscular relaxants. Informations about perioperative fluid therapy and doses of rocuronium were noticed. The blood samples were collected to perform tryptase concentration analysis: preoperatively - before anesthesia and postoperatively - after recovery from anesthesia.</intervention_model_description>
