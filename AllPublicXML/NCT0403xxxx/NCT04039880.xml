  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Single-centre, open-label, non-randomised, single dose study in 2 cohorts of healthy
      subjects. It is planned to enrol 6 healthy male subjects in Cohort A (standard mass balance
      and metabolite profiling cohort) and up to 6 subjects in Cohort B (biliary evaluation
      cohort); each subject will receive a single oral administration of 120 mg [14C]-olorofim oral
      solution containing approximately 3.7 MBq (100 µCi).

      Subjects will be screened up to 28 days prior to dosing and eligible subjects will be
      admitted to the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) on the day prior to dosing (Day-1). Each subject
      will be dosed on the morning of Day 1 after an overnight fast.

      Cohort A:

      Subjects will remain resident in the CRU up to 336 h post-dose (Day 15), with whole blood,
      plasma, urine and faeces collected throughout this period. There may be up to two further 24
      h residency periods (Days 21 to 22 and Days 28 to 29) for collection of plasma, urine and
      faeces if discharge criteria are not met.

      Cohorts B1 and B2:

      Subjects will remain resident in the CRU up to 96 h post-dose (Day 5) for collection of
      plasma, urine, faeces and bile. Subjects will return for a short follow-up visit on Day 10.
      Cohort B1 subjects will have bile sampling up to 6 h postdose and Cohort B2 subjects will
      have bile sampling up to 12 h postdose. Cohort B divided into 2 sub-cohorts for logistical
      reasons only.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  healthy males age 18 to 55 years of age with body mass index of 18 to 30 kg/m2
             (inclusive), and a body weight of 50 to 100 kg (inclusive).

          -  Subjects must be in good health as determined by a medical history, physical
             examination, vital signs, 12-lead ECG and clinical laboratory evaluations (congenital
             non haemolytic hyperbilirubinaemia is NOT acceptable).

          -  Must have regular bowel movements (ie, average stool production of ≥1 and ≤3 stools
             per day).

          -  Subjects who have used any non-prescribed systemic or topical medication (including
             herbal remedies) within 7 days of the dose administration

          -  Subjects who have received any medications, including St John's Wort, known to
             chronically alter drug absorption or elimination processes within 30 days of the dose
             administration

          -  Current smokers and those who have smoked or used nicotine containing products (eg
             electronic cigarettes) within the 3 months prior to check-in.

          -  Radiation exposure, including that from the present study exceeding 1 mSv in the last
             12 months or 5 mSv in the last 5 years. No occupationally exposed worker, as defined
             in the Ionising Radiation Regulations 1999, shall participate in the study.
