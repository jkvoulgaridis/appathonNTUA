    <textblock>
      Post-menopausal women aged 40-65 with symptomatic hand osteoarthritis are invited to take
      part in this feasibility study. The study's aim is to investigate whether it is acceptable to
      women with painful hand OA to take an estrogen-containing therapy, and what is the best way
      of collecting some of the information in order to facilitate planning a full size trial. The
      investigator's long-term aim is to find out whether giving estrogen-containing therapy to
      women after the menopause improves hand OA symptoms.
