  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a First in Human (FIH), double-blinded, parallel-group, randomised,
      placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK and PD of single
      and multiple ascending oral doses of GS-248 in healthy subjects.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Part I (SAD); In the SAD part of the study, single oral doses of GS-248 will be administered
      in 6 sequential cohorts, each consisting of 8 subjects randomised to receive either GS 248 or
      placebo in a 3:1 ratio. The first 2 subjects in each cohort will be dosed in a sentinel
      fashion; 1 subject will receive GS-248 and the other will receive placebo as randomised. The
      subjects will be carefully monitored by clinical staff during and after dosing. Vital signs
      and ECG will be checked at regular intervals.

      Part II (MAD); The MAD part of the study will explore multiple ascending dosing of GS-248
      administered for 10 days. The proposed starting dose is 25 mg/day. However, the starting dose
      as well as subsequent dose levels may be adjusted based on safety and PK evaluation in
      previous cohorts. GS-248 will be administered in 4 sequential cohorts, each of 8 subjects
      randomised to receive either GS 248 or placebo in a 3:1 ratio. The subjects will be carefully
      monitored by clinical staff during and after dosing. Vital signs and ECG will be checked at
      regular intervals.
