      The tonsil volume is an important factor in the decision of the tonsillectomy operation. For
      this reason, it is important to evaluate the tonsil size before the surgery. Ultrasonography
      was used in a limited number of studies about tonsil tissue assessment and also those studies
      include only the pediatric population. In this study, we investigate the success of
      ultrasonography in adults additionally pediatric population as a contribution to literature.

      Tonsillectomy is a common procedure performed on both adults and children. Recurrent
      tonsillitis, snoring and obstructive sleep apnea is among the most important indications for
      this surgery. Tonsil volume, in addition to recurrent tonsillitis frequency, are both
      considered in deciding tonsillectomy operation. Moreover, recent studies showed a correlation
      between tonsil hypertrophy and tonsillitis frequency. For this reason, a reliable assessment
      of tonsil volume is crucial both during clinical follow-up and surgery decision.

      Today, a number of clinical staging systems are used to assess tonsil volume; with 'Friedman
      Scale' and 'Brodsky Scale' being the most commonly used systems. Those staging systems employ
      physical examination and are graded on palatine tonsils' midline extension. In other words,
      clinical staging uses just the transverse length of tonsils and vertical length and depth are
      dismissed. In addition, other factors such as patient non-compliance, size of the tongue and
      tongue base, hyperactive gag reflex and trismus make a clinical assessment difficult. For
      those reasons, a correct clinical assessment of tonsil volume is not always conceivable.

      Ultrasonography (USG) was used in a limited number of studies about tonsil tissue assessment
      despite high patient compliance, low cost and its non-radioactive nature. Also, those studies
      include only the pediatric population.In this study, we would like to assess the success of
      USG in objective measurement of tonsil volume in both pediatric and adult populations and
      comparison of those results with clinical findings

    <description>All measurements were done by the same radiologist with over 20 years of experience. GE LOGIQ E9 (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI, USA) was used in USG examination. The patients were viewed using a 2-9 MHz linear probe from the submental region. The examination was done while the patient was in a supine position, with a neck support. Right tonsil measurement was done by turning the neck slightly to the upper left whereas left tonsil measurement was done by turning the neck slightly to the upper right. Tonsil volume was calculated with standard ultrasonography formula (height x length x thickness x 0.52) due to its ellipsoid shape.</description>
