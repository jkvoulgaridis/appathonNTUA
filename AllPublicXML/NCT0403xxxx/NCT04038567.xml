      This is a factorial experimental trial involving adult survivors of cardiorespiratory failure
      treated in intensive care units (ICUs) that is conceptualized as the Optimization Phase of a
      multiphase optimization strategy (MOST) framework. This will allow optimization of a mobile
      mindfulness intervention by comparing eight different iterations across domains including
      impact on symptoms, feasibility, acceptability, usability, scalability, and cost.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As survival has improved for the 2 million people with cardiorespiratory failure managed
      annually in US intensive care units (ICUs), it has become apparent that these patients suffer
      from severe and persistent post-discharge symptoms of psychological distress including
      depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, few targeted
      interventions exist that are relevant to patients' experiences and that accommodate their
      many physical, social, and financial barriers to personalized care. To fill this gap, an
      innovative app-based mobile mindfulness training program twas developed hat promotes
      automated care delivery and self-management of symptom-related distress.

      Subsequently, a pilot randomized clinical trial (RCT) called the LIFT study (R34 AT00819)
      compared mobile mindfulness to both a standard telephone mindfulness program and an ICU
      education control among survivors of cardiorespiratory failure. Key findings were that mobile
      mindfulness was feasibly delivered, acceptable, usable, and had a greater clinical impact on
      psychological distress than either comparator. This trial also highlighted opportunities to
      improve the intervention's impact related to its targeted population, content delivery, and
      system technology.

      To address these gaps, this 5-year project is conceptualized as the Optimization Phase of a
      multiphase optimization strategy (MOST) framework. It will optimize mobile mindfulness with
      four specific aims as described in the following sections. At the conclusion of this
      factorial randomized clinical trial study involving 152 cardiorespiratory failure survivors,
      a mobile mindfulness system fully optimized for usability, efficiency, scalability, and
      clinical impact will be delivered that will be off-the-shelf ready for a next-step definitive
      RCT—and can serve as a model for distance-based mind and body interventions.

               -  mechanical ventilation via endotracheal tube for ≥12 hours

               -  non-invasive ventilation (CPAP, BiPAP) for ≥4 hours in a 24-hour period provided
                  for acute respiratory failure in an ICU (not for obstructive sleep apnea or other
                  stable use)

               -  high flow nasal cannula or face mask for ≥4 hours in a 24-hour period and / or

             defined as those admissions that are non-life threatening and/or potentially impacting
             patient's well-being long-term or likely to precipitate additional future admissions.

             admission for a bronchoscopy, admission for deep vein thrombosis, or admission to ED
             resulting in overnight stay for cardiac work-up.

          2. Admitted from a location other than home (e.g., nursing home, long-term acute care
             facility, inpatient rehabilitation facility)

             (e.g., nursing home, long-term acute care facility, inpatient rehabilitation facility,
             home hospice)

          4. Complex medical care expected soon after discharge (e.g., planned surgeries,
             transplantation evaluation, extensive travel needs for hemodialysis, disruptive
             chemotherapy/radiation regimen)

          5. Unable to complete study procedures as determined by staff

          6. Lack of reliable smartphone with cellular data plan or wifi access

             EXCLUSION CRITERIA (at T1, post-discharge):

          7. Low baseline psychological distress symptoms, defined as the absence of the following
             at T1: PHQ-9 score &lt;5

          8. Failure to randomize within 2 month (60 days) post-discharge.
