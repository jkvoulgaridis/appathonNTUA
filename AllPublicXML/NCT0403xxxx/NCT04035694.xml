    <textblock>
      The main aim of this study is to conduct a pretest-posttest RCT with a three-month follow-up
      to investigate the sustainability of outcomes in students who use the Media Aware program.
      Media Aware, a web-based media literacy education program for high school students to promote
      sexual and relationship health. Media Aware is designed to provide high school students with
      sexual health knowledge, media literacy skills, and the skills to make healthy decisions
      about sexual activity. This study will examine if behavioral indicators among students in the
      intervention group sustain, emerge, or diminish over time compared to students in the delayed
      intervention group.

    <description>Media Aware is an online media literacy and sexual health education program developed for high school students that addresses the influence of media on sexual behaviors explicitly using established message processing theory. The program consists of 4 self-paced modules each with two to three lessons. Broadly, the modules cover healthy and unhealthy relationships, sexually transmitted infections, consent, substance use, pregnancy, protection and contraception, and communication between adolescents and their partners, parents, or health providers. Users also learn media literacy skills including message deconstruction to help examine the truth behind media messages.</description>

        SCHOOL SITES:

        Inclusion:

          1. Schools must have students in 9th or 10th grade health education as this program is

          2. Schools must agree to provide the Media Aware program during class periods as their
             sexual health education which means that an educator will facilitate the students
             taking the program.

          3. Schools must have adequate technology for the students to use the web-based Media
             Aware program and complete the online questionnaires.

          4. It must be feasible for iRT project staff members to travel to the school sites for
             the three data collection time points.

        TEACHER PARTICIPANTS:

        Inclusion:

          1. Teacher's classrooms must have students in 9th or 10th grade as this program is

        Inclusion:

          1. Students must be in grades 9 or 10.

             questionnaires) are in English. However, parent permission and youth assent forms for
             the research study will be available in both English and Spanish.

          3. Students must have appropriate parent permission to receive sexual health education
             per school districts' policy (i.e., opt-in policy or opt-out policy).
