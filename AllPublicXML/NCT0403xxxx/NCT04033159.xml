  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are no available treatments aside from supportive care for patients with Centronuclear
      myopathy (CNM). This trial will assess the safety, tolerability, PK and PD/preliminary
      efficacy of a new medicine called DYN101 in patients ≥ 16 years of age with CNM caused by
      mutations in DNM2 or MTM1.

      The trial will consist of a consent, a screening period, a run-in period (if applicable), a
      Single dose treatment part (SAD) with 4 weeks of follow-up after the drug administration and
      a washout period of at least 12 weeks (followed by follow-up phone calls), a Multiple dose
      treatment part (MAD) of 12 weeks of weekly dosing, and a Multiple dose extension part of 12
      weeks. All subjects will participate in the SAD, MAD, and MAD extension parts, unless they
      withdraw. During this time, multiple test will be performed in order to better understand how
      the drug is distributed and then later removed from the body and whether there any signs of
      an effect.

      As this trial is investigational, there is no defined, expected benefit for subjects who
      participate in this trial except a better knowledge of their disease.

      There are no available treatments aside from supportive care for patients with Centronuclear
      myopathy (CNM). This trial will assess the safety, tolerability, PK and PD/preliminary
      efficacy of DYN101 in patients ≥ 16 years of age with CNM caused by mutations in DNM2 or
      MTM1.

      DYN101 is a synthetically manufactured constrained ethyl gapmer ASO directed against DNM2
      pre-mRNA. DYN101 will be provided as a sterile concentrated solution for reconstitution into
      an infusion solution for intravenous (IV) administration, and will be diluted into a 0.9%
      sodium chloride solution before administration.

      The trial will consist of a pre-screening consent, a screening period, a run-in period (if
      applicable), a SAD part with 4 weeks of follow-up after IMP administration and a washout
      period of at least 12 weeks (followed by follow-up phone calls until the MAD part starts), a
      MAD part of 12 weeks, and a MAD extension part of 12 weeks. All subjects will participate in
      the SAD, MAD, and MAD extension parts, unless they withdraw. End-of-treatment assessments
      will be performed after 24 weeks of MAD treatment have been completed, i.e. at the Week 25
      visit. Subjects will be followed up on adverse events (AEs) and concomitant medications 3
      months after the last IMP administration.

      The primary analysis will be performed when all subjects in all cohorts have completed 12
      weeks of MAD treatment or discontinued earlier. The final analysis will be performed when all
      subjects have completed 24 weeks of MAD treatment (12 weeks in the MAD part + 12 weeks in the
      MAD extension part; Week 25 visit) or discontinued earlier.

      As this trial is investigational, there is no defined, expected benefit for subjects who
      participate in this trial except a better knowledge of their pathology, and the knowledge
      that they contribute to RNA-targeted therapy for CNM patients carrying MTM1 and DNM2
      mutations.

Each cohort will have 3 subjects with a DNM2 mutation and 3 subjects with a MTM1 mutation. Cohorts will enroll in a sequential staggered approach with an interval of ≥7 days between dosing of the first and the next subject in a cohort (after Medical Monitor 48hr safety data review).</intervention_model_description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female aged ≥ 16 years of age* on the date of signing the main ICF. The first
             subject (i.e. the sentinel subject) in each cohort will be ≥ 18 years of age. *for
             Germany, the subject must be ≥ 18 years of age in accordance with local and national
             regulations.

          2. Have a documented mutation in DNM2 or MTM1.

          3. Meet the following laboratory criteria at screening:

               -  Platelet count &gt; 150,000/µL,

               -  Normal kidney function, as determined by values of blood urea nitrogen (BUN),
                  creatinine, cystatin C, and eGFR within normal laboratory reference ranges,

               -  Normal liver function, as determined by values of ALT, AST, GGT, and bilirubin
                  within normal laboratory reference ranges (see Section 6.2.2.2).

             Note: Retesting of subjects should always be discussed with the sponsor and/or medical
             monitor. Retesting of laboratory values that lead to exclusion will be allowed once
             using an unscheduled visit during the screening period to assess eligibility. This
             visit should be at least 2 weeks later than the original screening visit.

          4. Have a symptomatic CNM in the opinion of the investigator, at least mild to moderately
             affected, i.e. showing clinical symptoms in at least 2 of the domains that will be
             investigated in this trial (respiratory, muscle strength and function, dysphagia), and
             be ambulatory, i.e. being able to walk 10 steps, if needed with support/assisted. If a
             subject is non-ambulatory but highly functioning in the view of the investigator,
             he/she may be included following discussion with the sponsor.

          5. Have an understanding, ability, and willingness to fully comply with visit frequency,
             trial procedures and restrictions, including contraceptive requirements.

          6. Able to provide written, signed and dated informed consent/assent to participate in
             the trial. Parental consent (one or both parents) and an assent for subjects &lt; 18
             years may be required per local legislation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Have clinical, laboratory or ultrasound evidence of liver disease. Note: Liver
             ultrasound at screening is mandatory for MTM1 subjects.

          2. Presence of significant co-morbidities or conditions other than CNM or clinically
             significant (CS) findings during screening of medical history, physical examination,
             laboratory testing, vital signs or ECG recording for which, in the opinion of the
             investigator and the medical monitor, participation would not be in the best interest
             of the subject (e.g. compromise the safety or well-being) or that could prevent,
             limit, or confound the protocol-specified assessments (e.g. taking a muscle biopsy).

          3. For female subjects of child-bearing potential: pregnant or breastfeeding, or planning
             to become pregnant during the trial.

          4. Current or past abuse of alcohol or recreational/narcotic drugs (with the exception of
             caffeine and nicotine), which in the investigator's opinion would compromise the
             subject's safety and/or compliance with the trial procedures.

          5. Currently enrolled in another investigational trial or scheduled to participate in
             another trial whilst participating in this trial.

          6. Current or relevant history of physical or psychiatric illness, any medical disorder
             that may require treatment or make the subject unlikely to fully complete the trial,
             or any condition that presents undue risk from the IMP or procedures.

          7. Intake of any disallowed therapies as noted in Section 5.5 within 12 weeks before the
             planned first IMP administration.

          8. Known or suspected intolerance or hypersensitivity to IMP ingredients or
             closely-related compounds, or history of a significant allergic reaction to IMP
             ingredients as determined by the investigator, such as anaphylaxis requiring
             hospitalization.

          9. Legally incapacitated or have limited legal capacity. Lack of mental capacity to fully
             understand the protocol requirements and complete all study required procedures.
