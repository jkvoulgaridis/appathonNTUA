  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy, safety, and tolerability of
      IONIS-PKK-LRx in participants with hereditary angioedema (HAE) type 1 (HAE-1), HAE type 2
      (HAE-2), or HAE with normal C1-inhibitor (C1-INH) and to evaluate the effect of IONIS-PKK-LRx
      on plasma prekallikrein (PKK) and other relevant biomarkers.

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, study in up 24 participants and will
      be conducted concurrently in 2 parts (Part A and Part B); participants will be allocated into
      Part A or Part B according to type of HAE (i.e., either HAE-1/HAE-2 in Part A or HAE-nC1-INH
      in Part B). Part A will be randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled; and Part B will
      be open-label. The length of participation in the study will be approximately 8 months, which
      includes an up to 8-week screening period, a 12-week treatment period, and a 13-week
      post-treatment period.

    <description>The AE-QoL was developed to measure health-related quality of life (HRQoL) impairment in participants with recurrent angioedema. The AE-QoL is a self-administered questionnaire that can be completed in less than 5 minutes. It comprises 17 items across 4 domains: functioning, fatigue/mood, fears/shame, and food. Responses use a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 'never' to 'very often.' Global and domain scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating greater impairment.</description>
