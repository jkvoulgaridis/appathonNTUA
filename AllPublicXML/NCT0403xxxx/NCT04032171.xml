Qualifying relapse is defined as occurrence of new or worsening neurological symptoms attributable to Multiple Sclerosis (MS) (for more than 24 hours, no fever, infection, injury, adverse events, and preceded by a stable or improving neurological state for greater than or equal to (=&gt;) 30 days).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants diagnosed with RMS (relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis [RRMS] or
             secondary progressive multiple sclerosis [SPMS] with relapses) in accordance with 2017
             Revised McDonald criteria (Thompson 2018).

          -  Participants have EDSS score of 0 to 5.5 at Baseline. Participants with an EDSS score
             &lt;= 2 at screening are only eligible for participation if their disease duration (time
             since onset of symptoms) is no more than 10 years.

          -  Participants are neurologically stable for &gt;= 30 days prior to both screening and
             baseline.

          -  Female participants must be neither pregnant nor breast-feeding and must lack
             child-bearing potential, as defined by either: post-menopausal or surgically sterile
             or use an effective method of contraception for the duration of the study.

          -  Participants have given written informed consent prior to any study-related procedure.

          -  Other protocol defined inclusion criteria could apply

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants diagnosed with Progressive MS, in accordance with the 2017 Revised
             McDonald criteria as follows: a). Participants with Primary Progressive MS. b).
             Participants with secondary progressive MS without evidence of relapse.

          -  Disease duration more than (&gt;) 10 years in participants with an EDSS =&lt; 2.0 at
             screening.

          -  Immunologic disorder other than MS, or any other condition requiring oral, intravenous
             (IV) , intramuscular, or intra-articular corticosteroid therapy, with the exception of
             well-controlled Type 2 diabetes mellitus or well controlled thyroid disease.

          -  Other protocol defined exclusion criteria could apply.
