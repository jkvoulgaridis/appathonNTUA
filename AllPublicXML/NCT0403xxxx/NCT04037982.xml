  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) is considered one of the most complex and dangerous procedures
      in general surgery. This procedure is the preferred surgical procedure for treating tumors
      around the ampulla. Traditional open pancreaticoduodenectomy (OPD) has brought great surgical
      trauma to patients while treating diseases. In 1994, Gagner et al first reported laparoscopic
      pancreaticoduodenectomy (LPD). With the development of laparoscopic techniques, the updating
      of devices, and the continuous accumulation of laparoscopic gastrointestinal surgery
      experience, the results of retrospective studies published show that there is no significant
      difference in safety between LPD and OPD. However, the results of the recently published RCT
      study show that the mortality associated with LPD complications is five times greater than
      that of OPD. At present, the security of LPD has been controversial. Therefore we conducted a
      prospective randomized controlled trial with a primary outcome of perioperative
      complications, providing evidence-based results for the safe and effective clinical
      development of LPD.

    <description>During laparoscopic surgery, the surgeon makes several smaller incisions in your abdomen and inserts special instruments, including a camera that transmits video to a monitor in the operating room. The surgeon watches the monitor to guide the surgical tools in performing the Whipple procedure. Laparoscopic surgery is a type of minimally invasive surgery.</description>
