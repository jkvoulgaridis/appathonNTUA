  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This feasibility study will assess if tracking objective and subjective facial skin changes
      over time is acceptable to pre and perimenopausal women undergoing chemotherapy and/or
      endocrine therapy for breast cancer. There is no intervention arm and no control group. Skin
      health will be assessed through the instruments described below, and subjective data will be
      collected with self-administered questionnaires.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are no studies objectively assessing changes to facial skin health in this population,
      but tools exist to objectively measure changes thus we have chosen to use those tools to
      measure skin health. Before embarking on an intervention study showing improvement in skin
      health and patients' self-image and QOL, we first need to see if 1) it is feasible to measure
      changes in skin health in this population and 2) if skin health does objectively change over
      the course of therapy.

        Our baseline skin health self-assessment tool accounts for smoking status, sun exposure,
        and sunscreen use and this will factor into our assessments/comparison to age and ethnicity
        matched norms. Sun exposure will likely affect skin age differences at baseline but should
        not affect the skin aging over the duration of the study.
