             days prior to or after the procedure

          -  Patient is receiving immunosuppression therapy and has known immunosuppressive or
             autoimmune disease (e.g. human immunodeficiency virus, systemic lupus erythematosus
             etc.)

          -  Patient is receiving chronic anticoagulation therapy (e.g., heparin, coumadin) that
             cannot be stopped and restarted according to local hospital standard procedures.

          -  Patient has a known hypersensitivity or contraindication to aspirin, both heparin and
             bivalirudin, both clopidogrel and ticlopidine, Novolimus, PLLA polymers or contrast
             sensitivity that cannot be adequately pre-medicated

          -  Elective surgery is planned within the first 6 months after the procedure that will
             require discontinuing either aspirin or clopidogrel

          -  Excessive tortuosity proximal to or within the lesion

          -  Angulation (≥ 45o) proximal to or within the lesion

          -  Calcification moderate or heavy

          -  Previous intervention restenosis

          -  The target vessel contains visible thrombus

          -  Another clinically significant lesion (&gt;40%) is located in the same major epicardial
             vessel as the target lesion

          -  Patient has a high probability that a procedure other than pre-dilatation and
