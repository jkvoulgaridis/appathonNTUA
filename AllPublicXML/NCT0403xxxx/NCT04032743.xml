  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children treated with intensive chemotherapy are at increased risk for life-threatening
      infections (sepsis). As the survival of oncology patients increased with the use of
      aggressive treatment protocols, there was also an increase in the need for hospitalization in
      intensive care units (ICU) due to sepsis.Several prognostic factors are known to affect the
      survival of these patients, including the number and type of damaged systems, the type of
      oncology disease and the duration of neutropenia. With the development of the treatment of
      ICU, the survival of the oncology patients hospitalized for sepsis has also increased.

      We will collect demographic details, details of their oncology and infections, laboratory
      tests and imaging. The goal is to identify prognostic factors in oncologic children
      hospitalized in ICU due to sepsis, as well as clinical and laboratory parameters that
      characterize this group of patients.
