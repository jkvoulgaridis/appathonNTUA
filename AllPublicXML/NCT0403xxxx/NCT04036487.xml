  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Among aesthetic or cosmetic surgeries, breast augmentation was the most frequently performed
      and the endoscopic transaxillary approach has become the preferred incision for Asian women.
      As breast augmentation must be performed under general anesthesia accompanied by its effects
      and potential complications, types of general anesthesia may affect the quality of recovery.
      Currently, the two most common techniques of general anesthesia are inhalation anesthesia
      (IH) and total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA). The effects of these types of general
      anesthesia on the quality of recovery have been investigated for numerous surgical
      procedures. However, no prior studies have analyzed different types of anesthesia used for
      performing transaxillary endoscopic breast augmentation. This prospective, parallel,
      randomized controlled study will evaluate the effects of inhalation anesthesia vs. total
      intravenous anesthesia on the quality of recovery in patients undergoing transaxillary
      endoscopic breast augmentation.
