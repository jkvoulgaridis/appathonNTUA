  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to see if and how mindfulness meditation affects pain.
      Specifically, we are interested in assessing if mindfulness is associated with the release of
      naturally occurring opiates in the body, in response to intravenous (IV) administration of
      the opioid antagonist naloxone during a chronic low back pain provoking procedure.

      The purpose of this psychophysical and pharmacologic study is to determine if meditation
      induced pain relief is mediated by endogenous opioids in response to intravenous (IV)
      administration of the opioid antagonist naloxone during a pain evoking straight leg raise
      test in response to double-blind intravenous administration (IV) of naloxone/placebo-saline.
      The aim of this study is to determine if mindfulness-based analgesia is associated with the
      release of endogenous opioids.

    <intervention_model_description>The study will employ a double blinded crossover factorial design. Baseline pain ratings will be assessed using visual analog scales obtained during three sessions where low back pain is induced. Study volunteers will participate in a four session (20min/session) meditation intervention. After meditation training, subjects will report to the UCSD Altman Clinical and Translational Research Institute across two separate experimental sessions. Half of the volunteers will be administered naloxone (opioid antagonist; 0.15 mg/kg bolus+ 0.1 mg/kg/hour infusion) and the other in the subsequent session will be administered IV placebo-saline, vice versa.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>Up to 8 weeks. This will be done at each experimental session where noxious stimulation will be adminstered. Visit 1, 6 and 7.</time_frame>

    <measure>Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System 29-Item Profile</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 8 weeks. Visit 1, 6 and 7.</time_frame>
    <description>This is a 29-item generic health-related survey that assesses 7 domains with 4-items in each domain: depression, anxiety, physical function, pain interference, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and ability to participant in social roles/activities. A score of 60 means that the person is one standard deviation above the reference population (standard deviation = 10). High scores represent more of the domain being measured. Thus, on symptom-oriented domains of PROMIS-29 (anxiety, depression, fatigue, pain interference, and sleep disturbance), higher scores represent worse symptomatology. On the function- oriented domains (physical functioning and social role) higher scores represent better functioning. For example, a high sleep disturbance score indicates high levels of sleep disturbance; a high physical functioning score indicates better physical function.</description>
