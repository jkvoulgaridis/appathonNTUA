  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis is a common critical illness in Intensive Care Unit (ICU). With the continuous
      progress of severe medicine, the mortality rate of ICU hospitalization for sepsis has
      decreased, but the long-term prognosis is not satisfied. Due to the high long-term mortality,
      poor physical and mental health and cognitive impairment, the long-term quality of life
      decreases greatly, putting great burden on the family and society. Therefore, it is of great
      significance to understand the epidemiology and risk factors of the long-term prognosis of
      sepsis and find out how to improve the prognosis .

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis is a clinical syndrome in which the body's host response to uncontrolled infection
      leads to life-threatening organ dysfunction. In recent years, with the continuous improvement
      of the early diagnosis ability of sepsis, the deepening of the understanding of
      pathophysiology, and the continuous updating of treatment, the hospital mortality rate of
      sepsis has decreased significantly. However, studies have shown that the prevalence of sepsis
      is still increasing year by year, and the number of deaths due to sepsis is increasing.
      Sepsis is the main cause of death in ICU patients.

      Although the mortality rate of patients with sepsis is significantly reduced, the increasing
      survival of patients with long-term outcome is not satisfied. All studies have shown that
      patients with sepsis have a high long-term mortality, and the long-term physiological,
      psychological, and cognitive function levels are reduced, which increases the economic burden
      and mental burden of the family and society. The increasing number of discharges has been
      considered a potential public health threat. In recent years, more and more researchers begin
      to pay attention to the long-term outcome of sepsis survivors. But compared with other acute
      or severe diseases, such as stroke, cancer, sepsis survivors has not been paid enough
      attention.

      Therefore, all stages of treatment and rehabilitation of sepsis require extensive social
      attention. Continuous research and input are needed to explore predicting factors and
      effective interventions to improve the outcome and help patients and their families return to
      normal life,to reduce the social burden.
