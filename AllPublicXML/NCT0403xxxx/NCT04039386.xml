    <textblock>
      Psychosocial conditions are common in young adults with hip pain including depression,
      anxiety, pain catastrophizing, and narcotic use. The incidence of these conditions is not
      well defined. Interventions to optimize psychosocial conditions with non-surgical or surgical
      treatments has not been investigated. The goal of this project is to determine the incidence
      of psychosocial conditions in the young adult population with hip pain and determine if
      cognitive based therapy can improve clinical outcomes in these individuals.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over the last 3 decades there has been a drastic increase in the number of joint preservation
      surgeries performed for pre-arthritic hip conditions in the United States. Despite advances
      in surgical technique and the understanding of the biomechanics of impingement and dysplasia,
      failure rates range from 5-20% at early follow up, and can be even higher with continued
      monitoring. These failures are often attributed to the presence of pre-operative
      osteoarthritis, increased age, or unaddressed structural deformity. The influence of
      psychosocial factors on surgical and rehabilitative outcomes has been recognized in multiple
      populations, but has largely been ignored in individuals with hip pathology, in spite of
      growing recognition by clinicians as to how psychosocial factors may contribute to patient
      outcomes. Previous investigations have demonstrated poor mental health is associated with
      pre-operative narcotic use and lower physical function. Further, the investigators have
      identified certain psychiatric diagnoses as independent factors associated with failure of
      hip arthroscopy. Addressing these often complex psychosocial issues using cognitive based
      therapy has been successful in improving outcomes across a range of medical conditions.
      Further investigation into the incidence of these psychosocial conditions, their
      contributions to surgical and non-surgical outcomes, and interventions for mental health
      optimization need to be performed in musculoskeletal medicine, specifically in the developing
      field of hip preservation surgery. The goal of this project is to (1) understand the burden
      of maladaptive psychosocial traits in young adult patients with hip pain, and (2) reduce
      pain, decrease narcotic use, and improve physical function through psychosocial intervention
      delivered concomitantly during physical therapy. The investigators seek to maximize outcomes
      of individuals with non-arthritic hip dysfunction by addressing maladaptive behaviors so
      subjects can more effectively participate in rehabilitative treatment, and potentially, avoid
      the need for surgical management.

    <measure>Evaluating the presence and severity of Kinesiophobia</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed via the Shortened Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK-11) electronically administered patient reported outcome questionnaire
The survey is a 11-question test scored from 11-44, where higher scores indicate increasing fear of movement.
A value of 11 is presumed in a nonpainful population.
Adults with chronic musculoskeletal pain undergoing outpatient chronic pain therapy report an average TSK score of 30.4 (+/- 6.6).
Successful evaluation of Kinesiophobia will be indicated if increases in TSK-11 scores are found to be significantly associated with increased pain and decreased physical function (HOOS, PROMIS-PI, PROMIS-PB, PROMIS-PF) or increased self-reporting of opioid use.
The finding of no significant association, but increased presence of maladaptive features compared to normative data for US adolescents would also be considered a successful finding.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluation of Resiliency</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed via The Brief Resiliency Scale (BRS) electronically administered patient reported outcome questionnaire
An 8 question survey scored from 1-5 points
The average score for US adults age 24-34 is 3.2 (SD 0.7)
A statistically significant lower Grit score would be &gt;1SD below this average value.
Successful evaluation of Grit will be indicated if increases in GRIT-S scores are found to be significantly associated with increased pain and decreased physical function (HOOS, PROMIS-PI, PROMIS-PB, PROMIS-PF) or increased self-reporting of opioid use.
The finding of no significant association, but increased presence of maladaptive features compared to normative data for US adolescents would also be considered a successful finding.</description>

    <measure>Evaluation of Grit</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed via The Short Grit Scale (GRIT-S) electronically administered patient reported outcome questionnaire
A 6-question test with low resiliency defined as a score of &lt;3.00.
Prior descriptive studies indicate an average score of 3.57 (SD 0.76) for young adults age 19.8±3.0 years.
Statistically significant lower resilience would be &gt;1SD below this average value.
Successful evaluation of Resiliency will be indicated if increases in GRIT-S scores are found to be significantly associated with increased pain and decreased physical function (HOOS, PROMIS-PI, PROMIS-PB, PROMIS-PF) or increased self-reporting of opioid use.
The finding of no significant association, but increased presence of maladaptive features compared to normative data for US adolescents (for those tests where this data exists) would also be considered a successful finding.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluating the presence and severity of Pain Catastrophizing</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed via Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) electronically administered patient reported outcome questionnaire
Scored on a 13 point scale.
Normative average values from a population of adults adults age 42.2 (17-63 years) with low back pain: mean 20.90 (SD 12.5),
Successful evaluation of Pain Catastrophization will be indicated if increases in PCS scores are found to be significantly associated with increased pain and decreased physical function (HOOS, PROMIS-PI, PROMIS-PB, PROMIS-PF) or increased self-reporting of opioid use.
The finding of no significant association, but increased presence of maladaptive features compared to normative data for US adolescents would also be considered a successful finding.</description>

    <measure>Evaluating Self-Efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed via The General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSE) electronically administered patient reported outcome questionnaire
10-question test, scored from 10-40, with lower scores representing low self efficacy.
Average US adult values: 29.48 (SD 5.13)
Successful evaluation of Self-Efficacy will be indicated if increases in GSE scores are found to be significantly associated with increased pain and decreased physical function (HOOS, PROMIS-PI, PROMIS-PB, PROMIS-PF) or increased self-reporting of opioid use.
The finding of no significant association, but increased presence of maladaptive features compared to normative data for US adolescents would also be considered a successful finding.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluating the presence and severity of Alcohol Use Disorders</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed via Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) electronically administered patient reported outcome questionnaire
A 10-question test with a threshold score &gt;7 considered &quot;AUDIT-positive&quot;, indicating risky or hazardous alcohol use behavior.
National data suggests 15-20% of US 14-18 year olds screen positive
Successful evaluation of Alcohol Use Disorders will be indicated if increases in AUDIT scores are found to be significantly associated with increased pain and decreased physical function (HOOS, PROMIS-PI, PROMIS-PB, PROMIS-PF) or increased self-reporting of opioid use.
The finding of no significant association, but increased presence of maladaptive features compared to normative data for US adolescents would also be considered a successful finding.</description>
