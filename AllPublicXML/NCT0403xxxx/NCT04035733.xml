  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is the most common of the autoimmune blistering skin diseases in
      Western Europe. [Joly 2012]The study will recruit the new onset or relapsing mild to moderate
      BP patients. The study population will consist of patients above the age of 18 years with an
      active episode of BP, confirmed by inclusion and exclusion criteria and who, in the opinion
      of the Investigator, would benefit from treatment with rVA576. Recombinant rVA576 is a small
      protein complement C5 and LTB4 inhibitor, which prevents the cleavage of C5 by C5 convertase
      and thereby inhibits generation of C5b-9 the membrane attack complex (MAC), as well as
      preventing the release of the anaphylatoxin C5a. rVA576 is effective in inhibiting terminal
      complement activity irrespective of the activating pathway (classical, lectin or
      alternative). This Phase IIa open-label single-arm study will evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of rVA576 in adult mild to moderate Bullous Pemphigoid patients

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Adult male or female ≥18-year-old patients

          2. Subject with newly presenting mild to moderate cutaneous bullous pemphigoid (BP)

          3. BPDAI global score at the screening of 10-56 (≥ 10 but &lt;56)

          4. Subjects with a relapse of mild to moderate bullous pemphigoid are eligible if their
             disease was quiescent for at least 2 months before the current relapse.

          5. Cutaneous bullous pemphigoid (BP) per standard diagnostic criteria:

               1. Clinical presentation (cutaneous blistering and/or itchy dermatosis), AND

               2. Direct immunofluorescence (DIF) studies.

          6. Karnofsky performance status &gt;60%

          7. Adequate cardiac, renal, hepatic, neurological and psychiatric function as determined
             by the Investigator and demonstrated by screening laboratory evaluations, vital sign
             measurement, ECG recording and physical examination results.

          8. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must agree to use effective contraception
             consistently throughout the study and have a negative serum pregnancy test at
             screening and a negative urine pregnancy test per the schedule of visits.
