  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to evaluate the safety and feasibility of SEMS followed by neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy prior to elective surgery for obstructing left-sided colon cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stoma is reported to be frequent in self-expanding metallic stent (SEMS) treated patients
      with obstructing left-sided colon cancer than in those with non-obstructing surgery.
      Retrospective study reported worse overall survival with SEMS and elective surgery than with
      emergency surgery in patients with left-sided malignant colon obstruction. In practice,
      intestinal wall edema following stent placement increases the difficulty of surgery, and this
      could be a major problem if the interval between stent insertion and surgery is short (1-2
      weeks). The patients with obstructing left-sided colon cancer received SEMS treatment, and
      the recevied neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to elective surgery.

    <description>Neoadjuvant chemotherapy was administered 1 week after successful SEMS placement and decompression for patient with obstructing left-sided colonic cancer. Patients received either three cycles of mFOLFOX6 repeated every 2 weeks or two cycles of CAPOX repeated every 3 weeks. Elective surgery was performed 2 weeks after completion of chemotherapy by experienced colorectal surgeons.</description>
