    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine if planned induction of labor at 39 weeks
      for nulliparous with pre-pregnancy BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2 reduces the incidence of cesarean section
      compared to expectant management

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity in the obstetric population has reached epidemic proportions, affecting over 30% of
      reproductive-aged women in the United States (1). The increase in this morbidity is
      associated with large increases in cesarean delivery over the non-obese obstetric population
      and resultant post-operative complications are also higher in obese women (2). There are no
      interventions proven to reduce the risk of cesarean in obese women. The aim of this research
      study is to determine if induction of labor at 39 weeks can reduce the incidence of cesarean
      delivery over routine obstetric care (expectant management).

The individual labor induction process will be at the discretion of the physician or midwife managing the subject's care. Methods of induction that may be used include misoprostol, intracervical Foley catheter, oxytocin, and/or amniotomy. Participating clinicians will be encouraged to use only one course of cervical ripening followed by oxytocin infusion and amniotomy.</description>
