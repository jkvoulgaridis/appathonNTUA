  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths in China. Despite advances
      in systemic therapy and improvement nonsurvival rates for patients with advanced lung cancer,
      morbidity and mortality remain high.

      Recently, many studies reported that patients with positive driving genes such as
      EGFR(epidermal growth factor receptor,EGFR), ALK(anaplastic lymphoma kinase,ALK), ROS1(c-ros
      oncogene 1 receptor,ROS1), BRAF (V-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1, BRAF)and so
      on have clearly targeted drugs, which bring survival benefits to patients. However, about
      half of patients still lack a clear driving gene target, which may have improved survival due
      to higher response rates to radiation therapy and other chemotherapy medications.

      Development of noninvasive imaging biomarkers such as CT (computed tomography,CT)and MRI
      (magnetic resonance imaging,MRI)may not only evaluate the response to therapy ,but also could
      predict the efficacy of drug therapy and whether the driving gene is positive or not, through
      analysing the relationship between clinical related data and imaging features to find the
      imaging characteristics for making clinical decisions, and, consequently, contribute to an
      improved prognosis.

      To explore the value of CT and MR using multiple sequences, including T2-TSE-BLADE, T2 maps
      StarVIBE, and iShim-DWI in evaluating the driving genes and prediction of response to therapy
      and OS in patients with lung cancer.

      Patients with biopsy-proven lung cancer were prospectively enrolled for imaging on CT and a
      3T MRI scanner . The MRI protocol included T2-TSE-BLADE, T2 maps,iShim-DWI and StarVIBE
      sequences, and so on. Patients received treatment according to NCCN( National Comprehensive
      Cancer Network) guideline. CT and MRI features were analyzed to find the correlation between
      pretreatment imaging features and driving genes and therapy response. The study will include
      400 patients. Inter-reader agreements of TN staging were analyzed excellent for CT and MRI.
      Diagnostic accuracy of CT and MRI will be calculated separately.
