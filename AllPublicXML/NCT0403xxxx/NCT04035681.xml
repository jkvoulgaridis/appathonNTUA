  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this feasibility study is to determine whether it is practical and helpful to
      provide problem-solving therapy to stroke survivors and their spouses/partners (caregivers)
      together. It will also compare the experiences of participants who receive problem-solving
      therapy to those who receive stroke-related health education.

      Many stroke survivors and caregivers report feeling sad or blue at some point after the
      stroke. These feelings can impact quality of life. Encountering problems is a part of daily
      life. These problems can be big or small, but sometimes they can pile up and feel
      overwhelming, contributing to feelings of sadness. Problem-solving therapy is a tool that
      teaches structured ways to address current problems or challenges in your life.

      Participants who are assigned to receive problem-solving therapy will work with a research
      team member for six, one-hour sessions. During each session, participants will identify a
      problem (big or small) and create a plan to work on that problem.

      Participants who are assigned to receive stroke-related health education will work with a
      research team member who will teach them about various topics related to stroke over six,
      one-hour sessions. Each session will cover information about a different topic related to
      stroke.

      Outcomes data will be collected at approximately 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 13 weeks from
      baseline.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Both dyad participants are at least 18 years of age.

          2. The stroke survivor experienced an ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke at least 3 months
             prior to enrollment.

          3. The caregiver is a spouse/partner who provides regular, unpaid support for the
             survivor in activities of daily living.

          4. Both dyad members are willing and able understand and comply with protocol
             requirements.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The stroke survivor has severe expressive or receptive aphasia or global aphasia, as
             documented in the medical record by a speech pathologist or other provider.

          2. Either dyad member is unable to write, as this will interfere with completion of
             MiniCog assessment.

          3. Either dyad member has significant cognitive impairment, evidenced by MiniCog score &lt;4
             at screening.
