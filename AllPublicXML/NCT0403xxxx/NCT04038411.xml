    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open-label, one-arm, multicenter clinical trial, aimed to evaluate the
      safety, tolerability, and efficacy of PD-1 Antibody, Chidamide, Lenalidomide and Etoposide in
      Relapsed or Refractory NK/T cell Lymphoma. A total of 50 patients are planned to be enrolled
      into the study. The primary end points are objective responder rate (ORR) and progression
      free survival(PFS) and the secondary end points include overall survival(OS) , and adverse
      events.
