  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is to verify if the test formulation of Levothyroxine sodium presents an equivalent
      rate and extension of absorption to the comparator formulation when administered with the
      same dosage and under fasting conditions and after baseline correction concentrations.

             of 18.50 to 27.00

          -  No abnormal findings on medical history that, in the opinion of the investigator,
             constitutes a risk or a contraindication for the participation of the participant in

             mmHg; temperature between 36.0 and 37.0 degrees Celsius

          -  Electrocardiogram (ECG) normal (abnormalities, even if clinically not relevant, are
             not permitted [example {e.g.}: PR, QRS, QT, QTcF] should be within normal range, no
             conduction abnormalities etcetera [etc.])

          -  All values for biochemistry and hematology tests of blood and urine within the normal
             range or showing no clinically relevant deviation as judged by the Investigator

          -  Other protocol defined inclusion criteria could apply

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Supplementary tests results out of the values considered as normal, unless considered
             clinically irrelevant

          -  Research participants who are submitted to surgery before the beginning of the study

             complying to an exclusion period ranging from 4 to 8 weeks

          -  Positive test for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in
             pre-study tests

          -  Participants with a history of hypersensitivity/allergy to study drug or excipients,
             history or presence of asthma or any serious allergy (requiring hospitalization or
             prolonged systemic treatment), any food allergy or intolerance which in the opinion of
             the Investigator represents a safety risk (e.g., iodine allergy, etc.)

          -  Has participated in any experimental trial or has taken any experimental drug within 6
             months previous to this study (RDC [resolution of the collegiate board] Resolution 34,
             dated June 3, 2008)

          -  Participants that prior to the dosing takes any other medication and had not passed at
             least seven half-lives of elimination of the drug, in this case, be considered by the
             Principal Investigator the non-inclusion of the participant in the study. Participants
             taking medications known to affect thyroid hormone metabolism, e.g., oral
             contraceptives, hormonal implants, parenteral hormones, anabolic steroids, androgens,
             etc., or the bioavailability of levothyroxine like proton pump Inhibitors

          -  Has a history of alcohol abuse or has ingested alcohol 24 hours previous to the
