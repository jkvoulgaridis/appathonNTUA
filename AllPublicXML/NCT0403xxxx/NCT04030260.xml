    <textblock>
      REGONIVO is a Phase Ib study to explore the efficacy and safety of regorafenib in combination
      with nivolumab in the treatment of gastric cancer and colorectal cancer with MSS. The study
      enrolled 50 patients with advanced disease, including 25 cases of gastric cancer, 25 cases of
      colorectal cancer, except for one case of colorectal cancer with MSI-H, and others were MSS
      type. The results of the study showed that patients with colorectal cancer had an objective
      response rate (ORR) of 36% and a progression-free survival (PFS) of 6.3 months.

      Based on the preliminary results of the REGONIVO study, the aim of this phase 2 study is to
      explore the safety and efficacy of regorafenib and nivolumab in combination with radiotherapy
      with or without irinotecan in previously treated metastatic colorectal cancer patients with
      pMMR/MSS.

    <description>The PFS is defined as the time from the start of treatment to the date of first documented PD or death as a result of any cause, whichever occurred first. When a patient was alive and without progression, PFS was censored at the date of the last disease assessment. The PFS rates at 6 months was estimated from Kaplan-Meier curves.</description>
