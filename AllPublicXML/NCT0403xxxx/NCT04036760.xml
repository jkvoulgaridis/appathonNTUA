    <textblock>
      This study assesses the impact of a hepatitis C care coordination program on rates of linkage
      to hepatitis C care following release from New York City jails. Adult patients (age 18 years
      and above) with chronic Hepatitis C infection at Bellevue Hospital Center 19 North prison
      clinic from July 1, 2015 through December 31, 2016 will be offered participation in a
      transitional care coordination program. The rates of linkage of these individuals following
      release from jail will be compared to a historical cohort of adult patients with chronic
      Hepatitis C infection at the 19 North prison clinic from January 1, 2014 through June 31,
      2015.
