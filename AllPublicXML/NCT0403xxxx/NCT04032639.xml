  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) have increased hunger and food seeking
      behaviour, as well as learning (cognitive) challenges. In addition, some patients with PW
      been shown to have low cortisol production, particularly in stressful situations. However,
      research examining how hormonal, cognitive, and psychological factors are interrelated PWS is
      limited. To address this gap in knowledge, the goal of this project is to understand how
      changes in brain regions involved in controlling food intake and cognitive processes are
      related to changes in hormones regulating appetite, the stress hormone cortisol, and
      performance on neuropsychological tests.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) is characterized by hyperphagia, although the degree of food
      seeking can vary between individuals. This behaviour may be moderated by hormonal,
      neurocognitive, and psychological factors; however, data assessing these factors in an
      integrated fashion is scarce. The proposed research will address and identify relationships
      between three major challenges in PWS: 1) dysregulated feeding behaviour, 2) cognitive
      performance, and 3) chronic stress. The investigators will measure brain response to food
      cues, during a cognitive task, and at rest using magnetoencephalography (MEG) in adolescents
      with PWS and BMI-matched controls. This is an innovative design as previous studies in this
      population used only functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine food cue
      reactivity, which does not directly measure neuronal activity and lacks temporal-sensitivity.
      In contrast, MEG directly records neural firing and combines high spatial resolution with
      exquisite temporal resolution, allowing us to measure functional connectivity between brain
      regions. Importantly, MEG is also patient-friendly with fewer contraindications than MRI. To
      assess cognitive function, the investigators will utilize gold-standard neuropsychological
      measures, as well as emotional and social behavioural functioning. Lastly, the investigators
      will assess hair cortisol, which is a reflection of long term, month-by-month cortical
      exposure. This new area of research will explore neurobiological and cognitive mechanisms
      controlling feeding behaviour in PWS.

        Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) is characterized by hyperphagia, although the degree of food
        seeking can vary between individuals. The characteristic endocrine and metabolic
        dysfunction in PWS is indicative of abnormalities in the hypothalamus, and other brain
        systems. In addition to the hyperphagia and risk for obesity, anxiety is a prominent
        feature of PWS
