  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present trial will prospectively evaluate the accuracy of both a systematic predefined
      axillary ultrasound imaging together with tumor load quantification of suspicious and
      sentinel axillary lymph nodes to predict overall tumor load in the axilla.

    <textblock>
      Axillary node clearance (ANC) is a controversial intervention in the surgical treatment of
      breast cancer. Different studies have shown that in some patients with infiltrated axillary
      lymph nodes but low tumor burden, ANC can be safely omitted. However, indications for ANC
      persist in nowadays for patients with positive axillary lymph nodes and upfront surgery and
      patients with positive lymph nodes after neoadjuvant treatment. The present prospective study
      will evaluate the ability to establish an axillary tumor load with two steps. The first step
      will be a preoperative predefined systematic axillary ultrasound imaging workflow. The second
      step will be the tumor load evaluation of suspicious and sentinel axillary lymph nodes. We
      will also evaluate which patients have infiltrated nodes only beneath the second
      intercostobraquial nerve. The trial intends to identify patients for who a complete axillary
      node clearance could be spared.
