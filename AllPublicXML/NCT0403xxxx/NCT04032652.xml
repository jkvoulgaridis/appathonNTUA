  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to develop a novel method of estimating 5-ASA levels in the rectum at
      a mucosal level using in vivo rectal dialysis technique towards the eventual goal of
      determining the optimal dosing of Asacol速 that would provide therapeutic levels of 5-ASA in
      the left colon.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asacol速 is mesalazine in a pH-dependent tablet (Eudragit S) that remains intact until
      reaching the terminal ileum. The tablet dissolves at a pH 7 or greater, allowing mesalazine
      release in the terminal ileum and throughout the colon; hence, it would be anticipated that
      this form of 5-ASA will produce higher concentrations in the left colon in patients with
      active ulcerative colitis compared to other immediate release forms of 5-ASA. However,
      preliminary research using dynamic computer modeling and simulation predicted that patients
      with active ulcerative colitis (characterized by an increased stool frequency) treated with
      Asacol速 and Lialda (another delayed release formulation) will achieve very low 5-ASA levels
      in the sigmoid colon and rectum. The model predicts that these 5-ASA preparations will be
      relatively ineffective in treating the left side of the colon in active ulcerative colitis.
