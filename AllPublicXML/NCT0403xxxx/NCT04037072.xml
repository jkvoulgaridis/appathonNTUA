    <textblock>
      This study evaluates Mitomycin C as treatment for dysphagia in adult subjects with documented
      complex esophageal anastomotic strictures. Patients will be randomized in a double-blinded
      fashion to topical application of normal saline (NS) or Mitomycin C (MMC) at the time of time
      of index procedure.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent and HIPAA
             consent document

          -  Patients must have symptomatic (dysphagia ≥2), treatment naïve complex esophageal
             anastomotic stricture (length &gt;2 cm or diameter ≤9mm).

          -  Age ≥ 18

          -  Esophago-gastro or esophago-jejunal anastomosis with or without having undergone
             neoadjuvant or adjuvant radio-chemotherapy

          -  Any patient taking antiplatelet agents such as Plavix, Effient, Brilinta, Aggrenox
             must be able to hold the drugs 5 days prior to dilation and may resume 3 days after
             the dilation.

          -  Any patient on vitamin K antagonists such as warfarin must be able to hold the drugs 5
             days prior to dilation and may resume 3 days after the dilation. INR should be checked
             for such patients at least 24 hours before dilation and it must be &lt; 1.5

          -  Patients taking direct thrombin inhibitors such as Pradaxa, Angiomax must be able to
             hold the drugs 5 days prior to dilation and may resume 3 days after the dilation

          -  Patients taking Factor Xa inhibitors must be able to hold the drugs 2 days prior to
             dilation and may resume 3 days after dilation

          -  Patients taking GIIB/IIIA inhibitors must be able to hold the drugs1 day prior to
             dilation and resume 3 days after the dilation.

          -  Patients taking unfractionated heparin must be able to hold the drug 6 hours before
             dilation and low molecular weight heparin must be held 24 hours before dilation.
             Unfractionated heparin may resume immediately after the dilation while low molecular
             weight heparin may resume 3 days after dilation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with malignant strictures

          -  Patients with non-complex benign strictures.

          -  Patients with anastomosis creation within ≤ 2 weeks

          -  Patients with suspected gastrointestinal perforation or leak that could result in
             extraluminal extravasation of Mitomycin C

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Pregnant or breast feeding. Refer to section 4.4 for further detail.

          -  Patients receiving systemic chemotherapy during the treatment of esophageal stricture.
