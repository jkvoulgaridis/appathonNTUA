  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main risk factors for failure after single-incision slings are reduced urethral mobility
      and stress urinary incontinence severity in long-term follow-up.

      The medical records of the 132 patients were retrospectively analyzed. Preoperative
      assessment included medical history and urogynecological examination. Patients were asked to
      answer validated questionnaires such as Urinary Distress Inventory (UDI-6) and Incontinence
      Impact Questionnaire (IIQ-7). Objective cure of SUI was defined as the absence of
      demonstrable leakage of urine on the cough stress test. Subjective cure was based on negative
      response to UDI-6, question 3. Patients were divided according to objective cure rate into
      two groups: cured (Group A) and failed patients (Group B).
