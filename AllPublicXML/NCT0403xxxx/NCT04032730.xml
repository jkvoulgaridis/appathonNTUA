  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the proposed study is to enhance adherence and retention in care for M/XDR-TB HIV
      patients through enhanced standard of care, targeted transition to outpatient medication
      self-administration prior to hospital discharge, and use of community adherence groups, with
      an overarching goal of promoting patient engagement in a care continuum.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tuberculosis (TB) remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide among people
      living with HIV (1). Globally, the incidence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and
      extensively drug resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB), the most drug-resistant forms of TB, has
      approximately doubled over the past fifteen years (1-3). Nowhere has this increased incidence
      generated more concern than in South Africa where interactions between TB and generalized HIV
      epidemics are causing 'explosive' TB incidence (4-6) and case-fatality are threatening to
      undermine the progress reached with antiretroviral therapy (ART) (7, 8).

      Medication adherence, a key predictor of outcomes in M/XDR-TB and HIV treatment, is
      understudied in high burden TB-HIV settings (9-11). Patient losses during transitions in the
      care continuum are frequent (12), increase mortality and limit control of the linked
      epidemics. Demands of M/XDR-TB HIV treatment are severe including extraordinary pill burden,
      severe adverse effects, lengthy treatment, isolation and stigma with few parallels in modern
      medicine (13-15).

    <description>Participants assigned to the intervention arm will undergo extensive counselling, participants will be provided with an electronic pillbox that monitors their adherence to one of their TB and one of their ART medication. Based on the recordings provided by the wisepill device we will determine if a participant is adherent to their medication and intervene with counselling, phone calls, home visits and relevant referrals.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive a Wisepill device for TB and ART medications. Participants will receive an exit counselling session prior to being discharged.
Participants will select the content of a text message to be sent when missing a dose as measured by Wisepill non-opening during medication dose-window.
Participants will receive a post-discharge phone call by study staff for the purpose of identifying any early challenges or obstacles. All participants may receive a titrated Wisepill intervention (TWI) consisting of a text message, phone call, and/or study home visit triggered by medication non-adherence as detected by Wisepill non-opening.
All participants will receive a monthly counselling intervention (MCI). Adherence support groups (ASG) will be conducted on a monthly basis.</description>
