    <textblock>
      The main objectives of this study are:

      i) To determine patient-level, physician-level and health system factors influencing
      therapeutic decisions in multiple sclerosis (MS) care by applying conjoint discrete
      experiments.

      ii) To determine the prevalence of therapeutic inertia among participating neurologists.

      iii) To compare clinical judgement vs. a qualitative or quantitative approach when assessing
      for a given case-scenario.

      iv) To evaluate the influence of decision fatigue in treatment decisions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The landscape of MS care is changing. Currently, there are over 15 disease modifying agents
      (DMTs) available to treat MS, with varying availability around the world.

      Significant heterogeneity exists in the efficacy and risks associated with these therapies.

      Neurologists caring for MS patients face important choices in each medical encounter: 1)
      continue with the same management, 2) initiate or escalate therapy for a more effective or
      safer agent, or 3) consider a reassessment within months under the uncertainty of the current
      status of the patient.

      Limited information on how physicians weigh in different factors when making therapeutic
      decisions.

      Physicians (cognitive biases affecting decision making) and health system (e.g. access to an
      infusion center) factors are the most responsible causes of practice gaps in MS care. The
      physician's component is the least studied.

      Therapeutic inertia (TI) is a common phenomenon in MS care defined as lack of treatment
      initiation or escalation (e.g. switch interferons or glatiramer to fingolimod /alemtuzumab
      /natalizumab/ocrelizumab/ etc.) when recommended by guidelines or evidence of disease
      progression. This phenomenon leads to poorer patient's outcomes, greater disability, and
      diminished quality of life.

      Goals of the study: i) to determine what are the most relevant factors influencing
      therapeutic decisions among neurologists with expertise in MS care; ii) to asses whether
      physicians rely on medical information provided in a case scenario versus a quantitative or
      qualitative estimation of disease progression based on hypothetical models.

    <description>The therapeutic inertia (TI) score is based on our previous work published elsewhere (see references). It is based on the sum number of case-scenarios that required treatment escalation over the total number of presented scenarios (10).
Range: 0 (lowest value) to 10 (maximal value). The higher value represents the higher level of therapeutic inertia. There is no subscale. This measurement has been previously reported (Saposnik et al. JAMA Netw Open. 2019 Jul 3;2(7):e197093. doi: 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2019.7093; Saposnik et al. MDM Policy Pract. 2019 Jun 21;4(1):2381468319855642. doi: 10.1177/2381468319855642)</description>

    <description>Given that participants will be exposed to several case-scenarios, a comparison of therapeutic inertia will be conducted between the first half and the second half of case scenarios as previously reported (Saposnik et al. Front Neurol. 2017 Aug 21;8:430. doi: 10.3389/fneur.2017.00430. eCollection 2017).</description>

    <description>Comparison of treatment decisions using a binary definition of therapeutic inertia (TI). Lack of treatment escalation in at least one case-scenario (out of the total) will be considered as TI present as previously reported ((Saposnik et al. JAMA Netw Open. 2019 Jul 3;2(7):e197093. doi: 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2019.7093; Saposnik et al. MDM Policy Pract. 2019 Jun 21;4(1):2381468319855642. doi: 10.1177/2381468319855642)</description>

    <description>Participants will be exposed to 12 pairs of case-scenarios as per the discrete choice design. Participants have to choose the ideal case-scenario (e.g. A, B or neither- but they cannot choose both) for escalating treatment. Each pair of case-scenarios represent a comprehensive combination of possible variables. The most common factors associated with treatment escalation will be assessed based on these experimental design. A weighted estimate will be calculated for each collected variable.

    <description>Participants will be exposed to case-scenarios. Each case scenario provides a description of the current clinical situation (e.g. patient age, current treatment, number of relapses, current EDSS, MRI findings, etc). In addition, participants will see a squared box indicating the probability of risk progression (20%, 25%, 85%, 90%). This information may or may not be accurate to reflect potential errors of risk prediction tools.</description>

Each case scenario provides a description of the current clinical situation (e.g. patient age, current treatment, number of relapses, current EDSS, MRI findings, etc). In addition, participants will see a squared box indicating a qualitative probability of risk progression (low, high).
