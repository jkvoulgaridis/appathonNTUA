  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lower extremity (LE) function of patients with a spinal cord injury (SCI) will be assessed in
      an observational project with a cross-sectional and a longitudinal study design. The main
      goal is to identify kinematic and kinetic parameters to precisely characterize LE function
      and in parallel the impairment and limitation in SCI patients throughout rehabilitation in
      acute patients and in chronic patients to define LE function and LE recovery.
