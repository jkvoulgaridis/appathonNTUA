  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Globally, about 248 million people are chronic HBV surface antigen carriers, and about 5% of
      them also had hepatitis delta virus (HDV) infection as well. The prevalence of HBsAg in Egypt
      is intermediate (2-7%) .

      Hepatitis D virus (HDV) is an incomplete RNA virus that needs hepatitis B surface antigen
      (HBsAg) to help its replication. HDV is considered a subviral particle because it depends on
      HBV for its propagation. Combined HDV- HBV infection produces more severe liver affection
      than HBV alone.

      HDV infection leads to both of acute and chronic liver illnesses. Acute HDV infection can
      occur at the same time with acute HBV infection (coinfection) or can be superimposed on the
      top of chronic HBV infection. About 20% to 30% of coinfections of HDV and HBV in humans
      develop fatal fulminant hepatitis versus 2% of patients with acute hepatitis B
      mono-infection. Worldwide, Hepatitis D virus (HDV) infection present in more than 15 million
      people and it is endemic in the Middle East . In Upper Egypt, data about the prevalence,
      clinical, laboratory and virological characters of Hepatitis D virus-infected patients is
      rare.

      This study aims were:

        1. To estimate the prevalence of hepatitis D virus infection among HBsAg positive
           individuals.

        2. To determine the clinical, laboratory and virological characters of HDV infected
           patients.

        This study was a hospital-based, prospective, cross-sectional analytic one. The study was
        carried out on 186 HBsAg positive cases who were recruited from Tropical Medicine and
        Gastroenterology Department, Al Rajhi Liver Hospital, Assiut University, and Sohag
        University Hospital during two years.The Participants accepted to participate in the study.
