  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim is to develop and assess an intervention to enhance initiation and adherence to
      PrEP among HIV negative young women of high risk (YWHR). The specific aims are (1) To conduct
      formative research to enhance our understanding of the dynamics of the social and sexual
      networks, and context of young HIV-uninfected women (aged 15-24) engaged in high risk sexual
      behavior in Kampala, Uganda (2) Document barriers and opportunities for PrEP uptake and
      adherence as well as repeat HIV testing by self test; (3) To develop and test a socially and
      culturally acceptable and feasible prevention intervention on uptake and adherence to PrEP
      and HIV self-testing for young women at high risk for HIV.
