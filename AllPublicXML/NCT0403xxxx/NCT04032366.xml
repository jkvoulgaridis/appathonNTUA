  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to clarify the possible mechanism of hypoxemia after surgical
      treatment of type A acute aortic dissection and the possible mechanism of the treatment role
      of inhaled nitric oxide in refractory hypoxemia.

      The investigators' previous study has stressed that inhaled nitric oxide therapy might play
      an ameliorative role in patients with refractory hypoxemia after surgical treatment of type A
      acute aortic dissection. The possible reason might be the decreasing of intrapulmonary shunt
      because previous studies showed that inhaled nitric oxide could decrease intrapulmonary shunt
      by selectively dilating the pulmonary vessels in ventilated areas. As a result, the
      investigators designed this observational study to calculate the intrapulmonary shunt before
      and after inhaled nitric oxide therapy. Intrapulmonary shunt was calculated from oxygen
      content (CO2) of different sites ( artery, mixed venous, alveolar capillary) by Fick
      equation:(CaO2-CcO2)/(CvO2-CcO2). A FiO2 of 1.0 and tidal volume of 6~8 ml/kg were chosen.
      Oxygen content was calculated from hemoglobin (Hb), oxygen saturation (SO2) and oxygen
      partial pressure (PO2) by the following equation: CO2 = 1.34*Hb*SO2 + 0,0031*PO2. PaO2, SaO2,
      PvO2 and SvO2 were measured from arterial and mixed venous blood samples taken from the
      radial arterial catheter and from the pulmonary artery catheter. ScO2 was estimated to be 1.0
      with a FiO2 of 100%. PcO2 was considered to be the same as PAO2 (partial pressure of oxygen
      in the alveoli), and was calculated from the alveolar gas equation with PAO2 = [(atmospheric
      pressure - 47) * (FiO2)] - PaCO2/0.8.Other variables such as hemodynamic variables from
      pulmonary artery catheter were also collected.
