  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness of a structured educational intervention in
      physical exercise &quot;Active Legs&quot; as an adjuvant treatment to improve the healing of chronic
      venous ulcers at 3 months of follow-up, compared with the usual practice in people treated in
      primary care. Secondary objectives: To evaluate if the intervention active legs as an
      adjuvant treatment produces better results than usual practice in: degree of healing,
      recurrence, complete healing at 6 months, pain and quality of life. Describe degree of
      adherence and satisfaction with the intervention. Design: Randomized, multicenter, pragmatic,
      open clinical trial of parallel groups with 6 months of follow-up. Setting: Primary Care
      Health Centers (Madrid). Subjects: Patients with venous ulcers, with treatment in the nursing
      consultation of the participating centers. Sample: 224 participants (112 in each group).
      Intervention: Both groups will receive the usual treatment of cleaning, debridement based on
      humid environment cure and multilayer compression therapy according to the recommendations of
      Community of Madrid. The intervention group will also receive the structured educational
      intervention of lower limbs physical exercise and daily walking patterns. Variables: Main:
      complete healing at 3 months follow-up. Secondary: Degree of healing; ulcer area; quality of
      life; pain, related to the healing process, prognosis and recurrences; Sociodemographic and
      related adherence and satisfaction. Data analysis: Main effectiveness: comparison of the
      incidence of ulcers with complete healing at 3 months of follow-up in both groups, time to
      complete healing (Kaplan-Meier and Log-rank test). Adjustment of prognostic factors (Cox
      regression).

    <description>ACTIVE LEGS: The usual care plus experimental intervention. It is a structured educational intervention, directed by nurses and carried out in the health center consultations. The intervention &quot;Active Legs&quot; has been designed based on the available evidence. It incorporates a program of lower limb exercise at home and daily walking patterns.
Home program of lower limb exercises. The nurse will instruct the patients in the performance of 4 exercises of lower limbs of progressive difficulty that must be performed at home 5 days a week, twice a day Daily walking program. In addition, patients must ambulate progressively until reaching the marked goal (150 min / week (30 minutes for 5 days a week)) .
At the start of the study, the &quot;Active Legs&quot; diary will be provided, showing the patterns of the exercise and walking program graphically and a pedometer.</description>
