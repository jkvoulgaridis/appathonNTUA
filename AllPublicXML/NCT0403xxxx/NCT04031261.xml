    <measure>Severe Asthma Questionnaire (SAQ) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Part 1: National Validation - Only cross-sectional data recorded within 2 weeks after enrollment (enrollment period of 6 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The new questionnaire will provide a combined assessment of disease and its treatment on the quality of life of patients with severe asthma. The scale is based on existing Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) scales but modified for the severe population and provides assessments of the effect of asthma symptoms and the effect of asthma medicines. The SAQ was produced from detailed qualitative research. The questionnaire has 16 items, scored on a 1-7 scale (a higher score indicating better quality of life). The mean score of these 16 questions is calculated to produce an overall score.
An additional 3 items are included to asses overall HRQoL, and HRQoL during different months of the year. These three questions are scored on a 100 point scale with a higher score indicating better HRQoL.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Severe Asthma Questionnaire (SAQ) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Part 2: Sensitivity to change: Collected at 0 (baseline) 4, 8, 12 &amp; 16 weeks, (enrollment period of 10 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The Severe Asthma Questionnaire (SAQ) will be collected at 5 time points and matched with the Global Rating of Change questionnaire at these time points to determine the SAQ's Minimum Clinically Important Difference (MCID).
The questionnaire has 16 items, scored on a 1-7 scale (a higher score indicating better quality of life). The mean score of these 16 questions is calculated to produce an overall score.
An additional 3 items are included to asses overall HRQoL, and HRQoL during different months of the year. These three questions are scored on a 100 point scale with a higher score indicating better HRQoL.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Mini Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (MiniAQLQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Part 1: National Validation &amp; Part 2: Sensitivity to change - Collected at 0 (baseline) weeks, within two weeks after enrollment (enrollment period of 6 or 10 months respectively)</time_frame>
    <description>This 15-item scale is commonly used as the quality of life scale in asthma studies. It consists of 15 questions which are scored on on a 1-7 scale, with a higher score indicating better health related quality of life. Whilst the MiniAQLQ can be scored as four separate domains (Symptoms, Activity Limitations, Emotional Functional and Environmental Stimuli), these will not be used. Instead the mean score of the 15 questions will be used as the MiniAQLQ score.
For the purpose of validation, we wish to show that this scale correlates with the burden of symptoms but not, or with a much lower correlation, with the burden of treatment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Asthma Control Test (ACT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Part 1: National Validation - Only cross-sectional data recorded within 2 weeks after enrollment (enrollment period of 6 months), Part 2: Sensitivity to change - Collected at 0 (baseline) 4, 8, 12 &amp; 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Note: Recruiting sites are able to chose which Asthma Control Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) to contribute data for, (The ACT or the ACQ).
The Asthma Control Test (ACT) is a 5-item scale is commonly used as a measure of asthma control in asthma studies. It is scored on a scale of 1-5 with a higher score indicating better asthma control. For the purpose of validation, we wish to show that this scale correlates with the burden of symptoms but not, or with a much lower correlation, with the burden of treatment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ)</measure>

    <description>The Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) contains 7 items and takes into consideration FEV1% predicted and daily use of rescue bronchodilator. Patients respond to 7 items concerning their symptom severity on a 0-6 scale (0 = no impairment, 6 = maximum impairment). The mean of the 7-items will be used as the score of the ACQ.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>EQ-5D-5L</measure>
    <time_frame>Part 1: National Validation - Only cross-sectional data recorded within 2 weeks after enrollment (enrollment period of 6 months) , Part 2: Sensitivity to change - Collected at 0 (baseline) &amp; 16 weeks within 2 weeks of enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>This is a 5-item scale scored from 1-5 with a higher score indicating worse health. For the purposes of this study, the mean score of the five items will be used as the score for the EQ5D. In addition to the 5 items, the EQ-5D-5L also includes a category rating scale to rate their quality of life on the day of completion. This is scored from 0-100 with a higher score indicating better health.
This scale is commonly used in clinical trials to determine improvement in patients' perceived quality of life.
The correlations between EQ-5D-5L scores and SAQ scores will be explored.</description>

    <description>This scale will be used by participants to indicate how much better they feel since commencing a biologic treatment for asthma. The 11-point scale ranges from -5 (a great deal worse) to 5 (A great deal better).</description>
