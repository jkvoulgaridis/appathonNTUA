      Diagnostic error, Dual process model of reasoning) During the last decade, much emphasis has
      been placed on system solutions to patient safety problems. However, diagnostic error,
      despite being responsible for twice as many adverse events as medication error, has received
      little attention. The rate of diagnostic errors have been estimated to be between 0.6% to
      12%.Some estimates are as high as 15%.The rate of negative outcome or adverse effects of
      diagnostic errors range from 6.9% to 17%. Most authors accept that the dual process model of
      reasoning explains how clinicians make diagnoses. The purpose of this study is to investigate
      why diagnostic errors occurred in the emergency departments (EDs).

      reasoning explains how clinicians make diagnoses. The purpose of this study is to investigate
      why diagnostic errors occurred in the emergency departments (EDs). A qualitative study
      approach was used with in-depth semi-structured interviews conducted with emergency
      physicians to investigate the cognitive diagnosis process. The study takes place in the EDs
      of three hospitals in Taiwan. We chose the participants using a purposive sampling technique
      to yield a sample that would be most likely contribute significant information on the
      diagnostic process. Sampling continued until novel information was no longer being gathered.
      All audiotapes were transcribed verbatim. The transcripts are analyzed by two of the
      investigators based on the ground theory. Once all relevant codes were identified, they were
      grouped together into meaningful categories. These categories were then grouped under
      appropriate themes, which were used to generate a theory of diagnostic errors.
