  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to compare the effect of DAILIES TOTAL1, a low water
      content silicone hydrogel lens, and Biotrue ONEday, a high water content hydrogel lens, on
      the rate of tear evaporation. The study will also serve to validate the novel, in-house
      developed evaporimeter.
