    <textblock>
      Background : Acute exacerbations of COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) are frequent
      events in the course of the disease and they can deteriorate the respiratory function of the
      patients, impact their quality of life and even potentially threaten their life. It is
      therefore crucial to prevent these exacerbations from occurring.

      Aim of the study : Investigate how cardiorespiratory parameters of COPD patients differ
      between exacerbation phases and their nominal state in order to identify predictors of COPD
      exacerbations.

      Study design : Patients admitted at one of the investigation centers on a suspicion of COPD
      exacerbation will be enrolled on a voluntary basis. Enrolled patients' cardiorespiratory
      parameters will be monitored with a connected wrist-worn pulse oximeter (BORA Band) during
      the hospitalisation phase and one month after they have been discharged.

      Setting : 4 investigative centers across Brittany

      Patients : 50 patients will be enrolled in the study
