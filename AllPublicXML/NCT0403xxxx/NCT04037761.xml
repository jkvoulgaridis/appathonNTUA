    <measure>Child Care Environment</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The ICCE measures child care environment through 13 questions in four subscales: &quot;human stimulation&quot; , &quot;social stimulation&quot;, &quot;avoidance of restriction&quot;, and &quot;social support&quot;. It can be used as a self-report or interview, meaning that it does not necessarily need a home visit. Each item is assessed using a multiple-choice format, and the answer is given a binary score according to the manual (1 = good, 0 = not good or not sure); the overall score is calculated by summing all items in the scale. A higher score indicates a better child care environment.</description>

It has also been shown to have good person-separation reliability (0.82). Parents were asked to indicate the frequency of 12 parent-child interactive activities they engaged in during the past month on a scale of 0-5 (0 = not occurring, 5 = very frequent). The questionnaire measures the quantity of the most common activities of learning related, reading, recreation, and interaction with environment.
