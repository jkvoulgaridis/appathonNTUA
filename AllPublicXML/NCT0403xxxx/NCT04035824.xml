  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastrodia and Uncaria Recipe is a well-known effective prescription in Traditional Chinese
      Medicine (TCM) to treat hypertension of liver yang hyperactivity type, which manifests
      symptom of headache or dizziness. However, it lacks consolidated evidence by multi-center
      randomized controlled trials. The hypothesis of this study is that Gastrodia and Uncaria
      granule may have significant anti-hypertensive effect on patients with stage-one hypertension
      and liver-yang hyperactivity syndrome than placebo.

      This study is a randomized, controlled, multi-center, double-blind clinical trial. This study
      aims to recruit 500 hypertension patients who 1) are untreated or taking anti-hypertensive
      medicine for at least two weeks and 2) have an office systolic blood pressure of 140-159
      mmHg, an office diastolic blood pressure of &lt;100 mmHg, and a 24-hour ambulatory mean systolic
      blood pressure of &gt;=130 mmHg. The patients will be stratified according to center, sex, and
      the TCM type of liver yang hyperactivity/ liver yang non-hyperactivity, and are then randomly
      assigned to the treatment of Gastrodia and Uncaria granules or placebo for 2 months. The
      blood pressure lowering effect is evaluated by 24-hour ambulatory systolic blood pressure
      (primary outcome) / diastolic blood pressure, as well as by home and office blood pressures.
