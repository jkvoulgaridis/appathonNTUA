    <textblock>
      The PFC Sigma Knee by DePuy Synthes is an excellent knee replacement with an excellent
      clinical track record, good survival rates (98% 10 years survival in patients aged &lt; 55
      years) and minimal early migration as measured with RSA (0.5mm MTPM at two years follow-up).

      The Attune Knee by DePuy Synthes is an advancement in knee replacement options. It is
      designed to provide better range of motion and address the unstable feeling some patients
      experience during everyday activities, such as stair descent and bending. To date, more than
      470,000 patients have received an Attune Knee and positive feedback was received regarding
      patient recovery, stability and motion.

      The objective of this study is to accurately assess and compare migration, clinical and
      radiological outcome and patient reported outcomes of two knee prostheses: the Cemented
      Attune Fixed Bearing Cruciate Retaining Knee System and the Cemented PFC Sigma Fixed Bearing
      Cruciate Retaining Knee System, both by DePuy Synthes, Warsaw, Indiana, USA. The primary
      objective of this study is to compare the magnitude and pattern of migration of the
      prostheses (Femoral and Tibial component). The secondary objective of this study is to
      compare clinical and radiological outcome of the prostheses and PROMS.

      This study is designed as a single-blind, randomized trial between the Attune Knee System and
      PFC Sigma Knee System. 32 patients with the Attune Knee System and 32 patients with PFC Sigma
      Knee System will be included in this study.

      The study population will consist of patients with symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee
      scheduled for knee replacement surgery at the Department of Orthopaedics, Haags Medisch
      Centrum The Hague (HMC), The Netherlands. Annually 350 TKA procedures are performed in this
      department, of which about 90% is Osteo Arthritis (OA) and 10% Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) and
      other indications. We anticipate that inclusion can be accomplished within a 1 year period
      and that the total study duration is 3 years.

      Main study parameters/endpoints are:

        -  Migration, measured by means of RSA.

        -  Patient Reported Outcome Measures by means of questionnaires.

Migration is defined as the relative movement of the prosthesis with respect to the markers in the bone.
MTPM is defined as Maximum Total Point Motion, which means the amount of motion of the point that moves the most.</description>

          -  Patient is diagnosed with osteoarthritis and requires primary knee arthroplasty

          -  All consecutive patients (&quot;usual care&quot;) are included to prevent selection bias in the
             migration analysis.

          -  Patient is capable of giving informed consent and expressing a willingness to comply
             with this study

               -  The patient is diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis

                  attachment of the PCL (because of bony defects)

          -  The patient is unable or unwilling to sign the Informed Consent specific to this study

          -  The patient does not understand the Dutch or English language good enough to

          -  Patients indicated for revision arthroplasty instruments because of bone defects or
             deformity of the bone
