  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current urological therapeutic modalities are represented by extracorporeal lithotripsy
      (ECL), rigid (URS) or flexible (URSsple) uretero-renoscopy and percutaneous nephrolithotomy
      (PCNL).

      They make it possible to extract the vast majority of stones by minimally invasive techniques
      but leave behind small residual lithic fragments (FR) that can always cause pain, infection,
      or promote the development of a larger stone.

      A non-invasive technique that can help eliminate them would be of great benefit to many
      patients by avoiding painful recurrences and limiting reprocessing; combined with appropriate
      medical management, it would limit the rate of remote recurrences and long-term
      complications.

      The treatment called &quot;hydro-posturotherapy&quot; has been developed in some spas that are approved
      for kidney diseases such as Vittel or Capvern. It includes several modalities:
      posturotherapy, lumbar percussion and hyperdiuresis.

      The main objective is to compare at 3 months, on the unprepared abdomen (ASP) and the
      low-dose scanner without injection, the elimination of kidney stone fragments under the
      effect of a short spa treatment with posturotherapy, lumbar percussion and controlled
      hyperdiuresis compared to the recommended standard treatment. The result will be assessed in
      3 categories: complete elimination (SF: &quot;without fragments&quot; or &quot;stone-free&quot;), elimination of
      more than 50% of the fragments; elimination of less than 50% of the fragments.

      Randomized multicenter controlled clinical trial comparing hydroposturotherapy in short
      thermal cure with standard hyperdiuresis in patients with residual stones, especially lower
      caliciels after urological treatment.

      5 inclusion centres

        -  Central Hospital, Nancy

        -  Nancy Urology Center

        -  Clinique de la Croix du Sud in Toulouse

        -  Edouard Herriot Hospital in Lyon

      The radiological images will be reviewed by the radiology department of the Central Hospital,
      Nancy.

    <description>The SF 36 questionnaire is a questionnaire measuring quality of life with 36 items grouped into 8 scales: physical activity, limitation/physical state, physical pain, perceived health, vitality, life/relationships, psychological health, limitation/psychological state
The SF-36 is not suitable for producing an overall summary score. Indeed, the information in the individual responses is lost in the total score of the scale (since the total score can be obtained in different ways from the individual responses of the items). The recommended rating system for SF-36 is a Likert weighted system for each item. The items in the subscales are totalled to obtain a summary score for each subscale or dimension. Each of the 8 summary scores is linearly transformed on a scale from 0 (negative for health) to 100 (positive for health) to obtain a score for each subscale.</description>
