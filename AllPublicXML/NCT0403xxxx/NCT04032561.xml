  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted during the period of, January 2019 - August 2019 with
      pre-diabetic participants on a NHS England funded National Diabetes Prevention Program (NDPP)
      with a clinically diagnosed Haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) referral reading of between 42mmol/mol -
      47mmol/mol within the last 12 months. The term pre-diabetic can all be used to explain blood
      glucose levels that are higher than normal, but not high enough for participants to be
      diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes. Having high blood glucose levels can increase a participant's
      risk of developing Type 2 diabetes and other health complications, although this is not
      inevitable.

      100 participants will take part in the study. Participants will be eligible if they are aged
      between 18 and 65 years and have an HbA1c referral reading of between 42-47mmol/mol within
      the last 12 months.

      The participants will be given a written consent form to sign to take part in the study,
      after receiving both written and verbal information beforehand on the study protocol from the
      researcher. Health screening to determine eligibility for the NHS funded program will be
      undertaken directly by the intervention provider.

      Study design and procedures:

      The study will be delivered in a controlled format and will be designed to assess the
      relationship between the elevation of HbA1c level, sleep quality and sleep duration in
      clinically diagnosed pre-diabetic participants referred and registered to join the NHS NDPP.
      Participants will receive a pre-program information pack in conjunction with a sleep quality
      and sleep duration questionnaire at the end of their 1:1 initial appointments for the NHS
      NDPP.

      Participants will be given prepaid envelopes to send their anonymised questionnaires back to
      the researcher once completed after their appointments. The researcher will ensure
      confidentiality by keeping all questionnaires in a securely combination coded locked cupboard
      that only the researcher has access to. Participants will be instructed to not write their
      names on the questionnaires but to only state their gender, age, and referral HbA1c reading
      received from the relevant health care professional.
