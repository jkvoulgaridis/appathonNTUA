  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Posterior Spinal fusion (PSF) is one of the most invasive orthopedic surgical procedures in
      children and adolescents, often characterized by extensive tissue trauma, and severe
      postoperative pain. In addition to pain, the postoperative period is complicated by the side
      effects of opioids such as nausea and vomiting, itching and sedation. Various studies have
      shown that pain in the direct postoperative phase is an important determinant for development
      of chronic post-surgical pain.

      The consequences of untreated acute pain are known and can also contribute to chronification
      in pain.

    <textblock>
      Surgical correction of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is indicated for severe
      deformity. Posterior Spinal fusion (PSF) for AIS is one of the most invasive orthopedic
      surgical procedures in children and adolescents, often characterized by a large surgical
      incision, extensive tissue trauma, risk of blood loss, longer operating times and severe
      postoperative pain. In addition to pain, the postoperative period is complicated by the side
      effects of opioids such as nausea and vomiting, itching and sedation. All of this can, along
      with under-treatment of postoperative pain, be an important delaying factor in postoperative
      recovery and rehabilitation with a late hospital discharge and increased patient
      dissatisfaction. Various studies have shown that pain in the direct postoperative phase is an
      important determinant for development of chronic post-surgical pain.

      The consequences of untreated pain are known and can also contribute to chronification in
      pain.

      The incidence of chronic post-surgical pain after scoliosis fusion is 22% at 6 months and
      11-15% at 1 to 5 years postoperatively. It is therefore important to minimize the pain during
      the first postoperative days. Untreated pain in patients is far from benign with significant
      negative short and long term consequences with accompanying reduction in rehabilitation
      duration, sleep quality of life. To date, there is no scientific evidence that some analgesic
      policy is superior, making adequate and safe pain relief and associated anti-emetic therapy
      after PSF a challenge makes for all healthcare providers involved.
