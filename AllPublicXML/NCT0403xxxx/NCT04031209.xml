  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective and prospective, multi-center, non-comparative, post market clinical
      follow-up study involving orthopedic surgeons skilled in THA and experienced implanting the
      devices included in this study.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of the study are to document the performance and safety of the G7 Dual
      Mobility System when used in primary total hip arthroplasty for the treatment of femoral neck
      fracture by analysis of standard scoring systems, radiographs, revision and adverse event
      records.The study will include a maximum of 15 centers and up to 300 implanted hips. Each
      center may enroll up to a maximum of 40 hips to permit the consistency of outcomes across a
      variety of investigators and clinical setting

    <time_frame>Up to 5 years post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The Oxford Hip score consist of 12 disease-specific questions measuring patient-reported pain and function of the hip joint. Responses to each question are formatted as a 5-point Likert scale, scored from 0 (the worst outcome/most symptoms) to 4 (the best outcome / least symptoms). The scores for each question are added together for a final result between 0 and 48.</description>

    <measure>Quality of life by EQ-5D-5L questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>This 5-level EQ-5D version (EQ-5D-5L) consists of 2 pages: the EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS). The descriptive system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. A 1-digit number expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state. The health states may be converted into a single index value where 1 represents full health and 0 represents death. The EQ VAS records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale, where the endpoints are labelled 'The best health you can imagine' and 'The worst health you can imagine'.</description>

    <measure>Quality of life by JHEQ</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The Japanese Orthopaedic Association hip disease evaluation questionnaire (JHEQ) is a self-administered questionnaire that evaluates the quality of life in patients with hip disease. The questionnaire consists of three subscales: pain (28 points), movement (28 points), and mental (28 points), with higher scores indicating a better outcome. This measurement is applicable to Japanese population only.</description>

    <measure>Pain and Functional Performance by JOA Hip Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) hip score consists of four subcategories: pain (Pain, 40 points), range of motion (ROM, 20 points), ability to walk (Gait, 20 points), and activities of daily life (ADL, 20 points), with higher scores indicating a better outcome. This measurement is applicable to Japanese population only.</description>

        The study population will consist of patients who required primary THA for treatment of
        femoral neck fracture and satisfy eligibility criteria outlined in this section. In order
        to avoid potential selection bias, each investigator will offer study participation to each
        consecutive eligible patient presenting as a candidate for primary THA using G7 Dual
        Mobility System.
