  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neurocognitive deficits are frequent with people suffering from schizophrenia. Unlike
      positive symptoms, cognitive deficits are not reduced with antipsychotic medication. They can
      be very disabling, especially for social and professional rehabilitation. Cognitive deficits
      can concern primary processes such as attention or more integrative processes. Social
      cognition is also massively altered. As a consequence, decision making is often altered with
      the presence of the 'jumping to conclusion' (JTC) phenomenon. People that jump to conclusion
      are making decisions without having the necessary information to be sure of their judgment.
      In addition, people suffering from schizophrenia also present differences in cerebral
      activity. For instance, the P300 involved in executive processes appears later and with a
      smaller amplitude. Many cognitive remediation programs have been created to overcome these
      deficits. Their efficiency has been proved. However, their effects on cerebral activity have
      not been studied extensively in literature, especially concerning decision making changes.
      The present project will use a cognitive remediation program centered on social decision
      making to test its efficiency on JTC and the potential changes in cerebral activity it can
      induce. This program, inspired by the SCIT (Social Cognition and Interaction Technique) will
      be based on 10 sessions (1 each week). Participants will be tested before and after
      remediation/control group with 3 experimental tasks. Cerebral activity will be measured with
      an EEG cap. They will also undergo a neuropsychological evaluation and a symptomatology
      evaluation.

      Among cognitive deficits associated to schizophrenia, the jumping to conclusion bias is a
      frequent consequence of the decision making process alteration. This bias is characterized by
      a fast decision making when probabilistic judgments would be necessar.

      Cognitive remediation aims at reducing the impact of cognitive deficits. The program that
      will be used in the present study focuses on the jump to conclusion bias. In schizophrenia,
      the positive impact of programs targeting such a bias, and more generally social cognition,
      has already been shown in numerous studies. However, despite the fact that jumping to
      conclusion is one of the main goals of these programs, their effects on decision making are
      poorly investigated in literature.

      The program should impact decision making and reduce the jumping to conclusion bias. The
      benefits will probably be linked with a change in the P300 signal. They will probably appear
      earlier and with bigger amplitudes.
