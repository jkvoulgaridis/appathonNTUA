  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The six-minute walk test (6MWT) is a well established field exercise test to assess the
      functional exercise capacity in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The objective
      of this study is to assess the impact of walking behind the patient on 6MWT distance in
      patients with COPD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a single-center, randomized crossover study, the investigators aim to elucidate whether
      there is a difference in the 6MWT distance when the assessor walks behind the patient
      compared to the patient walking alone.

      Patients with COPD referred for pulmonary rehabilitation will be invited to perform an
      accompanied 6MWT (assessor walks behind the patient) and unaccompanied 6MWT (assessor does
      not walk behind the patient) in random order.

      The tests will be performed at the end of a pulmonary rehabilitation program, after patients
      are familiarised with the 6MWT testing procedure and learning effects can be excluded.
