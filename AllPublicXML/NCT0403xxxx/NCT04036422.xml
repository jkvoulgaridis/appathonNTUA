  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke occurs as a result of blood vessels of the brain becoming blocked or bleeding which in
      turn can result in loss of function in the limbs. Rehabilitation of patients following stroke
      includes repetitive, task based exercises to help regain normal limb function. Developments
      in stroke rehabilitation have resulted in more and more therapeutic options being available
      for inclusion in the treatment plan of stroke patients. The benefits of computerised task
      based arm and hand rehabilitation exercises in stroke rehabilitation are well known. Computer
      based rehabilitation supports the stroke patient in performing high intensity, multiple
      repetition exercises and in doing so encourages the regeneration of brain cells. In addition,
      it is believed that the stimulating environment provided by computerised exercise programs
      encourages the ability to problem solve and perform tasks. However, the effects of such
      computer based treatments on cognition have rarely been studied.

      In Turkey to date there are no community based, task specific computerised exercise
      programmes available to stroke sufferers. Such systems may provide inpatient and community
      based stroke sufferers with a practical and economical therapeutic option as a part of stroke
      rehabilitation. Moreover, this may provide the patient with a mode of ongoing, long term
      therapeutic exercise and maintenance of skills acquired in the hospital rehabilitation period
      shortly after stroke.

      The aim of this study was to investigate the benefits of computer based, task specific
      exercises when compared to conventional rehabilitation alone on arm and hand function,
      quality of life and cognition in stroke patients.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In developed countries only 5-10% of chronic stroke patients receive an active rehabilitation
      program. In Turkey, there is no community based rehabilitation program available to stroke
      patients in the subacute - chronic phase of the disease, even though it is known that
      functional gain can continue in this part of the disease when supported by an adequate
      rehabilitation program. Equally, functional gain can be lost over time if appropriate
      physical therapy is discontinued.

      Recent Advances in technology have allowed for the development of new approaches in stroke
      rehabilitation. Computer based treatment options include virtual reality (VR), robotic
      training and computer based task specific games. Computer based rehabilitation can encourage
      patients in performing high intensity, repetitive exercises which in turn aids
      neuroplasticity; the benefits of such treatments in upper extremity rehabilitation following
      stroke have been established. It is also believed that the stimulating environment provided
      by computed based exercises can enhance the development of problem solving and functionality
      in stroke patients. However, the effects of such technology on cognitive function in stroke
      patients has not been established in the literature. The disadvantages of VR and robotic
      training is that the necessary hard and software is often expensive and use of the machinery
      requires special training. Therefore, these options are often unavailable in rehabilitation
      centres. Contrary to this, computerized task specific gaming systems can be more economical
      and practical for both therapist and patient and can be used in the home environment without
      the necessity of direct supervision of a physiatrist.

      A review by Johansson et al. on home computer based task specific gaming exercises in stroke
      patients concluded that patients enjoyed the treatment but determining the benefits of
      treatment require further randomized control studies of better quality to be conducted. A
      pilot study based on a six week computer based task specific gaming exercise program in
      chronic stroke patients resulted in an improvement in learnt tasks and clinical evaluation.

      Rejoyce (Rehabilitation Joystick for Computerized Exercise), is a computer game based task
      specific exercise system developed by Rehabtronics Inc. for use as part of the treatment of
      stroke and spinal cord injury patients. Rejoyce aims to improve upper extremity and hand
      function by encouraging neuroplasticity through repeated task specific games.

      The aim of this study was to study the effects of computer game based task specific exercise
      system on upper extremity and hand function as well as cognitive function and quality of life
      compared to conventional rehabilitation in stroke patients.

      Patients who have developed a stroke in the past year and who have been admitted to our
      Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine (PRM) Department in Turkey for stroke rehabilitation
      will be included in the study. The total number of patients to be included in the study to
      obtain a study power of 80% and 5% type I error is thirty.

All patients will receive a one hourly 'one-on-one' session of physiotherapy five days a week to a total of twenty hours (four weeks) which includes strengthening, balance and walking exercises. In addition to this, one group will receive one hourly sessions of conventional occupational therapy which includes task based exercises aimed at improving upper arm dexterity, coordination and strength seven days a week to a total of twenty eight hours (four weeks), whereas patients in the other group will received half an hour of conventional occupational therapy and half an hour of Rejoyce computerized exercise to a total of twenty eight hours (four weeks).</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The Fugl-Meyer Upper Extremity (FMUE) Scale is a widely used and highly recommended stroke-specific, performance-based measure of impairment. It is designed to assess reflex activity, movement control and muscle strength in the upper extremity of people with post-stroke hemiplegia. It has been extensively used as an outcome measure in rehabilitation trials and to record poststroke recovery, particularly in the USA.
The FMUE Scale comprises 33 items, each scored on a scale of 0 to 2, where 0 = cannot perform, 1 = performs partially and 2 = performs fully. It is free, requires only household items for testing, and takes up to 30 minutes to administer.The total score ranges from 0-66 where 66. The higher the score the less the level of impairment.</description>

    <description>The Brunnstrom Stages of Stroke Recovery is a test that evaluates the motor development of stroke patients. In 1966, Signe Brunnstrom identified the stages of motor development observed in a large number of hemiplegic patients. In this staging, the hemiplegic upper extremity, lower extremity and hand are evaluated separately and the motor development of these three areas are staged from 1-6. The lowest stage according to this staging system is stage 1 (flask, no movement); the highest stage is stage 6 (normal motor function). Higher Brunnstrom stages indicate better motor development.</description>

    <description>The MMS is a test used to evaluate cognitive function which consists of eleven questions. The maximum score which can be obtained is thirty. The cut off score for normal cognitive function is 23. The MMS is divided into two sections, the first of which requires vocal responses only and covers orientation, memory, and attention; the maximum score is 21. The second part tests ability to name, follow verbal and written commands, write a sentence spontaneously, and copy a complex polygon similar to a Bender-Gestalt Figure; the maximum score is nine.

    <description>The MoCA is used to assess and detect mild cognitive impairment and has been shown to be a reliable tool in the assessment of cognitive function following acute onset of stroke. The MoCA is a thirty point test with a cut off for 'normal' cognition of 21. The MoCA consists of a series of questions aimed at evaluating short-term memory recall, visuospatial abilities, executive functions, attention, concentration, and working memory and language.</description>

    <description>The SS-QOL is a questionnaire used to evaluate a stroke patient's independence in activities of daily living, social role within the family and community and quality of life (QOL). The SS-QOL consists of 49 questions which are each given a score between 1 and 5 giving a total score between 49 and 245. The higher the total score the better the patient's QOL. The validity and reliability of the Turkish version of the SS-QOL has been studied.</description>
