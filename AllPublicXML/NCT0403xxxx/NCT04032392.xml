      To evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of autologous γδT cells in the treatment of
      advanced hepatitis B-related hepatocellular carcinoma.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-centre, non-randomised, open label, no control, prospective clinical trial.
      The study will include the following sequential phases: sign informed consent, γδT cells
      pre-culture, fresh biopsy and screening, apheresis, γδT cells preparation, treatment and
      follow-up. The study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of autologous γδT
      cells in patients with advanced hepatitis B related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) which are
      refractory to current treatment.

      Stage I comprising a safety cohort of patients to identify a safe dose, Stage II comprising
      an expanded patient group for response signal identification, Stage III to confirm efficacy
      and safety.
