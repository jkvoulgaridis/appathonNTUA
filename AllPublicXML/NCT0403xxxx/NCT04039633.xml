  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Erythromelalgia is a rare disorder characterized by red, warm, and painful extremities, which
      is often precipitated by warm conditions. The pathophysiology is incompletely understood. The
      management of pain in erythromelalgia is challenging as no single therapy has been found to
      be effective. Response to pharmacotherapy varies, meaning that the physician has to take a
      stepwise trial and error approach with each patient. Consequently, this disorder is often
      associated with poorer health-related quality of life. There is currently no consensus or
      guideline on management of pain in erythromelalgia. Spinal cord stimulation is a widely
      applied therapy to treat severe chronic pain of various origin. Case reports and anecdotal
      evidence suggest that this therapy might alleviate refractory pain in patients with
      erythromelalgia.

      The aim of this trial is to evaluate the efficacy of spinal cord stimulation for refractory
      pain in erythromelalgia.

    <description>questionnaire originally designed to quantify disability for degenerative conditions of the lumbar spine, possibly a relevant outcome measure also in patients with erythromelalgia as it covers intensity of pain, ability to care for oneself, ability to walk, ability to sit, ability to lift, sexual function, ability to stand, social life, sleep quality, and ability to travel. The index is scored from 0 to 100. Zero means no disability and 100 reflects maximum disability.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. A diagnosis of primary or idiopathic erythromelalgia

          2. Patients ≥18 years who have developed chronic pain that has remained refractory to
             medical treatment for ≥6 months.

          3. Minimum pain intensity of 5/10 on a numeric rating scale NRS at baseline.

          4. Successful two-week SCS testing period with tonic stimulation (≥2 points reduction in
             pain NRS from baseline). This means patients will experience paresthesia during the
             trial period of spinal cord stimulation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Coexisting conditions that would increase procedural risk (e.g., sepsis,
             coagulopathy).

          2. History of laminectomy or posterior fusion at the thoracolumbar junction, where
             percutaneous electrode end tips are routinely placed.

          3. Abnormal pain behavior and/or unresolved psychiatric illness.

          4. Unresolved issues of secondary gain or inappropriate medication use.

          5. Unfit for participation for any other reason as judged by the study physician.
