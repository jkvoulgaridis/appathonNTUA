  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate safety, immunogenicity and anti-tumor responses of intradermally delivered
      SNS-301 added to ongoing checkpoint inhibitor therapy in ASPH+ locally advanced unresectable
      or metastatic/recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) patients.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2, open-label, multi-center trial to evaluate the safety, immunogenicity
      and preliminary clinical efficacy of SNS-301 delivered intradermally in addition to
      pembrolizumab in patients with ASPH+ locally advanced unresectable or metastatic/recurrent
      SCCHN. The trial population consists of patients with ASPH+ locally advanced unresectable or
      metastatic/recurrent SCCHN who are currently receiving pembrolizumab or nivolumab therapy.
      Patients must have a best response of stable disease (SD) or first evidence of unconfirmed
      progressive disease (PD) after a minimum of 12 weeks of pembrolizumab or nivolumab therapy.
      Prior chemotherapy is allowed but not required. Patients receiving nivolumab will be switched
      over to pembrolizumab at the time of entering this study.
