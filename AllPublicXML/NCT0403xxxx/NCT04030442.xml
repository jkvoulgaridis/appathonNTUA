  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the proposed study is to investigate the interaction of cannabidiol (CBD) and
      morphine effects on pain sensitivity. Cannabidiol is a cannabinoid (similar to cannabis, or
      marijuana) present in marijuana that alters some of the effects of marijuana.

      Eligible participants will be asked to participate in a total of three experimental sessions
      with each session day separated by at least one week. Each session day will last
      approximately 6-7 hours.

      In the morning of each of the three study sessions participants will be asked to answer
      questions about how they feel and vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation,
      and temperature) will be measured using a non-invasive (external) vitals monitor.

      Participants will be asked to take an oral morphine capsule.

      Participants will participant in 3 smoking sessions where they will be asked to smoke
      cigarettes containing either cannabidiol or placebo (a blank).

      Participant's response to different intensities of thermal (heat and cold) stimulation will
      be administered to test pain sensitivity.

      Participants will be asked to complete questionnaires and have vital signs (blood pressure,
      heart rate) monitored.

      After completing the third round of smoking and assessment battery, participants will be
      provided with lunch and can relax, watch television, listen to music or read.

      Once vital signs and questionnaire ratings have returned to baseline levels, participants can
      leave the laboratory.

    <description>Indices of abuse liability is being assessed. Participants will be asked to make drug purchases based on how they feel at the moment (each DPT assessment is independent from the last CBD cumulative dose received). They will be informed that the amount purchased at each drug unit price (independent observations) must be consumed within 24-hr (i.e., participants cannot save or stockpile drug). Unit prices (UPs) per drug dose will be: $0 (free; no constraint) and $0.01, $0.10, $0.50, $1, $3, $5, $7.50, $10, $12.50, $15, $20, $25, $30, $35, $40, $45, $50, $60, $80 and $100.</description>
