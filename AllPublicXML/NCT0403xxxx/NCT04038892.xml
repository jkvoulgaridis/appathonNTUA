  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bronchiectasis is defined as abnormal, chronic and permanent enlargement of one or more
      bronchi. Disease symptoms; often productive cough, dyspnea, fatigue and wheezing. Changing
      pulmonary mechanics, inadequate gas exchange, decreased muscle mass and associated
      psychological problems may cause dyspnea, decreased exercise capacity and health-related
      quality of life. Exercise training as a part of pulmonary rehabilitation is used to reduce
      the severity of symptoms; is an effective treatment to improve exercise capacity and health
      status. Virtual reality based exercise training has taken its place in many areas of
      rehabilitation as a current and new approach. In the studies in the literature, Nintendo Wii
      Fit games are an effective, motivating, entertaining and clinically useful method for
      reducing symptoms in the rehabilitation of chronic lung diseases. Wii Fit games generally
      include strengthening, aerobics and balance exercises. Developed by BreathingLabs, Breathing
      Games, which is based on breathing exercises, are a new product, a virtual reality
      application that has been included in a limited number of studies, has shown its effect on
      reducing respiratory problems and is open to research effects for many patient groups. The
      importance of this study is that it will be the first study on Nintendo Wii Fit games based
      exercise training and Breathing Games based breathing exercises training in children with
      bronchiectasis.

      The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of different virtual reality-based
      exercise trainings on pulmonary function, respiratory and peripheral muscle strength,
      functional capacity and balance in children with bronchiectasis.
