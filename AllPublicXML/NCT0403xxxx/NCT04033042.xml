      The aim of the study is to demonstrate the safety and performance of a novel non-invasive
      glucose monitoring device, to collect data and reference measurements for establishment of
      calibration models and to evaluate the instructions for use for the device. This study will
      be an explorative study with 10 study subjects.

      The Investigational Medical Device (IMD) for this investigation is the Prototype 0.5 (P0.5)
      developed and manufactured by RSP Systems (RSP). The device is intended for non-invasive
      interstitial intermittent glucose monitoring in persons (age 18 and older) with diabetes. The
      technology relies on the well-established capacities of Raman spectroscopy for directly
      detecting glucose subcutaneously. The Raman spectroscopy physical principle relies on the
      fact that when laser light of a given wavelength interferes with a molecule, a small fraction
      of the incident light will interact with the vibrational states of the molecule, causing the
      photons to lose a portion of their energy which will change the wavelength of the light. The
      scattered light will be collected by the optical probe head and analyzed with advanced
      algorithms to correlate the signal to glucose concentrations. Data collected from the IMD
      will be paired with validated glucose reference values collected by the finger sticking
      method.
