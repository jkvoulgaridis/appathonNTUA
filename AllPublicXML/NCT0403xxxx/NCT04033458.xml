  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the pharmacokinetic profile of a single dose of two
      solid dosage formulations relative to a reference formulation (solution in polyethylene
      glycol-400 [PEG-400]) of JNJ-64140284 in healthy male participants under fasting condition
      and to assess the effect of food on the bioavailability of two solid dosage formulations of
      JNJ-64140284.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) between 18.0 and 29.9 kilograms per square meter (kg/m^2)
             inclusive

          -  Participants must be healthy on the basis of clinical laboratory tests performed at
             screening. If the results of the serum chemistry panel, hematology, or urinalysis are
             outside the normal reference ranges, retesting of an abnormal lab value(s) that may
             lead to exclusion will be allowed once during the screening phase. The participant may
             be included only if the investigator judges the abnormalities or deviations from
             normal to be not clinically significant or to be appropriate and reasonable for the
             population under study according to the investigator. This determination must be
             recorded in the participant's source documents and initialed by the investigator

          -  Participant must be healthy on the basis of physical examination, medical history,
             vital signs, and 12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) (means of triplicate ECG, inclusive
             QTcF less than or equal to [&lt;=] 450 milliseconds [msec]) performed at screening and
             admission to the clinical unit. Minor abnormalities in ECG, which are not considered
             to be of clinical significance by the investigator, are acceptable. The presence of
             left bundle branch block (LBBB), atrioventricular (AV) block (second degree or
             higher), or a permanent pacemaker or implantable cardioverter defibrillator [ICD] will
             lead to exclusion

          -  Non-smokers (not smoked cigarettes or equivalent or not used nicotine-based products
             for 3 months prior to screening)

          -  Men who are sexually active with a woman of childbearing potential and have not had a
             vasectomy must agree to use a barrier method of birth control for example, either
             condom or partner with occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with
             spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository for the duration of the study plus 3
             months after receiving the last dose of study drug, and all men must not donate sperm
             during the study and for 3 months after receiving the last dose of study drug. In
             addition, their female partners should also use an additional method of birth control
             (which may include a hormonal method, an intrauterine device [IUD] or an intrauterine
             system [IUS]) for at least the same duration. Men with a partner who is pregnant, you
             must use a condom to avoid exposure to the unborn child

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of or current significant medical illness including (but not limited to)
             cardiac arrhythmias or other cardiac disease, hematological disease, lipid
             abnormalities, bronchospastic respiratory disease, diabetes mellitus, renal or hepatic
             insufficiency, thyroid disease, Parkinson's disease, infection, or any other illness
             that the Investigator considers should exclude the participant

          -  Serology positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis C virus (HCV)
             antibodies or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies

          -  Participant has a history of at least mild drug or alcohol use disorder according to
             Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th edition) (DSM-V) criteria
             within 6 months before Screening or positive test result(s) for alcohol and/or drugs
             of abuse (opiates (including methadone), cocaine, amphetamines, methamphetamines,
             cannabinoids, barbiturates, ecstasy and benzodiazepines) at screening or admission

          -  Drinks, on average, more than 5 cups of tea or coffee or 8 cans of cola per day

          -  Clinically significant acute illness within 7 days prior to study drug administration
