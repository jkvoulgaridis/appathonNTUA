  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vitiligo is a disease in which autoimmunity plays a major role. Multiple treatment options
      are available, of which narrow-band UVB is a cornerstone, acting through immunosuppression
      and repigmentation by stimulating reservoir melanocytes.

      It's expected that this immunsupression is lower in darker skin types, where increased basal
      melanin might act as a barrier.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vitiligo is acquired depigmentation disorder. Several theories were hypothesized for causing
      vitiligo, of which the autoimmune theory is the most accepted.

      The main targets of therapy are stabilization of the disease activity through
      immunosuppression, and repigmentation through stimulation of reservoir melanocytes
      proliferation and migration.

      Narrow band ultraviolet phototherapy (NB-UVB) remains the cornerstone treatment of vitiligo.
      NB-UVB can induce both immunosuppression and repigmentation. Several factors can modulate the
      efficacy of NB-UVB therapy in treatment of vitiligo cases, including patient's age, lesion
      site, duration of the disease, and duration of the therapy.

      The immunosuppressive function of NB-UVB was first detected in 1963 by Hanisko and Suskind,
      who observed that the contact hypersensitivity response in skin sensitized to
      dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) was reduced if skin was previously exposed to suberythemal doses
      of UVB.

      Present evidence suggests that UVB suppress immune system through generation of T-suppressor
      cells, which inhibit the effector cells of Th1 type. It appears that UV-induced
      immunosuppression depresses the function of Th1 cells and enhances the activity of Th2 cells
      via cytokines such as Interleukin 10.

      It's expected that this immunsupression is lower in darker skin types, where increased basal
      melanin might act as a barrier. However, skin was previously divided to UVB-resistant and
      UVB-sensitive (UVB-R and UVB-S) based on the contact hypersensitivity testing, regardless of
      the skin type. Moreover, A study on NB-UVB phototherapy for psoriasis revealed that
      photoadaptation during NB-UVB therapy Is Independent of skin type.

    <intervention_model_description>100 patients with non-segmental vitiligo are randomized to either NB-UVB therapy with placebo versus NB-UVB combined with mini-oral pulse steroids therapy. Vitligo activity will be assessed according to the VIDA scoring system. Skin type, extent of vitiligo using VES score, photography of all areas according to the VES areas at a fixed distance of 50 cm from the patient, and using a 1 cm diameter circular white sticker for reference later will be done. All patients will receive NB-UVB phototherapy at starting dose of 0.3 J/cm2, 3 times per week for 6 months (72 sessions) with gradually increasing increments according until faint erythema is attained at which point the dose is fixed. 100 patients will be randomized into 2 groups; 50 patients will receive mini pulse dexamethasone therapy in a dose of 3 mg/ day for adults or 1.5 mg/day for children on two consecutive days per week while the other 50 patients will receive placebo having the same color, form and packaging for 6 months.</intervention_model_description>
