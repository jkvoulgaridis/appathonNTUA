  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our main objective is to collect feasibility data on helmet NIPPV and other clinical elements
      in to eventually prepare for a full scale randomized trial based on findings of this pilot
      study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with acute hypoxemia leading to respiratory failure are frequently supported by
      endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. Unfortunately an invasive approach to
      support is associated with risks of lung injury, infection, need for heavy sedation, and
      increased mortality. Non-invasive oxygen delivery, by mask (BiPAP or CPAP), high flow nasal
      cannula or helmet interface, is better tolerated and reduces risks associated with invasive
      mechanical ventilation. A growing body of medical literature and clinical experience suggests
      that non-invasive oxygen delivery can prevent the need for endotracheal intubation in some
      patients. This proposal will compare two different modes of non-invasive oxygen delivery:
      helmet and high flow nasal cannula.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age ≥ 18 years

          2. AHRF defined as:

             A ratio of partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) to fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2)
             between 100 - 250 mm Hg while breathing O2 from Venturi mask, or other delivery system
             that allows quantification of FiO2 such as Mask-NIPPV or HFNC.

             When no arterial blood gas (ABG) result available, use transcutaneous oxygen
             saturation measurement (SpO2) to impute PaO2 (Appendix A.2 for Table of PaO2 / FiO2
             imputed from SpO2 [Brown 2017]. If no oxygenation data prior to use of Mask-NIPPV or
             HFNC are available, then P/F ratio 100 - 250 on Mask-NIPPV or HFNC meets this
             criterion.

             minutes despite FiO2 and non-invasive support vii. Respiratory or cardiac arrest viii.
             Glasgow Coma Scale ≤ 8

          4. Contraindication to HFNC, Helmet-NIPPV, or Mask-NIPPV

         14. Lack of informed consent

         15. Pregnancy

         16. Actual body weight exceeding 1 kg per cm of height

         17. Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage

         18. Severe acute pancreatitis as etiology for hypoxemia

         19. Recent upper gastrointestinal surgical anastomosis within the past 30 days

         21. Unsuitable for non-invasive ventilation in the judgment of the treating MD

         22. Decision to withhold life-sustaining treatment. Patients with Do-Not-Resuscitate (DNR)
             or No Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (No CPR) order may be enrolled.
