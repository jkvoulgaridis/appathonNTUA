  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine if mind body therapies can help people suffering from
      chronic back pain. The study is a randomized, partially blinded trial examining the
      effectiveness of mind body interventions (treatment arms) in reducing disability from back
      pain and alleviating back pain in participants as compared to usual care (control arm ). The
      investigators will secondarily investigate whether mind body interventions improve
      participant quality of life and reduce the need for pain-related hospitalization.
