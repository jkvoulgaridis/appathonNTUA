  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This innovative study will address scientific and clinical areas relatively unexplored in
      chronic stroke that could lead to greater recovery of walking. Ischemic Conditioning (IC) is
      a non-invasive, simple procedure that improves motor function, exercise performance and
      cardiovascular function in healthy controls, but it has never been applied to the stroke
      population. We postulate that IC enhances the recruitment of motoneurons and results in
      positive neural adaptations, improves vascular endothelial function and peripheral blood
      flow, and together these improvements result in an increased capacity to exercise and faster
      walking speed. Future studies will examine the effects of IC and traditional therapy at
      different time points of recovery post stroke, durability of IC, molecular mechanisms of
      neural and cardiovascular adaptation and the efficacy compared with other adjuncts.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will quantify the effects of Ischemic Conditioning and treadmill training on
      improvements in: walking speed, leg strength, neuromuscular fatigability and the hyperemic
      blood flow response to muscle contractions, and vascular endothelial function and aerobic
      exercise capacity. A randomized control design will be used with three groups of chronic
      stroke survivors enrolled for four weeks of training (3x/week; 12 sessions total). The groups
      are: IC + Treadmill Training, IC Sham + Treadmill Training, and IC only. We will also enroll
      a group of age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects who will undergo IC + Treadmill
      Training. All Aims will be tested concurrently over a five-year period. All studies will be
      performed in Cramer Hall at Marquette University in the Integrated Neural Engineering
      Rehabilitation Laboratories, the Human Performance Assessment Core, and the Physical Therapy
      Clinic.

      Randomization of stroke patients to the three intervention groups will be performed by using
      randomized block designs (randomly chosen block sizes of 3, 6 and 9). This number accounts
      for possible dropouts and the use of non- parametric methods.

The Modified Ashworth scale measures resistance during passive soft-tissue stretching and is used as a simple measure of spasticity. Higher scores indicate worse spasticity. The scores and scale are as follows:
0: No increase in muscle tone
Slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch and release or by minimal resistance at the end of the range of motion when the affected part(s) is moved in flexion or extension 1+: Slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch, followed by minimal resistance throughout the remainder (less than half) of the range of motion.
More marked increase in muscle tone through most of the range of motion, but affected part(s) easily moved
Considerable increase in muscle tone, passive movement difficult
Affected part(s) rigid in flexion or extension</description>

    <intervention_name>Ischemic Conditioning</intervention_name>
    <description>Ischemic conditioning is a well-defined, non-invasive procedure which consists of inflating a blood pressure cuff around a limb (in our study, the paretic leg), inflating the cuff to 225 mmHg to occlude blood flow to the limb for 5 minutes, releasing the cuff for 5 minutes, and repeating 5 times. In our study, participants assigned to the IC Only and IC + Treadmill Training groups will undergo twelve sessions of ischemic conditioning over a four-week period.</description>

    <intervention_name>Ischemic Conditioning Sham</intervention_name>
    <description>Ischemic conditioning sham consists of the same setup as ischemic conditioning, which consists of inflating a blood pressure cuff around a limb (in our study, the paretic leg), inflating the cuff to 10 mmHg for 5 minutes, releasing the cuff for 5 minutes, and repeating 5 times. 10 mmHg is a sufficient inflation pressure for study participants to perceive some cuff tightness, but is not high enough to occlude blood flow. In our study, participants assigned to the IC Sham + Treadmill Training groups will undergo twelve sessions of ischemic conditioning sham over a four-week period.</description>

    <intervention_name>Treadmill Training</intervention_name>
    <description>Participants will perform 3 treadmill training sessions/week for a 4 week period (12 sessions total). Treadmill training will immediately follow IC or IC Sham. Personnel performing the treadmill training will be blinded to the IC treatment group. Subjects will walk on a treadmill for six, 5-minute intervals. Walking speed will be continuously adjusted to maintain heart rate between 50% and 60% of age-adjusted heart rate reserve to minimize the confounder of intensity. If individuals cannot walk at 80% of their overground self-selected walking speed, for 5 minutes, they will be assisted into a body weight support harness. Body weight support will be adjusted (up to 50%) such that individuals can walk at 80% of their over ground walking speed for five minutes and adjusted accordingly throughout the session. Participants assigned to the Treadmill + IC and Treadmill + IC Sham groups will receive Treadmill Training.</description>
