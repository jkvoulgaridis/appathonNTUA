  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the influence of cost information on decision-making for immobilization
      for treatment of distal radial buckle fractures. Half of the participants will receive cost
      information from an orthopaedic surgeon prior to making their decision for treatment, while
      the other half will receive cost information from another member of the study team after they
      had made their decision treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Research has shown equipoise in treatment outcomes after casting and splinting for pediatric
      buckle fractures. Despite the similarly favorable treatment outcomes associated with both
      casting and splinting these fractures, there is wide disparities in cost between the two
      types of immobilization. However, cost information is not routinely presented to families
      during the discussion of immobilization types.

      The primary objective of this study is to determine if cost information influences family
      decision-making about immobilization type after pediatric buckle fractures. A secondary
      objective is to determine if the timing of and person disseminating the cost information
      changes the influence it has on families' decision-making.
