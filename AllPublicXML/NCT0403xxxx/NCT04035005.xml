  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of ocrelizumab ( Ocrevus®) compared with
      placebo in participants with primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS), including
      participants later in their disease course. This study focuses on upper limit disability
      progression. This study will consist of the following phases: screening, double-blind
      treatment, follow-up 1 (FU1), an optional open-label extension (OLE), follow-up 2 (FU2), and
      B-cell monitoring (BCM).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The screening phase will last up to 24 weeks. In the double-blind treatment phase,
      participants will undergo at least 120 weeks of study treatment. Study drug (ocrelizumab or
      placebo) will be administered every 24 weeks. In the FU1 phase, all participants who
      discontinue prematurely from the double-blind treatment phase will enter the FU1 phase,
      including participants who receive post-double progression ocrelizumab (PDP OCR) treatment,
      other immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive treatment(s) for MS, commercial ocrelizumab, or
      no treatment. The FU1 phase will run in parallel with the double-blind treatment phase until
      the primary analysis is performed. If the primary analysis is positive, an optional OLE phase
      is planned for eligible participants who either have remained in the double-blind treatment
      phase or are on PDP OCR treatment at the time of the primary analysis and, in the opinion of
      the investigator, could benefit from ocrelizumab treatment. The follow-up 2 (FU2) phase will
      begin after the primary analysis is performed. The following participants will move into the
      FU2 phase: participants who are ongoing in the FU1 and not on PDP OCR treatment at the time
      of primary analysis; participants who are ongoing in the double-blind treatment phase or
      receiving PDP OCR at the time of the primary analysis and do not enter the OLE phase;
      participants who complete or withdraw from the OLE phase. At the end of the FU2, all
      participants will move into B-cell monitoring (BCM) phase until the end of the study. This
      study will end when all participants who are not being treated with an alternative B-cell
      depleting therapy have repleted his or her B-cells.
