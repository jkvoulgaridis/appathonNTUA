    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess the therapeutic role of rTMS on parkinson's patients with
      depression. Patients diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease and depression will be recruited. All
      patients will be admitted and will be allocated randomly into two groups one of which will
      receive real sessions of high frequency rTMS for left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)
      for 10 consecutive sessions totally over period of 10 days with repeated booster sessions
      every month during the period of follow up. The other will receive sham sessions.

      This study aims to assess the therapeutic role of rTMS on parkinson's patients with
      depression. Thirty PD patients with depression using United Kingdom (UK ) bank criteria for
      PD will be recruited from outpatient clinic in Assiut University. All patients will be
      admitted at Neuropsychiatric Department, Assiut University Hospital/ Assiut, Egypt.Each
      patient fulfilled the inclusion criteria as having score more than or equal 14 on Beck
      Depression Inventory (BDI) will be recruited. The patients will be allocated randomly into
      two groups one of which will receive real sessions of high frequency rTMS (25 HZ), with
      intensity of 80% of resting motor threshold detected from the hand motor area, with total
      2000 pulses for left DLPFC for 10 consecutive sessions totally over period of 10 days with
      repeated booster session every month during the period of follow up among three months. The
      other will receive sham sessions. All subjects will be followed up by selected clinical
      rating scales at different intervals pre session, post 10 sessions, and after one, two and
      three months.

    <description>By defining intensity of 80% of the resting Motor Threshold detected from motor area for Rt Abductor Pollicis Brevis (APB), we will apply repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) using 70-mm diameter air-cooled figure-of-8 coil and SuperRapid2 Magnetic Stimulator with high frequency (25Hz), Stimuli will be delivered for total 2000 pulse (divided on 50 trains with 40 pulses per train with inter-train interval 30 seconds) for the left DLPFC (coil placed tangential over the optimal position of 7 cm anterior to hand motor hotspot area detected for Real group and the same coil placed perpendicular with hand of coil pointing upward over occipital cortex for Sham group). Sessions will be consecutive for ten days period with repetition of consecutive 5 sessions as boosting doses on 5 days period over the follow up visits every month for the next 3 months.</description>
