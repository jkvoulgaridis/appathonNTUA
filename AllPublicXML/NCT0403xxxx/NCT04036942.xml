  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastroesophageal reflux disease has a high global prevalence, proton pump inhibitors are the
      cornerstone in the management but 10-20% of the patients are refractory to these, surgical
      treatment being an option of treatment in these patient but its associated with high
      morbidity, as well as a greater possibility of early therapeutic failure, for these reasons
      new therapies are in development being the mucosectomy with band and ablation of the
      esophagogastric junction with hybrid argon plasma options widely available that can offer a
      viable therapeutic option for patients with difficult control of symptoms or those who does
      not want to receive continuous medical treatment or surgical treatment. The aims of the study
      is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of this new techniques in the management or
      gastroesophageal reflux disease without hiatal hernia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gastroesophageal reflux disease is a disease with high global prevalence, reaching rates of
      19.6 and 40% in our country, for which it is one of the most common reasons for medical care
      and although a clinical response is obtained in an 80-90% of patients with the use of proton
      pump inhibitors, the rest of the patients represents a medical challenge; surgical and
      endoscopic treatment being within the treatment options, the former having a high related
      morbidity (perforation, vagal nerve injury, postoperative dysphagia, etc), its duration is
      suboptimal and a second operation is associated with more surgical complications and
      morbidity, as well as a greater possibility of early therapeutic failure. For all these
      reasons, new endoluminal therapies have begun to be planned, including transoral
      fundoplication and radiofrequency ablation of the esophagogastric junction, these with
      controversial results and with the need of the use of special accessories and instruments
      that are not widely available; mucosectomy with band and ablation of the esophagogastric
      junction with hybrid argon plasma are widely available procedures in medical centers,
      offering a viable therapeutic option for patients with difficult control of symptoms or those
      who does not want to receive continuous medical treatment or surgical treatment.
