    <textblock>
      This trial aims to assess, in patients aged ≥50 years with an average baseline SBP ≥130 mmHg
      and a previous history of cardiovascular diseases or at high vascular risk, the effects on
      the incidence of major cardiovascular events during the scheduled treatment period of greater
      reduction in blood pressure with a SBP target &lt;120 mmHg versus &lt;140 mmHg.

      This study is a multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial, which will randomize
      participants aged ≥50 years with an average baseline SBP ≥130 mmHg and a previous history of
      cardiovascular diseases or at high vascular risk. The study will compare the effects on the
      incidence of major cardiovascular events of allocation to achieve an intensive SBP goal (SBP
      &lt;120 mmHg) with a standard SBP goal (SBP &lt;140 mmHg) in four years of follow up.

    <description>Participants randomized into the Intensive treatment group will have a goal of SBP &lt;120 mmHg. A two- or three-drug regimen should be initiated at randomization for most participants. Drug doses should be increased and/or additional antihypertensive medications should be added at each visit in the intensive treatment group, usually at monthly intervals, until the participant's goal of &lt;120 mmHg has been reached or the local investigator decides no further antihypertensive medications may be added.</description>

    <description>Participants randomized into the Standard treatment group will have a goal of SBP &lt;140 mmHg. It is expected to achieve a SBP of 135-139 mmHg in as many participants as possible. Medication dose titration or addition of another drug is indicated if SBP is ≥160 mmHg at a single visit or is ≥140 mmHg at two consecutive visits. Down titration should be carried out if the SBP is &lt;130 mmHg at a single visit or &lt;135 mmHg at two consecutive visits.</description>

    <intervention_name>Intensive BP treatment group</intervention_name>
    <description>Participants in the Intensive BP treatment group have a goal of SBP &lt;120 mmHg. It is recommended to provide long-acting antihypertensive medications, that is once daily, unless other medication delivery frequency is needed. The local investigator may select among the available study antihypertensive medications. Other drugs not supplied by the trial may also be used as the investigator determines appropriate.
One or more medications from the following classes of agents will be provided by the study for use in managing participants in both randomization groups to achieve study goals:
Angiotension converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors; Angiotension receptor blockers (ARBs); Thiazide-type diuretics; Loop diuretics; Potassium-sparing diuretics; Beta-blockers; Calcium channel blockers (CCBs); Direct vasodilators; Alpha1-receptor blockers; Sympatholytics</description>
