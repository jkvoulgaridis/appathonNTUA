  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to investigate the effect of mechanical correction taping on
      the stiffness of the upper trapezius and pectoralis minor muscles in patients with rounded
      shoulder deformity. The secondary aim of our study was to see whether different tape
      materials affect the application results.

      Mechanical correction technique is a highly preferred method among users. Besides its
      tactical stimulation it serves like a tool helping to reposition the joints.

      Here in this study, the investigators aimed to see the secondary effect of the technique on
      posture. İt is already known that mechanical correction supports the joints and posture but,
      the question is; by supporting the upright position does it help the extra loaded muscles to
      release? As the best way to measure the stiffness of the muscles is Elastography, this study
      will highlight an important issue about correcting posture and regulate muscle loading.

    <description>Originally published in 1999 in Disorders of the Shoulder: Diagnosis and Management, the Penn Shoulder Score assesses patient pain (3 items), satisfaction (1 item), and function (20 items). This is a patient-reported outcome tool and the scores range from 0 to 100 with a score of 100 indicating low pain, high satisfaction, and high function. This is a joint-specific score, which may be useful for individuals with shoulder pathology.</description>
