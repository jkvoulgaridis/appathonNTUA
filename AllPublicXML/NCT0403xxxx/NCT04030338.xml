      The purpose of this study is to determine if Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA)
      positron emission tomography (PET) scans used in this study accurate and better at imaging
      participants' prostate cancer than the usual methods.

    <description>The baseline PSMA PET scan may be performed externally or at MSKCC, but all follow-up imaging must be performed at MSKCC. Approximately 60-90 minutes after intravenous injection of radiotracer, patients will be scanned from the mid-skull to the mid-thigh. Imaging will start with a low-dose CT for attenuation correction, followed by a PET scan. Upon completion of imaging and at the discretion of the investigator, the patient may be asked to void and get back in the scanner for 1 additional image of the pelvis.This additional image allows investigator's to see an unobstructed view of the prostate/prostate bed</description>

        Potential research subjects will be identified by a member of the patient's treatment team,
        the protocol investigator, or research team at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK)
        in the Department of Medical Oncology, Radiology, Radiation Oncology or Surgery.
        Investigators will screen their patients' medical records for suitable research study
        participants and discuss the study and their potential for enrolling in the research study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with histologically confirmed prostate cancer, that is either: newly
             diagnosed OR progressive as defined by standard PCWG3 criteria. note that metastatic
             disease is defined by either bone scintigraphy or by CT or MRI, or a combination of
             these tests, but not exclusively by molecular imaging criteria.

        Patients with newly diagnosed localized or metastatic prostate cancer are eligible,
        provided standard imaging (either bone scintigraphy, CT or MRI) demonstrates evidence of
        radiographic disease

        Patient with progressive disease that is non-metastatic are eligible by biochemical
        progression: A minimum of three rising PSA values from a baseline that are obtained 1 week
        or more apart, or 2 measurements 2 or more weeks apart

        Patients with progressive disease that is metastatic are eligible either by biochemical
        progression or radiographic progression or both

        Patients are permitted to have had up to 2 months of prior hormonal therapy before entering
        this trial (and many therapeutic trials) and therefore, their progression criteria would
        apply to their pre-treatment imaging and PSA parameters

          -  Karnofsky performance status of &gt;/= 50 (or ECOG/WHO equivalent)

          -  Male (or transgender female) &gt; 18 years of age

          -  Patient must be able to understand and willing to sign a written informed consent
             document

          -  Patient is anticipating starting a therapeutic strategy following imaging

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient undergoing active treatment for non-prostate malignancy, other than skin basal
             cell or cutaneous superficial squamous cell carcinoma that has not metastasized and
             non-invasive bladder cancer

          -  Unable to lie flat, still or tolerate a PET scan
