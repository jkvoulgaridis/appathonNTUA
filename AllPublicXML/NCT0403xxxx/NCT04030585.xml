  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of robot-assisted biofeedback exercise
      program on grip strength, movement speed, coordination, functional status, depressive status,
      and quality of life in patients with myoelectric prosthesis with upper limb amputation. In
      the literature review, There is no robot-assisted exercise program applied in patients using
      upper extremity myoelectric prosthesis.

      The expected benefit from this study is to show that the functional status, depressive
      status, and quality of life of the patients who received robot-assisted biofeedback exercise
      were better than those who had a home exercise program only.

      The study was planned as a randomized prospective clinical study. The study was planned to
      include 20 patients. New amputation patients will be excluded from the study. The patients in
      the study group will have 5 sessions of exercise in the hospital for a week. The control
      group will receive a home exercise program.

      Statistical analysis Student t test will be used for the comparison of descriptive
      statistical methods (mean, standard deviation, median, frequency and ratio) and normal
      distribution parameters between groups. Pearson chi-square test, Yates Continuity Correction,
      Fisher-Freeman-Halton Exact Test, Fisher Exact Test and Marginal Homogeneity Test will be
      used to compare qualitative data. The results will be evaluated at 95% confidence interval
      and p &lt;0.01 and p &lt;0.05.
