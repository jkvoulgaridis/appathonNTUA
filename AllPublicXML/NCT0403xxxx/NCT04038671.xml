    <textblock>
      This randomized, prospective study evaluates incision closure, post-surgical wound
      complications, dressing changes, incision/scar appearance, pain associated with dressing
      changes, and patient satisfaction rates of an activated carbon dressing versus two
      commercially available wound dressings.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative incision complications and surgical site infections are risks for patients
      undergoing surgery. While most surgical incisions heal without complications, postoperative
      complications, such as erythema, blistering, maceration, scarring, necrosis, and infection,
      interfere with the normal healing process. Preventing such complications must be a priority,
      as they may contribute to longer recovery times, as well as increased hospital stays, costs,
      and morbidity.

      Ideally, surgical incision dressings should exhibit the following characteristics:

        -  promote a moist environment;

        -  be absorbent, but transparent so fluid accumulation and other complications may be
           observed;

        -  be permeable;

        -  be low adherent to facilitate removal from skin;

        -  act as a complete barrier to bacteria and water, but not to moisture vapor; and

        -  feature some flexibility to avoid restricted limb movement and postoperative edema in
           the incision area [Chen et al; Collins].

      However, despite advances in wound dressing designs, there is no consensus regarding the
      ideal surgical incision dressing. One emerging dressing modality exhibits these key
      characteristics. This novel activated carbon cloth dressing is low-adherent, comprised of
      100% pure activated carbon and also conforms to body contours to maintain contact with the
      incision surface.

      This randomized, prospective clinical trial will compare this activated carbon cloth dressing
      to two other commercially-available wound dressings, including a non-adherent antimicrobial
      alginate dressing with silver and a non-adhering knitted cellulose acetate mesh dressing
      soaked in Povidone-iodine. The primary endpoint is incision coaptation/closure. Secondary
      endpoints include incision/scar appearance, such as inflammation and edema, odor, pain,
      patient satisfaction, and number of dressing changes.

    <measure>Incision Scar Appearance</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patient &amp; Observer Scar Assessment Scale consists of 2 scales; one that the investigator completes and one that the subject completes. The investigator rates vascularization, pigmentation, thickness relief, and pliability on five 10-point numeric scales, with &quot;normal skin&quot; on the left pole and &quot;worst scar imaginable&quot; on the right pole. Patients rate their scar pain &amp; itching, and scar appearance on six 10-point numeric scales, with &quot;no, no complaints&quot; on the left pole and &quot;yes, worst imaginable&quot; on the right pole. Individual items from both scales are summed with higher scores representing poorer scars and lower scores representing scars more closely resembling normal skin. The total score range of the observer scale component is 5 to 50. The total score range of the patient scale component is 6 to 60. The lowest scores, 5 and 6, respectively, reflect normal skin.</description>

    <measure>Wound odor</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will rate the odor of their wound using a Visual Analog Scale that consists of 10-cm(100-mm) line with the descriptor &quot;no odor&quot; positioned at the left pole and the descriptor &quot;extremely offensive odor&quot; positioned at the right pole. The lowest score, 0, reflects no wound odor, whereas a score of 10cm/100mm indicates extremely offensive wound odor.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain with Dressing Changes</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will rate their pain associated with the dressing changes using a Visual Analog Scale, as described by Springer BD et al, Am J Orthopedics, 2015. The Visual Analog Scale consists of a 10-cm (100-mm) line with the descriptor &quot;no pain&quot; positioned at the left pole and the descriptor &quot;worst pain imaginable&quot; positioned at the right pole. The lowest score, 0, reflects no pain, whereas a score of 10/100 indicates worst pain imaginable.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will rate their satisfaction of their ability to perform activities of daily living, including ability to perform personal hygiene activities, ability to change clothes, ability to sit comfortably, and ability to sleep comfortably, using a Visual Analog Scales, as described by Springer et al, Am J Orthopedics, 2015. For each of the 4 satisfaction measures, patients will rate their satisfaction on the scale that consists of a 10-cm (100-mm) line, with the descriptor completely unsatisfied&quot; on the left pole and the descriptor &quot;completely satisfied&quot; on the right pole. These 4 satisfaction measures will be averaged for a composite satisfaction measure. An average score of 10/100 would indicate the patient is completely satisfied, whereas an average of 0 would indicate the patient is completely unsatisfied.</description>

    <description>Investigator or study staff will rate the difficulty of the dressing changes using a Visual Analog Scale that consists of 10-cm(100-mm) line with the descriptor &quot;no difficulty&quot; positioned at the left pole and the descriptor &quot;extreme difficulty&quot; positioned at the right pole. The lowest score, 0, reflects no difficulty with dressing changes, whereas a score of 10cm/100mm indicates most difficulty with the dressing changes.</description>
