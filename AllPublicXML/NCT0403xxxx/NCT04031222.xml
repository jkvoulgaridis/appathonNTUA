  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study intends to assess the role of inflammation in insulin resistant conditions (i.e.,
      obesity and pre-diabetes) and the subsequent development of disease, such as type 2 diabetes
      (T2D) and cardiovascular disease (CVD), in the adolescent population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study proposes to characterize inflammatory biomarkers, insulin resistance and fecal
      microbiome composition in obese/pre-diabetic adolescents after glucose ingestion, followed by
      an oral fat tolerance test on a separate visit. Lipoprotein abnormalities and intestinal
      biomarkers, post-lipid ingestion, will also be evaluated. The primary aim is to assess the
      role of inflammation in insulin resistant conditions (i.e., obesity and pre-diabetes) and the
      subsequent development of disease, such as type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular disease
      (CVD), in the adolescent population.

    <description>Multiple measurements from a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance will be aggregated to arrive at one reported value (ie., insulin in uU/mL units and glucose values in mg/dL units which are measured at baseline, 30 min, 60 min, 90 min, and 120 min during the oral glucose tolerance test will be combined to calculate whole body insulin sensitivity index). There is no unit of measure for whole body insulin sensitivity index. Whole body insulin sensitivity index will be calculated using the following equation: whole body insulin sensitivity index = 10,000 / âˆš [(fasting glucose x fasting insulin) x (mean glucose x mean insulin)].</description>

    <description>Cytokines will be measured in plasma and fecal water with Bio-PlexTM arrays providing biomarkers of type 1 diabetes and/or type 2 diabetes progression. As indices of gut microbial translocation, serum lipopolysaccharides (LPS), macrophage secreted cluster of differentiation 14 (CD14) that binds LPS and LPS binding protein (LBP) will be examined.</description>
