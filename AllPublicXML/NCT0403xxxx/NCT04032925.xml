    <textblock>
      The PICSO ViPER study is a prospective single centre cohort study of the use of PICSO in
      patients presenting acute myocardial infarction and impaired function of the left ventricle
      and candidate to angioplasty the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery.

      The percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedure will be undertaken in a standard
      fashion, in accordance with the Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust (OUHT) departmental
      guidelines for PCI, and includes the use of pressure wire measurements before and after stent
      deployment. PICSO treatment will be added on top of the conventional treatment.

      The protocol will constitute of 5 main stages (that will all be performed during index
      angioplasty procedure). The protocol is complete at the end of the angioplasty procedure, and
      the patient will exit the study at this point. The five stages of the protocol are described
      below (for details see &quot;Detailed Description&quot;):

        -  Baseline

        -  PICSO treatment during pre-dilation

        -  Stenting with PICSO support

        -  Post-stent Physiology

        -  PICSO treatment during post-dilation

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In detail, the five stages of the PICSO VIPER study include:

      Stage 1: Baseline

        -  Diagnostic angiography will be performed in the standard manner using appropriate
           catheters.

        -  Pre-stenting coronary physiology parameters, namely fractional flow reserve (FFR),
           coronary flow reserve (CFR) and index of microcirculatory resistance (IMR) will be
           measured, using a pressure wire, as used for routine clinical measurements in patients
           undergoing PCI.

        -  Via a separate arterial access, a conductance catheter will be inserted retrogradely in
           the left ventricle for baseline measurements of cardiac pump function .

        -  Baseline blood samples will be withdrawn from the CS (via PICSO balloon) and ascending
           aorta (via coronary guiding catheter used for revascularization)

      Stage 2: PICSO treatment during pre-dilation

        -  The PICSO device will be deployed as already previously described in the literature.

        -  Pre-dilation will be performed using an angioplasty balloon at a size determined by the
           operator, as per standard clinical practice. Balloon will be maintained inflated for a
           minimum of 1 minute to a maximum of 2 minutes if well tolerated by the patient.

        -  Balloon inflation will be performed once with the PICSO device activated and once with
           PICSO device in standby. The order of this will be determined by randomisation via
           Sequentially Numbered Opaque Sealed Envelopes.

        -  During each balloon inflation measurements of coronary and cardiac function will be
           performed and blood samples will be collected exactly as in stage 1.

      Stage 3: Stenting with PICSO support

      • Stenting is performed as usual clinical practice while the PICSO device is active. The
      overall duration of PICSO will be no less than 20 minutes, up to a maximum of 45 minutes.

      Stage 4: Post-stent Physiology

        -  Post-stenting coronary and cardiac physiology parameters will be measured using a
           pressure wire and conductance catheter, respectively.

        -  Blood samples will be drawn from the CS and the coronary guide catheter as described in
           stage 1.

      Stage 5

        -  Stent post-dilation will be performed using an angioplasty balloon at a size determined
           by the operator, as per standard clinical practice. Balloon will be maintained inflated
           for a minimum of 1 minute to a maximum of 2 minutes if well tolerated by the patient.

        -  Balloon inflation will be performed in all patients once with the PICSO device activated
           and once with the PICSO device in standby. The order of this will be the same as in
           Stage 2 (as determined by Sequentially Numbered Opaque Sealed Envelopes)

        -  During each balloon inflation measurements will be made of coronary and cardiac
           physiology parameters and blood samples will be drawn from the CS and the coronary guide
           catheter as described in stage 1.

        -  Following this, the participant completes and exits the study.

    <description>PICSO therapy is delivered through the PICSO Impulse System, which consists of the PICSO Impulse console and PICSO impulse catheter. The PICSO therapy is delivered in each patient for a minimum of 20 minutes to a maximum of 45 minutes.
The PICSO Impulse catheter is automatically activated by the PICSO Impulse console. It is inserted in the coronary sinus via femoral vein access. The PICSO Impulse Console cyclically inflates and deflates the balloon at the tip of the PICSO Impulse catheter, generating transient increase in coronary sinus pressure.</description>
