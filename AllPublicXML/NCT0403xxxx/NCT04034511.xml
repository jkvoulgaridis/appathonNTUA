  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low-income adults are disproportionately affected by diabetes, experiencing greater rates of
      diabetes, diabetes-related complications, and mortality. Dietary habits play an important
      role in achieving and maintaining glycemic control to improve health outcomes. However,
      low-income adults are less likely to adopt the necessary dietary changes to improve glycemic
      control largely due to poor access to care, limited knowledge and skills to facilitate
      lifestyle change, and financial and environmental constraints that limit access to healthy
      foods. Nutrition interventions that target key barriers to healthy dietary habits among
      low-income adults with diabetes may have a profound impact on improving glycemic control. The
      provision of home-delivered, medically-tailored meals in addition to individualized medical
      nutrition therapy is a promising approach to improve dietary habits in socially disadvantaged
      populations with diabetes. Evidence suggests the provision of medically tailored meals may be
      beneficial in improving health outcomes and health care costs among socially disadvantaged
      adults with chronic illnesses, however rigorous studies specifically exploring the benefits
      of meal provision and medical nutrition therapy among adults with type 2 diabetes are
      lacking. The investigators aim to conduct a randomized-controlled clinical trial examining
      the impact of medically-tailored meals and medical nutrition therapy on health-related
      outcomes and health care costs among low-income adults with type 2 diabetes.

      The investigators will recruit 100 individuals age 18 and over with uncontrolled diabetes
      (defined as a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) &gt;8%) and enrolled in Priority Partners Medicaid
      insurance. Participants will be randomized to one of two groups: 1) 3 months of
      home-delivered, medically-tailored meals combined with monthly individual Medical Nutrition
      Therapy sessions for 6 months or 2) usual care. The investigators will follow participants
      for up to 12 months to assess for changes in hemoglobin A1c.
