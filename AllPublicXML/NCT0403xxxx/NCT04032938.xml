      This protocol is designed as a prospective observational case-control study in patients who
      underwent cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) due to cardiac surgery. 30 healthy persons were
      selected as control group. The case group included patients admitted to intensive care unit
      (ICU) after cardiac surgery and extracorporeal circulation which is performed by the
      Department of cardiac surgery of Peking Union Medical College Hospital. The patients enrolled
      should be divided into two groups according to their primary outcomes: one grouped fever
      and/or hemodynamic instability after cardiopulmonary bypass and the other grouped
      normothermia and normal hemodynamic during 48 hours after surgery(cause an infection
      manifested &gt;48 hours after admission was defined as hospital acquired. ). Sample collection
      was terminated when both groups received 30 cases. These 60 cases would regard as the case
      group. Additionally, all the CPB patients we observed will be divided into survivors and
      non-survivors based on the 28-day survival. Feces and blood samples will be obtained at
      certain time points（initial sampling at least one day before the surgery, repeat sampling
      within 24-48 hours after CPB）. The fecal samples analysis will apply metagenomics and the
      feces and blood samples will be analyzed using untargeted metabolomics method. In this study,
      the stratification of gut microbial communities in patients underwent extracorporeal
      circulation were explored and analysed the variation of metabolite in patients's plasma and
      fecal samples. Predictive bio-markers and possible pathogenesis of fever and/or hemodynamic
      instability after CPB will be also provided by clinical outcomes analysis combined with
      multi-omics study.
