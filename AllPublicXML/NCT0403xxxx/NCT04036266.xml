  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis is a common degenerative disorder of the articular cartilage . Risk factors
      include genetics, female sex, past trauma, advancing age, and obesity. The diagnosis is based
      on a history of joint pain worsened by movement, which can lead to disability in activities
      of daily living .

      Diagnosis of knee osteoarthritis can be confirmed based on clinical and/or radiological
      features. The potential of a progressive disease can be prevented or decreased by earlier
      recognition and correction of associated factors. Obesity and alignment especially varus
      malalignment are recognized factors of a progressive disease.

      High tibial osteotomy (HTO) is a widely performed procedure, and good results can be achieved
      with appropriate patient selection and precise surgical technique. It is reported to be an
      effective treatment for varus knee osteoarthritis (OA) by redistributing the load line within
      the knee joint . With an HTO, the surgeon aims to change the coronal alignment of the leg in
      order to shift the center of force passing axially through the knee from the arthritic region
      of the knee towards the unaffected side. The amount of alignment correction to be performed
      is calculated before surgery based on the extent of knee arthrosis and on the alignment of
      the patient's lower limbs on long-leg weight bearing radiographs .

      Our study is focused on effectiveness of open wedge High tibial osteotomy on clinical and
      radiographic outcomes of patients with medial knee osteoarthritis.

      The investigators will conduct a retrospective case-series study of at least 40 patients ,
      who underwent medial open-wedge HTO for treatment of medial knee osteoarthritis between
      January 2016 and January 2019 in our Arthroscopy and Sports Injuries Unit in Orthopaedics
      Department of Assiut University. Inclusion criteria is Kellgren-Lawrence classification
      grades 1 to 3; symptomatic unicompartmental osteoarthritis

      Pre-operative :

      assessment of patients is done clinically using Knee society score (KSS) and visual analogue
      scale (VAS) (0 mm, no pain;100 mm, worst pain) and radiographic assessment according to
      Kellgren and Lawrence using anteroposterior (AP) and lateral x-ray views of the knee , a
      two-leg long standing view with or without slight flexion assessing Femoral-tibial angle
      (FTA) .

      Intra-operative :

      After anaesthesia is induced, an arthroscopic examination is performed to define the status
      of the menisci (excluding significant damage of the lateral compartment), cruciate ligaments,
      and articular cartilage. meniscal surgery (partial menisectomy/meniscal repair) is performed
      when necessary, then The medial open wedge high tibial osteotomy (MOWHTO) is performed.

      Post-operative :

      follow up after at least 1 year post-operative clinically using knee society score (KSS) ,
      visual analogue scale (VAS),Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score(KOOS) , Western
      Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis (WOMAC) index scores and radiological
      assessment using Anteroposterior and lateral views xrays assessing union two-leg long
      standing view x ray with or without slight flexion assessing Femoral-tibial angle (FTA) and
      joint line .
