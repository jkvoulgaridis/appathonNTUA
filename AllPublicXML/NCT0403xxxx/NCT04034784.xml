  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the safety and tolerability of a new liquid anti-adhesion device,
      Discrete(TM), in healthy volunteers, in order to determine the best volume of Discrete(TM) to
      go forward into clinical efficacy research.

      The clinical trial will progress in accordance with first-in-human study guidance from the
      United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA).

      It will be conducted as a randomized, controlled, double-blinded, single ascending volume,
      single-center, interventional safety trial. Participants will remain blinded to treatment
      until end of clinical trial. A maximum of 7 cohorts will be studied to assess optimal volume
      of investigational medical device compared with Control Lactated Ringer's solution (LRS)
      administered intraperitoneally. A maximum of 72 participants will be enrolled. The trial will
      commence with low volume and progress in a sequential, stepwise volume-escalating schema
      until defined maximum tolerated volume criteria are met.

      Eligible and consented adult men and women will be sequentially enrolled within each cohort
      at a ratio of 6 participants on Discrete(TM) to 3 participants on Control LRS. Participants
      will be followed for up to 10 days after intraperitoneal application.

      An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Committee will closely review safety in the
      clinical trial.
