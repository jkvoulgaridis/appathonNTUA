  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More than 80% of individuals in the U.S. start maintenance hemodialysis (HD) with a central
      venous catheter, despite substantial evidence that starting HD with an arteriovenous (AV)
      access improves quality of life, lowers mortality, and decreases healthcare costs. Health
      system- and patient-level barriers contribute to low rates of AV access creation prior to HD
      initiation. Evidence-based, pre-dialysis interventions to improve these low rates and
      associated clinical outcomes are lacking.

      A Vascular Access Navigation and Education Quality Improvement Program will be implemented in
      the Geisinger Danville, PA chronic kidney disease clinic. Individuals who choose to
      participate in a research sub-study of the program will complete questionnaires to assess
      their vascular access care knowledge and confidence before and after participation in the
      quality improvement program.
