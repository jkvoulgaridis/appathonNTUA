  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Longterm oral anticoagulation with very low dose rivaroxaban (2.5mg bid) in combination with
      aspirin has been shown superior over standard aspirin monotherapy in patients with stable
      coronary artery disease (CAD) in the COMPASS trial. To date, there are no data comparing
      these - antithrombotic strategies and to provide insights about mechanistic effects of very
      low dose rivaroxaban on top of aspirin for longterm treatment.

      Thus, the goal of the planned pilot study will be to identify effects of rivaroxaban on
      platelet function, platelet-mediated vascular inflammation and particularly,
      platelet-mediated thrombin generation as well as the underlying mechanisms and to reveal
      differences in mechanistic effects during longterm treatment with combined novel
      antiplatelet/anticoagulant strategies. This study is planned as descriptive study.

    <description>Define the course of vascular inflammation and thrombogenicity during transition from acute to chronic phase after percutaneous coronary intervention and to provide mechanistic insights of very low dose rivaroxaban (VLDR) on platelet activation and function, platelet-triggered thrombin generation and platelet-dependent vascular inflammation. Platelet function as well as platelet-dependent vascular inflammation will be determined by flow cytometry, thrombinoscopy, spectrofluorimetry, aggregometry, total thromus-formation analysis system (T-TAS) and thrombelastography (TEG) studies</description>
