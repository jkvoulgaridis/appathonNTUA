      Study of efficacy of probiotic in older patients with multiple co-morbidites and constipation

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>

      Background and aims:

      Probiotics are known to have a beneficial effect on the management of constipation. Thus, the
      current study objective was to evaluate the impact of a microbial cell preparation (MCP)
      (Hexbio®; comprising Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus strains) on stool frequency,
      consistency, and constipation-related symptoms in elderly patients with multiple chronic
      medical conditions.

    <masking_description>Both investigators and patients were unaware of the assignment and were blinded to the labelling process performed by the sample supplier. The patients were randomly allocated to one of two groups; those who received sample labelled A or B. Emergency code break were kept at the manufacturing factory and no code break was needed throughout the trial duration. Both the MCP and placebo were manufactured and supplied by B-Crobes Laboratory Sdn. Bhd. as powder in identical sachets and labelled as A and B. Investigators have no contact with the manufacturing staffs at any point during the trial process. Following data analysis, unblinding was performed to complete the study process.</masking_description>
