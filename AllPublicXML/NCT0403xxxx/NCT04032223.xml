  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Implant retained overdentures provided more satisfaction with regard to conventional denture
      related problems such as esthetics, speech, chewing, fit and retention, function and quality
      of life. Evaluation of patient satisfaction allows direct quantification of patients'
      opinions on different aspects of a given treatment.

      Studies have indicated that conventional complete denture wearers rehabilitated with
      mandibular implant supported overdenture experience better retention and stability, improved
      overall function and satisfaction.

      Patient satisfaction is one factor that influences the success of overdenture
      treatment(Naert, Alsaadi et al. 2004). Previous studies have shown a difference between
      patients' satisfaction with their dental prostheses and clinicians' assessments of patients'
      oral condition.(Emami, Heydecke et al. 2009).This indicates that clinical assessments of
      dentures are not valid predictors of patient satisfaction.

      The two primary methods used to fabricate these restorations may be subtractive (milling and
      grinding) or additive manufacturing (Rapid Prototype, RP or 3D printing), The 3D printing
      technology has been incorporated into dentistry, but does not include ceramics and is limited
      to polymers.

      3D printing by rapid prototyping has many advantages which are the availability of high
      production rate where the technician can easily produce over 150 units per hour. Also the
      quality control of wax copings which results in high precision fit and constant wall
      thickness. This will result in better stability and retention and consequently patient
      satisfaction. Finally is the reduced finishing work needed on cast copings. The
      irregularities in wax coping thickness can be avoided.

      Cast metal coping is the comparator. Because of their parallel walled design, telescopic
      crowns provide horizontal stability, thus stabilizing the prosthesis against lateral
      dislodging forces. The overdenture's self finding mechanism in telescopic constructions
      facilitates prosthesis insertion considerably.

      Telescopic constructions seem to be easy to care for as they do not possess areas of
      difficult access for maintenance. This is why this construction also seems to be an effective
      treatment modality for geriatric patients with serious systemic diseases, which affect the
      degree of dexterity.

      Despite rapid development in overdenture attachments and implant-supported overdentures with
      cast metal copings remain a viable and usable modality in dental practice. There is limited
      clinical follow-up data of the complications associated with overdentures and abutment teeth
      restored with metal copings, including post-procedural and prosthetic problems.

    <description>Patients will be recalled on their scheduled dates to the Prosthodontics department ,Faculty of Dentistry , Cairo University. The patient-based outcomes that will be used in this thesis included the variables measured on the 100-mm VAS (Visual Analogue Scale) and on Category Scales (CAT) that had been previously validated</description>

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>small perpendicular metal tubes were placed a few millimetres underneath the canines in the mandibular denture base.
In this manner the denture could be rigidly and reproducibly connected to the retention-measuring device. Retention measuring device is a device that was developed to apply an increasing, vertical force on the denture The force was administered througha straight metal bar that was fitted withstrain gauges (Measurements Group Inc.,Raleigh, NC, USA). The bar was rigidly connected to the denture.</description>
