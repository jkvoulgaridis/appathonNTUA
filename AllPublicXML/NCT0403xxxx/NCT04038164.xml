  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rationale of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of DAT in children and
      adolescents with FASD in relation to its effects on social skills, internalized and
      externalized symptomatology and on severity of FASD symptoms. This objective was accomplished
      through a randomized controlled pilot study of DAT for children and adolescents with FASD.

      The rationale of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of Dog Assisted Therapy in children
      and adolescents with FASD. The investigators conducted a randomized, rater-blinded,
      controlled pilot trial in a cohort of 33 children and adolescents with FASD. Participants
      were randomly assigned either to DAT group (n=17) or Treatment as Usual (TAU control group)
      (n=16). The investigators evaluated changes on social skills, internalized and externalized
      symptomatology and on severity of FASD symptoms at pre-treatment and post-treatment.

    <description>Social Skills Improvement System-Parent Form (SSIS-P). is a 79 items scale (Likert scale 0 to 4) measuring social skills and problem behaviors in children and adolescents as reported by their parents. In the Social Skills domain, the subscales are communication, cooperation, assertion, responsibility, empathy, engagement, and self-control. The Problem Behaviors domain includes internalizing and externalizing problems, bullying, hyperactivity/inattention and autism spectrum.</description>

The CBCL is a 113 item scale (Likert scale: 0-2) which assesses withdrawn symptoms, somatic complains, anxiety/depressive symptoms, thought problems, ADHD features, oppositional behavior and behavioral problems. Higher scores indicate more conduct problems.</description>

    <description>The DAT program comprised 12 manualized sessions and included two phases: 1) individual intervention (6 sessions) and 2) group activity (6 sessions). Patients participated in weekly sessions for about 3 months. Each session lasted 45 minutes. The groups were formed by 3-4 patients. Sessions included the participation of two certified therapy dogs, two technicians specialized in DAT and a psychologist. Participants in this group were visited by their psychiatrist in order to monitor their adherence to medications.</description>

    <description>Participants received their usual treatment. They were visited by their psychiatrist in order to monitor their adherence and continuation on medications as prescribed. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were the same as for the experimental group. Participants in the TAU group did not receive DAT sessions.</description>
