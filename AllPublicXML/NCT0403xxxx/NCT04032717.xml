  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is the first-in-human clinical study to see if a single dose of an investigational enema
      made from a modified plant protein called Q-Griffithsin is safe, tolerated, and acceptable
      for use by healthy adults 18-45 years of age who practice receptive anal intercourse.

      A microbicide is a drug or agent designed to prevent transmission of HIV. Griffithsin, or
      &quot;GRFT&quot;, is an investigational product that is being developed as a microbicide. GRFT is a
      naturally occurring protein originally isolated from the red alga Griffithsia found in the
      South Pacific Ocean. GRFT is one of the most powerful, broad-spectrum antivirals ever tested
      and its activity is under study for potential therapeutic applications against several viral
      pathogens including HIV, herpes simplex virus type-2, human papillomavirus (HPV), and
      hepatitis C. GRFT can be formulated into a number of delivery vehicles including gels, films,
      suppositories and even simple enemas or rinses.

      The product is intended for use prior to sexual activity by people who practice receptive
      anal intercourse (RAI), and thus represent the population most vulnerable to HIV-1
      transmission due to the high concentration of HIV target cells in the rectal mucosa and the
      presence of mucosal trauma commonly associated with RAI. For the purposes of this study GRFT
      has been genetically modified to produce a more stable compound less prone to oxidation,
      Q-GRFT.

      Up to 21 HIV-uninfected individuals between the ages of 18 - 45 years will be enrolled in
      this study at the University of Pittsburgh, the only study site. Participants will be
      screened to exclude those with HIV infection, and anorectal sexually transmitted infections
      (STIs) (Visit 1). Up to 28 days after screening, eligible participants will return for a
      baseline visit (Visit 2), be assigned to a study arm, and undergo sample collection including
      flexible sigmoidoscopy with collection of colorectal biopsies.

      The first 3 participants will be assigned to Arm 1 and receive a clinician administered
      single dose exposure of open-label Q-GRFT. Once the participants in Arm 1 complete Visit 4,
      study activity will be paused while the study Protocol Safety Review Team (PSRT) conducts an
      interim review of the clinical and laboratory data. In the absence of any significant safety
      concerns, the PSRT will be asked to approve enrollment of Study Arms 2 and 3. The remaining
      18 participants will be assigned 2:1 in a randomized and blinded fashion to either Study Arm
      2 (Q-GRFT) or 3 (placebo), respectively.

      At Visit 3, participants will receive a clinician-administered single-dose exposure followed
      by flexible sigmoidoscopy with collection of colorectal biopsies at 1-hr and PK sampling of
      blood and rectal fluid at 1-hr and 4-hr. Participants will return to clinic the next day
      (Visit 4) for colorectal biopsies and 24-hr PK sampling. Participants in Arm 1 will
      additionally return for PK sampling including colorectal biopsies at 48 hrs (Visit 4a)
      following Visit 3. Participants will be contacted by study staff approximately 3 days after
      Visit 4 to collect safety information.

      Participants will return for a final study visit, Visit 5, 4 weeks +/- 1 week after Visit
      4/4a to collect blood samples for PK and immunogenicity assessments. A final study exit call
      for safety will occur within one week after the final study visit.

    <description>Safety analysis will be conducted on all participants who have receive study product. The number and the frequency of ≥ Grade 2 adverse events (AEs) and ≥ Grade 1 Genitourinary AEs as defined by the Division of AIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric AEs, Version 2.1 (March 2017), Addendum 1 Female Genital Grading Table for Use in Microbicide Studies (November 2007), and/or Addendum 3 Rectal Grading Table for Use in Microbicide Studies (Clarification dated May 2012) to this table will be tabulated for each of the three methods of administration from Baseline through the final study contact. To determine whether AEs are occurring excessively, the proportion of subjects that experience an AE will be calculated for each method of administration. Additional safety analyses will also tabulate the number and type of AEs observed overall, and by severity, site, and study product. AEs that lead to discontinuation of study participation will be tabulated separately.</description>

On a 5-point Likert scale, with 1 being completely unacceptable and 5 being highly acceptable, the distributions of scores on all product characteristics will be examined to determine product characteristics that pose or could pose significant barriers in current or future product use.</description>

               4. Any other drugs that are associated with increased likelihood of bleeding
                  following mucosal biopsy (e.g., daily high dose aspirin &gt; than 81 mg, NSAIDs, or

             Note:

             • HSV-1 or HSV-2 seropositive diagnosis with no active lesions is allowed, since
             treatment is not required

          7. Has any of the following laboratory abnormalities at Screening:

              10. Positive for HIV

          8. Any other condition or prior therapy that, in the opinion of the investigator, would
             preclude informed consent, make study participation unsafe, make the individual
             unsuitable for the study or unable to comply with the study requirements. Such
             conditions may include, but are not limited to, current or recent history of severe,
