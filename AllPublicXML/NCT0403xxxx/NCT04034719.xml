  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Carrying (or kangaroo carrying) is known to reduce neonatal and child morbidity and mortality
      and improves the quality of survival of premature and term children during the most fragile
      growth period, the first thousand days of life. Carrying is also a growing brain protection
      technique and becomes a routine of care in all neonatal units around the world.

      In University hospital of Saint-Etienne, the developmental care program has been developed
      since 2002 in all neonatology units and advocates the practice of skin-to-skin carrying
      between the parent (father or mother) and his baby, from the time of the hospitalization.
      Professionals in units who have long been thinking about the concept of attachment and the
      benefits of skin-to-skin, wish to validate the use of the wearing scarf as a tool for the
      practice of skin -in-skin in neonatology then back home by performing a randomized
      monocentric prospective longitudinal study.

      This study it's a single-center, prospective, randomized study to evaluate the benefit of the
      scarf in the practice of skin-to-skin and portage (PAPSE Group) compared to a Skin-to-Skin
      and Carry Without Scarf (PAP group).
