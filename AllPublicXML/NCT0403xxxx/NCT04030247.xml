  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure the incremental effectiveness of a twice daily plant
      sterol supplement in a population of young South Asian patients who have moderate
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, we aim to measure the LDL-C reducing impact of regular plant sterol
      supplementation added to a proven CVD reduction program for moderate risk South Asians who do
      not meet guideline-based criteria (2018 ACC/AHA Lipid Guidelines) for medical lowering of
      their LDL-C with an HMG CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) drug, and they are recommended to
      improve their lipid-risk profile through diet and exercise primarily.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is a male or female, ≥18 years of age, &lt; 61 years of age.

          2. Subject has LDL-C ≥120 and &lt;190 mg/dL measured in the past 3 months (or measured at
             the baseline visit), while not taking cholesterol-lowering medication for at least 1
             month prior, and having a ASCVD Risk score &lt;7.5%.

          3. Subjects with LDL-C ≥120 and &lt;190 mg/dL with ASCVD risk scores &gt;7.5% who are known to
             be intolerant of statin therapy drugs.

          4. If current smoker, subject does not have any plans to change current smoking status or
             frequency.

          5. Subject is willing to fast (10-14 h, target 12 h, water only) prior to each clinic

             to participate in the study and authorization for release of relevant protected health

             dietitian/health coach and consents to virtual clinical care pathway.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has taken a prescription cholesterol-lowering medication in the past 1 month.

          2. Subject has a known allergy or sensitivity to soy or any ingredients in the study
             product.

          3. Subject is taking dietary supplements for cholesterol-lowering such as red yeast rice,
             niacin &gt;100 mg/d or omega-3 fatty acid supplements providing ≥1000 mg/d
             eicosapentaenoic acid and/or docosahexaenoic acid.

             (Stable use of viscous fiber laxative ≤2 teaspoons/d is allowed.)

          4. Subject is a female, who is pregnant, planning to be pregnant during the study period,
             or lactating. Subjects should agree to use contraception during study period to avoid
             pregnancy.

          5. Individual has active angina, stable or unstable, requiring urgent cardiovascular
             functional risk stratification (stress testing or catheterization) or intervention. Or
             has congestive heart failure that is not compensated or in which the subject is not
             euvolemic, as determined by the treating MD.

          6. Individual has a condition the Investigator believes would interfere with his or her
             ability to provide informed consent, comply with the study protocol, which might
