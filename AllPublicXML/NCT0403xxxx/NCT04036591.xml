  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background. Acute respiratory infections in childhood have high incidence and morbimortality
      rates, generating significant sanitary and social costs. Due to its diversity of
      manifestations and clinical forms, the degree of severity varies widely.

      Published acute respiratory infections assessment severity scales are mainly focused on acute
      bronchiolitis, but there is no validated scale to evaluate the effects of respiratory
      physiotherapy in acute respiratory infections in children.

      Objective. To study the usefulness of the Acute Bronchiolitis Severity Scale to assess
      children under 24 months suffering from acute respiratory infections susceptible to receive
      outpatient respiratory physiotherapy treatment.

      Methods. Pre-post assessment descriptive study using the Acute Bronchiolitis Severity Scale.
      Children under 24 months suffering from acute respiratory infection will be evaluated during
      the first outpatient respiratory physiotherapy treatment.

    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 2 years.</time_frame>
    <description>Physiotherapists will use the Acute Bronchiolitis Severity Score (ABSS) to assess severity of infection pre and post treatment. After several assessments each one of them will inform about the usefulness and aplicability of the scale in outpatient respiratory physiotherapy treatment by filling in a likert scale (usefulness, aplicability, simplicity, time required...)</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Immediate effectiveness of outpatient respiratory physiotherapy treatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>Measurements will be taken during the outpatient respiratory physiotherapy treatment, 1 hour approximately. Pre treatment data will be collected before starting the treatment and post data 5 minutes after finishing the last manouver.</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in the Acute Bronchiolitis Severity Score (ABSS) punctuation at the end of outpatient respiratory physiotherapy treatment (pre-post treatment measurement of the scale).
The ABSS is a validated scale in a Spanish population that combines the evaluation of heart and respiratory rate, wheezings, crackles, respiratory effort and inspiration/exhalation ratio. It has three levels of severity: mild (0 to 4 points), moderate (5 to 9) and severe (10 to 13).</description>

    <description>All infants will be assessed using the Acute Bronchiolitis Severity Scale (ABSS) before and after being treated by experienced physiotherapists using the prolonged slow expiration technique and provoqued cough. Before the application of these techniques a retrograde rhinopharyngeal unclogging will be performed in order to clean the nasopharynx.</description>
