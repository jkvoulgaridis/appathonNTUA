    <textblock>
      The study is a systematic case replication series of a new psychological therapy Method of
      Levels (MOL) for people who experience psychosis. Between 6 and 8 people with psychosis who
      receive services from CMHT will be recruited. Participants will complete baseline
      questionnaires measuring their symptoms and distress and will be offered up to 12 sessions of
      MOL. Following the completion of therapy they will complete the questionnaires measuring
      symptoms and distress again.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Psychosis is an enduring and distressing mental illness which can cause high levels of
      disability. Recommended treatments include antipsychotic medication and Cognitive Behaviour
      Therapy (CBT). Antipsychotic drugs cause serious negative side effects which are intolerable
      for some patients. CBT can be difficult to conduct in the presence of comorbid problems and
      can be too demanding for some patients. Both medication and CBT sometimes fail to
      sufficiently reduce the symptoms. Method of Levels (MOL) is a flexible, short-term, cognitive
      therapy informed by a theory that explains the underpinnings of psychological distress and
      the mechanisms of action in effective therapy. The purpose of the current study is to
      evaluate the utility of MOL for individuals with non-affective psychosis who are under the
      care of secondary mental health services. A case series will explore the efficacy of MOL for
      the levels of symptoms, distress and general functioning. MOL will be offered to 6-8
      individuals with psychosis within a flexible appointment scheduling system. Levels of
      symptoms, distress and general functioning will be measured before and after treatment. Open
      feedback interviews following the completion of treatment will allow us to evaluate the
      patients' experience of MOL. The project will provide preliminary data which will inform
      clinical practice and contribute to large scale research of MOL.
