  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Consumptive coagulopathy is associated with increased mortality in patients with heart
      failure (HF). Physical activity influences the risk of major vascular thrombotic events. This
      study investigates how high-intensity interval training (HIIT) affects the capacity of
      endogenous thrombin generation (TG) by modulating circulatory procoagulant microparticles
      (MPs) in HF patients. Thirty-eight HF patients and 38 age- and gender-matched normal
      counterparts (NC) were recruited into this study. The HF group performed HIIT (3-min
      intervals at 40% and 80%VO2peak) on a bicycle ergometer for 30 min/day, 3 days/week for 12
      weeks, whereas the NC group did not receive any form of intervention. Plasma TG kinetics,
      procoagulant MPs, coagulation-related factors, and oxidative stress/proinflammatory status
      were analyzed. The results demonstrated that the HF group exhibited (i) less endogenous
      thrombin potential (ETP) and TG rate, (ii) lower concentration/activity of tissue factor (TF)
      and counts of TF-rich MPs derived from blood cells, and (iiii) higher vascular endothelial
      shedding and plasma myeloperoxidase and interleukin-6 concentrations, compared to the NC
      group did. However, HIIT elevated plasma ETP and TG rate, as well as, TF
      concentration/activity and blood cell-derived procoagulant MP levels in the HF patients.
      Moreover, the exercise regimen also decreased vascular endothelial shedding and plasma
      myeloperoxidase and interleukin-6 concentrations in patients with HF. Hence, we conclude that
      HF reduces the capacity of endogenous TG in plasma, which is associated with decreased (or
      consumed) circulatory procoagulant MP levels. However, HIIT alleviates HF-declined endogenous
      TG capacity and vascular endothelial damage through recuperating TF-related coagulation
      activity and suppressing oxidative stress/proinflammatory status.
