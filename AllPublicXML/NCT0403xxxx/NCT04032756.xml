  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This registry on Tofacitinib and biologics (anti-integrin/anti-TNF) in the treatment of
      ulcerative colitis (UC) patients in Germany will extend the prospective documentation of
      safety issues and efficacy in induction and maintenance therapy of Tofacitinib (Xeljanz®) in
      addition to other biologics used in Germany with a particular interest in predictors of
      long-term responses and favorable disease outcome or to predict severe side effects caused by
      therapy with Januskinase(JAK)- inhibitors/biologics.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an Investigator-initiated non-randomized, non-interventional observational
      prospective long- term research (IIR) as part of the normal treatment of UC patients for the
      safety and efficacy of Tofacitinib / biologic therapies. As of 01st July 2019, UC patients
      who have been provided Tofacitinib / biologics for UC according the respective label by the
      treating physician may be prospectively included in an online database by the participating
      study centers by 31st March 2021.

      An interim analysis is planned at the end of patients ́ recruitment with respect of the
      induction phase (week 16) for October 2021 with a first publication of the data in a
      peer-reviewed journal (e.g., JCC, GUT, UEG Journal).

      Up to 480 patients (including about 360 UC patients with Tofacitinib and about 120 UC
      patients with biologics) will be included in the online documentation. A specification to the
      study centers regarding the group inclusion (patients treated with Tofacitinib (group 1) or a
      biologics (group 2)) will not be made; this means, each study center can include patients in
      both groups.

      The CED Service GmbH assume that approximately 20-30% of Tofacitinib patients will be
      biologic-naïve UC patients, many of whom will represent early disease patients (&lt; 2 years
      after first diagnosis).

    <description>The primary endpoint is steroid-free remission (remission: partial Mayo score ≤ 1 plus a bleeding subscore of 0) in the inductionphase (week 16). For this endpoint it will be only captured if there is a current use of steroids at the time of the visit. So the patient will be asked for current steroid use at time of visit at week 16 and if he has received steroids within the last 4 weeks prior to time point of the visit.</description>
