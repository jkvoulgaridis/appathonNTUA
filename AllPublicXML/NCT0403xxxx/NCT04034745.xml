  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single arm study will evaluate whether Xermelo (telotristat ethyl) associated weight
      gain is affects lean body mass, dietary intake, and physical and cognitive functioning among
      neuroendocrine tumor (NET) patients with a history of carcinoid syndrome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the mechanisms of weight gain associated with the
      drug telotristat ethyl (Xermelo) among patients with a neuroendocrine tumor (NET) with
      history of carcinoid syndrome. We want to know if taking Xermelo affects patients' lean body
      mass, quality of life, dietary intake, and physical and cognitive functioning during
      treatment. A better understanding of the mechanisms of weight gain from Xermelo may allow us
      to determine whether this drug may be beneficial for treating carcinoid syndrome, cachexia,
      or weight loss seen in other diseases.

    <measure>Mean change in lean body mass (measured using DXA Scan) from baseline and after 13 weeks of treatment.</measure>

    <measure>Mean change in patient reported outcomes using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) from baseline up to 3 years post treatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 3 years post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The summary score (SS) is a mean of 13 QLQ-C30 subscale scores, ranging from 0 to 100, with a higher SS rating reflecting a better health status.</description>

    <measure>Mean change in patient reported outcomes using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) test from baseline up to 3 years post treatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 3 years post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>MOCA scores range between 0 and 30, with higher scores indicating higher cognitive function.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean change in patient reported outcomes using a stool survey measured from baseline and after 13 weeks of treatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 13 weeks post-treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>The stool survey is a non-validated descriptive measure of gastrointestinal symptoms by taking the mean score on a scale of 0 - 10, where 0 indicates no symptoms and higher scores denote a worsening of symptoms.</description>
