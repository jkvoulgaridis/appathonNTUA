      This study evaluates efficacy of LY3023414 followed by prexasertib in patients with
      metastatic triple negative breast cancer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Seventy to eighty percent of breast cancers have a gene expression profile which is
      characterized by homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) and high proliferation. HRD leads
      to errors in DNA pathway [non -homologous end joining (NHEJ)] that repair DNA-breaks, a
      process required for metastatic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) survival. The hypothesis
      of this pilot trial is that administration of LY3023414 will inhibit NHEJ in metastatic TNBC,
      leading at the time of disease progression to metastases that are HR-deficient and sensitive
      to prexasertib therapy.

    <description>Patients with metastatic TNBC who meet the enrollment criteria will receive LY3023414 until disease progression followed by prexasertib until disease progression. Patients who achieve a confirmed clinical complete response will discontinue prexasertib, and these patients will be followed to document the durability of the complete responses. Patients whose disease does not respond to prexasertib may be treated with standard of care breast cancer therapies off study, at the recommendation of the treating physician.</description>

    <description>Patients will then be treated with 200 mg single-agent LY3023414, PO BID until disease progression. Patients will then discontinue LY3023414. At disease progression from LY3023414, a second core needle biopsy of the same metastatic lesion (or different metastases if the initial metastasis has regressed) will be performed for RPPA and other molecular analyses. If a research biopsy from a patient's metastatic disease cannot be safely obtained, a skin biopsy is permitted.
Patients will be treated with prexasertib 105 mg/m2 IV administered every 2 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Prexasertib will be discontinued in patients who achieve a confirmed clinical complete response, and these patients will be followed to document the durability of the complete responses. For patients achieving a CR or PR on prexasertib, a third additional core needle biopsy of metastatic disease may be obtained, if possible, for RPPA and other molecular analyses.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients ≥18 years of age. Patients must agree to use one highly effective (less than
             1% failure rate) method of contraception or use a combination of two effective methods
             of contraception during treatment with study drug and for at least 12 weeks following
             the last dose of study drug.

          2. Have a diagnosis of metastatic TNBC previously treated with standard anthracycline,
             cyclophosphamide, and taxane chemotherapy, unless there was a contraindication to
             doxorubicin, in which case prior treatment with this agent is not required.

          3. Have not received more than 3 prior chemotherapy regimens for metastatic disease.

          4. Have locoregional (eg, breast, chest wall, regional lymphatic) or pulmonary or hepatic
             metastatic disease that is amenable to core needle biopsy. If a research biopsy from a
             patient's metastatic disease cannot be safely obtained, a skin biopsy is permitted. If
             a skin biopsy cannot be safely obtained, patients may still be eligible, per physician
             discretion.
