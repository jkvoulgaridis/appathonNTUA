  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The blood-brain barrier regulates the passage of peripheral built appetite-suppressing
      hormones from the blood to the brain and informs the brain about the nutritional- and energy
      status.

      The aim of this study is to investigate in which extent the hormones are able to overcome the
      blood-brain barrier and how long it takes after food intake. Relating thereto indications to
      the effect of peripheral hormones in the central nervous system and the role of these
      hormones in the development of overweight are provided.

      In this study 30 patients (10 per intervention group) will be recruited. The patients are
      hospitalized in the local neurosurgery and they have a CSF-drainage due to their neurological
      primary disease or due to neurosurgical interventions. The patients are examined in each case
      on the same day.

      Simultaneous samplings of blood and CSF are taken from 10 patients after an oral glucose
      tolerance test. These interventions are carried out to investigate in which extent the
      appetite-suppressing hormones (e.g. Leptin, Insulin, GLP 1 and Glucagon) reach the liquor and
      so the central nervous system.

      In order to understand the temporal sequence, simultaneous samplings of blood and CSF are
      taken from 10 other patients at certain points throughout the day.

      In a further group of 10 patients will be investigated how the central effective insulin
      modulates the transport of the other appetite-suppressing hormones. Therefore samplings of
      blood and CSF are investigated before and after intranasal insulin administration.
