  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Once randomisation has been completed, the study treatment should be started preferably
      immediately; at the latest within one week following randomisation.

      The patients will be randomised in a ratio of 1:2 to the following two treatment arms.

      Patients in both treatment arms will receive standard chemotherapy with FOLFOXIRI as
      background treatment, which can be de-escalated to FOLFIRI in case of toxicity.

      Standard arm A:

      The patient will be treated with FOLFOXIRI plus bevacizumab for up to 12 cycles (24 weeks) or
      until progression (if the latter occurs before completing the 12 cycles). Within the 12
      cycles, the FOLFOXIRI plus bevacizumab regimen may be de-escalated, owing to toxicity, to
      FOLFIRI and bevacizumab at the treating physician's discretion.

      After 12 cycles of the study treatment, a switch to a maintenance regimen with a
      fluoropyrimidine (5-FU infusion or capecitabine) plus bevacizumab, administered until
      progression occurs, is recommended. The recommended maintenance phase of the study is not
      part of the study treatment. However, maintenance therapy will be counted as first-line
      therapy.

      Experimental arm B:

      The patient will be treated with FOLFOXIRI plus weekly administration of cetuximab for up to
      12 cycles (24 weeks) or until progression (if the latter occurs before completing the 12
      cycles). Within the 12 cycles, the FOLFOXIRI plus cetuximab regimen may be de-escalated owing
      to toxicity, to FOLFIRI and cetuximab at the treating physician's discretion.

      After 12 cycles, a switch to a maintenance regimen with 5-FU and cetuximab or with irinotecan
      and cetuximab, administered until progression occurs, is recommended. The recommended
      maintenance phase of the study is not part of the study treatment. However, maintenance
      therapy will be counted as first-line therapy.

             during participation in the study, with the exception of a basal cell or squamous cell
             carcinoma of the skin or cervical carcinoma in situ, if these were treated curatively.

          -  Known history of alcohol or drug abuse

          -  A significant concomitant disease, in particular chronic hepatic or renal disease,
             chronic inflammatory or autoimmune diseases, ruling out the patient's participation in
