  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Vector-borne diseases are caused by the bite of an infected mosquito, fly, flea, tick, or
      other blood-feeder. These diseases cause almost 1 million deaths per year. And they are on
      the rise, particularly in Southeast Asia in particular. Researchers think that these diseases
      make up about 10 percent of fevers in Cambodia. But many of these illnesses are never
      diagnosed. Studying these diseases can help find new ways to identify and treat them.

      Objective:

      To find pathogens in people who have a fever using metagenomic pathogen sequencing platforms.

      Eligibility:

      People aged 6 months to 65 years with a fever of at least 38 degrees Celsius who visit the
      referral hospital in Cambodia

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with their medical history. Children will be weighed to make
      sure they are big enough to give blood samples.

      Participants will share data about their sex, age, and where they live. They will answer more
      questions about their heath history. They will answer questions about and any places to which
      they have recently traveled. They will take a questionnaire. They will have a blood test.

      Participants aged 2 years or older who test positive for malaria will have one more blood
      test.

      Participation will last up to 2 days.

    <textblock>
      Vector-borne diseases continue to cause significant global morbidity and mortality,
      particularly in Southeast Asia. However, given a lack of diagnostics available in
      resource-poor countries, many vector-borne diseases are never diagnosed and therefore their
      impact is underappreciated. Cross-sectional retrospective surveys have revealed higher than
      expected antibody prevalence to a number of diseases including mosquito-borne viruses and
      ectoparasite-borne rickettsial diseases.

      Here, we aim to collect specimens from febrile individuals to better describe the febrile
      disease landscape of Cambodia using novel genomics technologies (unbiased next-generation
      sequencing) to investigate possible infectious etiologies of illnesses of unexplained
      etiology in Cambodian children and adults. With the current rise of vector-borne diseases
      around the world, we hope the results of this study contribute to better understanding the
      epidemiology and burden for vector-borne diseases in this region.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        In order to be eligible to participate in this study, an individual must meet all of the
        following criteria:

          -  Provision of signed and dated informed consent form.

          -  Stated willingness to comply with all study procedures.

          -  Male or female, aged 6 months to 65 years, with documented fever equal or greater than
             38 degrees Celsius in previous 24 hours.

          -  Willing to allow biological samples to be stored for future research and for all
             de-identified metagenomic sequencing data to be stored in publicly accessible
             databases.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Any underlying, chronic, or current medical condition that, in the opinion of the
