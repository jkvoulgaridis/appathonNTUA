  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Established evidence base with MBT for treatment of Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD)
      and/or Antisocial Personality Disorder (ASPD). Demographic information of United Kingdom
      prison population highlights large proportion of offenders with PD. There is no agreed
      universal approach to treatment of PD within Scottish prisons with large variance across the
      prison estate. MBT pilots in HMP Edinburgh and HMP Cornton Vale have demonstrated positive
      findings in female offenders which could be replicated in male populations.

    <measure>Quantitative data measuring change in difficulties with interpersonal relationships pre- and post-intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>21 months</time_frame>
    <description>Inventory of Interpersonal Problems-32 (IIP-32) to be administered one week pre-, one week post- and three months post-intervention. The scale measures difficulties with interpersonal relationships which are a core feature of personality disorder psychopathology.
There are 32 items scored on a 5 point scale (0-4) measuring 2 domains of affiliating and distancing (16 items each) difficulties with interpersonal relationships. There are 8 differing interpersonal relationship styles (4 each for affiliating and distancing). The maximum score therefore for each style is 16 (4 x 4 point scores), for each domain is 64 (16 x 4 point scores), and total score is 128 (32 x 4 point scores). The minimum score is 0. Higher values indicate increasing severity.</description>

    <description>Reflective Functioning Questionnaire (RFQ) to be administered one week pre-, one week post- and three months post-intervention. The scale measures difficulties with reflective functioning which is a core feature of personality disorder psychopathology.
There are 54 items scored on a 7 point (1-7) scale measuring 2 domains of certainty and uncertainty (26 items each) difficulties with reflective functioning. Two items do not score. Only extreme rankings score points for each item (i.e 7 or 1 scores 3, 6 or 2 scores 2 and 5 or 3 scores 1 depending on the item type). The maximum score therefore for each domain is 78 (26 x 3 point scores), and total score is 156 (52 x 3 point scores). The minimum score is 0. Higher values indicate increasing severity.</description>
