      This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study investigated the efficacy and safety
      of the herbal medicinal product containing a combination of extracts of restharrow root
      (Ononidis radix), Java tea (Orthosiphonis folium) and goldenrod herb (Solidaginis herba) in
      the treatment of acute lower uUTI. The herbal medicinal product represent a multi-target
      therapy that includes diuretic, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial aspects.

      Patients were randomized to one of the two treatment groups and treated with the
      phytotherapeutic agent or matching placebo for seven days.

      The primary endpoint was microbiologic response defined as reduction in bacterial urine
      culture counts by at least 10*2 CFU/ml.
