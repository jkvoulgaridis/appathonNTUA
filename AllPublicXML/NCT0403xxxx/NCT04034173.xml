  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present hypothesis is that anti-EGFR agents are active in tumors with low-level RAS
      mutation when the majority of tumor cells is still sensitive. While response rate may be high
      and may reflect sensitivity to anti-EGFR agents, PFS is anticipated to be shorter than in RAS
      wild-type patients due to the faster development of resistance when sensitive cells are
      eradicated and when the RAS-mutant anti-EGFR resistant clones become predominant.

      The characteristics of low-level RAS mutant tumors would be:

        -  Objective response rate (ORR) high (reflecting the sensitive clone)

        -  Progression-free survival (PFS) short (reflecting the more rapid outgrowth of RAS mutant
           clones)
