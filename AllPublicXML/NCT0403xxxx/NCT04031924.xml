    <description>The Chair Stand Test: This requires people to repeatedly stand up from and sit down on a chair for 30 seconds. The number of stands is recorded.</description>

    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Biceps Curl Test: This requires people to repeatedly lift a 5 lb(2.27 kg) weight (for women) or an 8 lb (3.63 kg) weight (for men) for 30 seconds. The number of lifts is recorded.</description>

    <time_frame>30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The 6-minute Walk Test: This is measured in distance (m) and reflects aerobic endurance. The original version of the Senior Fitness Test required people to walk on a straight line.</description>

    <description>The 8-Foot Up-and-Go test: This is measured in time (seconds) and reflects agility and dynamic balance.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Kinesiophobia</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Kinesiophobia was assessed in all participants using the Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia (TSK). The TSK is a self-completed questionnaire and the range of scores are from 17 to 68 where the higher scores indicate an increasing degree of kinesiophobia.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Balance</measure>
    <time_frame>20 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Berg Balance Scale (BBS) was used to evaluate balance. The BBS consists of 14 items which include simple mobility task and that are scored on a scale of 0 to 4. The level of proficiency for each activity, a score of &quot;0&quot; is given if the participant is unable to do the task and a score of &quot;4&quot; is given if the participant can complete the task based on the criterion that has been assigned to it. The maximum total score on the test is 56.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Balance</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Timed Up and Go Test was used to assess the balance performance of people during the movement. For the starter position, a participant sits in a chair with standard height, measuring a distance of 3 meters from the chair. The test timer starts by the clinician at the moment the clinician said &quot;go&quot;, the participant gets up from a chair, walks 3 meters, turns 180Â° a designed spot, walks back to the seat, when the participant sits down then the test stopped.</description>

    <description>Sixteen individuals with liver transplantation were included in the study, and their physical and demographic characteristics of the individuals recorded. The Senior Fitness Test (SFT) was used to evaluate to physical fitness. The Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK) was used to assess kinesiophobia; the Fatigue Impact Scale (FIS) and Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) to evaluate fatigue; the Berg Balance Scale (BBS) and the Timed Up and Go test (TUG) to evaluate the balance; the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) to determine the level of physical activity;and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) to evaluate psychological status.</description>
