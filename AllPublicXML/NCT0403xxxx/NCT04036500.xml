  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Blogs, word-of-mouth, and small studies from the 1990s in the premature ovarian insufficiency
      and menopause populations have suggested sublingual or transdermal estradiol may be safer
      and/or more effective than an oral formulation. Sublingual administration entails holding the
      estrogen tablet under the tongue and allowing it to dissolve, where its absorption is
      enhanced by the rich vascularization under the tongue. According to Price et al., sublingual
      administration results in rapid absorption with significantly higher estradiol levels than
      does comparable oral dosing. This is likely because sublingual administration will bypass
      metabolism by the intestines and liver. The transdermal route, which also bypasses first-pass
      metabolism, is not associated with an increased venous thromboembolic risk nor a significant
      increase in plasma triglycerides or HDL-cholesterol levels. As such, transdermal estrogen is
      often preferred over oral formulations, although it is relatively expensive and not
      accessible to many transgender women. Conversely, sublingual administration of estrogen
      tablets is widely available and could be a cost-effective alternative to transdermal
      estrogen. However, there are no well-conducted studies that have evaluated the safety and
      efficacy of sublingual estrogen therapy in the transgender population. This pilot study will
      elucidate how estrogen levels in the blood change following sublingual versus oral
      administration of estradiol in transgender women. This data may be used later to design
      larger studies on safety and efficacy.

      Additionally, analyzing a dosage method that patients themselves have tried independently and
      found effective is also important. This approach incorporates intelligence from the
      transgender community into our research, creating new knowledge that is supported by data but
      is founded in existing community insights. Thus, the outcomes of this research have the
      potential to integrate patient input while also aiding in the development of safety
      recommendations, with the goal of better caring for our transgender patients.

      Primary aim. To establish the pharmacokinetics of sublingual estradiol versus oral estradiol
      in transgender women.

      Patient will plan on being in the Adult Translational Research Unit (A-TRU) for 8 hours. They
      will be assigned to a suite. They will get 7 blood draws at hours 0,1,2,3,4,6,8 and vitals at
      the beginning of the visit. Vitals will include height, weight, blood pressure, respiration
      rate, and pulse. Subject is able to eat while in the A-TRU. Day 1 patient will take estradiol
      1 mg ORALLY after time 0 blood draw. The medication will be given by registered nurse. A
      wash-out period of at least one week will allow for complete clearance of the exogenous oral
      estradiol before testing the pharmacokinetics of sublingual estradiol on the same ten
      patients in the same manner. Subject cannot take any hormone replacement therapy between
      their research appointments. On day 2, subject will take estradiol 1 mg SUBLINGUALLY after
      time 0 blood draw, supervised by a research team member to ensure proper dissolution. Blood
      will be drawn at hours 0,1,2,3,4,6,8 as on day 1.
