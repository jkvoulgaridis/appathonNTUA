  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is one of main cause of cancer death in worldwide, characterized of low 5-year
      survival rate of less than 20%. Pulmonary nodule is considered as the typical imaging
      manifestation in early stage of lung cancer. The National Lung Screen Trial has demonstrated
      that the mortality rates could decline greatly, by the utility of low-dose helical computed
      tomography for screen of pulmonary nodules. Thus, automatic detection, diagnosis and
      management of pulmonary nodules, play the vital roles in computer-aided lung cancer screening
      and early intervention.

    <description>Competitive performance metric (CPM) is a criterion used for CAD system evaluation. Based on FROC paradigm, CPM score is computed as an average sensitivity at seven predefined average false positive rates. CPM score ranges from 0 to 1, with higher CPM score indicating better CAD performance.</description>
