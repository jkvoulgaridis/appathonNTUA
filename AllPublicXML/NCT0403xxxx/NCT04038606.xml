    <textblock>
      Background :

      Breast cancer is a disease that occurs primarily in elderly women: 54057 of breast cancer
      occurred on women in 2008, 15.2% were between 75 and 84 years and 5.4% were over 85 years.
      Elderly women cancers care exposes to several problems: the opportunity for screening,
      knowing that mammography is not recommended after 75 years old, and the level of treatment
      depending on the background and the existence of weaknesses. It should determine whether
      patients are in adequate physiological condition to tolerate classical and &quot;complete&quot;
      treatment or conversely in a precarious state with advanced fragility, justifying only
      lightened and adapted symptomatic treatment.

      Purpose :

      The purpose of this research theme is to assess the quality of life of elderly patients who
      underwent mastectomy for breast cancer. The objectives are:

        -  Assess the determinants of acceptance and / or rejection of mastectomy based on personal
           background (level of fragility, self-image) and linked to cancer

        -  Assess the quality of life, 6 months later, of women who underwent or not mastectomy,
           and appreciate the determinants

      Abstract :

      The total mastectomy allow, oncologically, a more valid treatment than a lumpectomy, in many
      cases of women suffering from a breast cancer, but its relevance and acceptability are poorly
      known. Some think that an elderly woman, postmenopausal, is less concerned with her
      aesthetics and feminine attributes, which would allow her to accept easily the mastectomy.

      The research hypothesis is that the acceptability of mastectomy is not good in elderly women

      Primary outcome:

      Better detection of comorbidity and geriatric syndromes in vulnerable patients Better
      detection of a degradation of the quality of life at D0 (at diagnosis)

      Secondary outcomes:

      Better support for quality of life and psychological support after mastectomy (revaluation to
      6 months) Integration of patients in the geriatric sector and implementation of regular
      monitoring Study design: prospective, multicenter

    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36). SF-36 is a set of generic, coherent, and easily administered quality-of-life measures. These measures rely upon patient self-reporting and are now widely utilized monitoring and assessment of care outcomes in adult patients.
a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability</description>

    <description>Quality of life (QoL or QOL) is the perceived quality of an individual's daily life, that is, an assessment of their well-being or lack thereof. This includes all emotional, social and physical aspects of the individual's life;All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100.</description>
