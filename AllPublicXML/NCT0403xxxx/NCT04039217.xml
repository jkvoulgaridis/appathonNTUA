    <textblock>
      The study seeks to understand how anti-HIV drug Biktarvy -
      tenofovir+emtricitabine+bictegrativir (TAF/FTC/BIC) is absorbed and how long it persists in
      different body compartments, including mucosal tissues, as it may be considered for PrEP or
      PEP regimens in the future.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Men who have sex with men (MSM) continue to be disproportionately affected by HIV. The
      majority of MSM acquire HIV after exposure to the rectal mucosa through receptive anal
      intercourse without condoms. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and post-exposure prophylaxis
      (PEP) are recommended for MSM who may be exposed to HIV to prevent infection. Current
      recommendations for PrEP are to take the combination anti-HIV drug, tenofovir+emtricibatine
      (TDF/FTC), on a daily basis for the duration of someone's HIV risk exposure period, which
      could be months or years. For PEP, a three-drug anti-HIV medication is recommended within 72
      hours of a possible exposure for a 28-day course. While PrEP and PEP are effective, some
      people find it difficult to follow the recommended regimen. Therefore, additional
      short-course dosing regimens for PrEP and PEP are being considered for future development.
      The study drug provided in this study will not protect participants from HIV or treat any
      active infection. This proposal seeks to understand how other anti-HIV medications are
      absorbed and how long they persist in different body compartments, including mucosal tissues,
      as they may be considered for PrEP or PEP regimens in the future.

Approximately 24 mL of blood will be drawn, an oral cheek swab, 1 pre- wet penile swab and 1 dry penile swab, and a urethral swab will be collected. After previous swab collections are complete, participants will be asked to provide a urine sample (some of which will be used for gonorrhea and chlamydia testing). Participants will undergo rectal biopsy collection at 1 study timepoint.</description>
