  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II non-blinded randomized study evaluating men with oligometastatic prostate
      cancer lesions randomized (1:1) to stereotactic ablative radiation therapy (SABR) versus SBAR
      + Radium-223. We are looking to determine the progression-free survival of men who have
      oligometastatic prostate cancer with at least one bone metastasis with stereotactic ablative
      radiation therapy (SABR) versus SABR + Radium-223.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The metastatic capacity of prostate cancer (PCa) behaves along a spectrum of disease that
      contains an oligometastatic state where metastases are limited in number and location. The
      importance of local consolidation of all tumor deposits in oligometastatic disease to
      forestall further metastatic dissemination is now backed by small randomized studies. Our
      previous Baltimore ORIOLE randomized trial of stereotactic ablative radiation (SABR) alone,
      highly focused, high-dose radiation, versus observation in oligometastatic PCa final data
      demonstrate a progression-free survival (PFS) benefit of SABR alone. The patterns of failure
      from our ORIOLE trial in combination with prior data suggest one dominant mode of failure is
      from microscopic disease particularly those with bone-tropic biology. These are important
      early clinical data suggesting the existence of an oligometastatic state and the importance
      of local therapies in the management of these patients. Radiopharmaceutical therapy (RPT)
      approaches have not been applied in the oligometastatic space and thus the opportunity to
      target micrometastatic disease in conjunction with local consolidation of macroscopic disease
      with SABR has the potential to provide a curative paradigm for patients with oligometastatic
      PCa. We introduce the successor trial to ORIOLE called RAVENS that is a phase II randomized
      trial of SABR +/- the bone metastasis seeking RPT Xofigo in men with oligometastatic PCa. We
      hypothesize macroscopic prostate tumors support the growth of and help nurture future distant
      metastases and this process can be impacted most by total, macro- and microscopic, tumor
      consolidation. In addition, we hypothesize that circulating biomarkers can identify men with
      oligometastasis that benefit the most from SABR and RPT.

    <description>The brief pain inventory assesses the severity of pain, location of pain, amount of pain over the last 24 hours, and impact of pain on daily functions. Scores for the 4 pain severity items and 7 pain interference items range from 0-10, where 10 is the worst pain or pain that completely interferes with described activity and 0 is the least pain or does not interfere with described activity. The mean of these scores is used to measure pain severity and pain interference.</description>
