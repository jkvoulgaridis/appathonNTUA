  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the yield of tissue biopsy specimen and the diagnostic accuracy of tissue
      acquisition using a newly developed 22 gauge needle in patients with solid lesions throughout
      the GI tract.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of 22 gauge needle to gather tissue samples under EUS guidance has not been
      associated with an increased risk, and no major complications have been described so far both
      for the 22 gauge Procore needle and for standard 22 gauge.20, 21 Potential benefits of this
      new needle are the possibility of increasing the chance of retrieving tissue specimens for
      histological examination, with the possibility of increasing the diagnostic accuracy of the
      procedure saving the need and the cost deriving from on-site cytopathology examination. This
      may reduce the need to repeat EUS procedures or other more invasive sampling procedures,
      including surgery.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age greater than 18 and less than 80.

          -  Presence of a solid lesion within or adjacent of the gastrointestinal tract. In the
             presence of a cystic component, the solid part of the lesion should be more 75% of the
             total.

          -  Absence of an uncorrectable coagulopathy as defined by abnormal prothrombin time (PT)
             or partial thromboplastin time (PTT) that does not normalize after administration of
             fresh frozen plasma.

          -  Informed consent is obtained

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous biopsy of the lesion with diagnosis of malignancy

          -  Presence of an uncorrectable coagulopathy as defined by abnormal prothrombin time (PT)
             or partial thromboplastin time (PTT) that does not normalize after administration of
             fresh frozen plasma.
