    <textblock>
      This study is designed to assess the safety and clinical activity of tamoxifen and the COX
      inhibitor, aspirin, given in combination with standard AC-T chemotherapy (doxorubicin,
      cyclophosphamide, and paclitaxel) for the treatment of high-risk estrogen receptor (ER)+,
      human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)- breast cancer. If successful, the study
      could improve long-term outcomes for a subpopulation of women with aggressive stage I-III
      ER+/HER2- breast cancer.

    <description>AC-T chemotherapy includes 4 cycles of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide given every 2 or 3 weeks followed by either 12 weekly cycles of lower dose paclitaxel or 4 cycles of higher dose paclitaxel every 2 or 3 weeks. During this time, all participants would receive daily aspirin and daily tamoxifen. After the AC-T chemotherapy, participants will undergo standard of care surgery to remove any remaining tumor.</description>

          3. Male or female, aged 18 or older

          4. Newly diagnosed with ER+/HER2- stage I-III breast cancer according to American Society
             of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)/College of American Pathologists (CAP) guidelines and the
             8th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC); ER positive is defined
             as ≥ 1% positive nuclear staining

             tamoxifen

          8. If genomic profiling has been performed (OncotypeDx, Mammaprint or other), then the
             score must be in a medium- or high-risk range.

             transfusions Absolute Neutrophil Count ≥1000/mm3 Platelets ≥100,000/mm3 Hemoglobin ≥9
             g/dL Serum Creatinine or Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of

             curative intent resection)
