  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exercise intolerance is an understudied phenomenon in people with CF. The investigators
      hypothesized that vascular dysfunction plays a significant role, and can be partially
      reversed by administration of the phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor, sildenafil.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is the most common fatal genetic disease in Caucasians. The predicted
      median life expectancy age for patients with CF is 47.7 years compared to 78.8 years in the
      general U.S. population. Exercise intolerance, evaluated as a reduction in exercise capacity
      (VO2 peak), has been shown to predict mortality in patients with CF independent of lung
      function. A critical barrier to improving exercise tolerance in CF is the lack of knowledge
      regarding the different physiological mechanisms which contribute to decreased exercise
      capacity. The present investigation will not only evaluate the impact that sildenafil has on
      clinically relevant and patient oriented outcomes, it will also provide mechanistic insight.

      Phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors reduce inflammation, improve vascular health,
      increase microvascular O2 delivery and improve skeletal muscle function. Accordingly, the
      central hypothesis of the study is that treatment with the PDE5 inhibitor, sildenafil, can
      improve exercise capacity, vascular and cardiac function, and overall quality of life, all of
      which may contribute to improvement in exercise tolerance in people with CF
