  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Phase 1 research study is to obtain data or information on the safety and
      effectiveness of the combination of gemcitabine, docetaxel with radiation.

      Primary Objective:

      • To determine the maximum tolerated doses Gemcitabine and Taxotere when given weekly with
      concurrent radiation in the neoadjuvant setting for patients with soft tissue sarcoma of the
      extremities.

      Secondary Objective:

      • To evaluate immunological changes induced by gemcitabine and docetaxel with radiation in
      patient with high risk-soft tissue sarcomas in blood. This would include T cell subsets, NK,
      and dendritic cells and tumor macrophages all of which make up the tumor microenvironment.

    <time_frame>8 weeks post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Complication/side effects from the chemotherapy combination of gemcitabine and taxotere concurrent with radiation will be assessed by toxicity counts/rates presented descriptively by toxicity, severity, and dose level using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Immunological Changes in Blood</measure>
    <time_frame>4 years</time_frame>
    <description>The effects of the treatment on the immune system will be analyzed using paired t-test or the non-parametric counterpart. Correlations between immune cells and immune factor levels will be assessed using Spearman correlation coefficient. All tests will be two-sided with a significance level of 0.05, and no adjustment for multiple comparisons will be made due to the exploratory nature of these studies.</description>
