          9. Unstable seizure disorder as defined by any seizure in the 6 months prior to baseline
             visit and/or a change in any anti-convulsant drug dosing in the 60 days prior to study
             screen.

         10. Abnormal baseline safety lab assessments including, but not limited to ALT or AST
             greater than 1.5x the upper limit of normal, elevated ANA, total bilirubin or
             creatinine greater than 1x the upper limit of normal, other clinically relevant lab
             abnormality, or abnormality in ECG, HR or BP at screening as determined by the
             investigator or designee.

             during the course of the study

         14. Inability to attend scheduled study visits, plans for family relocation during the
             study, or any other criteria that the investigator may determine to be associated with
