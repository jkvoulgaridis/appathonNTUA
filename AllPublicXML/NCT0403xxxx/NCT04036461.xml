    <textblock>
      Study CC-99712-MM-001 is an open-label, Phase 1, dose escalation (Part A) and expansion (Part
      B), First-in-Human (FIH) clinical study of CC-99712 in subjects with relapsed and refractory
      multiple myeloma (MM). The dose escalation part (Part A) of the study will evaluate the
      safety and tolerability of escalating doses of CC-99712, administered intravenously (IV), to
      determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and non-tolerated dose (NTD) of CC-99712 using a
      modified accelerated titration design and Bayesian methodology. The MTD and NTD may be
      established separately for CC-99712 administered at Q3W and/ or Q4W schedules. The expansion
      part (Part B) will further evaluate the safety and efficacy of CC-99712 administered at or
      below the MTD in selected expansion cohorts in order to determine the RP2D. One or more
      dosing regimens may be selected for cohort expansion. All subjects will be treated until
      confirmed disease progression per IMWG criteria, unacceptable toxicity, or
      subject/Investigator decision to withdraw.

                       is performed within the prior 72 hours). A serum or urine pregnancy test
                       (investigators discretion) must also be performed at the end of study for
                       each FCBP.

                  participating in the study, during dose interruptions, and for at least 42 days
                  following CC-99712 discontinuation, even if he has undergone a successful
                  vasectomy.
