    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is at the first stage: a comparative assessment of the safety of
      the two methods of vaccine administration, at the second - an assessment of the safety and
      state of post-vaccination immunity at different times after vaccination
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the first stage estimate of safety of vaccine after its single administration to the nasal
      cavity by the drip method or by spray - dispenser during the period of observation in 30 days
      with the participation of 24 volunteers, divided into 2 groups of 12 people for each method
      of administration

      After interim analysis of safety data is subject to the consent of the local ethics Committee
      of the Research Centre about the possibility of further studies of the drug - will be started
      the second phase of the study, which, along with continued security research, provides the
      definition of the parameters of immunogenicity of the study drug. The second phase of the
      study will included 200 participants, including 100 people will receive the study drug and
      100 will be a control group of observation - that is, will get a placebo.
