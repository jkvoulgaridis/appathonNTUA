      Primary Objective:

      To evaluate the effect of dupilumab on sleep quality in adult patients with moderate to
      severe atopic dermatitis (AD)

      Secondary Objectives:

      To evaluate the effect of dupilumab on objective and subjective quantitative sleep
      parameters, AD related outcomes, and daytime consequences of sleep deprivation

      To continue to assess the safety and tolerability throughout the study

          -  with diagnosed chronic atopic dermatitis (AD), demonstrated 1) inadequate response to
             topical medications, 2) expected severity of AD and 3) sleep disturbance

          -  having applied skin emollients (moisturizers) at least 7 days before screening

          -  having applied medium potency topical corticosteroids (TCS) on all active AD lesions
             at least 7 days before screening

          -  willing and able to comply with all clinic visits and study-related procedures

          -  providing signed informed consent

        Exclusion criteria:

        Participants excluded from the study:

          -  with known hypersensitivity to Dupixent, clinical depression, drug abuse history,
             sleep problems not related to AD, irregular sleep pattern, active/acute infections,
             severe medical conditions, laboratory abnormalities, any condition that may present
             unreasonable risk to patients or interfere with study assessment, or any severe
             concomitant illness(es) that would adversely affect the patient's participation in the
             study, and contraindications of topical corticosteroids
