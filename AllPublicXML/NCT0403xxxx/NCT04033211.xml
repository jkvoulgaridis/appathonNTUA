  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate if the application of a Chlorhexidine coated suture
      (Novosyn® CHD) will reduce the colonization of bacteria in comparison to an uncoated suture
      (Novosyn®) used for the closure of trocar wounds in laparoscopic surgery (appendectomy and
      cholecystectomy).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The bacteriostatic and bactericidal effect of Novosyn® CHD will be assessed by the incidence
      of surgical site infection (SSI) in each suture group until 30 days postoperatively. The
      frequency of infections (SSI: A1 and A2) is considered as a suitable parameter for the
      assessment of efficacy. It is expected that the use of the Novosyn® CHD suture will reduce
      the occurrence of infections (SSI: A1 and A2) 30 days postoperatively compared to Novosyn
      suture (primary objective). SSI will be classified according to the Centre of Disease Control
      and Prevention (CDC), therefore the time point for assessment of SSI as set to 30 days
      postoperatively.

      Furthermore, short-term and long-term complications, the handling of the suture material,
      length of postoperative hospital stay, costs, pain, quality of life, time to return to work,
      hernia rate including umbilical hernias and the cosmetic outcome will also be assessed as
      secondary objectives.

    <measure>Course of Health Status</measure>

    <description>EQ-5D is a standardised measure of health status developed by EuroQol Group in order to provide a simple, generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal. EQ-5D is designed for self-completion by respondents and it takes only a few minutes to complete. Instructions to respondents are included in the questionnaire. EQ-5D-5L consists of 2 pages - descriptive system and the EQ visual Analogue scale (EQ-VAS). The descriptive system comprises 5 dimensions (mobility, self care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression). Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The EQ VAS records the respondents self rated health on a 20 cm vertical , visual analogue scale with endpoints labelled &quot;the best health you can imagine&quot; and &quot; the worst health you can imagine&quot;</description>
