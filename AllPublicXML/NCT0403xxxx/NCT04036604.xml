  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alteration of hormonal structure and decreasing of muscle tissue with aging causes pelvic
      floor dysfunction. Over age of 65 so many factors such as decrease in volume of muscle
      tissue, decrease in the amount of estrogen / testosterone, and low level of physical activity
      cause problems such as incontinence, prolapse, constipation and sexual dysfunction The aim of
      this study is to investigate the effectiveness of pelvic floor exercise program on sexual
      dysfunction, incontinence, quality of life and physical activity level in elderly.

    <textblock>
      Pelvic floor problems including prolapse, voiding and defecation dysfunction have been seen
      in approximately 37% of women aged 60-79 years and incontinence is the leading pelvic floor
      dysfunction. The International Incontinence Society (ICS)defines that all types of
      involuntarily urinary leakage as urinary incontinence. The incidence of urinary incontinence
      is 26.6% in women aged 65-74 and 41.8% in patients aged 75 and over. Sexual dysfunction is
      also frequently encountered problem in pelvic floor disorders in people older than 65 years.
      The aim of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of pelvic floor exercise program on
      sexual dysfunction, incontinence, quality of life and physical activity level in elderly.
      Pelvic floor exercises programme contains different contractions of pelvic floor muscle. Each
      exercises have slow and fast twitch muscle exercise contraction.

    <description>The FSFI is a brief questionnaire measure of sexual functioning in women. It was developed for the specific purpose of assessing domains of sexual functioning (e.g. sexual arousal, orgasm, satisfaction, pain) in clinical trials.</description>

    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The ICIQ-UI Short Form is a brief and psychometrically robust patient-completed questionnaire for evaluating the frequency, severity and impact on quality of life (QoL) of urinary incontinence in men and women in research and clinical practice across the world. It is scored on a scale from 0-21.</description>

    <measure>SEAPI-QMM</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The SEAPI incontinence questionnaire includes 5 data points that rate severity of specific urinary symptoms. The SEAPI-QMM Incontinence Classification System was developed in the early 1990s as a system that could quantify urinary incontinence and its impact without special equipment or time-consuming procedures.</description>

    <measure>Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) is a brief (5 minutes) and easily scored survey designed specifically to assess physical activity in epidemiological studies of persons age 65 years and older[6].
The PASE score combines information on leisure, household and occupational activity[7]. The PASE assesses the types of activities typically chosen by older adults (walking, recreational activities, exercise, housework, yard work, and caring for others. It uses frequency, duration, and intensity level of activity over the previous week to assign a score, ranging from 0 to 793, with higher scores indicating greater physical activity. PASE was initially developed in early 90s to provide an instrument to investigate specifically older people with an age-specific physical activity questionnaire, filling what was an important need in epidemiological research at that time</description>
