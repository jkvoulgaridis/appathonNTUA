      Clinical trial of Tofacitinib, Ruxolitinib, and Baricitinib have shown promising prospects
      for the treatment of alopecia areata (especially severe alopecia areata) with JAK
      inhibitors，Jaktinib Dihydrochloride Monohydrate is a potent inhibitor of JAK1 、JAK2 and
      JAK3．This was a phase Ⅱ, open-label, Multi-center,randomized study to Evaluating Safety and
      Efficacy of oral Jaktinib Dihydrochloride Monohydrate (150mg qd or 200 mg qd) for the
