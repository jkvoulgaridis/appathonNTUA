  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to investigate the absorption, metabolism, and excretion of EYP001a as
      well as the safety/tolerability of EYP001a following the administration of a single oral dose
      to healthy male volunteers. The EYP001a dose is administered in a [14C]-labeled form to
      enable detection and quantitation of dose-related material independent of possible
      biotransformation.

    <textblock>
      This is a single site, open-label, mass balance phase 1 study.

      Six healthy male subjects will receive a single oral dose A of [14C]-EYP001a containing 100
      μCi radioactivity.

        -  Eligibility is assessed during a screening period of up to 4 weeks.

        -  Subjects will check into the clinic one day prior to dosing (Day -1) for baseline
           assessments and to (re-)confirm eligibility.

        -  The study drug will be administered on Day 1, after an overnight fast of at least 10
           hours.

        -  Blood, urine and fecal samples will be collected up to and including Day 4. If the study
           discharge criteria are not met on Day 4, blood, urine and fecal samples will be
           collected in 24- hour intervals until the study discharge criteria are met.

        -  An End of Study Visit will be planned at Day 14 (+/- 1 Day).
