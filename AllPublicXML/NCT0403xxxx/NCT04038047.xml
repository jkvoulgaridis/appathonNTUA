  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center observational study. The study is designed to measure the
      clinical effectiveness of elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor triple combination therapy
      (TCT) in people with one or more copies of the F508del mutation, study the effects of TCT
      across a number of CF disease manifestations, and collect specimens for future research.
      Subjects in the study will have one &quot;before TCT&quot; visit within 30 days before initiation of
      the therapy and five &quot;after TCT&quot; visits over a 24-month follow-up period. Most participating
      sites will be divided into sub-study groups; each sub-study group will have specific
      non-optional procedures conducted in addition to the &quot;Core&quot; procedures. Finally there are
      four optional procedures (pH pill, transient elastography, and nasal cell procurement) that
      will be offered to subjects at certain sites. The duration of participation for each subject
      is 25 months. NOTE: FDA is currently reviewing the New Drug Application (NDA) for the TCT.
      Study will not begin unless and until FDA approval is granted.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder caused by mutations in the
      gene encoding the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. In
      people with CF, this manifests as dysfunction in multiple organ systems including the lungs,
      pancreas, liver, intestines, skin and others.

      While nearly 2000 mutations have been described, the most common disease-causing CFTR
      mutation is F508del, which is found in &gt;85% of patients followed in the US CF Patient
      Registry. Two CFTR corrector drugs plus the potentiator ivacaftor have been developed as a
      triple combination therapy for CF patients with one or two copies of the F508del mutation. We
      predict that over 90% of CF patients (initially age 12 y/o and above) will be eligible for
      highly effective CFTR modulator therapy in the U.S.

      The PROMISE study is designed to measure the direct and indirect CFTR-dependent anion
      secretion by collecting and analyzing clinical research outcomes and biomarkers on a large
      number of patients both before and after they begin treatment with elexacaftor, tezacaftor
      and ivacaftor triple combination therapy (TCT). This study will investigate the impact of TCT
      across a wide range of CF disease manifestations and organ systems. While specific biomarkers
      of special interest have been selected for detailed analysis in this study, an additional
      important goal is to collect blood, urine, stool, and airway epithelial cell specimens for
      long-term storage in a biorepository to enable future research. These samples can be made
      available for research beyond the current scope of work. The PROMISE study will provide a
      coordinated collection of clinical research outcomes data that can be linked with these
      specimens.
