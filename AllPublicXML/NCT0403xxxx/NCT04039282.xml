  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dietary assessment is a key component of the dietetic care process. Assessments usually take
      place within dietetic consultations using methods such as 24-hour recall and paper food
      diaries. This study will examine the feasibility of using an online dietary assessment tool,
      myfood24 as an alternative to current dietary assessment practices and explore the barriers
      and facilitators to its use within dietetic clinical practice. This will be a mixed method
      study using questionnaires and semi structures interviews with both dietitians and patients.
      Dietitians, and patients with a range of clinical conditions referred to an NHS Dietetic
      Service, will be recruited. Patients will be asked to trial the system to record their food
      intake prior to their dietetic appointment. This data will then be used for the dietary
      assessment within the consultation. Following this, patients and dietitians will be
      interviewed about their experiences. Quantitative data will be statistically analysed, and
      thematic analysis will be used to analyse qualitative data.
