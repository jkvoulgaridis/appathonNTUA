  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this project is to gather research data and subsequently evaluate algorithms
      to demonstrate clinical efficacy of a novel sleep apnoea detection system in the paediatric
      population.

      The Study will involve patients who will have been referred for diagnosis of sleep apnoea,
      and the ultimate aim will be to compare the output of a novel apnoea detection system against
      in -clinic polysomnography.

      in -clinic polysomnography.

      Patients who are referred to the clinic will spend one night's sleep in the clinic. They will
      wear a polysomnography system (current goldstandard) and the novel device.

      At the end of the trial, we will compare the diagnosis results from both systems.
