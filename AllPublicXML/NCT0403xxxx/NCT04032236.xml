  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nicotine is a psychoactive substance and its effect is demonstrated by neuronal
      nicotinic-acetylcholine receptors excreted in the brain and periphery. Psychoactive
      substances such as nicotine and caffeine play a role in rewarding through the mesolimbic
      dopaminergic system. The released dopamine produces pharmacological effects that can cause
      pleasurable emotions. These effects are an important factor in maintaining smoking
      motivation.

      The rate of absorption of nicotine from the buccal mucosa, the rate and amount of dependence,
      significantly affects the risk. In addition to PH, other factors such as local blood flow,
      product nematode, size and surface area of the tobacco mixture, constant pH holding capacity,
      and nicotine content of the tobacco can affect nicotine absorption. To facilitate the
      absorption of nicotine from the buccal mucosa, various substances that increase absorption
      have been investigated. Increased alkalinity has been shown to increase nicotine absorption
      and physiological effects by buffering alkaline pH values with moist snuff products and
      nicotine gums. Although other factors may affect the nicotine absorption rate in oral
      tobacco, it is stated that the main factor that determines the rate of nicotine absorption is
      pH.

      Factors that trigger nicotine use include stress in daily life, daily routines, eating and
      drinking habits, and especially the use of caffeine. The chronic use of caffeine causes
      tolerance in many of its effects, and the use of nicotine reduces tolerance effects and also
      potentiates the effects stimulated through the dopaminergic pathway. It has been reported
      that smokers consume more caffeine than non-smokers.

      In the present study, the relationship between oral pH and cigarette demand after caffeine
      consumption will be investigated. Until now, the relation between cigarette pre- and
      post-caffeine saliva pH and cigarette smoking has not been investigated. In addition, the
      effects of drinking behavior and changes in salivary pH on cigarette desire will be
      investigated and evidence of behavioral methods applied in cigarette smoking cessation
      treatment will be provided.

      Nicotine dependence is accepted as the most common disease and can be treated with medical
      methods like other diseases. Scientifically proven pharmacotherapy as well as cognitive and
      behavioral therapy play an important role in reducing cigarette smoking. In this context, it
      is suggested that the motivation of the person should be questioned, the daily behavioral
      models should be questioned, the elements triggering the desire for smoking should be
      identified and the methods of combating them should be developed and the usual vital actions
      including eating and drinking should be organized. Consumption of acidic foods causes acidic
      pH in the mouth and salivation increases in order to neutralize it. After meals; tea or
      coffee, it was reported that smoking desire increases.

      Caffeine is another psychostimulant substance found in varying proportions in coffee and tea,
      and its antagonistic effects on the locomotor system are at adenosine receptors level.
      Stimulated at low doses and depressed at high doses. Nicotine has a stimulating effect on
      locomotor activity in chronic use. The chronic use of caffeine causes tolerance in many
      effects, and nicotine use decreases tolerance effects and also potentiates the effects
      stimulated through the dopaminergic pathway. It has been reported that smokers consume more
      caffeine than non-smokers. There are also studies reporting that there is no interaction
      between caffeine and nicotine and that cocaine consumption increases cigarette smoking as
      well as epidemiological studies that relate caffeine and nicotine concurrent consumption to
      pharmacological effects rather than pharmacological effects after food and between studies
      that are the two most common actions due to stress. However, this effect is not entirely due
      to the pharmacological effects of caffeine, but influences the intraoral pH and affects the
      cigarette smoking desire. In this study, the main aim is to investigate the effect of changes
      in salivary pH on the desire to smoke and how the drinking behavior of water affected this
      desire.
