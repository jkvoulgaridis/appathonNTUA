      This study is a retrospective study. Enrollment study. Enrolled in the Department of
      Hepatology, Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Department of Liver
      Histology, Department of Hepatology, Chronic HBV HBV infection. The data collected included
      patient gender, . The data collected included patient gender, . The data collected included
      the patient's gender, age, HBV age of infection, past family history, etc., the age of the
      collected subjects, the current family history, etc., the liver histopathological diagnosis
      information collected in the group, and the liver disease examination Clinical toxicities and
      indicators, including serological diagnostic information, clinical toxicities and indicators
