  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical inactivity in people with cerebral palsy (CP) has been linked with increased risk of
      cardiometabolic disease. Exercise studies rarely include people with CP with severe walking
      impairments and assess the sustainability of the intervention. RaceRunning allows people
      severe walking impairments to independently propel themselves using a running bike, which has
      a breast plate for support but no pedals. This project will assess the feasibility of at
      trial into the effectiveness of RaceRunning to reduce cardiometabolic disease risk factors
      and improve functional mobility. Intervention: Weekly standardised RaceRunning sessions over
      6 months led by an experienced coach. Participants Twenty-five young people with CP aged
      5-21, GMFCS levels III-V. Feasibility outcomes: Acceptability of RaceRunning, adherence and
      fidelity of the intervention, recruitment and retention rates and adverse events. Outcome
      measures: Cardiometabolic disease risk factors (physical activity, sedentary time, resting
      heart rate and blood pressure and aerobic capacity) and functional mobility assessed at
      baseline, 3 and 6 months. Quality of life (EQ-5D-Y) and health service use will inform a
      future cost-effectiveness analysis. Aspects of feasibility and acceptability and the
      variability and patterns of the change in outcomes will be reported using descriptive
      statistics.

      This is a multi-centre experimental study with a single intervention arm. Assessments will be
      conducted at baseline, 12 weeks and 24 weeks. The intervention will be delivered in Scotland
      and Gloucestershire. Participants will take part in one RaceRunning session each week for a
      period of 24 weeks. The content of the sessions will be standardised for all training groups
      and will consist of a warm-up, coordination (drills), sprint and endurance training, and
      cool-down. The training program will be adapted to the athlete's ability and fitness. The
      project objectives are to examine the feasibility of delivering and acceptability of
      participating in RaceRunning as a community-based intervention for young people with
      moderate-to-severe CP, including fidelity to and safety of the intervention. Secondly, to
      examine the feasibility of conducting a definitive study of RaceRunning including exploring
      recruitment and retention over 24 weeks, acceptability of data collection methods and rate of
      outcome measure completion, and acceptability and quantity of missing data relating to health
      economic data collection tools. Finally, to examine the variability and patterns of change in
      outcomes over 24 weeks in order to determine a primary outcome measure and calculate sample
      size for a future study.

    <description>RaceRunning (www.racerunning.org) is a growing disability sport that provides an opportunity for people with moderate-to-severe CP to participate in exercise in the community. It allows those who are unable to walk independently, to propel themselves using a RaceRunning bike, which has a breastplate for support but no pedals. Participants sit on the saddle and use their legs to propel themselves forward.</description>
