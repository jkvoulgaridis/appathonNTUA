  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Major depression (MD) in youth is a serious psychiatric illness with extensive morbidity and
      mortality. The American Academy of Pediatrics recently released practice guidelines promoting
      primary care (PC)-based youth MD screening; however, even when diagnosed by PC providers,
      &lt;50% of youth with MD access treatment. Thus, a need exists for interventions that are
      feasible for youths and parents to access and complete—and that may strengthen parents'
      likelihood of pursuing longer-term services. Single-session interventions (SSIs) may help
      forward these goals. SSIs include elements of comprehensive treatments, but their brevity
      makes them easier to disseminate at scale. Meta-analytic evidence suggests SSIs can reduce
      youth psychopathology, including self-administered (e.g., online) SSIs. One computer-based
      SSI, teaching growth mindset (GM; viewing personal traits as malleable), has reduced
      adolescent depressive symptoms in multiple RCTs; GM-SSIs have also improved parents'
      expectancies that psychotherapy could benefit their children's mental health. This project
      will test whether these online, youth- and parent-directed GM-SSIs—designed to reduce youth
      depressive symptoms and improve parents' mental health treatment expectancies,
      respectively—may increase mental health service access, reduce youth depressive symptoms, and
      relieve parental stress following PC-based youth MD screening. Youths reporting elevated MD
      symptoms at PC visits (N = 200) will receive either Information/Psychoeducation/Referral
      (IPR) or IPR plus parent- and youth-directed GM-SSIs (IPR+SSI). The investigators will
      examine whether IPR+SSI, versus IPR alone, increases MD service access; reduces parental
      stress; and reduces youth depressive symptoms across three months. Results may yield a
      disseminable model for promoting youth treatment access after PC-based depression screening.

    <intervention_model_description>Youths reporting elevated MD symptoms at a PC visit (N = 200) will be randomly assigned to one of two conditions (within a waitlist-control design): Information, Psychoeducation, and Referral (IPR; ie., usual care, or the &quot;control&quot;) or IPR enhanced with youth- and parent-directed online SSIs (IPR+SSI), designed to reduce youth MD symptoms and improve parents' expectancies of mental health treatment, respectively.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Participating youths and parents will be aware of whether they are receiving the online interventions immediately or after the 3-month follow-up period (i.e., whether they are in the 'intervention group' or the 'waitlist group'). However, participating families will be assigned to these conditions via an online survey, which they complete remotely, and condition assignments will be unknown to the research team and the youth's primary care provider.</masking_description>

    <measure>Mental Health Treatment-Seeking Behavior Checklist</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 3-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>At baseline and 3-month follow-up, parents will indicate whether they have engaged in each of four treatment-seeking behaviors for their child: researched local mental healthcare providers/agencies for their child; contacted a mental healthcare provider or agency about treatment for their child; contacted child's school regarding mental health supports for their child; and scheduled an appointment OR placed child on a waiting-list with a mental healthcare provider/agency. Total number of treatment-seeking behaviors between baseline and 3-month follow-up may range from 0 to 4. Individual behaviors are self-reported by parents on as 'yes' or 'no' (noting whether they engaged in the behavior during the study period). At baseline, parents will report on whether they engaged in these behaviors 'since the child's last doctor's appointment.' At follow-up, parents will report whether they have engaged in these behaviors 'since their past survey, 3 months ago.'</description>

    <description>Includes 2 online, one-session programs (one for youths; one for parents) and Primary Care-based IPR. The 30-min, self-administered YOUTH PROGRAM includes: An introduction to the brain and a lesson on neuroplasticity; Testimonials from older youths who describe their views that traits are malleable, due to the brain's plasticity; Further stories by older youths, describing times when they used &quot;growth mindsets&quot; to persevere during social/emotional setbacks; Study summaries noting how/why personality can change; And an exercise in which youths write notes to younger students, using scientific information to explain people's capacity for change. In the 15-min Qualtrics-based PARENT PROGRAM, parents read 2 scientific passages on (1) the notion that emotions are flexible in youth and adults, and (2) that failure promotes personal growth. After each passage, parents write a persuasive summary of its main arguments, directed to fellow parents who may benefit from the information.</description>
