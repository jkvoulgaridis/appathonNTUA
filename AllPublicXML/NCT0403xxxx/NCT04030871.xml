  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This document is a protocol for a human research study. This study is to be conducted
      according to US and international standards of Good Clinical Practice (International
      Conference on Harmonization ICHE6, R2), the Code of Federal Regulations Title 21 parts 803
      and 812, and other applicable government regulations and Institutional research policies and
      procedures. The purpose of the study is to compare the cost effectiveness and tolerability of
      standard of care gastrostomy tubes to newer capsule dome gastrostomy tubes. The newer tubes
      are significantly more expensive, therefore the aims of this study will be to determine
      economic feasibility of going to the new model. Data are lacking on the newer g-tubes in
      terms of longevity and cost-effectiveness

      Gastrostomy tubes are enteral feeding devices that are designed to provide delivery of
      nutrients, fluids, medications directly into the stomach, bypassing the mouth and esophagus.
      These devices are also known as gastrostomy tubes (G-tubes) or percutaneous endoscopic
      gastrostomy tube (PEG tube). These are used when patients have conditions that make them
      unable to swallow. While parenteral (Intravenous) nutrition and nasogastric tubes are also
      nutritional-support methods. A variety of g-tube designs have been used in pediatric to adult
      populations. The insertion of a g-tube is one of the most common endoscopic procedures and is
      relatively safe. The OSU endoscopy lab placed 381 g-tubes in 2018.

      The most common G-tube used by the OSU Endoscopy Lab is the Balloon Bolus feeding tube. In
      2017 the Capsule Dome G-Tube became commercially available. The cost of the Capsule dome
      g-tube is twice as expensive as the standard balloon g-tube. The insertion costs would be
      comparable.

      The need to perform a pilot comparative study of the two g-tubes is necessary to improve our
      physicians understanding of the potential cost-effectiveness that longer patency we could
      gather from the alternative device.
