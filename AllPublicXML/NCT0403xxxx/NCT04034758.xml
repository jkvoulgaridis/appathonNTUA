  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess the safety and efficacy of heterologous fecal microbiota
      transplantation (FMT) by Standardized Quantitative multi-donor Intestinal Microbiota Capsule
      (SQIMC-md) in mild-moderate ulcerative colitis patients who fail to achieve clinical
      remission over 4 weeks after full dose 5-Aminosalicylic acid(5-ASA). Intestinal microbiota
      transplant for FMT will be prepared from multiple healthy donors and prepared by standardized
      procedure with fixed quantitative dosage. This strategy might offer a novel and safe
      therapeutic approach for these patients before step up to corticosteroid, immunosuppressant
      or biologics therapy.

      All candidates for mild-moderate ulcerative colitis treated in Dept. Gastroenterology, Tongji
      Hospital, Tongji Medical College of HUST, the second Xiangya Hospital of central south
      university and the first affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University will be screened for
      study inclusion and exclusion criteria. All consenting patients will 2:1 randomized into
      SQIMC-md treatment group or Placebo group. Three dose of SQIMC-md capsule will be orally
      administrated on day1, day2 and day3. Follow-up will be performed every 4 weeks and last for
      12weeks. Full dose of 5-ASA is orally administrated simultaneously during the study. Clinical
      data and outcome will be collected and documented in electronic case reported form (eCRF).

      FMT DONORS:

      Potential healthy adult stool donors (between 18 and 28 years of age) will be recruited by
      the research staff. They will be asked to volunteer for the screening and regularly supply
      stool samples according to the study protocol.

Mayo score (Disease activity index) for Ulcerative Colitis. Total range for complete Mayo score 0-12 (sum from 4 subscales below) and partial Mayo score 0-9 (sum from 1,2 and 4 subscales below):
Each subscale for mayo score:
Stool frequency: 0-3
Rectal bleeding: 0-3
Mayo endoscopic score: 0-3
Estimation from physician: 0-3
Clinical response rate is defined as a decrease of ≥ 3 points and at least 30% from baseline in the Mayo score, with an accompanying decrease of ≥ 1 point in the subscore for rectal bleeding or an absolute subscore ≤ 1 for rectal bleeding</description>
