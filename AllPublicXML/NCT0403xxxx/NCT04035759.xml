  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study assesses the feasibility and acceptability of the APPEAL program, a 3-session
      intervention designed to promote positive affect among men and women living with HIV
      infection. Forty participants will be randomly assigned to receive the APPEAL program, and
      another 40 will receive standard of care. All participants will complete self-reported
      assessments at baseline and at 3 and 6 months, and will have their HIV antiretroviral
      medication adherence monitored as part of study participation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is strong reason to expand the scope of current adherence programs to include
      consideration of a group of health protective variables known as 'psychosocial assets'. These
      assets include cognitive factors, such as optimism, emotional factors, such as positive
      affect, and positive social relationships. Increased psychosocial assets such as positive
      affect are associated with reduced morbidity and mortality, slower slower HIV progression,
      and reduced burden of depression symptoms. However, there has been limited translation of
      positive affect interventions to support patient self-management. In this study, we extend
      previous research on positive affect and adherence through the APPEAL program. The Affect,
      Promoting Positive Engagement, and Adherence for Life (APPEAL) program is an intervention
      that combines positive affect approaches to promote adherence in patients who have suboptimal
      adherence. We seek to implement the program, assess its feasibility, and describe
      associations with theoretically derived mechanisms of change, including positive affect.

    <measure>Changes in the proposed mechanistic target of positive and negative emotions, assessed using the Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PANAS is a 20 item measure which assesses emotions utilizing 5 response options for each question, ranging in value from 1 to 5. PANAS includes two 10-item subscales: positive affect and negative affect. Positive affect and negative affect items are summed separately, with each subscale ranging from 10 to 50. Higher scores for positive affect subscale indicate higher levels of positive affect and lower scores for negative affect items indicate lower levels of negative affect</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The MDES is a 20 item measure which assesses emotions utilizing 5 response options for each question, ranging in value from 0 to 4. MDES includes two 10-item subscales: positive affect and negative affect. Positive affect and negative affect items are summed separately, and each is divided by 10, with each subscale ranging from 0 to 4. Higher score for each subscale indicate greater frequency of experiencing positive or negative emotions.</description>

    <measure>Measurement properties (range, missingness, reliability) and mean scores with standard deviations for the Drug Abuse Screening Test (DAST 10)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The DAST 10 is a 10 item screen for drug abuse. It includes 10 items, each response with a 0 or 1. Items are summed, with a range of responses from 0 to 10. Higher scores indicate greater negative consequences of drug abuse.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Measurement properties (range, missingness, reliability) and mean scores with standard deviations for the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS4)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PSS4 measures perceived stress. Each of the 4 items has five possible response options, ranging from 0 to 4. The resulting summed scale can range from 0 to 16, with higher scores indicating greater stress.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Measurement properties (range, missingness, reliability) and mean scores with standard deviations for the Coping Strategies Inventory, Short Form (CSISF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The CSISF is a 16 item scale assessing approaches to coping with stressors. Each of the items has 5 potential response options, ranging from 1 to 5, and items are grouped into four 4-item subscales. Items within each subscale are summed, resulting in a subscale range from 4 to 20. Higher scores on each of the subscales, focused on 1) Problem-Focused Engagement, (2) Problem-Focused Disengagement, (3) Emotion-Focused Engagement, and (4) Emotion-Focused Disengagement, indicates greater frequency of use of that particular coping strategy.</description>

    <measure>Measurement properties (range, missingness, reliability) and mean scores with standard deviations for the Revised Life Orientation Test (LOT-R)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The LOT-R is a 6-item measure of generalized optimism versus pessimism. For each of the items there are 5 response options ranging from 0 to 4. Items are summed with a scale range of 0 to 24, and with higher scores indicating greater optimism.</description>

    <measure>Measurement properties (range, missingness, reliability) and mean scores with standard deviations for the Patient Health Questionnaire-8 item (PHQ8)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PHQ8 is an 8-item measure assessing burden of depression symptoms. Each item has 4 response options ranging from 0 to 3; items are summed with a resulting scale range of 0 to 24. Higher scores suggest greater risk for depression.</description>

    <measure>Measurement properties (range, missingness, reliability) and mean scores with standard deviations for the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test - Concise (AUDIT-C)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The AUDIT-C is a 3-item measure assessing risk for alcohol use disorder. Each item has 4 response options ranging from 0 to 4, and items are summed with a resulting range from 0 to 12. In men, a score of 4 or more is considered positive for an alcohol use disorder; in women, a score of 3 or more is considered positive.</description>
