  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a complex disease associate to metabolic alterations, which may lead to
      cardiometabolic risk in women with obesity. The use of interactive digital technology as
      adjuvante tool to the clinical practices in weight loss therapy emerges as an innovative
      strategy. However, it was note fully investigated if this kind of approach can contribute to
      improve inflammatory state and metabolic alterations in obese population.

      This study consists in a 12-week clinical interdisciplinary weight loss therapy, with
      endocrinologist, nutritionist, psychologist and exercise physiologist to evaluate the effects
      of clinical interdisciplinary therapy associated to use the eletronic means on inflammatory
      biomarkers and metabolic alterations in women with obesity.

      The present study was composed by a sample of obese women (20 to 45 years old), recruited
      through advertisements in the media (newspapers, magazines, radio, television and social
      media - Twitter®, Facebook® and Instagram®). The volunteers lived in the city of São Paulo or
      nearby, so they could attend monthly the University on the days of the clinical, nutritional,
      psychological and exercise evaluations, counseling, educational sessions and motivational
      strategies supporting adherence. To complete the Education Behaviors Program the volunteers
      follow weekly the instructions found in the Platform #12Semanas®. All participants met the
      inclusion criteria for the obesity profile according to the World Health Organization (WHO),
      presenting Body Mass Index (BMI) values above 30 kg/m². Patients with any pathology that
      could compromise the results of the study (heart disease, musculoskeletal deformities,
      diseases related to the immune system, genetic, metabolic or endocrine diseases, identified
      by the physician) were not included in the study. Anthropometric measures, body composition
      by bio-impedance and bood samples were collected to serum analysis.
