  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this research study is two-fold, 1) to determine if body composition and
      body image perception are affected through the different phases of the menstrual cycle, and
      2) if an acute session of resistance training can have different effects depending on the
      menstrual cycle phase.

      The purpose of the research is to establish whether body composition and body image
      perception are affected throughout the different phases of the menstrual cycle and if the
      perception can be modified through resistance training. To the best of our knowledge, only
      one study has analyzed the effects of the menstrual cycle on body image perception. However,
      research analyzing the effects of the menstrual cycle on both body image perception and, body
      composition is lacking. Furthermore, research in the effects of resistance training on
      menstrual cycle-related changes on both perceived and measured body composition are
      inexistent. Findings from this study have the potential to increase the knowledge about
      resistance training's effects in modulating body image perception throughout the menstrual
      cycle. Further understanding of these responses may set the groundwork to develop exercise
      intervention programs to reduce the risk of developing more serious mental conditions linked
      to unhealthy body image perception.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Female

          -  Sedentary or Active

          -  18.5-34.9 kg/m2 BMI

          -  Age range is 18-45 years old

          -  The inclusion of other participants may alter the results as an increase in body fat
             has been linked to known changes in different hormonal levels and those changes might
             influence substrate utilization

          -  Changes in the hormonal status of pre-menopausal women may appear without symptoms

          -  Younger females also display variations in their hormones since they are going through
             the process of development

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous physiological and mental health history

          -  Pregnant females
