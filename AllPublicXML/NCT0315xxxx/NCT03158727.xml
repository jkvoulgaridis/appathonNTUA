  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomised, multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase Ib/IIa
      study is to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of eASCs (Cx611) administered
      intravenously as adjunctive therapy, therefore in addition to standard of care (SoC) therapy,
      to patients with severe community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (sCABP).

      The completion of this study will contribute to the basic knowledge on stem cells and their
      mode-of-action, and has a large translational character, i.e. to document the safety and
      explore the efficacy of Cx611 in patients with sCABP.

      The purpose of this randomised, multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase Ib/IIa
      study is to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of eASCs (Cx611) administered
      intravenously as adjunctive therapy, therefore in addition to standard of care (SoC) therapy,
      to patients with severe community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (sCABP).

      The key objectives of this study are to:

      Primary objective:

      Investigate the safety profile of two allogeneic Cx611 80 mL infusions administered through a
      central line within 3 days (on days 1 and 3) at a dose of 160 million cells each (320 million
      cells total) and to monitor any adverse event and potential immunological host responses
      against the administered cells during 90 days of follow-up after the first infusion.

      Secondary objective:

      Explore the clinical efficacy of Cx611 in terms of a reduction of the duration of mechanical
      ventilation and/or need for vasopressors and/or improved survival, and/or clinical cure of
      the sCABP, and other efficacy-related endpoints.

    <ipd_description>Takeda makes patient-level, de-identified data sets and associated documents available for all interventional studies after applicable marketing approvals and commercial availability have been received (or program is completely terminated), an opportunity for the primary publication of the research and final report development has been allowed, and other criteria have been met as set forth in Takeda's Data Sharing Policy (see www.TakedaClinicalTrials.com for details). To obtain access, researchers must submit a legitimate academic research proposal for adjudication by an independent review panel, who will review the scientific merit of the research and the requestor's qualifications and conflict of interest that can result in potential bias. Once approved, qualified researchers who sign a data sharing agreement are provided access to these data in a secure research environment.</ipd_description>
