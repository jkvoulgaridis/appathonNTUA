  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are going to carry out a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial
      to study the efficiency and mechanism of bumetanide on the treatment of children with Autism
      Spectrum Disorder.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In consideration of the increasing number of autistic children and poor intervention effect
      in China, it is an urgent to find some effective medicine. Some studies have reported
      bumetanide, a classic diuretic, could improve autistic behaviors in both animal model and
      humans; while the efficiency of bumetanide on Chinese autistic chilren is unkonwn and the
      underlying mechanisms remain unfolding. The investigators aim at investigating whether
      bumetanide would improve the clinical symptoms in Chinese children with autism within a safe
      dosage and further study the physiological mechanism beneath.The investigators will regularly
      assess the participants' autism-related symptoms during medication, as well as the adverse
      effects of each patient. The investigators will carry out genome-wide association analysis
      (GWAS) from blood sample, related metabolites in nervous system and compare the concentration
      of the neurotransmitter in autistic brain before and after 3 months' treatmeat,and also will
      collect the EEG signal in autistic chilldren when the participants performing certain tasks
      before and after 3 months' treatment.

    <description>The Sensory Profile is a measure of children's responses to sensory events in daily life. The caregiver completes the Sensory Profile by assessing the frequency of the child's responses to certain sensory processing, modulation, and behavioral/emotional events as described in the 125 items.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 0 and Day 90</time_frame>
    <description>Symbolic Play Test is a nonverbal measure of symbolic functioning in participants aged 12-36 months. The test does not require any expressive speech, and is therefore appropriate for use with all participants with ASD. Participants are sequentially presented with four sets of toys, and their spontaneous manipulation of the objects is observed and recorded on a standardized checklist.</description>
