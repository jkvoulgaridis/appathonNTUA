  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Danish male patients who had undergone bilateral TAPP (July 2012 to June 2013) were recruited
      from the Danish Hernia Database and cross-checked with hospital files and the National
      Patient Registry. A standardized postal questionnaire was sent out two years after the index
      surgery to investigate Patients Related Outcome Measures (PROMs) such as chronic
      post-operative pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present study was primarily undertaken to provide evidence for the risk of
      activity-related chronic postoperative inguinal pain following bilateral TAPP in an all-male
      Danish setting. Impaired sexual activity and sleep disturbance due to pain was also recorded.
      Data based on nationwide consecutive patients undergoing bilateral TAPP. Data collected for
      the Danish Inguinal Hernia Database, hospital files and the National Patient Registry
      (Denmark).
