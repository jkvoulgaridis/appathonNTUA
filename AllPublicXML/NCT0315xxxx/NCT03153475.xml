    <textblock>
      Five-year, Prospective, multi-center, non-randomized, non-controlled study of the ATTUNE®
      Revision total knee prostheses, utilizing the fixed bearing (FB) and rotating platform (RP)
      tibial component with the posterior stabilizing (PS) femoral component in revision total knee
      arthroplasty.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed as a non-comparative, worldwide, multi-center study with up to 30 sites
      that will intend to implant a total of 400 Subjects (200 PS RP and 200 PS FB) with the study
      devices. The follow-up period of 5 years was selected to cover both the early post-operative
      period as well as the medium term period which is a good indicator of longer term
      survivorship.

      The primary endpoint of survivorship at 5 years was selected to capture the time period
      during which the majority of revision failures occur while providing a good indication of
      long term survivorship. The secondary outcomes include commonly used measures of clinical
      performance that will allow for comparison with published literature. Additionally, patient
      reported outcomes, AORI bone defect classification , satisfaction and pain scores will be
      collected and analyzed.

      Male and female Subjects, age 22-80 years, inclusive, with a failed primary knee
      arthroplasty, including unicompartmental or failed previous revision TKA, who are suitable
      candidates for revision TKA using the ATTUNE® Revision system are eligible for enrollment in
      this study. The use of the ATTUNE Revision system includes both partial and complete revision
      surgical procedures, including implantation of revision components as the second stage within
      a two-stage treatment for infection.
