  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Attachment injuries are events occurring within couple relationships that involve betrayal or
      abandonment by a significant other during times of need (e.g., infidelity). They can be
      understood as relationship traumas, which can lead to debilitating symptoms consistent with
      posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and generalized anxiety for the injured
      partner. Research has demonstrated that the presence of an attachment injury represents a
      barrier to empirically effective couple's therapy. However, disrupting memory reconsolidation
      with the beta-blocker propranolol has been shown to alleviate PTSD symptoms by attenuating
      the salience of the emotional trauma memory, representing an interesting avenue for the
      treatment of adjustment disorders stemming from attachment injuries. Here, the investigators
      aim to extend the conditions under which reconsolidation therapy with propranolol can be used
      in a clinical setting. The investigators hypothesize that, compared to a wait-list control,
      4-6 sessions of memory reactivation under propranolol would significantly reduce
      trauma-related, depression, and anxiety symptom, associated with an attachment injury.

    <masking_description>Randomization to 'waitlist group' or 'treatment group' will be done by a blind investigator at the time of the statistical analyses. The randomization scheme will use the permuted-block method with a block size of four, stratified by gender (male and female) and event type (infidelity and other), and a group allocation probability of 50% (Fleiss, 1986). A sensitivity analysis will be conducted by via a cross-over method, whereby the group allocation will be reversed, and all outcome data will be re-analyzed.</masking_description>
