  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the safety of escalating IV doses of Tc 99m tilmanocept in HIV (human
      immunodeficiency virus) subjects with confirmed KS and to compare results obtained from
      subcutaneous and IV administrations of Tc 99m tilmanocept in the same subjects.

      This is a Manocept Platform prospective, single-center, open-label, non-randomized, dose
      escalation, comparative, safety study of intravenously and subcutaneously injected Tc 99m
      tilmanocept in the localization and detection of cutaneous and non-cutaneous KS tumor(s) in
      subjects with biopsy-confirmed KS. Three IV doses (Âµg/mCi) of tilmanocept will be evaluated
      in three cohort groups. One subcutaneous dose will be evaluated in cohort group 3.

      This study is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of IV Tc
      99m tilmanocept and to compare results obtained from IV and subcutaneous administrations of
      Tc 99m tilmanocept in the same subjects. Whole body planar as well as SPECT/CT imaging will
      be performed to provide greater resolution of areas of Tc 99m tilmanocept localization. A
      biopsy of a non-visceral KS lesion will be taken to correlate pathology with Tc 99m
      tilmanocept localization.

      This study is designed to evaluate the use of Tc 99m tilmanocept as an imaging agent in
      HIV-positive subjects with known KS by evaluating localization in known and unknown cutaneous
      and non-cutaneous lesions.
