               -  Any factors that increase the risk of QTc prolongation or risk of arrhythmic
                  events such as heart failure, hypokalaemia, congenital long QT syndrome, family

               -  Patients with an ejection fraction (EF) &lt;55% or the lower limit of normal of the
                  institutional standard will be excluded. Only in cases where the Investigator (or
                  the treating physician or both) suspects cardiac disease with negative effect on
                  the EF, will the EF be measured during screening using an appropriate method
                  according to local standards to confirm eligibility (e.g., echocardiogram,
                  multi-gated acquisition scan). A historic measurement of EF no older than 6
                  months prior to first administration of study drug can be accepted provided that
                  there is clinical evidence that the EF value has not worsened since this
                  measurement in the opinion of the Investigator or of the treating physician or
                  both.

          -  History of pneumonitis within the last 5 years

          -  History of severe hypersensitivity reactions to other mAbs

             4 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment.

          -  Active autoimmune disease or a documented history of autoimmune disease, except
             vitiligo or resolved childhood asthma/atopy

          -  Active infection requiring systemic treatment (antibacterial, antiviral, or antifungal
             therapy) at start of treatment in this trial

          -  Known history of human immunodeficiency virus infection or an active hepatitis B or C
             virus infection

          -  Interstitial lung disease

          -  Chronic alcohol or drug abuse or any condition that, in the Investigator's opinion,
             makes him/her an unreliable trial subject, unlikely to complete the trial, or unable
             to comply with the protocol procedures.
