          -  In the diabetic arms - a diagnosis of T2DM with HbA1c ≥6.5% (≥48 mmol/mol) and &lt;10%
             (&lt;86 mmol/mol); and eGFR (CKD-EPI) between ≥25 and ≤50 mL/min/1.73m2 or between &gt;90
             and ≤130 mL/min/1.73m2 for patients aged 59 years or younger, between &gt;85 and ≤130
             mL/min/1.73m2 for patients aged 60 to 69 years, and between &gt;75 and ≤130 mL/min/1.73m2
             for patients aged 70 years or older at the Screening Visit (Visit 1)

             the exception of metformin, sulphonylurea, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors,
             insulin (insulin only allowed in Group 1), oral glucocorticoids, non-steroidal
             anti-inflammatory drugs, immune suppressants, chemotherapeutics, antipsychotics,
             tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors

          -  Receiving immunosuppressive or other immunotherapy for primary or secondary renal
             disease within 6 months prior to screening
