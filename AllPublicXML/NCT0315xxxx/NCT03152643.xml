  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this RCT is to compare differences in the efficacy and safety between
      cleavage-stage embryo transfer and blastocyst-stage embryo transfer in IVF/ICSI treatment
      cycle, taking into account of subsequent vitrified embryo transfers. Subjects with 3 or more
      transferrable cleavage embryos will be randomized to the cleavage-stage or blastocyst-stage
      embryos transfer group. The primary outcome is cumulative live birth rate (CLBR) per patient
      until the first live birth from one initiated oocyte retrieval cycle, calculated using
      outcomes from the first three embryo transfers within 1 year after randomization.

    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized clinical trial comparing the efficacy and safety between
      cleavage-stage embryo transfer and blastocyst-stage embryo transfer in IVF/ICSI treatment
      cycle, taking into account of subsequent vitrified embryo transfers.Randomization will be
      performed on day 2/3 after oocyte retrieval, when at least 3 embryos are achieved. Patients
      in group A will have 1 cleavage-stage embryo transferred. Patients in group B will have 1
      blastocyst-stage embryo transferred. The outcomes from all the embryo transfers within 1 year
      after randomization will be followed up. If a pregnancy/live birth is not achieved, single
      embryo transfer is required for the first 3 embryo transfers within 1 year after
      randomization. For embryo transfers beyond the third within the 1 year, patient's treatment
      must follow their randomized allocation, and SET is no longer mandatory. The follow-up period
      is 2 years from the day of randomization.

    <description>For subjects assigned to blastocyst-stage (D5/D6) embryo transfer group, all embryos will be cultured to D5 or D6. 1 blastocysts of the best quality will be transferred in fresh cycle on D5 or D6 after oocyte retrieval (D5 embryo will be the prior choice). The surplus embryos, if any, will be vitrified for future FET in case the fresh cycle does not result in a live birth. If a patient is at a high risk of OHSS, all embryos on D5 or D6 can be cryopreserved with vitrification for patient's safety. The FET cycle will be initiated on the second menstrual cycle after oocyte retrieval.</description>

HCG will be administered for final oocyte maturation. Patients will have a single blastocyst-stage embryos transferred. The outcomes of all the embryo transfers within 1 year after randomization will be followed up. Single embryo transfer (SET) is required for the first 3 embryo transfers within 1 year after randomization. For embryo transfers beyond the third within the 1 year, patients' treatment must follow their randomized allocation, and SET is no longer mandatory. Luteal phase support will be administered before embryo transfer. If pregnancy is confirmed, luteal phase support will be continued until 10 weeks of gestation. The follow up will be continued until 6 weeks after delivery.</description>
