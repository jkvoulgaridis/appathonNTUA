        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A clinical diagnosis of Crohn's disease for at least 3 months prior to screening
             corroborated by prior endoscopic and histopathologic documentation consistent with
             Crohn's disease.

          -  Quiescent to mildly active inflammatory Crohn's disease defined with a total of SES-CD
             score of &lt; 10 or FCP &lt; 500 mcg/g within 4 weeks before Screening.

          -  Moderate to severe abdominal pain as defined by AAPS of &gt;/= 4points on 7 consecutive
             days of the screening period up to Day -2. AAPS will be based on the 11-point numeric
             rating scale where 0 (no abdominal pain) to 10 (worst possible abdominal pain).

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Female subjects who are lactating or have a positive serum pregnancy test during the
             screening period or a positive urine pregnancy test on Day 1 prior to study drug
             administration.

          -  Recent history (within 6 months of screening visit) of cerebrovascular disease, Acute
             Coronary Syndrome, Cerebrovascular accident, Transient ischemic attack, Myocardial
             infarction, unstable angina.

          -  Other significant chronic pain conditions that in the opinion of the Investigator may
             influence the abdominal pain score.

          -  History of extensive colonic resection, subtotal or total colectomy.

          -  History of &gt;3 small bowel resections or diagnosis of short bowel syndrome or who have
             undergone bowel resection within 6 months prior to randomization.

          -  Chronic active hepatitis B within the last year (unless shown at the time of study
             entry to be hepatitis B antigen negative) or any history of hepatitis C.

          -  Evidence of current gastro-intestinal infection (bacterial or parasitic) or
             significant infection within 45 days of screening.

        Note: other protocol defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria may apply.
