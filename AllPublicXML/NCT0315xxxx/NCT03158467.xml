  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We aim to examine the effect of an online advance directive on decisional conflict and
      quality of life in patients undergoing stem cell transplant. We also aim to assess the effect
      of palliative care at the time of a sentinel event on quality of life.

    <description>Instruments will be administered via the online RedCAP platform. The survey instruments will include a Decision Conflict Scale (DCS), the McGill Quality of Life (MQoL), the Human Connection (THC), and a general demographics questionnaire. Patients will have the opportunity to complete the instruments via a research iPad while in clinic or via a survey link emailed to their private email account.</description>
