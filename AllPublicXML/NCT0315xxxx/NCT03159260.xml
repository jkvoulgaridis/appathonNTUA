  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of Theraworx/[pH]uel on the frequency
      and severity of night-time cramps and spasms symptoms, including quality of life, depression
      and sleep quality when compared to a placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      50 subjects who claim to have experienced night-time cramps and spasms on average at least
      three times per week will be recruited. Eligible individuals will be scheduled to attend a
      &quot;consent and baseline assessment&quot; (T1). During this visit, the study will be described by a
      member of the research team and the subjects will be asked to provide written consent to
      participate in the protocol. Following providing informed consent, the subjects will be asked
      to complete a series of questionnaires about their demographic characteristics, presence and
      severity of night-time cramps and spasms symptoms, including quality of life, depression and
      sleep quality. Once these questionnaires are completed all subjects will complete a 14-day no
      treatment period in which they will be told to engage in their usual activities and
      treatments. Subjects will return following this two week period (T2) and complete the same
      questionnaires. Variables that will be collected at T2 include presence and severity of
      night-time cramps and spasm symptoms, including quality of life, depression and sleep
      quality. Subjects will be asked to refer their responses on these instruments to the previous
      2 weeks following completion of the baseline assessment. Once the subjects have completed
      these instruments they will be randomly assigned to one of two study groups with 25 of in
      &quot;Foam A&quot; and 25 in&quot;Foam B.&quot; Subjects will receive two 3 ounce foam dispensers corresponding
      to their group assignment (Foam A or Foam B) and a 2-week Compliance and Symptom Log.
      Subjects will be instructed to apply the topical foam they have been assigned to their entire
      upper and lower legs and feet using 8 pumps from the product dispenser per leg (upper thigh
      to foot) before retiring each evening for the next 14 days. If subjects experience leg cramps
      or spasms after retiring they will be instructed to reapply to 2 pumps of the foam to the
      affected area in response to each event. Each morning during the 14 days in which subjects
      apply the foam they will be asked to complete the Compliance and Symptom Log that documents
      the incidence and severity of night-time cramps and spasms their use of the foam and any
      other therapies they used to treat their night-time cramps and spasm. Following 14
      consecutive days of applying the assigned foam, subjects will return to SSR (T3) and return
      the completed Treatment Compliance Log to the research staff. During this final visit
      subjects will again complete the same questionnaires that were completed during the T2 visit,
      referring the responses to the previous 2 weeks when the subjects were applying the assigned
      foam to the legs.

    <measure>Change in Restless Legs Syndrome Quality of Life Instrument (RLSQoL) Over 4 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 2 weeks, and 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Restless Legs Syndrome Quality of Life Instrument (RLSQoL) assesses the impact of restless legs symptoms on daily life, emotional well-being, social life and work life in adults 21 years and over. Each subsection is totaled separately and summed to form a total score from 0-100. Higher scores on the RLSQoL overall life impact score indicate a better quality of life. The subsections include Social Life, Daily Function, Sleep Quality, and Emotional Well-being. Each subsection questions are summed, divided by total score, and multiplied by 100 to form a scale of 0 (worst outcome) to 100 (best outcome).</description>

    <measure>Change in Beck Depression Scale Over 4 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 2 weeks, and 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Beck Depression Scale is one of the most widely used psychometric tests for measuring the severity of depression. The score is calculated by adding up the score for each of the twenty-one questions by counting the number to the right of each question marked. The highest possible total for the whole test would be sixty-three and the lowest possible score for the test would be zero. The level of depression is evaluated by: 0-10 (These ups and downs are considered normal);11-16 (Mild mood disturbance); 17-20 (Borderline clinical depression); 21-30 (Moderate depression); 31-40 (Severe depression); over 40 (Extreme depression).</description>

    <measure>Change in Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index Over 4 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 2 weeks, and 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index is used to measure the quality and patterns of sleep in adults. It differentiates &quot;poor&quot; from &quot;good&quot; sleep quality by measuring seven areas (components): subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medications, and daytime dysfunction over the last month. The seven component scores are added together for a global score ranging from 0 to 21, 0 indicating no difficulty and 21 indicating severe difficulties.</description>

    <measure>Change in Modified Patient Specific Functional Scale Over 4 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 2 weeks, and 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Modified Patient Specific Functional Scale is used to quantify activity limitation and measure functional outcome for patients with any orthopaedic condition. Three important activities that are unable to be done or are having difficulty are rated from 0 to 10, 0 being unable to perform and 10 being able to perform activity at the same level as before injury or problem. The total score is the sum of the activity scores divided by the number of activities, ranging from 0 (worst outcome) to 10 (best outcome).</description>

        <title>Change in Restless Legs Syndrome Quality of Life Instrument (RLSQoL) Over 4 Weeks</title>
        <description>Restless Legs Syndrome Quality of Life Instrument (RLSQoL) assesses the impact of restless legs symptoms on daily life, emotional well-being, social life and work life in adults 21 years and over. Each subsection is totaled separately and summed to form a total score from 0-100. Higher scores on the RLSQoL overall life impact score indicate a better quality of life. The subsections include Social Life, Daily Function, Sleep Quality, and Emotional Well-being. Each subsection questions are summed, divided by total score, and multiplied by 100 to form a scale of 0 (worst outcome) to 100 (best outcome).</description>

The participants were blind to the contents of the foam and the investigators until the study was completed. One foam contained Theraworx/[pH]uel (treatment) and the other contained a physiologically inert substance (placebo control).
Theraworx: Participants were instructed to apply the assigned foam to their entire upper and lower legs and feet using 8 pumps from the dispenser per leg before retiring each evening for 14 days. If participants experienced leg cramps or spasms after retiring they were instructed to reapply 2 pumps of the foam to the affected area in response to each event. Each morning participants applied the foam they also completed the Compliance and Symptom Log, documenting the incidence and severity of night-time cramps and spasms their use of the foam and any other therapies they used to treat their night-time cramps and spasm.</description>

        <title>Change in Beck Depression Scale Over 4 Weeks</title>
        <description>The Beck Depression Scale is one of the most widely used psychometric tests for measuring the severity of depression. The score is calculated by adding up the score for each of the twenty-one questions by counting the number to the right of each question marked. The highest possible total for the whole test would be sixty-three and the lowest possible score for the test would be zero. The level of depression is evaluated by: 0-10 (These ups and downs are considered normal);11-16 (Mild mood disturbance); 17-20 (Borderline clinical depression); 21-30 (Moderate depression); 31-40 (Severe depression); over 40 (Extreme depression).</description>

        <title>Change in Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index Over 4 Weeks</title>
        <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index is used to measure the quality and patterns of sleep in adults. It differentiates &quot;poor&quot; from &quot;good&quot; sleep quality by measuring seven areas (components): subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medications, and daytime dysfunction over the last month. The seven component scores are added together for a global score ranging from 0 to 21, 0 indicating no difficulty and 21 indicating severe difficulties.</description>

The participants were blind to the contents of the foam and the investigators until the study was completed. One foam contained Theraworx/[pH]uel (treatment) and the other contained a physiologically inert substance (placebo control).
Theraworx: Participants were instructed to apply the assigned foam to their entire upper and lower legs and feet using 8 pumps from the dispenser per leg before retiring each evening for 14 days. If participants experienced leg cramps or spasms after retiring they were instructed to reapply 2 pumps of the foam to the affected area in response to each event. Each morning participants applied the foam they also completed the Compliance and Symptom Log, documenting the incidence and severity of night-time cramps and spasms their use of the foam and any other therapies they used to treat their night-time cramps and spasm.</description>

        <description>The Modified Patient Specific Functional Scale is used to quantify activity limitation and measure functional outcome for patients with any orthopaedic condition. Three important activities that are unable to be done or are having difficulty are rated from 0 to 10, 0 being unable to perform and 10 being able to perform activity at the same level as before injury or problem. The total score is the sum of the activity scores divided by the number of activities, ranging from 0 (worst outcome) to 10 (best outcome).</description>
