  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a multifactorial disorder resulting from multivariate etiopathogenic factors. The
      current lifestyle, causes a gradual increase in weight both in the adult population and in
      the child population. Among their treatments is bariatric surgery. About which there is
      little evidence in the literature regarding the health condition developed by patients
      operated on the same. Objective: To know the influence of a moderate exercise program on
      health status in patients operated on with bariatric surgery. Methodology: A controlled
      clinical trial, the population will consist of 32 women and 11 men. Coming from the
      consultations of bariatric surgery of the Clinic of the Maule - Talca. In the period between
      March 2017 and March 2018. It will be selected following a non-probabilistic sampling and for
      convenience. Results Analysis: The variables used in this study will be: cardiovascular
      function, respiratory function, strength, health perception, anthropometric measures and
      functional capacity to perform exercises. The Shapiro-Wilk normality test will be performed
      to determine the distribution of the data to be analyzed. The t-student test or its
      nonparametric counterpart will be applied to compare two variables. To compare three or more
      variables, the ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis test will be used depending on the results of the
      normality test.

    <description>Physical exercise program begins with a 2-week adaptation stage, climbs onto the treadmill (HP Cosmos®). The programming of the tape will be done initially with an intensity of 40% of its FCdRes obtained from the formula of Karvonen after performing the 6-minute walk test, you will have to maintain that intensity for 15 min, the patient is evaluated with the Borg scale and oxygen saturation permanently.After two weeks of adaptation, the HRdRes becomes to be calculated, 59% of said frequency will be modified until the exercise program is completed.The training is 30 minutes in the tradmill machine.The work of muscle strengthening of biceps, triceps, deltoids and pectorals, will be progressive in intensity and number of repetitions, determined by the evaluation of 1 Rmax. The start of work with weights is 40% of the Rmax, it will be modified monthly from 40% to 75%. Cycloergometer training (Monark ®) is without load for 15 minutes.</description>
