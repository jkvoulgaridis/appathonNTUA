  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the safety and effectiveness of a new therapy,
      commensal lotion containing infection fighting bacteria, on decreasing or eliminating the
      infection causing bacteria found on the skin of Atopic Dermatitis (AD) patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will enroll adult participants, 18-60 years of age, with moderate-to-severe atopic
      dermatitis (AD) and a positive Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) colonized lesion (at least
      15 cm^2 in size) on the upper extremities.

      Participants who are eligible based on their positive Staph culture results will be
      randomized to one of two treatments: Targeted Microbiome Transplant Lotion (TMT) or Placebo
      (2:1 randomization). One lesional site measuring at least 15 cm^2 and one non-lesional site
      of equal size will be identified on the participant's ventral upper extremities as the target
      swabbing areas. These sites will be photographed and marked for swabbing for reference at the
      participant's future visits. Participants will be instructed to apply investigational product
      with gloved hands to their ventral upper extremities bilaterally from the wrist to the upper
      humerus, which will include the identified lesional and non-lesional swabbing sites twice a
      day for 1 week starting on Day 0. Participants will return to clinic on Day 4 for the
      assessment of adverse events, the collection of skin swabs from the identified target sites,
      and to obtain additional investigational product and gloves. Participants will complete an
      additional clinic visit on Day 7 to correspond with the end of their 1 week treatment. During
      this visit, participants will be assessed for AEs and provide skin swab samples. All unused
      product and empty packets will be returned during the Day 4 and Day 7 visits. Three
      additional clinic visits on Days 8, 9, and 11 will be scheduled for additional skin swabs to
      assess the safety and the stability of the microbiome transplant and time to recurrence of
      Staph colonization. Participants will be followed through Day 38 to assess for safety and
      disease status.

    <time_frame>Days 0, 4, 7, 8 and 11</time_frame>
    <description>The eczema area and severity index (EASI) for the ventral arms is a composite score measuring physical signs of atopic dermatitis. The scale ranges from 0-18. The components measuring severity are four signs/symptoms of atopic dermatitis: erythema, papulation, excoriation, and lichenification each scored on a scale of 0 (absent) to 3 (severe) for the ventral arms. The component measuring area is the percent area of the ventral arms with atopic dermatitis lesions scored on a scale of 0 (0%) to 6 (90-100%).</description>

    <measure>The Scoring Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) Score at Specific Days During the Measure Time Frame</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 0, 4, 7, 8 and 11</time_frame>
    <description>SCORAD (Severity scoring of Atopic Dermatitis) is a composite severity index comprising A) the amount/extent of body surface area affected; A= 0-100%, B) disease intensity assessed as sum of scores for 6 parameters (erythema, edema/papulation, oozing/crusting, excoriation, lichenification, and dryness), each graded from 0 (none) to 3 (severe); B= 0-18, and C) subjective symptom visual analog assessments for pruritus [0 (no itch) to 10 (worst imaginable itch)] and sleep loss [0 (no sleep loss) to 10 (worst imaginable sleep loss)] summed for a total symptom score; C=0-20. The SCORAD = A/5 + 7B/2 + C and ranges from 0 (no AD present) to 103 (severe).</description>

    <description>The pruritus visual analog scale (VAS) asks participants to rate the status of their Pruritus based on the severity of their itch. Scores range from 0 to 10 (0 = no itch, 10 = worst imaginable itch)</description>

    <measure>The Rajka-Langeland (RL) Score at Specific Days During the Measure Time Frame</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 0 and 7</time_frame>
    <description>The Rajka &amp; Langeland (RL) eczema severity score is a simple assessment of AD severity as well as the classification of AD into mild, moderate, or severe. The score is based on the grading of: (i) eczema extent based on % body area affected, (ii) eczema course based on the number of months with remission during the previous year, and (iii) eczema intensity expressed in terms of nocturnal sleep disturbance due to itch. Each parameter is scored on a scale from 1-3, and the scores are summed. The RL score ranges from 3 to 9 (mild, 3-4; moderate, 4.5-7.5; severe, 8-9)</description>

      <recruitment_details>Recruitment of patients with active atopic dermatitis took place between 20 September 2017 through 24 April 2019 at 2 clinical centers in the US: National Jewish Health: Division of Pediatric Allergy and Clinical Immunology and University of California – San Diego</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Screened S. aureus positive participants requiring medication/therapy washout of ≤14 days to meet inclusion/exclusion criteria were randomized within 14 days of screening. Screened S. aureus positive participants requiring medication/therapy washout &gt; 14 days, completed a Repeat Culture Visit after a washout, to confirm S. aureus colonization.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>Measure of S. aureus colonies present on the participant’s lesional skin, as measured by bacteria growth on a blood agar plate. A skin swab sample was collected from an area of lesional skin on the participant’s upper extremity at their Screening Visit. Growth was measured as 0-4, increasing in relation to the amount of S. aureus present on the blood agar plate. In order to enroll, participants needed a positive S. aureus colonized lesion, with a growth score of at least 1.</description>

        <description>The eczema area and severity index (EASI) for the ventral arms is a composite score measuring physical signs of atopic dermatitis. The scale ranges from 0-18. The components measuring severity are four signs/symptoms of atopic dermatitis: erythema, papulation, excoriation, and lichenification each scored on a scale of 0 (absent) to 3 (severe) for the ventral arms. The component measuring area is the percent area of the ventral arms with atopic dermatitis lesions scored on a scale of 0 (0%) to 6 (90-100%).</description>

        <title>The Scoring Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) Score at Specific Days During the Measure Time Frame</title>
        <description>SCORAD (Severity scoring of Atopic Dermatitis) is a composite severity index comprising A) the amount/extent of body surface area affected; A= 0-100%, B) disease intensity assessed as sum of scores for 6 parameters (erythema, edema/papulation, oozing/crusting, excoriation, lichenification, and dryness), each graded from 0 (none) to 3 (severe); B= 0-18, and C) subjective symptom visual analog assessments for pruritus [0 (no itch) to 10 (worst imaginable itch)] and sleep loss [0 (no sleep loss) to 10 (worst imaginable sleep loss)] summed for a total symptom score; C=0-20. The SCORAD = A/5 + 7B/2 + C and ranges from 0 (no AD present) to 103 (severe).</description>

        <title>The Rajka-Langeland (RL) Score at Specific Days During the Measure Time Frame</title>
        <description>The Rajka &amp; Langeland (RL) eczema severity score is a simple assessment of AD severity as well as the classification of AD into mild, moderate, or severe. The score is based on the grading of: (i) eczema extent based on % body area affected, (ii) eczema course based on the number of months with remission during the previous year, and (iii) eczema intensity expressed in terms of nocturnal sleep disturbance due to itch. Each parameter is scored on a scale from 1-3, and the scores are summed. The RL score ranges from 3 to 9 (mild, 3-4; moderate, 4.5-7.5; severe, 8-9)</description>
