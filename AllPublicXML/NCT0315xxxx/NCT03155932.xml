        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males or females aged 18 to 80 years (inclusive) at the time of screening, with
             confirmed PBC diagnosis based upon at least 2 of 3 criteria:

               -  AMA titer &gt;1:40 on immunofluorescence or M2 positive by enzyme-linked
                  immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or positive PBC-specific antinuclear antibodies
                  (anti-GP210 and/or anti-SP100)

               -  ALP &gt;1.5 x ULN for at least 6 months

               -  Liver biopsy findings consistent with PBC

          -  Use of UDCA for at least 6 months prior to screening (stable dose for at least 3
             months immediately prior to screening)

          -  Patients must have ALP &gt;1.5 x ULN but &lt;10 x ULN, ALT and AST &lt;5 x ULN, and total
             bilirubin &lt;ULN, at all screening visits

          -  AST, ALT, ALP, and total bilirubin must have 2 values at least 4 weeks apart that are
             within 20% of each other

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Chronic liver disease of a non-PBC etiology. However, PBC patients accompanied with
             primary Sj√∂gren's syndrome (pSS) are eligible to be enrolled.

          -  History or evidence of clinically significant hepatic decompensation

          -  Medical conditions that may cause non-hepatic increases in ALP (e.g., Paget's disease)

          -  Clinically significant infections within 6 weeks prior to treatment start, or
             infection with hepatitis C virus anytime in the past

          -  Immunosuppressive, immunomodulating, or investigational agents within 30 days prior to
             treatment start

          -  Treatment with OCA within 30 days prior to Day 1
