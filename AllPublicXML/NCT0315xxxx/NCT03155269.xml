    <textblock>
      To investigate the effect of nutritional supplement on bone turnover markers (which are
      sensitive and respond quickly to nutrition or drug intervention) in Indian healthy
      premenopausal women after 6 months of intervention.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a double blind, single-center, randomized-controlled trial testing the effect of
      fortified beverage on bone turnover markers as compared to placebo control in 25-45 years old
      premenopausal women. The study will consist of two groups: Group 1 (Test) - Protein rich
      beverage powder fortified with MMN and Group 2 (control) - Low protein non-fortified
      iso-caloric beverage powder.

        <description>s-CTX-1 is a bone resorption marker which is used to assess the bone health. After 6 months of taking the allocated product, blood sample was collected under 12-hour fasting condition. Blood serum of whole blood collected from each participant was then isolated by the method of centrifugation. CTX-1 serum was analysed using biochemical tests from the samples stored. Decreased s-CTX-1 is associated with improved bone health.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Serum Procollagen Type 1 N-terminal Propeptide (s-P1NP) at 3 Months and 6 Months</title>
          <description>P1NP is a bone formation surrogate marker which is used to assess the bone health being the most abundant protein of bone matrix. After 3 months and 6 months of taking the allocated product, blood sample was collected under 12-hour fasting condition. Blood serum of whole blood collected from each participant was then isolated by the method of centrifugation. P1NP serum was analysed using biochemical tests from the samples stored. Increased s-P1NP is associated with improved bone health.</description>
          <population>The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population (n=102) was comprised of all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of study treatment and had at least 1 post-baseline (post-treatment) primary efficacy evaluation. This population was based on the treatment to which the participant was randomized.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Serum Vitamin D3 Using 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (25 OH D3) at 3 Months and 6 Months</title>
        <description>Serum vitamin-D3 is used to analyse the status of vitamin-D profile which is necessary for healthy bones. The marker used for analyzing serum vitamin-D3 was 25 OH D3. After 3 months and 6 months of taking the allocated product, blood sample was collected under 12-hour fasting condition. Blood serum of whole blood collected from each participant was then isolated by the method of centrifugation. Serum vitamin-D3 was analysed using biochemical tests from the samples stored. Increased serum vitamin-D3 is associated with improved bone health.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Plasma Zinc (Zn) at 3 Months and 6 Months</title>
        <description>Plasma Zn is used to assess the status of micronutrient profile necessary for healthy bones. After 3 months and 6 months of taking the allocated product, blood sample was collected under 12-hour fasting condition. Blood serum of whole blood collected from each participant was then isolated by the method of centrifugation. Plasma Zn was analysed using biochemical tests from the samples stored. Increased plasma Zn is associated with improved bone health.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Plasma Vitamin-B6 at 3 Months and 6 Months</title>
        <description>Plasma vitamin-B6 is used to assess the status of micronutrient profile necessary for healthy bones. After 3 months and 6 months of taking the allocated product, blood sample was collected under 12-hour fasting condition. Blood serum of whole blood collected from each participant was then isolated by the method of centrifugation. Plasma vitamin-B6 was analysed using biochemical tests from the samples stored. Increased plasma vitamin-B6 is associated with improved bone health.</description>
