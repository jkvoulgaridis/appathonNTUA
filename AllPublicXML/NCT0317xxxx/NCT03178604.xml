  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study we intend to apply a treatment protocol for hamstrings that can be beneficial
      for a good recovery.

      Initially, a sample of athletes with hamstring shortening was chosen. Once the sample is
      chosen, it will be divided into two groups: group 1 (G.1) who will receives a sham massage,
      group 2 (G.2) that receives the classic massage.

      To finalize the study comparing the results of the two groups to observe the experimental
      protocol obtains better results.

      Material and methods The sample of an athletic club. Recruiting subjects between 18 and 45
      years old without other injuries of the lower limb. Subjects with shortening of the hamstring
      muscles are available through the specific shortening test.

      This is a randomized controlled trial. Subjects were randomly assigned to two intervention
      groups (1 treatment and 1 placebo control). The intervention consists of 4 sessions for 1
      month. The sessions have a duration of 45 minutes. Evaluations are performed at the beginning
      of treatment, at the end of treatment. Participants also perform strengthening exercises
      three days a week, a total of 3 sets with 15 repetitions each.

      Group 1 receives a sham massage of the quadriceps and hamstrings. Group 2 receives a classic
      massage of the quadriceps and hamstrings. The assessments consist of knee and hip goniometry,
      lumbar and hamstring flexibility by finger-to-floor testing, and complete the questionnaire
      Mood Status Profile (POMS), Which evaluates the states of mind.

    <measure>Popliteal test</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It is a specific test that is performed in supine position. The subject flexes the hip until it reaches 90º, while keeping the knee flexed. Subsequently, he takes the ankle and takes the knee to an extension position passively. In this position, one takes measure of the degrees that are lacking until the complete extension. During the test, it should be ensured that there are no compensations.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hip flexion test</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It is performed with a knee and assesses the shortening of the hamstring muscles. The test is performed in supine position, and consists of flexing the hip in a slow and passive way until it reaches a flexion that the tightness or pain that the participant feels does not let go more. It should be noted that there is no knee flexion or any other type of compensation such as tilting of the pelvis. For the quantification we use a universal goniometer.</description>

    <measure>Range of motion</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Both legs (hip flexion, knee flexion and knee flexion) are measured by a universal goniometer, which has proven to be a valid and reliable instrument.</description>

    <measure>Lumbar flexibility</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>By the Fingertip-to-Floor Test (FFT). The restraints placed barefoot on a platform 25 cm high, with feet together and flat and toes on the edge pointing forward. They are then asked to lean forward and try to reach the floor with their fingertips as much as possible without discomfort, keeping the knees and arms fully extended. The bending is maintained for 3 seconds and the vertical distance between the tip of the middle finger and the platform is measured. The best of 3 trials is used for analysis.</description>

    <description>Classic massage (CM) treatment based on petrissage. It applies: 1 minute of mild effleurage, 5 minutes of deep effleurage with the thumbs, 5 minutes of firm kneading and 1 minute of tapotement (20 minutes in total). This procedure was repeated for each muscle group.</description>

    <description>It involves applying the classic massage techniques: effleurage (gliding or sliding movement over the skin with a smooth continuous motion following the direction of the muscle fibers of the superficial muscles in a distal to proximal direction); petrissage (lifting, wringing, or squeezing of soft tissues in a kneading motion, or pressing or rolling of the tissues under or between the hands); tapotement (various parts of the hand striking the tissues at a fairly rapid rate). The general objective is to improve extensibility of muscle, tendon, fascia, joint capsule, and ligamentous structures.</description>
