      <recruitment_details>The trial was conducted at 38 sites in China mainland.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants were randomised in a 2:1:1 manner to receive insulin degludec/liraglutide, insulin degludec or liraglutide in combination with metformin.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Insulin Degludec/Liraglutide</title>
          <description>Participants were to receive Insulin degludec/liraglutide subcutaneous injection once daily in combination with metformin for 26 weeks. Participants received 10 dose steps (10 units insulin degludec and 0.36 milligrams (mg) liraglutide) initially. The dose was then adjusted twice weekly based on pre-breakfast self-measured plasma glucose (SMPG) target of 4.0-5.0 millimoles/litre (mmol/L). The maximum dose was 50 dose steps (50 units insulin degludec and 1.8 mg liraglutide). One dose step corresponded to 1 unit insulin degludec per 0.036 mg liraglutide.</description>

            <description>Participants were to receive Insulin degludec/liraglutide subcutaneous injection once daily in combination with metformin for 26 weeks. Participants received 10 dose steps (10 units insulin degludec and 0.36 mg liraglutide) initially. The dose was then adjusted twice weekly based on pre-breakfast self-measured plasma glucose (SMPG) target of 4.0-5.0 mmol/L. The maximum dose was 50 dose steps (50 units insulin degludec and 1.8 mg liraglutide). One dose step corresponded to 1 unit insulin degludec per 0.036 mg liraglutide.</description>

        <description>Severe or BG confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes were defined as episodes that were severe according to the ADA classification (required assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or take other corrective actions) or BG confirmed by a PG value &lt;3.1 mmol/L with or without symptoms consistent with hypoglycaemia. Hypoglycaemic episodes were defined as treatment-emergent if the onset of the episode occurred on or after the first day of trial product administration, and no later than 7 calendar days after the last day on trial product. Number of participants who achieved ADA HbA1c target (HbA1c &lt;7.0%) (yes/no) after 26 weeks of treatment and without severe or BG confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes during the last 12 weeks of treatment are presented.

            <description>Participants were to receive Insulin degludec/liraglutide subcutaneous injection once daily in combination with metformin for 26 weeks. Participants received 10 dose steps (10 units insulin degludec and 0.36 mg liraglutide) initially. The dose was then adjusted twice weekly based on pre-breakfast self-measured plasma glucose (SMPG) target of 4.0-5.0 mmol/L. The maximum dose was 50 dose steps (50 units insulin degludec and 1.8 mg liraglutide). One dose step corresponded to 1 unit insulin degludec per 0.036 mg liraglutide.</description>

            <description>Participants were to receive Insulin degludec/liraglutide subcutaneous injection once daily in combination with metformin for 26 weeks. Participants received 10 dose steps (10 units insulin degludec and 0.36 mg liraglutide) initially. The dose was then adjusted twice weekly based on pre-breakfast self-measured plasma glucose (SMPG) target of 4.0-5.0 mmol/L. The maximum dose was 50 dose steps (50 units insulin degludec and 1.8 mg liraglutide). One dose step corresponded to 1 unit insulin degludec per 0.036 mg liraglutide.</description>

          <description>Severe or BG confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemic episodes were defined as episodes that were severe according to the ADA classification (requiring assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or take other corrective actions) or BG confirmed by a PG value &lt;3.1 mmol/L with symptoms consistent with hypoglycaemia. Hypoglycaemic episodes were defined as treatment-emergent if the onset of the episode occurred on or after the first day of trial product administration, and no later than 7 calendar days after the last day on trial product. The number of episodes are represented as rates. The observed rates of episodes per PYE (number of episodes divided by PYE multiplied by 100) after 26 weeks of treatment are presented.</description>

            <description>Participants were to receive Insulin degludec/liraglutide subcutaneous injection once daily in combination with metformin for 26 weeks. Participants received 10 dose steps (10 units insulin degludec and 0.36 mg liraglutide) initially. The dose was then adjusted twice weekly based on pre-breakfast self-measured plasma glucose (SMPG) target of 4.0-5.0 mmol/L. The maximum dose was 50 dose steps (50 units insulin degludec and 1.8 mg liraglutide). One dose step corresponded to 1 unit insulin degludec per 0.036 mg liraglutide.</description>

            <description>Participants were to receive Insulin degludec/liraglutide subcutaneous injection once daily in combination with metformin for 26 weeks. Participants received 10 dose steps (10 units insulin degludec and 0.36 mg liraglutide) initially.

            <description>Participants were to receive Insulin degludec/liraglutide subcutaneous injection once daily in combination with metformin for 26 weeks. Participants received 10 dose steps (10 units insulin degludec and 0.36 mg liraglutide) initially. The dose was then adjusted twice weekly based on pre-breakfast self-measured plasma glucose (SMPG) target of 4.0-5.0 mmol/L. The maximum dose was 50 dose steps (50 units insulin degludec and 1.8 mg liraglutide). One dose step corresponded to 1 unit insulin degludec per 0.036 mg liraglutide.</description>

            <description>Participants were to receive Insulin degludec/liraglutide subcutaneous injection once daily in combination with metformin for 26 weeks. Participants received 10 dose steps (10 units insulin degludec and 0.36 mg liraglutide) initially. The dose was then adjusted twice weekly based on pre-breakfast self-measured plasma glucose (SMPG) target of 4.0-5.0 mmol/L. The maximum dose was 50 dose steps (50 units insulin degludec and 1.8 mg liraglutide). One dose step corresponded to 1 unit insulin degludec per 0.036 mg liraglutide.</description>

      <desc>A TEAE was defined as an event that had onset date on or after the first day of exposure to randomised treatment and no later than seven days after the last day of randomised treatment. Results are based on SAS which included all participants who received at least one dose of insulin degludec/liraglutide, insulin degludec or liraglutide</desc>

          <title>Insulin Degludec/Liraglutide</title>
          <description>Participants were to receive Insulin degludec/liraglutide subcutaneous injection once daily in combination with metformin for 26 weeks. Participants received 10 dose steps (10 units insulin degludec and 0.36 mg liraglutide) initially. The dose was then adjusted twice weekly based on pre-breakfast self-measured plasma glucose (SMPG) target of 4.0-5.0 mmol/L. The maximum dose was 50 dose steps (50 units insulin degludec and 1.8 mg liraglutide). One dose step corresponded to 1 unit insulin degludec per 0.036 mg liraglutide.</description>
