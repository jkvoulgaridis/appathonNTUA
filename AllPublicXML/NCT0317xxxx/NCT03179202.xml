  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of electrical stimulation (low
      levels of electricity) on low back pain. This study involves the SPRINT Peripheral Nerve
      Stimulation (PNS) system. The System delivers mild electrical stimulation to the muscles in
      the low back. The System includes up to four small wires (called &quot;Leads&quot;) that are placed
      through the skin into the muscles in the low back. The wires attach to device(s) worn on the
      body that deliver stimulation (called Stimulators).

    <description>The SPRINT PNS System is a device which delivers mild electrical stimulation to the muscles in the low back. The System includes up to four small wires (called &quot;Leads&quot;) that are placed through the skin into the muscles in the low back. The wires attach to device(s) worn on the body that deliver stimulation (called Stimulators). The PNS System was approved by the FDA for up to 60 days of use for the management of acute and chronic pain, including back pain.</description>
