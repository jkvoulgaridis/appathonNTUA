      bifurcation lesion.

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective registry study in which patient with bifurcation lesion undergoing
      baseline coronary angiography, baseline OCT and percutaneous coronary intervention will be
      studied. OCT is used to assess the prevalence of vulnerable plaque, its location at
      bifurcation lesions and compare vulnerable plaque related major adverse cardiovascular events
      (MACE) during one-year follow-up in bifurcation lesions between patients with vulnerable
      plaque and those without. Relationship between endothelial shear stress and vulnerable
      plaque. Relationship between bifurcation angle and vulnerable plaque.

      Group A: presence of vulnerable plaque at the bifurcation Group B: absence of vulnerable
      plaque at the bifurcation Documentation of immediate post stent OCT and 12 months follow up
      angiography with OCT will be performed. Immediate post stent OCT to assess successful stent
      implantation and after 12 months follow up to document year major adverse cardiovascular
      events (MACE) included myocardial infraction, cardiac death and clinically driven target
      lesion revascularization, stent thrombosis.

    <description>Thin-cap fibro atheroma (TCFA) was defined as a lipid-rich plaque with the thinnest fibrous cap thickness&lt;65um. Plaque rupture was identified by the presence of fibrous cap discontinuity with a clear cavity formation inside the plaque. Plaque erosion is characterized by luminal thrombus and absence of the endothelium or without evidence of fibrous cap disruption. Fibro calcific plaque contains OCT evidence of fibrous tissue along with calcium that appears as a signal-poor or heterogeneous region with a sharply delineated border which is applied to larger calcifications. Calcified nodule is characterized as a signal or multiple regions of calcium protruding into the lumen, superficial calcification accompanied by substantive calcium proximal and or distal to the lesion. Thrombus is defined as a mass attached to luminal surface or floating within the lumen. It is seen as a protrusion inside the lumen of the artery with signal attenuation.</description>
