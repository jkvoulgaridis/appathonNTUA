  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether CRS-207 with pembrolizumab is safe and
      effective in adults with MPM who have failed prior anti-cancer therapy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The population for this study will consist of approximately 35 adults with
      histologically-confirmed MPM (epithelial or biphasic) whose disease has progressed after 1-2
      prior anti-cancer therapies.

    <measure>Overall Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>BOR was assessed from the first dose of study treatment until documented disease progression, initiation of new cancer treatment, death, or study termination, whichever is earlier, assessed up to 15 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>ORR was evaluated based upon the best overall response (BOR) for individual study subjects. BOR was determined by the highest post-baseline qualitative response value for each assessed subject as measured by modified response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (modified RECIST) for MPM (Byrne and Nowak, 2004) and given the following hierarchy of overall response results: complete response (CR) &gt; partial response (PR) &gt; stable disease (SD) &gt; progressive disease (PD) &gt; not evaluable (NE). The protocol-specified ORR was defined as the percentage of evaluable subjects with a BOR of CR or PR; however, this percentage was not calculated per the final study Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). Therefore, the number of evaluable subjects with BOR RECIST v1.1 values of CR, PR, SD, PD, and NE are provided for this outcome measure.</description>

    <measure>Progression-Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Subjects followed for disease progression from first dose of study treatment until documented disease progression, initiation of new cancer treatment, death, or study termination, whichever is earlier, assessed up to 9 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Number of weeks from the date of first dose of study treatment to the first date of objectively determined progressive disease (PD) (per modified RECIST for MPM) or death from any cause, estimated using Kaplan-Meier (KM) methods with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Subjects who do not experience PD and are alive on or before the data cut-off date will be censored at the time of last tumor assessment or data cut-off date, whichever is earlier.</description>

    <measure>Improvement in Pulmonary Function</measure>
    <time_frame>Subjects tested by spirometry at Screening and up to 7 days prior to dosing every other cycle starting at Cycle 3 until 4 weeks post final dose, assessed up to 16 weeks.</time_frame>

    <time_frame>OS was assessed from the first dose of study treatment until death or study termination, whichever is earlier, assessed up to 25 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Number of weeks from the date of first dose of study treatment to the date of death from any cause, estimated using KM methods with 95% CIs for subjects in the SAF.

    <description>CRS-207 and pembrolizumab will be administered in 3-week cycles. For Cycle 1, pembrolizumab (200 mg) will be administered by intravenous (IV) infusion over 30 minutes on Day 1 and CRS-207 (starting dose 1 × 10e9 colony-forming units [CFU]) will be administered by IV infusion over 1 hour on Day 2. If the infusions are well tolerated, pembrolizumab and CRS-207 may be administered on the same day (Day 1) for subsequent cycles. After 4 cycles, pembrolizumab will continue to be administered on Day 1 at each treatment cycle (every 3 weeks); CRS-207 will be administered once every 6 weeks (every other cycle). Treatment will continue for up to 35 cycles as long as there is adequate safety and potential for clinical benefit.</description>

        <title>Overall Response Rate (ORR)</title>
        <description>ORR was evaluated based upon the best overall response (BOR) for individual study subjects. BOR was determined by the highest post-baseline qualitative response value for each assessed subject as measured by modified response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (modified RECIST) for MPM (Byrne and Nowak, 2004) and given the following hierarchy of overall response results: complete response (CR) &gt; partial response (PR) &gt; stable disease (SD) &gt; progressive disease (PD) &gt; not evaluable (NE). The protocol-specified ORR was defined as the percentage of evaluable subjects with a BOR of CR or PR; however, this percentage was not calculated per the final study Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). Therefore, the number of evaluable subjects with BOR RECIST v1.1 values of CR, PR, SD, PD, and NE are provided for this outcome measure.</description>
        <time_frame>BOR was assessed from the first dose of study treatment until documented disease progression, initiation of new cancer treatment, death, or study termination, whichever is earlier, assessed up to 15 weeks.</time_frame>
        <population>Analysis based on subjects who received ≥1 dose of study treatment and had ≥1 evaluable post-baseline modified RECIST for MPM tumor response assessment or were discontinued due to toxicity (the Evaluable Analysis Set [EAS]). 1 subject did not have post-baseline tumor response assessments and could not be evaluated for this outcome measure.</population>

For Cycle 1, pembrolizumab (200 mg) was administered by IV infusion over 30 minutes on Day 1 and CRS-207 (starting dose 1 × 10e9 CFU) was administered by IV infusion over 1 hour on Day 2. If tolerated, pembrolizumab and CRS-207 were administered on the same day (Day 1) for subsequent cycles. After 4 cycles, pembrolizumab continued to be administered on Day 1 at each treatment cycle (every 3 weeks); and CRS-207 was administered once every 6 weeks (every other cycle).</description>
