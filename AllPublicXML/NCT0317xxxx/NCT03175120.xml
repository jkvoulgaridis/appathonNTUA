        Inclusion Criteria: Informed consent obtained before any trial-related activities.
        Trial-related activities are any procedures that are carried out as part of the trial,
        including procedures to determine suitability for the trial - Male or female, age at least
        18 years at the time of signing inform consent - Type 2 diabetes mellitus (clinically
        diagnosed) - HbA1c (glycosylated haemoglobin) above or equal to 7.5% by central laboratory
        analysis, with the aim of a median of 8.5%. When approximately 50% of the randomised
        subjects have an HbA1c above 8.5%, the remaining subjects randomised must have an HbA1c
        below or equal to 8.5% or when approximately 50% of the subjects randomised have an HbA1c
        below or equal to 8.5%, the remaining subjects randomised must have an HbA1c above 8.5% -
        Current treatment for at least 90 calendar days prior to screening with basal insulin plus
        metformin plus/minus Î±-glucosidase inhibitors, sulphonylureas, glinides or
        thiazolidinediones. Subjects should be on a stable dose for at least 60 calendar days prior
        to screening of: Basal insulin 20-50 units (U)/day (both inclusive) ( Individual
        fluctuations of plus/minus 5U during the 60 day period prior to the day of screening are
        acceptable.) on the day of screening in combination with: - Metformin (above or equal to
        1500 mg or max tolerated dose) or - Metformin (above or equal to 1500 mg or max tolerated
        dose) and sulphonylureas (above or equal to half of the max approved dose according to
        local label) or - Metformin (above or equal to 1500 mg or max tolerated dose) and glinide
        (at least half of the max approved dose according to local label) or - Metformin (above or
        equal to 1500 mg or max tolerated dose) and Î±-glucosidase inhibitors (AGI) (at least half
        of the max approved dose according to local label) or - Metformin (above or equal to 1500
        mg or max tolerated dose) and thiazolidinediones (at least half of the max approved dose
        according to local label) - Body mass index (BMI) above or equal to 24 kg/m^2 Exclusion
        Criteria: Current use of any antidiabetic drug (except for basal insulin, metformin,
        Î±-glucosidase inhibitors, sulphonylureas, glinides or thiazolidinediones) or anticipated
        change in concomitant medication, that in the investigatorÂ´s opinion could interfere with
        glucose level (e.g. systemic corticosteroids) - Treatment with glucagon like peptide -1
        receptor agonists, or dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 inhibitors or insulin (except for basal
        insulin) within 90 days prior to Visit 1 - Impaired liver function defined as alanine
        aminotransferase above or equal to 2.5 times upper normal range - Impaired renal function
        defined as serum-creatinine above or equal to 133 Î¼mol/L for males and above or equal to
        125 Î¼mol/L for females, or as defined according to local contraindications for metformin
        Screening calcitonin above or equal to 50 ng/L - Personal or family history of medullary
        thyroid carcinoma (MTC) or multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) - Cardiac disorder
        defined as: congestive heart failure (NYHA class III-IV), diagnosis of unstable angina
        pectoris, cerebral stroke and/or myocardial infarction within the last 12 months prior to
        screening and/or planned coronary, carotid or peripheral artery revascularisation
        procedures - Severe uncontrolled treated or untreated hypertension (systolic blood pressure
        above or equal to 180 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure above or equal to 100 mm Hg) -

      <recruitment_details>The trial was conducted at 40 sites in China.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants were randomised in a 2:1 manner to receive either IDegLira or IDeg in combination with metformin.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Insulin Degludec/Liraglutide</title>
          <description>Participants were to receive Insulin degludec/liraglutide (IDegLira) subcutaneous injection once daily in combination with metformin for 26 weeks. Participants received 16 dose steps (16 units insulin degludec and 0.6 mg liraglutide) initially. The dose was then adjusted twice weekly based on pre-breakfast self-measured plasma glucose (SMPG) values. The maximum dose was 50 dose steps (50 units IDeg/1.8 mg liraglutide). One dose step corresponded to 1 unit insulin degludec per 0.036 mg liraglutide.</description>

          <title>Change in SMPG-mean Post Prandial Increments</title>
          <description>Participants measured plasma glucose values using the blood glucose meter at 9 time points: before breakfast, 90 min after start of breakfast, before lunch, 90 minutes after start of lunch, before dinner, 90 min after start of dinner, bedtime, at 4:00 am and before breakfast the following day. Change in SMPG-mean postprandial increment over all meals from baseline (week 0) to week 26 is presented.</description>

            <description>Participants were to receive Insulin degludec/liraglutide (IDegLira) subcutaneous injection once daily in combination with metformin for 26 weeks. Participants received 16 dose steps (16 units insulin degludec and 0.6 mg liraglutide) initially. The dose was then adjusted twice weekly based on pre-breakfast self-measured plasma glucose (SMPG) values. The maximum dose was 50 dose steps (50 units IDeg/1.8 mg liraglutide). One dose step corresponded to 1 unit insulin degludec per 0.036 mg liraglutide.</description>

Participants received 16 dose steps (16 units insulin degludec and 0.6 mg liraglutide) initially. The dose was then adjusted twice weekly based on pre-breakfast self-measured plasma glucose (SMPG) values. The maximum dose was 50 dose steps (50 units IDeg/1.8 mg liraglutide).

        <description>The urinalysis was the measurements of protein, glucose, erythrocytes and ketones at week 0 and week 26 and categorised as negative, trace, 1+, 2+ and 3+. Number of participants in each category at week 0 and week 26 are presented.</description>

            <description>Participants were to receive Insulin degludec/liraglutide (IDegLira) subcutaneous injection once daily in combination with metformin for 26 weeks. Participants received 16 dose steps (16 units insulin degludec and 0.6 mg liraglutide) initially. The dose was then adjusted twice weekly based on pre-breakfast self-measured plasma glucose (SMPG) values. The maximum dose was 50 dose steps (50 units IDeg/1.8 mg liraglutide). One dose step corresponded to 1 unit insulin degludec per 0.036 mg liraglutide.</description>
