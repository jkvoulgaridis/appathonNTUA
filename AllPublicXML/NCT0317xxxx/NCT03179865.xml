  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Establishing that mucosal healing (MH) has occurred after therapy is an important treatment
      goal, and the gold standard is endoscopic evaluation. In UC it is unclear if clinical
      parameters are adequate. The pediatric ulcerative colitis activity index (PUCAI) has
      demonstrated good correlations for clinical remission and disease severity, but its role for
      establishing mucosal healing after therapy has not been validated . The ability to predict
      mucosal healing may be different for patients in long term remission compared to assessment
      after obtaining clinical remission. No previous study has prospectively validated the use of
      PUCAI as a proxy for MH specifically during clinical remission after therapy.

      All pediatric patients â‰¤ 19 years old and at the Wolfson Medical Center pediatric IBD center
      who enter clinical remission are routinely assessed by colposcopy or sigmoidoscopy assess.
      This is an analysis of prospectively collected data regarding PUCAI and endoscopic Mayo score
      at the time of assessment of mucosal healing by endoscopy. Patients could be included if they
      have establish ulcerative colitis, while they are on remission for at least 3 months after
      treatment of flare. For this study, complete clinical remission was absence of abdominal
      pain, and no diarrhea or bleeding (PUCAI&lt;10). sigmoidoscopy will be performed between 12-24
      weeks after remission was documented.
