  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an active- and placebo-controlled, single-site, four-part trial of MK-1092 in healthy
      adult participants, in participants with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), and in participants
      with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The primary hypothesis for this study is that at a dose
      with sufficient safety, the mean maximal glucose infusion rate (GIRmax) after single
      subcutaneous (SC) administration of MK-1092 in adult participants with T1DM is within an
      acceptable range. (Part 3)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There will be 4 parts in this study. In Part 1, healthy adult participants will be randomized
      to receive blinded MK-1092 subcutaneously (SC) or glargine SC, as a single dose under the
      euglycemic clamp. Once a safe and tolerated dose that achieves GIRmax is identified in Part
      1, Part 2 will start. In Part 2, 4 different healthy adult participants will be enrolled in a
      single panel and receive open-label MK-1092 SC as a single dose under the euglycemic clamp
      and also receive an intravenous infusion of Humalog®. In Part 3, adult participants with T1DM
      will be randomized to receive blinded MK-1092 SC or insulin glargine SC, as a single dose
      under the euglycemic clamp. Part 4 includes a 3-period (Periods 1, 2, and 3) design that will
      explore up to 3 single subcutaneous doses of MK-1092 or insulin glargine in participants with
      Type 2 diabetes mellitus.

    <description>An adverse event is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign including an abnormal laboratory finding, symptom or disease associated with the use of a medical treatment or procedure, regardless of whether it is considered related to the medical treatment or procedure, that occurs during the course of the study. Adverse events that occurred beyond 14 days of dosing were considered Post-Trial AEs. Given the half-life of MK-1092 and glargine, any events observed beyond 14 days would not be considered a result of study drug and were therefore presented together.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to approximately 24 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>The GIRmax required to maintain blood glucose at each participants' individual clamp target, following administration of MK-1092 SC or glargine SC was determined by use of a continuous glucose infusion during the euglycemic clamp so that glucose levels remained in the euglycemic range and hypoglycemia was prevented. Blood glucose was monitored frequently (~every 5 minutes), allowing rapid changes to the rate of glucose infusion. Mean and 95% CI were based on a linear fixed effects model containing a fixed effect for treatment (MK-1092 Doses, Glargine). In Part 3, 4 participants (across 2 dosing panels) received glargine. These 4 participants were analyzed together given the small numbers and the same treatment (same dose of glargine) received.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Who Experienced an Adverse Event (AE)</title>
        <description>An adverse event is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign including an abnormal laboratory finding, symptom or disease associated with the use of a medical treatment or procedure, regardless of whether it is considered related to the medical treatment or procedure, that occurs during the course of the study. Adverse events that occurred beyond 14 days of dosing were considered Post-Trial AEs. Given the half-life of MK-1092 and glargine, any events observed beyond 14 days would not be considered a result of study drug and were therefore presented together.</description>

        <description>An adverse event is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign including an abnormal laboratory finding, symptom or disease associated with the use of a medical treatment or procedure, regardless of whether it is considered related to the medical treatment or procedure, that occurs during the course of the study. Adverse events that occurred beyond 14 days of dosing were considered Post-Trial AEs. Given the half-life of MK-1092 and glargine, any events observed beyond 14 days would not be considered a result of study drug and were therefore presented together.</description>

        <title>GIRmax After a Single Dose Administration of Subcutaneous MK-1092 or Glargine to Healthy Adult Participants (Part 1)</title>
        <description>The GIRmax required to maintain blood glucose at each participants' individual clamp target, following administration of MK-1092 SC or glargine SC was determined by use of a continuous glucose infusion during the euglycemic clamp so that glucose levels remained in the euglycemic range and hypoglycemia was prevented. Blood glucose was monitored frequently (~every 5 minutes), allowing rapid changes to the rate of glucose infusion. Mean and 95% CI were based on a linear fixed effects model containing a fixed effect for treatment (MK-1092 doses, Glargine). In Part 1, 10 participants (across 5 dosing panels) received glargine. These 10 participants in Part 1 were analyzed together given the small numbers and same treatment (same dose of glargine) received.</description>
        <time_frame>Up to approximately 24 hours post-dose</time_frame>
        <population>The analysis population included participants in Part 1 who complied with the protocol sufficiently to ensure that these data likely exhibited the effects of treatment. Compliance included exposure to treatment, availability of measurements, and absence of major protocol deviations. The glargine-treated group was pooled; n=2 participants per panel.</population>

        <title>GIRmax After a Single Dose Administration of Subcutaneous MK-1092 or Glargine to Adult Participants With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) (Part 4)</title>
        <description>The GIRmax, following administration of MK-1092 SC or glargine SC, was determined by use of a continuous glucose infusion during the euglycemic clamp so that glucose levels remained in the euglycemic range and hypoglycemia was prevented. Blood glucose was monitored frequently (~every 5 minutes), allowing rapid changes to the rate of glucose infusion. For Part 4, a linear mixed effects model containing a fixed effect for treatment (MK-1092, Glargine), a nested effect from participants within treatment, an interaction between treatment and period (treatment by period: Period = Period 1, 2, 3) and a random effect due to participants was used. MK-1092 was administered to a single cohort of participants in Periods 1, 2, and 3. Glargine was administered to a single cohort of participants as 3.0 nmol/kg SC in Periods 1, 2, and 3.</description>

        <title>Time-Weighted Average GIR (TWA[GIR]) After a Single Dose Administration of Subcutaneous MK-1092 or Glargine to Healthy Adult Participants (Part 1)</title>
        <description>The GIRmax required to maintain blood glucose at each participants' individual clamp target, following administration of MK-1092 SC or glargine SC was determined by use of a continuous glucose infusion during the euglycemic clamp so that glucose levels remained in the euglycemic range and hypoglycemia was prevented. Blood glucose was monitored frequently (~every 5 minutes), allowing rapid changes to the rate of glucose infusion in Part 1 only. TWA(GIR)= Time-weighted average based on GIR values calculated as AUC (area under the curve) based on GIR values observed from time zero to t divided by t, t= 24 hours. Mean and 95% CI are based on a linear fixed effects model containing a fixed effect for treatment (MK-1092 Doses, Glargine). In Part 1, 10 participants (across 5 dosing panels) received glargine.

        <title>Time-Weighted Average GIR (TWA[GIR]) After a Single Dose Administration of Subcutaneous MK-1092 or Glargine to Adult Participants With T2DM (Part 4)</title>
        <description>The GIRmax required to maintain blood glucose at each participants' individual clamp target, following administration of MK-1092 SC or glargine SC was determined by use of a continuous glucose infusion during the euglycemic clamp so that glucose levels remained in the euglycemic range and hypoglycemia was prevented. Blood glucose was monitored frequently (~every 5 minutes), allowing rapid changes to the rate of glucose infusion in Part 4 only. TWA(GIR)= Time-weighted average based on GIR values calculated as AUC (area under the curve) based on GIR values observed from time zero to t divided by t, t= 24 hours. Mean and 95% CI were based on a linear mixed effects model containing a fixed effect for treatment (MK, Glargine), period (Period 1, Period 2 and Period 3), a nested effect from participants within treatment, and interaction between treatment and period. MK-1092 or glargine was administered to a single cohort of participants in Periods 1, 2, and 3.</description>

        <population>The analysis population included participants in Part 4 who complied with the protocol sufficiently to ensure that these data were likely to exhibit the effects of treatment, according to the underlying scientific model. Compliance included exposure to treatment, availability of measurements, and absence of major protocol deviations.</population>

        <description>Cmax is a measure of the maximum amount of drug in the plasma after the dose is given in Parts 1 and 3 only. Healthy participants received glargine in Panel A-E, and participants with T1DM received glargine in Panel G and H. The method of dispersion referenced below of geometric coefficient of variation is actually percent geometric coefficient of variation. In Part 1, 9 participants (across 5 dosing panels) received glargine and had quantifiable glargine levels, and, in Part 3, 4 participants (across 2 dosing panels) received glargine and had quantifiable glargine levels. These 9 participants in Part 1 were analyzed together and these 4 participants in Part 3 were analyzed together given the small numbers and same treatment (same dose of glargine) received.</description>

Healthy participants received glargine in Panel A-E, and participants with T1DM received glargine in Panel G and H. The method of dispersion referenced below of geometric coefficient of variation is actually percent geometric coefficient of variation. In Part 1, 9 participants (across 5 dosing panels) received glargine and had quantifiable glargine levels, and, in Part 3, 4 participants (across 2 dosing panels) received glargine and had quantifiable glargine levels. These 9 participants in Part 1 were analyzed together and these 4 participants in Part 3 were analyzed together given the small numbers and same treatment (same dose of glargine) received.</description>
          <population>The analysis population included participants in Parts 1 and 3 who received glargine and complied with the protocol sufficiently so that the data exhibited effects of treatment. One participant (Part 1) was excluded (no quantifiable glargine concentration). Data across panels were pooled for Parts 1 and 3.</population>
