      This study determines whether an educational intervention with a 90 g/day LCD is safe,
      effective and has good compliance for poorly controlled type 2 diabetes patients.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Poorly controlled type 2 diabetic men and women, aged between 20 and 80 years, with HbA1c≧
      7.5% (58mmol/mol) in the previous 3 months participated in this randomized controlled
      18-month trial at a medical center. Patients were randomly assigned to the interventional
      group and given a 90g/day low carbohydrate diet (LCD) or the controlled group, which
      maintained a standard calorie-restricted diet (CRD). All patients received periodic
      educational intervention and were monitored for weight, body composition, waist girth, hip
      girth, thigh girth, pre- and post-prandial serum glucose, HbA1c, lipid profile(Cholesterol,
      Triglyceride. HDL, LDL, sdLDL), renal function, microalbumin/cre, carotid intima-media
      thickness (IMT),and medication effect score (MES).

    <description>The MES assessed the overall utilization of hypoglycemic agents. The percentage of the maximum daily dose for each medication was multiplied by an adjustment factor and these products were summed to produce the final MES value. A higher MES value denoted a greater use of medication. The minimum score is 0 and without maximum score.The lower, the better. The reduction of MES over the 18 months after intervention.

    <description>For the LCD group, the daily carbohydrate intake was limited to less than 90g, without any restriction to total energy. The concept of a LCD was introduced and an educational 15 g equivalent carbohydrate food list was provided. The easy conversion method is that 15 g equivalent carbohydrate =1/4 bowel of rice= 1/2 bowel of noodle = 1 slice of toast = 3 soup-spoon of oats = one bowl of fruit =1/2 regular size banana= one glass of milk = 3 dumplings. Less than two equivalent 15g-carbohydrate intakes per meal were advised.</description>

    <description>For the calori restricted diet group, the target total calorie intake was calculated by multiplying the ideal body weight by 25 kcal/kg for those with a BMI in the range 18.5 to 24, 20 kcal/kg for obese subjects with a BMI &gt; 24 and 30 kcal/day for underweight subjects with a BMI &lt;18.5. The macronutrient percentage was 50-60% for carbohydrate, 1.0-1.2 g/kg for protein and fat ≦30%.</description>
