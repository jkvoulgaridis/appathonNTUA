  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this cluster randomized effectiveness trial, pediatric primary care practices will be
      recruited from the American Academy of Pediatrics' national Pediatric Research in Office
      Settings (PROS) practice-based research network, as well as the client database of the
      Physician's Computer Company (PCC) - an Electronic Health Record (EHR) vendor. We will
      recruit 18 practices. 9 practices will be randomized to the Intervention arm and 9 practices
      to Usual Care. Intervention arm practices will select 1-2 pediatric clinicians, including
      pediatricians (PED) and nurse practitioners (NP), to receive in-person training in
      Motivational Interviewing (MI), behavioral therapy, billing and coding, and study procedures.
      Usual Care practices will select 1-2 pediatric clinicians to receive billing / coding and
      study protocol training only, via telephone and webinar; they will be offered in-person MI
      training at the close of the trial. Around 316 parents of overweight or obese children (BMI &gt;
      85th percentile for age and gender) between 3 and 11 years of age at baseline that are
      patients of participating Intervention arm clinicians will be enrolled. Over 24 months, these
      parents may receive up to 4 in-person, MI-based counseling sessions with a trained pediatric
      clinician and up to 6 telephone counseling sessions with an MI-trained Registered Dietician
      (RD). There will be no study-specific contact with parents or their children in Usual Care
      practices during the trial - they will continue to receive usual care. EHR and billing data
      for all 3-11 year old children within all participating practices will be extracted by PCC to
      permit determination of the effectiveness of the intervention versus usual care on change in
      BMI z-score among 3 groups: 1) all eligible children in the Intervention arm), 2) all
      eligible children whose parent actively participates in the trial , and 3) all 3-11 year old
      children in all participating practices.

    <description>Change in child BMI z-score across the 2 years of the intervention. At the conclusion of the trial, BMI values for eligible children will be extracted from the electronic health record. Potential covariates include: days since baseline, sex, age, and ethnicity. To control for cluster randomization effects we will utilize SAS/PROC MIXED with practice treated as a random effect with TX condition nested in practice. Key potential effect modifiers include patient age, race, and gender.</description>

    <description>Although the primary intention to treat analyses described above for primary outcome will include all patients assigned to groups regardless of intervention exposure, as a secondary analysis, we will examine effects among the subsample of children who parents actively participated in the intervention, defined as receipt of at least 50% of the planned MI dose. The same modeling approaches discussed above will be employed to test this secondary aim.</description>
