  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Miscarriage occurs in about 1-2% of human pregnancies and is one of the common pregnancy
      problems before 12 weeks of pregnancy. Anatomical and chromosomal abnormalities, microbial
      factors and auto and alloimmune reactions have been speculated to attribute in recurrent
      miscarriage. Unexplained recurrent miscarriage (URM) is defined as three or more repeated
      abortions, probably caused by maternal immunological rejection . Given that maternal immune
      system encounters semi-allogeneic fetus, pregnancy outcome is associated with the interaction
      between maternal immune system and immuno-regulatory capability of the fetus. Effectiveness
      of treatment approaches in RM patients has been controversial and remained to be discovered.
      Immunomodulatory agents such as corticosteroids and allogeneic lymphocyte immunization showed
      variable success rates in RM patients. Therapeutic effects of IVIG in unexplained RM is
      controversial and most positive results were obtained from the trials in RM women with
      cellular immune abnormalities, such as increased NK cell level and/or cytotoxicity, and T
      cell abnormalities. Previous studies have shown that the incidence of genetic abnormalities
      in children who have received immunosuppressive drugs such as IVIg like normal people and
      normal society. In this study we used IVIg at the time of positive pregnancy,400 mg/kg IVIG
      was administered intravenously. Following the first administration, IVIG well given every 4
      weeks through 32 weeks of gestation to suppress the immune system in patients with
      immunological causes of RPL and the results will be compared with a control group that did
      not receive any type of drug.
