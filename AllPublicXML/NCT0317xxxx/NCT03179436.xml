  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and preliminary
      efficacy of escalating doses of MK-1308 when used in combination with pembrolizumab in
      participants with advanced solid tumors.

      After screening, participants are assigned to either the Dose Escalation Phase or Dose
      Confirmation Phase. The Dose Escalation Phase consists of 3 cohorts and will evaluate
      available PK and safety data from the first 6 participants of each cohort, including dose
      limiting toxicities (DLTs). The purpose of the Dose Confirmation Phase is to gather
      additional safety, tolerability, PK, and preliminary efficacy data of MK-1308 in combination
      with pembrolizumab. The 5 arms of the Dose Confirmation Phase will include
      advanced/metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and second line advanced/metastatic
      small cell lung cancer (SCLC). In participants who have initial evidence of radiological
      progressive disease (PD) by modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)
      version 1.1, it will be at the discretion of the investigator whether to continue a
      participant on study treatment until repeat imaging is obtained.

      Protocol Amendment 4 will enroll participants with melanoma in an Efficacy Expansion Cohort.
      During the Efficacy Expansion Phase, participants will be randomized to receive either
      MK-1308 in combination with pembrolizumab or MK-1308 monotherapy.

      Protocol Amendment 7 will enroll participants in a new cohort (Arm I). During the
      Coformulation Phase, the safety and PK of a coformulated product of MK-1308 plus
      pembrolizumab (MK-1308A) will be evaluated in comparison to that of the single,
      co-administered products given at the same dose and schedule.

    <description>DLTs will be assessed during the first 6 weeks (2 cycles) of treatment for the Dose Escalation and the first 3 weeks (1 cycle) of treatment for the Dose Confirmation. DLT is defined as toxicity that is possibly, probably, or definitely related to study therapy and may result in a change in the given dose. DLTs include Grade (Gr)4 non-hematologic toxicity (not laboratory); Gr 4 hematologic toxicity lasting ≥7 days (except thrombocytopenia); most non-hematologic AEs ≥ Gr 3 in severity; any Gr 3 or Gr 4 non-hematologic laboratory value that requires clinically significant medical intervention, leads to hospitalization, persists for &gt;1 week, or results in a drug-induced liver injury; Gr 3 or Gr 4 febrile neutropenia; a prolonged delay in initiating Cycle 2 or 3 of Dose Escalation or Cycle 2 of Dose Confirmation due to treatment-related toxicity; any treatment-related toxicity that causes the participant to discontinue treatment during the DLT observation period, and Gr 5 toxicity.</description>

    <description>ORR is defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population whose best overall response (BOR) is confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as assessed by BICR and based on imaging per modified RECIST 1.1.

According to modified RECIST 1.1, CR is disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm. PR according to modified RECIST 1.1 is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters (SOD) of target lesions as assessed by the investigator, taking as reference the baseline SOD.</description>

             treatment with an anti-PD-1/L1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) administered either as
             monotherapy, or in combination with other checkpoint inhibitors or other therapies

             months of stopping anti-PD-1 are eligible

          -  Have submitted pre-trial imaging and provided a baseline tumor sample

          -  Proto-oncogene B-raf (BRAF) V600 mutation-positive melanoma participants may have
             received targeted therapy for advanced or metastatic disease (eg, BRAF/MEK inhibitor,
             alone or in combination) prior to enrolling on this study; however, they are not
             required to progress on this treatment

          -  BRAF V600E mutation-positive melanoma participants who have NOT received a BRAF
             inhibitor (either as adjuvant therapy or in the metastatic disease setting) with
             lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) &lt; local upper limit of normal (ULN), no clinically
             significant tumor-related symptoms, and absence of rapidly progressing metastatic

             protein 1 (PD-1), programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), or anti PD-L2 agent or with
             an agent directed to another stimulatory or co-inhibitory T-cell receptor

          -  Has had chemotherapy, definitive radiation, or biological cancer therapy within 4
             weeks (2 weeks for palliative radiation) prior to the first dose of study therapy, or
