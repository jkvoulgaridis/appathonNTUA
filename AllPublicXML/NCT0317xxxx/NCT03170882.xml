  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of ixazomib + dexamethasone (ixa + dex)
      versus pomalidomide + dexamethasone (pom + dex) on progression-free survival (PFS) in
      participants with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) who have received at
      least 2 prior lines of therapy, including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor, and are
      refractory to lenalidomide but not refractory to proteasome inhibitors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called Ixazomib. Ixazomib is being tested to treat
      people who have RRMM. This study will compare the efficacy and safety in participants who
      take ixazomib and dexamethasone to pomalidomide and dexamethasone. It is an open-label, Phase
      2 study.

      The study will enroll approximately 120 participants. Participants will receive:

        -  Ixazomib 4 mg + dexamethasone 20 mg (or 10 mg if participant is aged &gt;=75 years) OR

        -  pomalidomide 4 mg + dexamethasone 40 mg (or 20 mg if participant is aged &gt;=75 years)

      All participants will be asked to take either ixazomib plus dexamethasone (in cases where
      only 4 mg tablets for dexamethasone are available, the following dexamethasone schedule is
      recommended for participants aged &gt;=75 years: 12 mg dexamethasone will be given on Days 1, 8,
      15, and 22 of every 28-day cycle; and 8 mg dexamethasone will be given on Days 2, 9, 16, and
      23 of every 28-day cycle) or pomalidomide 4 mg + dexamethasone 40 mg at recommended doses.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this
      study is approximately 28 months after the first participant enters the study.

      Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, and will be contacted for PFS
      follow-up, in case of study drug discontinuation for up to 4 years from first dose
      administration. After disease progression, participants will be followed-up for OS every 12
      weeks until death or up to 4 years.

    <measure>HRQOL based on EORTC QLQ-C30 Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 4 years</time_frame>
    <description>The EORTC QLQ-C30 contains 30 items across 5 functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), 9 symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain, dyspnea, sleep disturbance, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties) and a global health status/quality of life (QOL) scale. Most of the 30 items have 4 response levels (not at all, a little, quite a bit, and very much), with 2 questions relying on a 7-point numeric rating scale. Raw scores are converted into scale scores ranging from 0 to 100. For the functional scales and the global health status/QOL scale, higher scores represent better QOL; for the symptom scales, lower scores represent better QOL.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Must have a confirmed diagnosis of multiple myeloma (MM) requiring therapy according
             to IMWG criteria.

          2. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 2.

          3. Must have had a relapse or PD after having received 2 or more prior lines of systemic
             therapy. Note: A line of therapy is defined as 1 or more cycles of a planned treatment
             program; this may consist of 1 or more planned cycles of single-agent therapy or
             combination therapy, as well as a sequence of treatments administered in a planned
             manner. For example, a planned treatment approach of induction therapy followed by
             autologous SCT, followed by maintenance is considered 1 line of therapy. Typically
             each line of therapy is separated by PD. Discussion with the medical monitor may help
             clarify the number of lines of therapy that a prospective study participant had.

          4. Must be refractory to lenalidomide, defined as having received at least 2 consecutive
             cycles of lenalidomide as a single agent or within a lenalidomide-containing regimen
             and having had PD during treatment with or within 60 days after the last dose of
             lenalidomide. The starting dose of lenalidomide should have been 25 mg (or as low as
             10 mg in the case of renal function impairment or other safety concern), and the final
             dose should have been a minimum of 10 mg.

          5. Must have received at least 2 consecutive cycles of a bortezomib- or
             carfilzomib-containing regimen, and either:

             Achieved at least a PR and did not have PD during treatment with or within 60 days
             after the last dose of bortezomib or carfilzomib, OR

             o Had bortezomib and/or carfilzomib intolerance (defined as discontinuation because of
             drug-related adverse events [AEs] before completion of the planned treatment course)
             without PD before the start of the next regimen.

          6. Must have measurable disease defined by:

               -  Serum M-protein &gt;=1 g/dL (&gt;=10 g/L), OR

               -  Urine M-protein &gt;=200 mg/24 hours and must have documented MM isotype by
                  immunofixation (central laboratory).

          7. Suitable venous access for the study-required blood sampling, including
             pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling.

          8. Recovered (that is, less than or equal to [&lt;=] Grade 1 nonhematologic toxicity) from
             the reversible effects of prior anticancer therapy.

          9. Must be willing and able to adhere to pomalidomide-related risk mitigation activities
             if randomized to the pom+dex arm (example, Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies
             [REMS], pregnancy prevention programs).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior allogenic bone marrow transplantation in any prior line of therapy or prior
             autologous SCT in the last prior line of therapy- unless the autologous SCT was
             performed a year or more before disease progression.

          2. Diagnosed with or treated for another malignancy within 2 years before randomization,
             or previously diagnosed with another malignancy and have any evidence of residual,
             persistent, or recurrent disease. Participants with nonmelanoma skin cancer or

    <ipd_description>Takeda makes patient-level, de-identified data sets and associated documents available for all interventional studies after applicable marketing approvals and commercial availability have been received (or program is completely terminated), an opportunity for the primary publication of the research and final report development has been allowed, and other criteria have been met as set forth in Takeda's Data Sharing Policy (see www.TakedaClinicalTrials.com for details). To obtain access, researchers must submit a legitimate academic research proposal for adjudication by an independent review panel, who will review the scientific merit of the research and the requestor's qualifications and conflict of interest that can result in potential bias. Once approved, qualified researchers who sign a data sharing agreement are provided access to these data in a secure research environment.</ipd_description>
