    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effect of high-velocity low-amplitude thrust (HVLAT) manipulation to
      the cervical spine on neuropeptide expression as determined by the plasma concentration of
      oxytocin, neurotensin, orexin A and cortisol; and Examine the effect of HVLAT manipulation on
      pain perception in symptomatic females with non-specific mechanical cervical spine pain

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A high-velocity low-amplitude thrust (HVLAT) manipulation or commonly known as a spinal
      manipulation, is an intervention frequently used by physical therapists and other healthcare
      practitioners as an alternative treatment to help relieve spinal pain The mechanism by which
      HVLAT manipulation modulates pain remains undefined, although this does not contradict the
      clinical effects from HVLAT manipulation. Furthermore, there is evidence that suggests
      analgesia after HVLAT manipulation. There is a variety of observed and proposed phenomena
      that can explain the mechanisms for the psychological, mechanical, or neurophysiological
      responses from a HVLAT manipulation associated with alterations in pain processing or
      sympathetic and motor systems' excitation.

    <description>An HVLAT manipulation is applied to the site of pain or restriction with the patient in supine. This technique uses both primary levers (pre-manipulation rotation - away (30 ° - 45 °) from the side of pain or limitation) and secondary levers (Side bending - towards coupled with lateral shift - away, and posterior-anterior (PA) shift (extension). This is a bimanual technique. For the applicator hand, the anterolateral portion of the first or second phalanx of the second ray was positioned on the superior joint partner of the target vertebrae using a cradle hold. The other hand is placed on the posterolateral aspect of the occiput (above the ear). While maintaining these positions the clinician performed the thrust with the arc of rotation dependent on the level of the target vertebrae.</description>

            <title>HVLAT Manipulation</title>
            <description>An HVLAT manipulation is applied to the site of pain or restriction with the patient in supine. This technique uses both primary levers (pre-manipulation rotation – away (30 ° – 45 °) from the side of pain or limitation) and secondary levers (Side bending – towards coupled with lateral shift – away, and posterior-anterior (PA) shift (extension). This is a bimanual technique. For the applicator hand, the anterolateral portion of the first or second phalanx of the second ray was positioned on the superior joint partner of the target vertebrae using a cradle hold. The other hand is placed on the posterolateral aspect of the occiput (above the ear). While maintaining these positions the clinician performed the thrust with the arc of rotation dependent on the level of the target vertebrae.
HVLAT manipulation: HVLAT will be performed 10 minutes after the first blood draw.</description>

            <title>HVLAT Manipulation</title>
            <description>An HVLAT manipulation is applied to the site of pain or restriction with the patient in supine. This technique uses both primary levers (pre-manipulation rotation – away (30 ° – 45 °) from the side of pain or limitation) and secondary levers (Side bending – towards coupled with lateral shift – away, and posterior-anterior (PA) shift (extension). This is a bimanual technique. For the applicator hand, the anterolateral portion of the first or second phalanx of the second ray was positioned on the superior joint partner of the target vertebrae using a cradle hold. The other hand is placed on the posterolateral aspect of the occiput (above the ear). While maintaining these positions the clinician performed the thrust with the arc of rotation dependent on the level of the target vertebrae.
