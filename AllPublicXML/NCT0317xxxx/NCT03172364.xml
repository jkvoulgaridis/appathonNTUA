      This is an assessor blind (dermatologist and ophthalmologist) clinical in use study to
      determine the local cutaneous and ocular tolerance of two cosmetic facial cleanser products
      when used as per the intended instructions for use in a population of healthy female
      participants with clinically assessed sensitive skin.

    <measure>Frequency of Combined Dermatologist Score</measure>
    <time_frame>After 21 (+2) days of test product use</time_frame>
    <description>The intensity of any visual signs of irritation was recorded according to Dermal response score: 0=No evidence of irritation, 1=Minimal erythema; barely perceptible, 2=Definite erythema, readily visible; or minimal edema; or minimal popular response, 3=Erythema and papules, 4=Definite edema, 5=Erythema, edema, and papules, 6=Vesicular eruption, and 7=Strong reaction spreading beyond test site. Dermatologist also provided a superficial irritation score if the dermal response score &gt;0. Superficial irritation score was as follow: grade A/score 0=Slight glazed appearance, grade B/score 1=Marked glazing, grade C/score 2=Glazing with peeling and cracking, grade F/score 3=Glazing with fissures, grade G/score 3=Film of dried serous exudate covering all or portion of the patch, and grade H/score 3=Small petechial erosions and/or scabs. The combined score was equal the sum of the dermal response score plus the numerical equivalent of the superficial irritation score. Full range 0-10.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Frequency of Combined Ophthalmologist Score</measure>
    <time_frame>After 21 (+2) days of test product use</time_frame>
    <description>Ocular irritation assessed through the observation of the presence of two factors: Lacrimation Intensity and Conjunctiva Involvement. Conjunctiva involvement score are as follow: 0= None - No involvement, 1= Mild - Conjunctivae (palpebral and bulbar) injected above normal with possible chemosis (swelling); no discharge, 2= Moderate - Conjunctivae injected above normal; obvious swelling; possible discharge, and 3= Severe - Conjunctivae more diffuse, deeper crimson red, individual vessels not easily discernible; excessive swelling and/or discharge. Lacrimal intensity score are as follow: 0= None - No lacrimation observed, 1= Mild-Excessive wetness (no distinct tears), 2= Moderate - A few formed tears (contained in orbit), and 3= Severe - Intense tearing (leaving orbit). The combined ophthalmologist score was calculated in the following way: Combined ophthalmologist score = conjunctiva involvement score + lacrimal intensity score. Full range 0-6.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Frequency of Combined Dermatologist and Ophthalmologist Score</measure>
    <time_frame>After 21 (+2) days of test product use</time_frame>
    <description>The combined dermatologist and ophthalmologist score was calculated as the sum of the combined dermatologist score (i.e., dermal response score + superficial irritation score) and the combined ophthalmologist score (i.e., conjunctiva involvement score + lacrimal intensity score). No inferential statistic were performed for this endpoint.The full range was from 0 to 13 where lower scores indicated lower dermal irritation.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Combined Dermatologist and Ophthalmologist Score (Modified)</measure>
    <time_frame>After 21 (+2) days of test product use</time_frame>
    <description>A modified combined dermatologist and ophthalmologist score was calculated, where the superficial irritation component was removed from the equation. Therefore, the modified combined dermatologist and ophthalmologist score was defined as the dermal response score + the combined ophthalmologist score (i.e., conjunctiva involvement score + lacrimal intensity score). No inferential statistic were performed for this endpoint.The full range was from 0 to 13 where lower scores indicated lower dermal irritation.</description>

    <measure>Frequency of Participant Self-assessment Combined Score for Question Responses With Regards to Product Use Experience on Face</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after 21 (+2) days of test product use</time_frame>
    <description>Participants asked Subject Self-Assessment questions at Baseline (Visit 2), prior to test product use, 1 hour (± 20 minutes) following first supervised product use, and following 21 (+2) days of product use. Participants scored each symptom asked in the question (Are you experiencing any redness, dryness, burning, itching or stinging of your face?) by using following score: 0= None, 1=Mild, 2= Moderate, and 3= Severe. Combined score face was obtained by summing the 5 subject assessments for face i.e. redness, dryness, burning, itching and stinging. Maximum observed value of this combined score was 3 and maximum possible combined score was 15. Minimum observed value of this combined score was 0 and minimum possible combined score was 0.</description>

        <description>The intensity of any visual signs of irritation was recorded according to Dermal response score: 0=No evidence of irritation, 1=Minimal erythema; barely perceptible, 2=Definite erythema, readily visible; or minimal edema; or minimal popular response, 3=Erythema and papules, 4=Definite edema, 5=Erythema, edema, and papules, 6=Vesicular eruption, and 7=Strong reaction spreading beyond test site. Dermatologist also provided a superficial irritation score if the dermal response score &gt;0. Superficial irritation score was as follow: grade A/score 0=Slight glazed appearance, grade B/score 1=Marked glazing, grade C/score 2=Glazing with peeling and cracking, grade F/score 3=Glazing with fissures, grade G/score 3=Film of dried serous exudate covering all or portion of the patch, and grade H/score 3=Small petechial erosions and/or scabs. The combined score was equal the sum of the dermal response score plus the numerical equivalent of the superficial irritation score. Full range 0-10.</description>

        <description>Ocular irritation assessed through the observation of the presence of two factors: Lacrimation Intensity and Conjunctiva Involvement. Conjunctiva involvement score are as follow: 0= None - No involvement, 1= Mild - Conjunctivae (palpebral and bulbar) injected above normal with possible chemosis (swelling); no discharge, 2= Moderate - Conjunctivae injected above normal; obvious swelling; possible discharge, and 3= Severe - Conjunctivae more diffuse, deeper crimson red, individual vessels not easily discernible; excessive swelling and/or discharge. Lacrimal intensity score are as follow: 0= None - No lacrimation observed, 1= Mild-Excessive wetness (no distinct tears), 2= Moderate - A few formed tears (contained in orbit), and 3= Severe - Intense tearing (leaving orbit). The combined ophthalmologist score was calculated in the following way: Combined ophthalmologist score = conjunctiva involvement score + lacrimal intensity score. Full range 0-6.</description>

          <description>The combined dermatologist and ophthalmologist score was calculated as the sum of the combined dermatologist score (i.e., dermal response score + superficial irritation score) and the combined ophthalmologist score (i.e., conjunctiva involvement score + lacrimal intensity score). No inferential statistic were performed for this endpoint.The full range was from 0 to 13 where lower scores indicated lower dermal irritation.</description>

        <description>Participants asked Subject Self-Assessment questions at Baseline (Visit 2), prior to test product use, 1 hour (± 20 minutes) following first supervised product use, and following 21 (+2) days of product use. Participants scored each symptom asked in the question (Are you experiencing any redness, dryness, burning, itching or stinging of your face?) by using following score: 0= None, 1=Mild, 2= Moderate, and 3= Severe. Combined score face was obtained by summing the 5 subject assessments for face i.e. redness, dryness, burning, itching and stinging. Maximum observed value of this combined score was 3 and maximum possible combined score was 15. Minimum observed value of this combined score was 0 and minimum possible combined score was 0.</description>
