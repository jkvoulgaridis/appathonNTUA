    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects of daratumumab or FMS inhibitor JNJ-40346527
      before surgery in treating patients with high-risk prostate cancer that can be removed by
      surgery and has not spread to other parts of the body or has spread to nearby tissue or lymph
      nodes. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as daratumumab, may help the body's
      immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow
      and spreadFMS inhibitor JNJ-40346527 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of
      the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving daratumumab or FMS inhibitor JNJ-40346527 before
      surgery may work better in treating patients with prostate cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Safety and tolerability of therapy with the study drugs in men with high-risk localized
      prostate cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the proportion of patients who achieve pathological complete response (CR) with
      the study drugs in men with high-risk localized prostate cancer.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To study immunological changes in tumor tissues and peripheral blood in response to the
      study drugs in men with high-risk localized prostate cancer.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive daratumumab intravenously (IV) over 4-8 hours once weekly for 4 weeks
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo radical
      prostatectomy during week 6.

      ARM B: Patients receive FMS inhibitor JNJ-40346527 orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for 4-5
      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After a 3 day wash-out
      period, patients undergo radical prostatectomy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at week 18.

             [antiHBc] and/or antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen [antiHBs]) must be screened

             DNA levels. Those who are PCR positive will be excluded. EXCEPTION: Subjects with
             serologic findings suggestive of HBV vaccination (antiHBs positivity as the only
             serologic marker) AND a known history of prior HBV vaccination, do not need to be
             tested for HBV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) by PCR. Seropositive for hepatitis C
             (except in the setting of a sustained virologic response [SVR], defined as aviremia at
