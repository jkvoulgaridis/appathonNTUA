    <textblock>
      This is the Phase 1/2 first-in-human, randomized, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded study
      evaluating the investigational multivalent group B streptococcus vaccine. Healthy adults aged
      18 to 49 years of age with no history of group B streptococcal vaccination will be randomized
      to receive either a single intramuscular dose of multivalent group B streptococcus vaccine
      (various formulations at 3 dose levels) or a placebo (saline control).

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Local Reactions by Maximum Severity Within 14 Days After Vaccination</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 14 days after vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>Local reactions were collected by using an e-diary and included redness, swelling and pain at injection site. Redness and swelling were graded as: mild (2.5-5.0 centimeter [cm]), moderate (greater than [&gt;] 5.0-10.0 cm) and severe (&gt;10.0 cm), grade 4 for redness (necrosis or exfoliative dermatitis) and grade 4 for swelling (necrosis). Pain at injection site was graded as: mild (did not interfere with activity), moderate (repeated use of nonnarcotic pain reliever &gt;24 hours or interfered with activity), severe (any use of narcotic pain reliever or prevented daily activity which resulted in missed days of work or school or was otherwise incapacitating, or included use of narcotics for analgesia), and grade 4 (required emergency room visit or hospitalization). The maximum severity (highest grading) of each location reaction within 14 days of vaccination was derived.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Healthy adults (male and female) 18 to 49 years of age at enrollment who are
             determined by medical history, physical examination, and clinical judgment of the
             investigator to be eligible for inclusion in the study.

          2. Negative urine pregnancy test at Visit 1 for all female subjects who are of
             childbearing potential.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Male subjects and female subjects of childbearing potential who are unwilling or
             unable to use a highly effective method of contraception as outlined in this protocol
             for at least 3 months after the last dose of investigational product.

          2. Acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that may
             increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational product
             administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the
             judgment of the investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for entry into this
             study. Chronic medical conditions include human immunodeficiency virus, chronic
             hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (HBV surface antigen positive), and/or hepatitis C
             virus infection.

          3. History of severe adverse reaction and/or severe allergic reaction (eg, anaphylaxis)
             to any vaccine.

          4. History of microbiologically proven invasive disease caused by group B streptococcus
             (Streptococcus agalactiae).

          5. Previous vaccination with any licensed or investigational group B streptococcus
             vaccine, or planned receipt during the subject's participation in the study (through
             the last blood draw).

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Local Reactions by Maximum Severity Within 14 Days After Vaccination</title>
        <description>Local reactions were collected by using an e-diary and included redness, swelling and pain at injection site. Redness and swelling were graded as: mild (2.5-5.0 centimeter [cm]), moderate (greater than [&gt;] 5.0-10.0 cm) and severe (&gt;10.0 cm), grade 4 for redness (necrosis or exfoliative dermatitis) and grade 4 for swelling (necrosis). Pain at injection site was graded as: mild (did not interfere with activity), moderate (repeated use of nonnarcotic pain reliever &gt;24 hours or interfered with activity), severe (any use of narcotic pain reliever or prevented daily activity which resulted in missed days of work or school or was otherwise incapacitating, or included use of narcotics for analgesia), and grade 4 (required emergency room visit or hospitalization). The maximum severity (highest grading) of each location reaction within 14 days of vaccination was derived.</description>

        <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received investigational product without regard to possibility of causal relationship. Serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly or that was considered to be an important medical event.
