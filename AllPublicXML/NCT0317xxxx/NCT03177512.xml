  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is testing the acceptability and feasibility of a highly interactive mobile
      application (app) to promote HIV/sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing and uptake of
      pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) among young men who have sex with men (YMSM).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Using the Information-Motivation-Behavior Skills (IMB) model, we have developed LYNX, a
      highly interactive mobile app to promote accurate risk perception and increase HIV/STI
      testing and linkage to PrEP among young men who have sex with men (YMSM). Key components of
      the app include Sex Pro (a personalized HIV risk score), a sex diary to facilitate accurate
      data collection; HIV/STI testing information and reminders; access to home HIV/STI testing
      options; a geospatial-based locator of HIV/STI testing sites and PrEP clinics; PrEP
      information and videos; and online PrEP navigation.

      This study is part of the iTech NIH U19, which has an overall goal to develop innovative
      technology-focused interventions addressing the HIV prevention and care continuum for youth.
