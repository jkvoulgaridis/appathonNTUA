      The purpose of this study is to pilot data for a systematic molecular characterization of
      pathophysiologic perturbations incurred by snake envenomation and compare this to other
      inflammatory physiologic states such as trauma and sepsis. This sub-study will analyze
      samples of participants enrolled under the parent study &quot;Surgical Critical Care Initiative
      Tissue and Data Acquisition Protocol&quot;.

      The goal of this study is to pilot data for a systematic molecular characterization of
      pathophysiologic perturbations incurred by snake envenomation and compare this to other
      inflammatory physiologic states such as trauma and sepsis. The investigators will
      characterize transcriptomic and immune biomarker response to varying clinical severities of
      snakebite envenomation and compare to that of sepsis and traumatic injury.

      This sub-study will analyze samples of participants enrolled under a previously IRB-approved
      protocol, &quot;Surgical Critical Care Initiative Tissue and Data Acquisition Protocol (SC2i
      TDAP)&quot;. All participants eligible for protocol SC2i TDAP (NCT 02182180) are eligible to be
      included in the current proposal, and conversely, the investigators will not enroll any
      participants in the current protocol who is not enrolled in SC2i TDAP. Participants enrolled
      under that protocol who have suffered snakebite envenomation will undergo additional
      procedure of follow up phone call 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days after discharge from the emergency
      department or hospital to fill out the PSFS via phone. All labs and other procedures will
      otherwise be as described in SC2i TDAP.

    <description>Patient-Specific Functional Scale (PSFS) survey will be administered to patients to record symptoms at both the time of evaluation in the emergency department and in follow up by phone at 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days after discharge from the emergency department or hospital. The rest of the patients' care will be as usual care, and patients will have had research interventions of blood sampling and data collection as noted in the previously approved SC2i Tissue Data Acquisition Protocol (TDAP) Pro00054947 (ClinicalTrial.gov ID: NCT02182180).</description>

  <biospec_descr>

      Blood samples collected will be used for quantification of over one hundred micro RNA (levels
      will be assessed) as well as multiple markers of inflammation such as Interleukins 1-36 and
      their receptors, interferons and their receptors, tumor necrosis factors and their receptors,
      CCL and CXCL family chemokines and their receptors, macrophage and granulocyte colony
      stimulating factors and their receptors, and lymphocyte secreted products related to the
      action of these proteins will be evaluated. No genetic testing will be performed.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients enrolled into the Surgical Critical Care Initiative Tissue and Data
             Acquisition Protocol (NCT02182180) who have suffered a snakebite envenomation
             (enrolled under &quot;Group 5: Non-traumatic conditions: individuals with non-traumatic
             causes of organ or system failure that mirror the phenotype of traumatic complications
             in Group 1&quot;) are eligible to be included in this study.

          -  Adult patients (18 years of age or older) in a manner that is sensitive to the
             inclusion of women and members of underserved minority groups.

          -  Potential participants or legally authorized representative (LAR) will be originally
             identified by clinical team, as described under Pro00054947 (NCT02182180). Only
             participants enrolled in Pro00054947 (NCT02182180) will be recruited for this
             sub-study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant women will be excluded from the study.

    <ipd_description>The PI will ensure that there is no unauthorized use of the data or samples. As this study is unblinded and nonrandomized it is felt that a formal Data Safety Monitoring Board is not necessary to insure the prompt implementation of patient safeguards. Data for this sub-study will be entered in a separate REDCap database, with data specific to this sub-study (i.e., PSFS, hospital re-admissions from phone follow-ups). This database will only be available to appropriately delegated key personnel. Any data shared outside of Duke key personnel will be de-identified,</ipd_description>
