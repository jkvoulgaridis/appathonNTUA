  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is for adults 50 years or older who are losing their clear, sharp central vision.
      Central vision is needed to be able to read and drive a car. They have been diagnosed with
      dry age-related macular degeneration (called dry AMD). The macula is the part of the eye that
      allows one to see fine detail. AMD causes cells in the macula to die (atrophy). This study is
      looking at a new treatment for slowing or reversing dry AMD, called ASP7317. ASP7317 is a
      specially created type of cells derived from stem cells. ASP7317 cells are injected into the
      macula of the eye. Immunosuppressive medicines (called IMT) are also taken around the time of
      injection of the cells to prevent the body from rejecting them. The study is divided into 3
      stages.

      Stage 1 looks at the safety of ASP7317 at different dose levels. Researchers want to learn
      which of 3 different dose levels of ASP7317 work without causing unwanted effects. The doses
      are low, medium and high numbers of cells. IMT medicines will also be taken by mouth (oral)
      for 13 weeks around the time of the injection of ASP7317.

      In Stage 2, the participants are selected by chance (randomization) to be in the ASP7317
      treatment group or to be in the control group (no treatment). What was learned about the dose
      of ASP7317 in stage 1 will be used to determine the appropriate dose(s) in this stage. In
      those who receive ASP7317, oral IMT medicines will also be taken for 13 weeks. 26 weeks after
      ASP3717 is injected, the best corrected visual acuity will be compared between participants
      who received ASP7317 and in those who did not (control group). Visual acuity is a test to
      find out what the smallest letters are that one can read on a standard chart. This test will
      be masked. Masked means the study opticians who measure one's visual acuity don't know
      whether the participant received ASP7317 or not.

      In Stage 3, participants in the untreated control group from stage 2 will have the option to
      receive treatment with ASP7317. They must have been in the study for 26 weeks and still meet
      the requirements for treatment.

    <textblock>
      At the last study visit or time of withdrawal participants receiving ASP7317 will be
      consented to participate in the safety surveillance period of the study (under a separate
      protocol 7316-CL-0007), which will continue to monitor the participants for long-term safety
      via an annual questionnaire.

      Screening and enrollment are temporarily halted due to COVID-19.

All participants in the low cells/dose and medium cells/dose cohorts may be treated simultaneously. The high cells/dose cohort will require sentinel dosing. After the first participant is dosed with high cells/dose and followed for 6 weeks the independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review the safety data and images and recommend if the second and third participants may be treated with high cells/dose. One of the 3 doses will be selected for evaluation of efficacy and safety during the Proof of Concept (PoC) stage of the study.
