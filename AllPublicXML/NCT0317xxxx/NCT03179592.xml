    <description>This will be performed by two independent observers using a semi-quantitative rating scale of 1 - 5. Image quality will be graded on a five-point scoring system: 1 non-diagnostic; 2 limited diagnostic value; 3 adequate (presence of artifacts not limiting detection of luminal stenosis); 4 good; 5 excellent. Image quality assessments will be performed on both the investigative and control groups.</description>

        The study population includes 120 patients who present to radiology department for
        clinically indicated CCTA scan. In order to be included patients must meet all inclusion
        criteria and none of the exclusion criteria.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Referred for a clinically indicated CCTA scan.

          2. Subject must be 18 - 85 years of age.

          3. Subject must provide written informed consent prior to any study-related procedures
             being performed.

          4. Subject must be willing to comply with all clinical study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is a pregnant or nursing female. Exclude the possibility of pregnancy:

               -  By testing (serum or urine beta HCG) within 24 hours before study agent
                  administration, or

               -  By surgical sterilization, or

               -  Post-menopausal, with minimum one (1) year history without menses.

          2. Subject is chosen by the automated tube voltage selection algorithm (or adjusted by
             the technologist) to be scanned using a tube voltage that is not 70, 80, 90, 100, 110,
             120, or 130 kV.

          3. Subject is chosen by the automated tube voltage selection algorithm (or adjusted by
             the technologist) to be scanned using a tube voltage that has previously reached the
             maximum subject number (20 subjects per tube voltage).

          4. Subject has an acute psychiatric disorder.

          5. Subject is unwilling to comply with the requirements of the protocol.

          6. Subject has previously entered this study.

          7. Subject has an allergy against iodinated contrast agents or pharmaceutical stressors
             used in this study.

          8. Subject has impaired renal function (creatinine &gt; 1.5 mg/dl).

          9. Subject is in unstable condition.
