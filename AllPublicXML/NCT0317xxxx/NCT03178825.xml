  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multi-center clinical trial will evaluate the safety and long-term efficacy of hybrid
      fractional 2940 nm and 1470 nm lasers for treatment of symptoms of Genitourinary Syndrome of
      Menopause.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Both 2940 nm Er:YAG (Erbium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet) and 1470 nm diode lasers are
      cleared by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for ablation, vaporization, coagulation of
      soft tissue and for skin resurfacing. Fractional delivery of laser is a well-established
      method that stimulates tissue remodeling in the dermis while leaving the surrounding tissue
      intact in order to decrease healing time. The layers of skin and vaginal mucosal tissue
      exhibit similarities that suggest the clinical results seen with skin resurfacing may be
      translated to the vaginal tissue. Improved vaginal tissue health may lead to improvement of
      symptoms of Genitourinary Syndrome of Menopause (GSM). This multi-centered, 18-month
      prospective clinical trial will evaluate the safety and long-term effectiveness of hybrid
      fractional 2940 nm and 1470 nm lasers (HFL) as an alternative non-surgical, non-hormonal
      treatment for symptoms of GSM.
