      <pi_employee>All Principal Investigators ARE employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>There is NOT an agreement between Principal Investigators and the Sponsor (or its agents) that restricts the PI's rights to discuss or publish trial results after the trial is completed. </restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>The study was conducted in an unblinded manner and without controls. The sample size was not sufficient for rare ADRs. Some priority survey items were not reported, therefore incidence could not be estimated</limitations_and_caveats>
