    <textblock>
      The study contains Phase 1A and Phase 1B. Phase 1A has Part1 (BID Dose Escalation) and Part2
      (QD Dosing Escalation) Evaluation of a cohort of at least three participants completing one
      cycle of treatment at that dose level and dose regimen is required prior to determining the
      next dose level and dose regimen for the next cohort. Phase 1B has PartA (BID Dosing
      Expansion) will investigate efficacy in participants with selected tumor types and further
      evaluate safety and tolerability of BGB 290 at recommended dose for future studies. and PartB
      (Food Effect) will investigate the food effect on the Pharmacokinetics (PK) of BGB 290 in
      participants with advanced solid tumors.

             effects of radiotherapy before recording screening symptoms. 8.No untreated brain
             metastasis or unstable neurologic condition after the completion of radiation, or
             requiring corticosteroid of &gt; 40 mg prednisone daily equivalent dose to control the
