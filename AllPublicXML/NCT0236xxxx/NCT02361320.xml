    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well computed tomography works in diagnosing patients with pancreatic
      or hepatobiliary cancer. Computed tomography may help researchers predict how patients with
      pancreatic or hepatobiliary cancer may respond to chemotherapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To prospectively validate our pilot data that indicate that pre-therapy computed
      tomography-based (CT) mass transport properties correlate with overall survival.

      II. To prospectively validate our pilot data that indicate that local control of pancreatic
      and hepatobiliary tumors correlate with changes in computed tomography-based mass transport
      properties of the tumors after cytotoxic therapies.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo CT scan at baseline and after 4 to 6 cycles of
      fluorouracil/irinotecan/leucovorin calcium/oxaliplatin, or after 4 infusions of
      gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel (or other gemcitabine-based regimens), or 6 to 12 weeks after
      radiotherapy for hepatobiliary cancers. Patients may undergo optional magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) scans prior to therapy, after two weeks of therapy, and at the time of the
      first restaging CT scan.

    <description>Local tumor progression defined by clinical signs or symptoms of local pancreatic tumor growth (e.g., worsening back/abdominal pain, obstruction, jaundice, etc.) that are documented by the attending clinician and research data coordinator and/or diagnostic imaging evidence of tumor growth. Kaplan-Meier method used to estimate probabilities of LPFS for patients with a normalized AUC ratio &lt;1 and patients with a normalized AUC ratio &gt;/=1, respectively. Log rank test applied to compare the LPFS between these two patient groups. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models fitted to compare the LPFS between the two comparison groups, adjusting for the effects of patients' characteristics and clinical factors.</description>
