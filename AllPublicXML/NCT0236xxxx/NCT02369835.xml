  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase 3 trial studies how well modified Dakin's solution works in reducing
      radiation-induced dermatitis, a common skin reaction to radiation therapy, in patients with
      head and neck cancer undergoing radiation therapy. Modified Dakin's solution may reduce
      inflammation in the body, which may prevent or reduce dermatitis after radiation therapy.

      Radiation therapy in this study is regulatory medical care based on the patient's needs and
      the radiation oncologist's judgment. It is not possible nor necessary to explicitly define
      the dose or duration of treatment.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the proportion of patients who develop grade 3 radiation dermatitis (as
      defined by the Stanford Radiation Dermatitis Scoring System) as an adverse effect of
      radiation therapy or chemoradiation therapy for a head and neck cancer when initiating the
      use of prophylactic hypochlorite (HOCl) (modified Dakin's solution) at the start of therapy
      (experimental arm) compared to placebo (control arm).

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I (EXPERIMENTAL): Participants apply modified Dakin's solution (0.005% to 0.010%)
      topically to the skin of the arm up to 3 hours in advance of each radiation treatment.

      ARM II (CONTROL): Participants apply placebo solution (saline) topically to the skin of the
      arm up to 3 hours in advance of each radiation treatment.

      At the time that Stanford Radiation Dermatitis Scoring System (SRDSS) Grade E radiation
      dermatitis develops, the participant will transition to standard management for radiation
      dermatitis. SRDSS, by grade, is as follows.

        -  A. No skin change

        -  B. Faint, barely detectable erythema

        -  C. Follicular rash, hyperpigmentation, evolving erythema

        -  D. Dry desquamation, brisk erythema

        -  E. Moist desquamation

        -  F. Bleeding, ulceration, and/or infection

      SRDSS Grade E is roughly equivalent to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
      (CTCAE) Version 4.03 Grade 3 radiation dermatitis, &quot;Moist desquamation in areas other than
      skin folds and creases; bleeding induced by minor trauma or abrasion.&quot;

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 6 to 10 weeks.

    <description>Participants were assessed for radiation dermatitis on the arms according to the Stanford Radiation Dermatitis Scoring System (SRDSS), at baseline and through their treatment course. The outcome is reported by treatment group as the number and proportion of participants that experience SRDSS Grade E or greater radiation dermatitis through 10 weeks after completion of radiation treatment, a number without dispersion.
SRDSS, by grade:
A. No skin change
B. Faint, barely detectable erythema
C. Follicular rash, hyperpigmentation, evolving erythema
D. Dry desquamation, brisk erythema
E. Moist desquamation
F. Bleeding, ulceration, and/or infection

    <measure>Time to Grade E Radiation Dermatitis</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 weeks (estimated)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were assessed for radiation dermatitis on the arms according to the Stanford Radiation Dermatitis Scoring System (SRDSS), at baseline and through their treatment course. The time that SRDSS Grade E radiation dermatitis developed was noted. The outcome is reported by treatment group as the mean time to development of SRDSS Grade E radiation dermatitis, with standard deviation.
SRDSS, by grade:
A. No skin change
B. Faint, barely detectable erythema
C. Follicular rash, hyperpigmentation, evolving erythema
D. Dry desquamation, brisk erythema
E. Moist desquamation
F. Bleeding, ulceration, and/or infection
SRDSS Grade E is roughly equivalent to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.03 Grade 3 radiation dermatitis, &quot;Moist desquamation in areas other than skin folds and creases; bleeding induced by minor trauma or abrasion.&quot;

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Associated With Radiation Dermatitis</measure>
    <time_frame>3 to 12 weeks after completion of radiation treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life was assessed as pain associated with radiation dermatitis. Assessments were baseline and through treatment follow-up 3 to 12 weeks after completion of radiation treatment. The assessment was to be conducted with a Modified Brief Pain Inventory (MBPI), a 13-question survey with responses ranging from 0 to 10, and an overall score of 0 to 130. A higher score indicates more pain and less quality of life. The outcome was to be reported by treatment group as the mean score with standard deviation.

        <title>Radiation Dermatitis</title>
        <description>Participants were assessed for radiation dermatitis on the arms according to the Stanford Radiation Dermatitis Scoring System (SRDSS), at baseline and through their treatment course. The outcome is reported by treatment group as the number and proportion of participants that experience SRDSS Grade E or greater radiation dermatitis through 10 weeks after completion of radiation treatment, a number without dispersion.
SRDSS, by grade:
A. No skin change
B. Faint, barely detectable erythema
C. Follicular rash, hyperpigmentation, evolving erythema
D. Dry desquamation, brisk erythema
E. Moist desquamation
F. Bleeding, ulceration, and/or infection
SRDSS Grade E is roughly equivalent to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.03 Grade 3 radiation dermatitis, &quot;Moist desquamation in areas other than skin folds and creases; bleeding induced by minor trauma or abrasion&quot;</description>
        <time_frame>From first radiation treatment up to 10 weeks after completion of radiation treatment. Because much of the study data was not provided by the prior investigator to the current Responsible Party, it is not possible to be more precise than stated.</time_frame>

        <title>Pain Associated With Radiation Dermatitis</title>
        <description>Quality of life was assessed as pain associated with radiation dermatitis. Assessments were baseline and through treatment follow-up 3 to 12 weeks after completion of radiation treatment. The assessment was to be conducted with a Modified Brief Pain Inventory (MBPI), a 13-question survey with responses ranging from 0 to 10, and an overall score of 0 to 130. A higher score indicates more pain and less quality of life. The outcome was to be reported by treatment group as the mean score with standard deviation.
