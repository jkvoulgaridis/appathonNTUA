  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to compare the effectiveness of two different medications used in
      intravaginal trigger point injections (injections into extremely painful areas of a muscle)
      to treat chronic pelvic pain. The study compares onabotulinumtoxinA (BOTOXÂ®) (a drug prepared
      from the bacterial toxin botulin which temporarily paralyzes muscles) to Kenalog (a synthetic
      corticosteroid used as an anti-inflammatory agent).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) is a common and often debilitating problem among women. The
      musculoskeletal system is an important factor in chronic pelvic pain. Studies have
      demonstrated that women with CPP had more frequent musculoskeletal findings. On physical
      examination, myofascial trigger points have been found. Trigger points are hyperirritable
      bands of muscle that can be felt from the vaginal wall. They are often knot-like or taut and
      are painful when pressure is placed on them. Intravaginal injections of these trigger points
      using steroids including Kenalog (triamcinolone) have been done and produced decreases in
      pelvic pain. Trigger point injections of Onabotulinumtoxin A has also been shown to decrease
      pain in subjects with CPP. This study will compare these two drugs and assess pain (using
      subject questionnaires) at one, three and six months post injection.

    <measure>Pain Assessed by Change in Overall Pain Score Using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS).</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and One Month</time_frame>
    <description>The visual analog scale asks subjects to rate their level of pain on a scale from 0-10, with 0 being 'No pain' and 10 being 'Worst pain imaginable', hence lower scores are better. The baseline and follow-up visual analog scale for pain was obtained at every visit regardless if the patient received Trigger Point Injections. The difference between visual analog scale at 1 month and the visual analog scale at baseline was calculated. Positive numbers indicate the pain increased from baseline to 1 month and negative numbers indicates that pain decreased.</description>

    <measure>Pain Severity Assessed by Change in Overall Pain and Other Related Scores Using Questions 3, 4, 5, and 6 in the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) Questionnaire.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and One Month</time_frame>
    <description>Pain severity was constructed by averaging questions 3,4,5 and 6 of the brief pain inventory questionnaire (adding scores together and dividing by 4). Each question is on a scale from 0 (no pain) to 10 (pain as bad as you can imagine). Thus, lower numbers represent a better outcome. The difference between pain severity at 1 month and the pain severity at baseline was calculated. Positive numbers indicate the pain severity increased from baseline to 1 month and negative numbers indicates that the severity of the pain decreased.</description>

    <measure>Pain Interference Assessed by Change in Overall Pain and Other Related Scores Using Questions 9A Through 9G in the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) Questionnaire.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and One Month</time_frame>
    <description>The Pain Interference score was constructed by averaging the individual interference question scores from the brief pain inventory questionnaire (adding scores from questions 9A-9G and dividing by 7). The questions assess how, during the past 24 hours, pain has interfered with general anxiety (9A), mood (9B), walking ability (9C), normal work (9D), relations with other people (9E), sleep (9F), and enjoyment of life (9G). Each question is scored on a scale from 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (completely interferes). Thus, a lower value represents a better outcome. The difference between pain interference at 1 month and the pain interference at baseline was calculated. Positive numbers indicate the pain severity increased from baseline to 1 month and negative numbers indicates that the severity of the pain decreased.</description>

          <description>The Pain Interference score was constructed by averaging the individual interference question scores from the BPI questionnaire (scores for questions 9A-9G added together and divided by 7). The questions assess how, during the past 24 hours, pain has interfered with general anxiety (9A), mood (9B), walking ability (9C), normal work (9D), relations with other people (9E), sleep (9F), and enjoyment of life (9G). Each question is scored on a scale from 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (completely interferes). Thus, a lower value represents a better outcome.</description>

        <description>The visual analog scale asks subjects to rate their level of pain on a scale from 0-10, with 0 being 'No pain' and 10 being 'Worst pain imaginable', hence lower scores are better. The baseline and follow-up visual analog scale for pain was obtained at every visit regardless if the patient received Trigger Point Injections. The difference between visual analog scale at 1 month and the visual analog scale at baseline was calculated. Positive numbers indicate the pain increased from baseline to 1 month and negative numbers indicates that pain decreased.</description>

        <title>Pain Severity Assessed by Change in Overall Pain and Other Related Scores Using Questions 3, 4, 5, and 6 in the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) Questionnaire.</title>
        <description>Pain severity was constructed by averaging questions 3,4,5 and 6 of the brief pain inventory questionnaire (adding scores together and dividing by 4). Each question is on a scale from 0 (no pain) to 10 (pain as bad as you can imagine). Thus, lower numbers represent a better outcome. The difference between pain severity at 1 month and the pain severity at baseline was calculated. Positive numbers indicate the pain severity increased from baseline to 1 month and negative numbers indicates that the severity of the pain decreased.</description>

        <description>The Pain Interference score was constructed by averaging the individual interference question scores from the brief pain inventory questionnaire (adding scores from questions 9A-9G and dividing by 7). The questions assess how, during the past 24 hours, pain has interfered with general anxiety (9A), mood (9B), walking ability (9C), normal work (9D), relations with other people (9E), sleep (9F), and enjoyment of life (9G). Each question is scored on a scale from 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (completely interferes). Thus, a lower value represents a better outcome. The difference between pain interference at 1 month and the pain interference at baseline was calculated. Positive numbers indicate the pain severity increased from baseline to 1 month and negative numbers indicates that the severity of the pain decreased.</description>

        <description>The Pain Interference score was constructed by averaging the individual interference question scores from the brief pain inventory questionnaire (adding scores together for questions 9A-9G and dividing by 7). The questions assess how, during the past 24 hours, pain has interfered with general anxiety (9A), mood (9B), walking ability (9C), normal work (9D), relations with other people (9E), sleep (9F), and enjoyment of life (9G). Each question is scored on a scale from 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (completely interferes). Thus, a lower value represents a better outcome. The difference between pain interference at 3 months and the pain interference at baseline was calculated. Positive numbers indicate the pain severity increased from baseline to 3 months and negative numbers indicates that the severity of the pain decreased.</description>

        <title>Pain Interference Assessed by Change in Overall Pain and Other Related Scores Using Questions 9A Through 9G in the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) Questionnaire.</title>
        <description>The Pain Interference score was constructed by averaging the individual interference question scores from the brief pain inventory questionnaire (adding together scores for questions 9A-9G and dividing by 7). The questions assess how, during the past 24 hours, pain has interfered with general anxiety (9A), mood (9B), walking ability (9C), normal work (9D), relations with other people (9E), sleep (9F), and enjoyment of life (9G). Each question is scored on a scale from 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (completely interferes). Thus, a lower value represents a better outcome. The difference between pain interference at 6 months and the pain interference at baseline was calculated. Positive numbers indicate the pain severity increased from baseline to 6 months and negative numbers indicates that the severity of the pain decreased.</description>
