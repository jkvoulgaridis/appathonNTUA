    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to analyze and describe rehabilitation pathways of stroke patients
      in a region of North Norway and Central Denmark Region in relation to how patients perceive
      quality of life, health and functioning one year post stroke.

      The study will consist of 1) Translate, cross-cultural adapt and validate a stroke-specific
      health-related questionnaire 2) Describe the level of quality of life and rehabilitation
      pathway in the two countries 3) In-depth interviews of a smaller group of patients for a more
      complex understanding

      The study is part of a larger prospective observational multicenter-study of two patient
      cohorts with stroke.

      Anticipated: 500 patients from Norway and 500 patients from Denmark are included in the
      national stroke-register datasets, and 250 patients from each country in the
      questionnaire-based datasets.

      The questionnaire includes demographic data, the Stroke-Specific Quality of Life (SS-QOL)
      scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), The EuroQol Quality of Life scale
      (EQ-5D), the EuroQol Visual Analogue Scale (EQ-VAS), the Quality of Life After Brain Injury,
      Overall Scale QOLIBRI-OS, modified Rankin Scale (mRS), and additional questions about
      satisfaction on treatment and rehabilitation.

      5-6 patients from each country will be selected for semi-structured interviews with both
      priori questions and exploratory questions.

      The mixing of methods will balance the goals of generality and complex understanding in how
      patients describe their quality of life and rehabilitation-chain.
