    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of MT-3724 in subjects
      with relapsed or refractory B-Cell NHL or relapsed and refractory CLL (Part 1 only) and
      relapsed and refractory DLBCL (Part 2 and Part 3). Part 3 evaluates the efficacy of MT-3724.

      This is a three-part Phase 2 study

      Part 1: (MT-3724 Dose Escalation) Define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of MT-3724
      [Completed]

      Part 2: (MTD Expansion Cohort) Confirm the safety and tolerability of the MTD of MT-3724 in
      the MTD Expansion Cohort.

      Part 3: (Phase 2 MTD Expansion Cohort) Determine the efficacy of MT-3724 as monotherapy in
      subjects with relapsed or refractory DLBCL based on the overall response rate (ORR) by the
      revised Lugano Classification for Lymphoma adjusted according to LYRIC.

      It is anticipated that up to 100 patients will be enrolled in Part 3. Treatment will continue
      for up to six 21 days cycles. If the subject exhibits SD, CR or PR after the end of Cycle 6
      and the investigator determines that the benefit-risk ratio is favorable, then the treatment
      with MT-3724 may be continued after discussion with the sponsor.
