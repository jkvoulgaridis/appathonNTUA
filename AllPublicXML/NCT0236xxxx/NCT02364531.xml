    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to temporally evaluate the impact of abiraterone acetate
      (ZYTIGA) therapy on Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs) and on clinical outcomes in the
      chemotherapy-naive metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) population. Safety
      data, levels of health care resource utilization associated with abiraterone acetate (ZYTIGA)
      therapy will also be prospectively collected and analyzed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-interventional, multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school team
      work on a medical research study), prospective (observation of a population for a sufficient
      number of persons over a sufficient number of years to generate incidence or mortality rates
      subsequent to the selection of the study group), observational (clinical study in which
      participants may receive diagnostic, therapeutic, or other types of interventions, but the
      investigator does not assign participants to specific interventions) study. This
      observational study will focus on chemotherapy-naive metastatic castrate-resistant prostate
      cancer (mCRPC) participants initiating abiraterone acetate (ZYTIGA) therapy for the treatment
      of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic disease. All treatment decisions will be made at the
      discretion of the Investigator per clinical practice and in accordance with approved local
      Product Monograph and treatment algorithms. The planned study duration will be three years
      from initial first participant enrolment. Participants will be followed for a maximum of 72
      weeks from the time of initiation of abiraterone acetate (ZYTIGA) treatment, or up to the
      time of early study withdrawal/termination. Data will be collected in both paper-based and
      electronic data capture (eDC) and primarily collected for PROs and clinical outcomes.
      Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.

    <measure>Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Prostate (FACT-P) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>up to Week 72</time_frame>
    <description>The FACT-P consists of the FACT-General (FACT-G) and a prostate cancer subscale. The FACT-G contains a 27-item questionnaire and is composed of 4 subscales of health-related quality-of-life: physical well-being, social/family well-being, emotional well-being, and functional well-being. Each Item is scored on a scale of 0 (Not at all) to 4 (Very much). All Items on a sub-scale will be averaged to derive the sub-scale score.The prostate cancer subscale is composed of 12 items, related to prostate-specific questions, which include sexuality, bowel/bladder function, and pain. The FACT-P questionnaire has a 7-day recall, and takes approximately 15 minutes to complete. Each Item is scored on a scale of 0 (Not at all) to 4 (Very much). All Items on a sub-scale will be averaged to derive the sub-scale score.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) Scale Score</measure>
    <time_frame>up to Week 72</time_frame>
    <description>The BFI assesses the severity of fatigue and the impact of fatigue on daily functioning. BFI measures the severity of fatigue and the impact of fatigue on daily functioning in the past 24 hours. BFI is a 4 item questionnaire. Each item is assessed on a 11-point scale, ranges from 0 (No Fatigue) to 10 (As bad as you can imagine). Average from all 4 items will be used to derive the final score.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Brief Pain Inventory - Short Form (BPI-SF) Scale Score</measure>
    <time_frame>up to Week 72</time_frame>
    <description>The BPI-SF measures severity of pain, impact of pain on daily function, locations of pain, pain medications, and amount of pain relief in the past 24 hours or the past week. The BPI- SF includes 4 items measuring the intensity of pain which make up the pain intensity subscales, assessed using 11-point numerical rating scales from &quot;0&quot; = no pain to &quot;10&quot; = pain as bad as you can imagine; 7 items that assess how much pain has interfered with 7 daily activities which make up the pain interference subscale, assessed on a scale of 0, &quot;Does not interfere&quot; to 10, &quot;completely interferes.&quot; This subscale is typically scored as the mean of the 7 interference items; An additional item on the extent of pain relief.</description>

    <measure>Current Health Satisfaction in Prostate Cancer (CHS-PCa) Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>up to Week 72</time_frame>
    <description>The CHS-PCa is an exploratory questionnaire that includes 9 questions to assess participant satisfaction with their current status. Each question has 7 response categories corresponding to strongly agree, disagree, somewhat disagree, neither agree nor disagree, somewhat agree, agree and strongly agree.</description>

    <measure>Work Limitations Questionnaire (WLQ) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>up to Week 72</time_frame>
    <description>The WLQ measures the degree to which employed individuals are experiencing limitations on-the-job due to their health problems, and health-related productivity loss. The WLQ items ask respondents to rate their level of difficulty or ability to perform specific job demands. Scale score range from 0 (limited none of the time) to 100 (limited all of the time) and represent the reported amount of time in the prior two weeks respondents were limited on- the-job.</description>
