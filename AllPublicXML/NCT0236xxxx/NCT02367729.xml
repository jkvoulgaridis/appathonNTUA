  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effectiveness of a neurostimulator applied to the outer ear for
      adolescents with functional gastrointestinal disorders. The neurostimulator provides nerve
      stimulation to a branch of the vagus nerve which is thought to be involved in transmission of
      pain signals. Half of the study subjects will receive an active nerve stimulator while the
      other half will receive an inactive one.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The vagus nerve innervates the gastrointestinal tract and influences the autonomic nervous
      system. It is thought to carry signals of discomfort and nausea to the brain where it is
      interpreted. The autonomic nervous system may be in imbalance in patients with functional
      gastrointestinal disorders. By stimulating a branch of the vagus nerve in the outer ear, this
      study aims to improve symptoms and quality of life in adolescents with functional abdominal
      pain with or without nausea.

      Subjects will be randomized into two groups: 1) neurostimulation versus 2) sham. They will
      receive either an active or non-active (sham group) device for 5 days each week x 4 weeks
      total. Pain, nausea, anxiety, quality of life, potential side effects and overall symptom
      improvement will be monitored weekly for the entire study as well as after the study is
      completed.

    <measure>Pain Frequency-Severity-Duration Scale (PFSD) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>One-page, 6-item pain measure assessing pain symptoms over the past week. Measures the typical and worst pain intensity, frequency and duration over the past week in units on a scale from 0 to 10 (10 being the worst pain imaginable). Worst pain = primary outcome.</description>

    <measure>Nausea Profile</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to week 4 in Nausea Profile score.</time_frame>
    <description>Two page, 17-item questionnaire which measures the subjective experience of nausea on a scale from 0 (not at all) to 9 (severely) across three dimensions: 1) somatic distress; 2) gastrointestinal distress and 3) emotional distress. Total score 153.</description>

    <measure>State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children (STAI-C)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline (Pre) to 2-3 months after end of therapy (Post)</time_frame>
    <description>State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children (STAI-C). State anxiety measured by 20-item questionnaire assessing anxiety at a particular moment in time on a 3-point rating scale. Raw scores (range 20-60) were converted to normalized T-Scores based on a population of healthy school children (mean=50; standard deviation=10) with higher score indicating worse outcome. Effects of intervention on state anxiety was assessed before (pre) and after (post) therapy.</description>

    <time_frame>Change from Baseline (Pre) to 2-3 months after end of therapy (Post)</time_frame>
    <description>A 7-item instrument that measures quality of life in relation to health. Each question has five response options (scored 1-5 units on a scale). A total raw sum score is generated, ranging from lowest score of 7 and highest score of 35 with higher scores indicating better outcome (improved quality of life). The raw score is converted to a standardized T-score (mean=50; standard deviation=10) based on a population of healthy children. T-scores were compared before (Pre) and after (Post) treatment intervention.</description>

    <measure>Functional Disability Inventory (FDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline (Pre) to 2-3 months after end of therapy (Post)</time_frame>
    <description>15-item instrument, each question rated on a five-point scale (0=&quot;no trouble&quot; to 4=&quot;impossible&quot;), indicating how much difficulty subjects have doing common childhood activities because of their physical health. A total score is summed (range 0-60) with higher score indicating worse outcome (greater pain-related disability). Scored were compared before (Pre) and after (Post) treatment intervention.</description>
