      This study plans to learn more about transfusion of a human blood component called plasma in
      patients who have liver problems. Patients are asked to be in this study because they have
      liver disease and therefore may require the transfusion of plasma.

      The dose of plasma required to reach certain blood clotting laboratory targets is usually
      determined by clinicians. Due to the complexity of the patient's blood clotting disorder,
      determining the appropriate dose of plasma is very difficult. The investigators have
      developed a dosing table based on information from other patients with liver disease and the
      investigators are testing it to see if it is a more accurate dosing tool then clinician
      chosen dosing of plasma in patients with liver disease who need one or more plasma
      transfusions
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clinicians currently transfuse plasma to International Normalized Ratio (INR) targets without
      an understanding of the dose response characteristics of plasma in bleeding patients with
      liver disease. Epidemiologic studies show that INR is infrequently corrected to target INR
      values after clinician chosen plasma transfusion doses in patients with liver disease. Plasma
      transfusion is frequently given to patients prior to procedures and during active bleeding in
      this patient population though there are no dosing guidelines to aid clinicians in reaching
      INR targets in patients with liver disease. Previous studies suggest that patients with liver
      disease may need more plasma then patients without liver disease to correct any given
      pre-transfusion INR (INR value measured before plasma transfusion) to the same
      post-transfusion INR target (INR value measured after plasma transfusion).

      Current physician dosing of plasma is variable and rarely successful at reaching stated INR
      targets. The INR thresholds, commonly used triggers for plasma transfusion by
      Gastro-Intestinal (GI), Hepatology and critical care physicians at our institution range from
      1.5-3.0 in bleeding or pre-procedural patients with liver disease representing tremendous
      variability. When we evaluated plasma transfusion dosing practices in bleeding patients with
      liver disease over 8 years, we demonstrated that these same physicians rarely met stated
      theoretical targets.

      Over or under dosing plasma in these patients may lead to serious clinical complications.The
      target INR goal was to be within ±0.1 after the first round of FFP transfusion, and was
      selected because underdosing can result in prolonged bleeding, delayed procedure times, and
      more rounds of FFP transfusion. Furthermore, overdosing can result in excess cost, increased
      portal pressures, bleeding, transfusion associated circulatory overload (TACO), and
      transfusion related acute lung injury (TRALI).

    <description>Ability of dosing algorithm to accurately predict necessary plasma dose (ml/kg), required to reach commonly targeted International Normalized Ratio (INR) values, compared to clinician chosen plasma transfusion dose, as determined by dose-response curve.
The primary outcome was achievement of the target INR within ±0.1 after the first round of FFP transfusion. This primary outcome was selected because underdosing can result in prolonged bleeding, delayed procedure times, and more rounds of FFP transfusion. Furthermore, overdosing can result in excess cost, increased portal pressures, bleeding, transfusion associated circulatory overload (TACO), and transfusion related acute lung injury (TRALI).</description>

          <description>APACHE II (Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation II) is a severity-of-disease classification system with a final score of 0 to 71. Higher scores correspond to more severe disease and higher risk of death.
The weighted score uses 12 of the most commonly measured physiologic measures in hospitalized patients: vital signs (heart rate, mean blood pressure, respiratory rate, temperature and Glasgow Coma Score), routine blood test values (hematocrit and white blood cell count, serum potassium, serum sodium, serum creatinine), and arterial blood gas values (serum pH and Pa02).</description>

          <title>MELD Score</title>
          <description>The Model of End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) Score is a validated scoring system to estimate relative disease severity and likely survival of patients awaiting liver transplantation.
Score range is 6 to 40, with higher scores corresponding to more severe disease. Weighted patient laboratory values for serum bilirubin, serum creatinine, and the international normalized ratio (INR) for prothrombin time predict three-month survival. In patients with cirrhosis, an increasing MELD score is associated with increasing severity of hepatic dysfunction and increased three-month mortality risk.</description>

The primary outcome was achievement of the target INR within ±0.1 after the first round of FFP transfusion. This primary outcome was selected because underdosing can result in prolonged bleeding, delayed procedure times, and more rounds of FFP transfusion. Furthermore, overdosing can result in excess cost, increased portal pressures, bleeding, transfusion associated circulatory overload (TACO), and transfusion related acute lung injury (TRALI).</description>

Bleeding patients admitted to study hospitals,with chronic liver disease determined to receive fresh frozen plasma (FFP) for clinical indications as determined by hospital clinician. Total dose determined by physician's judgment (current standard of care). Physician chosen dose will be utilized but physician will be unaware of which dosing strategy utilized.
INR measurement will be performed within 1 hour after entire plasma transfusion administered. No other transfused blood component, crystalloid or colloidal fluid infused between first and second INR studies except plasma</description>

            <description>Intervention arm: Plasma transfusion dose determined using algorithm dosing table based on the pre-transfusion INR and clinician chosen INR target. Bleeding patients admitted to study hospitals with chronic liver disease determined to receive fresh frozen plasma (FFP) for clinical indications as determined by hospital clinician.
Pre-transfusion INR and target post-transfusion INR used to determine FFP dose. The study table determines dose in (ml/kg) of FFP. INR measurement will be performed within 1 hour after entire plasma transfusion administered. No other transfused blood component,crystalloid or colloidal fluid will be infused between the first and second INR studies except plasma.</description>
