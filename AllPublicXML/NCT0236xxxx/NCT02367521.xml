  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is frequently complicated by depression and other problems such
      as post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), sleep disturbance, cognitive deficits and
      behavioral problems. Untreated depression can lead to reduced productivity and poor global
      outcome. There is no Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drug for the treatment of
      TBI-related depression. The overarching goal of this small study is to determine the
      effectiveness of low frequency right (LFR) rTMS for the treatment of post-TBI depression and
      co-occurring psychiatric symptoms. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a
      brain stimulation technique. It involves generating a brief magnetic field in a coil that is
      placed on the scalp. The magnetic field passes through the skull and induces a weak
      electrical current in the brain that briefly activates neural circuits at the stimulation
      site. Adults aged 18 and older, with a history of head injury of mild or moderate severity ,
      who are currently experiencing symptoms of clinical depression may join the study.

    <measure>Ability to Inhibit Cognitive Interference as Assessed by the Stroop Color Word Test (SCWT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Mean at baseline and 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The SCWT is used to assess the ability to inhibit cognitive interference that occurs when the processing of a specific stimulus feature impedes the simultaneous processing of a second stimulus attribute. Participants are required to read three different tables as fast as possible. Two of the tables represent the &quot;congruous condition&quot; in which participants are required to read names of colors printed in black ink and name different color patches. In the third table, &quot;incongruous condition&quot; the color-words are printed in a different color in (ie: the word &quot;red&quot; is printed in green ink). Within this third table, participants are required to name the color of the ink instead of reading the word. The score is based on the number of items completed, which ranges from 0 to 100, with a higher score reflecting a better outcome.</description>

    <time_frame>Mean at baseline and 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The HVLT consists of a 12-item word list, composed of four words from each of the three semantic categories. The subject is instructed to listen carefully as the examiner reads the word list and attempt to memorize the words. The word list is then read to the subject at the approximate rate of one word every 2 seconds. This is done for three trials. After the third learning trial, the patient is read 24 words and is asked to say &quot;yes&quot; after each word that appeared on the recall list (12 targets) and &quot;no&quot; after each word that did not (12 distractors). Half of the distractors are drawn from the same semantic categories as the targets (related distractors) and half are drawn from other categories (unrelated distractors). The number of correctly-recalled words in each trial is recorded (maximum of 12 per trial). The score is the sum of all the correctly-recalled words from each trial, for a maximum of 36. T-scores are reported (average T-score of 50 (ranges 40-60)</description>

          <description>Investigators propose to deliver 1200 pulses daily at 110% Motor threshold for 4 weeks using four trains of 300 pulses daily separated by an intertrain interval of 60 seconds.
Low Frequency Right sided repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (LFR rTMS): LFR rTMS will be delivered at the Brain Stimulation Program at The Johns Hopkins Hospital with a Magstim Super Rapid 2 stimulator with a focal double 70-mm air cooled coil. LFR rTMS will be administered to the Experimental Group.
Control patients will receive treatment using an identically appearing coil that produces the same sound and is the same weight as the active coil, but has negligible magnetic field strength.</description>

        <title>Mean Clinical Global Improvement- Severity/Improvement Scale Score (CGI-I/CGI-S)</title>
        <description>The CGI scale is broken down into the CGI-S and CGI-I components. CGI-S is the baseline severity of mental illness. 1= normal, not at all ill; 2= borderline mentally ill; 3=mildly ill; 4=moderately ill; 5=markedly ill; 6=severely ill; 7=among the most extremely ill patients. The CGI-S is only performed at baseline.
The CGI-I component (which is any measure after intervention) is as follows: 1=very much improved since the initiation of treatment; 2=much improved; 3=minimally improved; 4=no change from baseline (the initiation of treatment); 5=minimally worse; 6= much worse; 7=very much worse since the initiation of treatment.</description>

        <title>Ability to Inhibit Cognitive Interference as Assessed by the Stroop Color Word Test (SCWT)</title>
        <description>The SCWT is used to assess the ability to inhibit cognitive interference that occurs when the processing of a specific stimulus feature impedes the simultaneous processing of a second stimulus attribute. Participants are required to read three different tables as fast as possible. Two of the tables represent the &quot;congruous condition&quot; in which participants are required to read names of colors printed in black ink and name different color patches. In the third table, &quot;incongruous condition&quot; the color-words are printed in a different color in (ie: the word &quot;red&quot; is printed in green ink). Within this third table, participants are required to name the color of the ink instead of reading the word. The score is based on the number of items completed, which ranges from 0 to 100, with a higher score reflecting a better outcome.</description>

The participant tells the tester if he or she wants to change the response and the tester clicks on the screen. The score is the number of errors, ranging from 0-128. A higher score reflects a poorer outcome.</description>

        <title>Immediate Recall as Assessed by Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT)</title>
        <description>The Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT) consists of a 12-item word list, composed of four words from each of the three semantic categories. The subject is instructed to listen carefully as the examiner reads the word list and attempt to memorize the words. The word list is then read to the subject at the approximate rate of one word every 2 seconds. This is done for three trials. The number of correctly-recalled words in each trial is recorded (maximum of 12). The score is a sum of all the correctly-recalled words from each trial, for a maximum score of 36.</description>

Half of the distractors are drawn from the same semantic categories as the targets (related distractors) and half are drawn from other categories (unrelated distractors). The number of correctly-recalled words in each trial is recorded (maximum of 12 per trial). The score is the sum of all the correctly-recalled words from each trial, for a maximum of 36.

        <title>Delayed Recall as Assessed by Brief Visual Memory Test (BVMT)</title>
        <description>BVMT is used to evaluate visuospatial memory abilities in neuropsychological populations. A visual display of six simple figures arranged in a 2 × 3 matrix on an 8 × 11 booklet is shown to participants for three consecutive 10-second trials. After each trial, participants are to draw as many designs as accurately as they can and in the correct location after a 25-minute delay filled with other distractor tasks. Scoring of the delayed recall is based on the accuracy of the drawings and the location of the figures. For each figure, one point is awarded to each satisfactory domain resulting in a maximum of 12-points per trial for a total score range of 0-36, with higher scores indicating a better outcome.</description>

Low Frequency Right sided repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (LFR rTMS): LFR rTMS will be delivered at the Brain Stimulation Program at The Johns Hopkins Hospital with a Magstim Super Rapid 2 stimulator with a focal double 70-mm air cooled coil. LFR rTMS will be administered to the Experimental Group.
Control patients will receive treatment using an identically appearing coil that produces the same sound and is the same weight as the active coil, but has negligible magnetic field strength.</description>

          <title>Delayed Recall as Assessed by Brief Visual Memory Test (BVMT)</title>
          <description>BVMT is used to evaluate visuospatial memory abilities in neuropsychological populations. A visual display of six simple figures arranged in a 2 × 3 matrix on an 8 × 11 booklet is shown to participants for three consecutive 10-second trials. After each trial, participants are to draw as many designs as accurately as they can and in the correct location after a 25-minute delay filled with other distractor tasks. Scoring of the delayed recall is based on the accuracy of the drawings and the location of the figures. For each figure, one point is awarded to each satisfactory domain resulting in a maximum of 12-points per trial for a total score range of 0-36, with higher scores indicating a better outcome.</description>

        <description>The NBRS is a 28-item interview which includes a test of orientation and memory for recent events, questions regarding emotional state, post-concussional symptoms, focused attention, and concentration (performing serial sevens), explanation of proverbs, tasks of planning and mental flexibility, and delayed recall of three objects presented at the beginning of a session. Observations are also made regarding the patient's fatigability, visible signs of anxiety, disinhibition, agitation, hostility, difficulties in expressive and receptive communication, and disturbance of mood. The balance of the items are rated according to the patient's performance on brief tasks and quality of answers to interview questions. Each of the 28 items are scored on a scale of 0 (not severe) to 6 (extremely severe), for a maximum score of 168. A higher score reflects increased severity of neuropsychiatric symptoms.</description>

        <description>MOAS measures four types of aggressive behavior as witnessed in the past week. Each section consists of five items, with the first section regarding verbal aggression, the second section focusing on aggression against property, the third section measuring autoaggression, and the fourth section concerning physical aggression. Participants are asked to check each item that is true over the last week. Items are allocated 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4 point(s), and then all points for each selected item are summed. The maximum total for each section is 10 if all items are selected. Total score ranges from 0-40 with a higher score indicating more aggressive behavior.</description>

          <title>Aggressive Behavior as Assessed by the Modified Overt Aggression Scale (MOAS)</title>
          <description>MOAS measures four types of aggressive behavior as witnessed in the past week. Each section consists of five items, with the first section regarding verbal aggression, the second section focusing on aggression against property, the third section measuring autoaggression, and the fourth section concerning physical aggression. Participants are asked to check each item that is true over the last week. Items are allocated 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4 point(s), and then all points for each selected item are summed. The maximum total for each section is 10 if all items are selected. Total score ranges from 0-40 with a higher score indicating more aggressive behavior.</description>
