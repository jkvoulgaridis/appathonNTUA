      Purpose: Using transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), in Experiment 1 we will
      study whether tACS induces changes in prefrontal alpha oscillatory frequencies in women with
      premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) and whether tACS effects on alpha oscillations varies
      by menstrual cycle phase. A secondary objective is to assess whether there are any changes in
      symptom severity during the menstrual cycle phase in which tACS is delivered relative to
      their baseline symptom levels (determined in a diagnostic feeder study, see below). If
      hypotheses for Experiment 1 are supported, we will proceed with Experiment 2 which is a sham
      (placebo) controlled treatment trial.

      Participants: Women between ages 18-52 with a diagnosis of PMDD confirmed by participation in
      a PMDD diagnostic study (IRB# 05-3000).

      Procedures (methods): Experiment 1: After a re-screening and consent appointment, eligible
      participants will alert the study staff when they begin menstruating. Participants will have
      their first session in either the follicular phase or luteal phase (determined by ovulation
      testing) of their menstrual cycle and the second session in the other cycle phase. The order
      of phase at first testing will be counterbalanced across participants. Each session will
      consist of 40 minutes of tACS with by an EEG recording before and after stimulation.
      Patients' symptoms will be assessed at the end of each session and with the daily mood
      ratings collected throughout the menstrual cycle that coincides with tACS sessions
      (approximately 26 - 32 days).

      Experiment 2: Participants will begin daily ratings and have baseline EEG performed during
      the follicular and luteal phases of their menstrual cycle. Following the luteal phase EEG,
      the patient will receive, in a double blind cross-over fashion, 5 days of tACS, 40
      minutes/session, performed in two successive months. On the first and fifth days of each
      treatment, EEG will be performed. Patients' symptoms will be assessed at the end of each
      session and with the daily mood ratings across the menstrual cycle .

      Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) describes the cyclic appearance of affective symptoms
      and resultant impairment during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. The objective of
      Experiment 1 is first to determine if transcranial alternating current electrical stimulation
      (tACS) will alter prefrontal alpha oscillatory frequencies in women with PMDD, disruption of
      which has been implicated in other mood disorders. A secondary objective is to determine if
      menstrual cycle phase will influence the effects of tACS on alpha oscillations. Demonstration
      of 'target engagement' (alterations in prefrontal alpha oscillatory frequencies with tACS) is
      a necessary first step before moving forward with subsequent research that would test whether
      tACS is a potential treatment for this disorder (Experiment 2) - promising research in other
      mood disorders suggests that it may be.

      The cause of PMDD is unknown, the morbidity substantial, and the identified treatments
      limited in their effectiveness, since 40% of PMDD women are non-responders to SSRIs (Yonkers
      et al. 1997) and many additional women are intolerant of antidepressant induced side effects.
      PMDD is prevalent (6-8% of women of reproductive age), attended by substantial morbidity, and
      hence a significant public health problem. Indeed, by World Health Calculations, PMDD is
      associated with 4.5 million Disability Adjusted Life Years in the US alone (Halbreich et al.
      2003).

      The rationale for testing whether tACS differentially alters target engagement in the
      follicular versus luteal phases of the menstrual cycle is as follows: 1) Role of Hormones:
      While there is little evidence for ovarian dysfunction in PMDD (Rubinow et al. 1988;
      Backstrom et al. 1983), a role for the reproductive hormones is clearly implicated, since our
      own work and that of others has shown that suppression of ovarian function results in a
      complete remission of symptoms in a majority of women with PMDD, while adding back gonadal
      hormones results in the return of symptoms in women with PMDD, with no symptoms seen in
      controls (Schmidt et al. 1998). Both estradiol and progesterone appear capable of
      precipitating mood destabilization in this paradigm. Recently completed studies from our
      group further demonstrate that continuous administration of hormones for longer than one
      month results in a sustained symptom remission subsequent to the initial precipitated
      episode. Thus, dysphoric mood states in PMDD appear to be induced by normal changes in
      gonadal hormones rather than by exposure to elevated hormone levels (i.e., women with PMDD
      are differentially sensitive to the mood dysregulatory effects of reproductive steroids).

      Differential Effects on Cortical Activity: Although there is substantial literature
      demonstrating the effects of reproductive steroids and, by extension, the menstrual cycle on
      cortical activity, the usually described effects are disturbed in women with PMDD. Examples
      include the following: 1) in normal women, activation of the medial orbitofrontal cortex is
      diminished during the luteal phase and the affective valence of the stimulus to which it
      responds is reversed (i.e., it responds only to negative stimuli rather than to positive
      stimuli, as occurs during the follicular phase). These changes are absent in women with PMDD.
      (Protopopescu et al. 2008) 2) in normal women during the luteal phase, there is an increase
      in cortical inhibition - a presumed effect of the GABA receptor activating effects of the
      progesterone metabolite allopregnanolone. This effect is absent in women with PMDD ( Smith et
      al. 2003). Both animal and human data further suggest the role of a disturbed cortical
      response to progesterone-derived neurosteroids in PMDD (Epperson et al 2002; Shen et al
      2007). Thus, sudden changes in the levels of allopregnanolone (as occurs at the start of the
      luteal phase with increasing levels of progesterone) result in subcortical excitability and
      irritability in rodents (Shen et al. 2007), while elimination of changes in
      progesterone-derived neurosteroids (with neurosteroid synthesis inhibition) successfully
      prevents the emergence of the dysphoric state in PMDD.

      Differential Network Activation: Psychiatric disorders characterized by dysregulation of
      affective state -depression and PMDD - are increasingly recognized as are &quot;network disorders&quot;
      in which aberrant electric signaling in large-scale neuronal networks mediates the clinical
      symptoms. Recent studies have documented impaired balance in activation between left and
      right prefrontal cortex in patients with PMDD (Baehr, Rosenfeld et al. 2004; Accortt, Stewart
      et al. 2011; Lin, Tsai et al. 2013). In particular, similar to major depressive disorder
      (Henriques and Davidson 1990), the balance between alpha oscillation power in the left and
      the right hemisphere is shifted towards the left in patients with PMDD. The presence of alpha
      oscillations corresponds to a relative decrease in neuronal activity (inverse relationship).
      Therefore, such a left-shifted alpha asymmetry is indicative of hypoactivation of the left
      hemisphere - a common finding in imaging studies of patients with MDD ( Grimm, Beck et al.
      2008). Since this asymmetry is exacerbated during the luteal but not the follicular phase
      (corresponding to the time course of symptom presentation in PMDD, (Baehr, Rosenfeld et al.
      2004; Lin, Tsai et al. 2013)), we hypothesize that normalization of alpha oscillations across
      the hemispheres would reduce symptom presentation in patients with PMDD. This network level
      intervention can be accomplished with brain stimulation by application of weak electric
      currents, a non-invasive approach to modulating intrinsic cortical network dynamics. The
      advantage of this approach is twofold: it is non-pharmacologic and thus avoids the otherwise
      attendant side effects; and it will provide systems level insights into the pathophysiology
      underlying mood state dysregulation.

      Brain stimulation by constant electric currents applied to the scalp (tDCs) modulates
      neuronal excitability in humans (Wagner, Valero-Cabre et al. 2007; Zaghi, Acar et al. 2010;
      Stagg and Nitsche 2011). Transcranial current stimulation with sine-wave stimulation
      waveforms (transcranial alternating current stimulation, tACS) likely enhances cortical
      oscillations in a frequency specific manner. The mechanisms of weak electric fields generated
      by tDCS and tACS previously have been demonstrated to interact with cortical network activity
      by altering the temporal activity structure of electric signaling in cortex (Frohlich and
      McCormick 2010; Ali, Sellers et al. 2013). In this study, we will assess whether tACS will
      enhance bilateral alpha synchronization (8-12 Hz) and whether this varies by menstrual cycle
      phase. A secondary objective will be to examine the severity of the PMDD symptoms collected
      daily during the stimulation cycle and compare that severity with baseline symptoms ratings
      collected during the PMDD diagnostic study from which these participants will be recruited.
      The rationale for this stimulation is the known deficits in the overall structure of cortical
      activity in this frequency band in patients with mood disorders ( Henriques and Davidson
      1990; Baehr, Rosenfeld et al. 2004; Bruder, Sedoruk et al. 2008; Accortt, Stewart et al.
      2011; Lin, Tsai et al. 2013)and the previously demonstrate clinical benefits of tDCS in the
      treatment of mood disorders (Berlim, Van den Eynde et al. 2013; Brunoni, Valiengo et al.
      2013). In this study, we will use more targeted stimulation waveforms by employing bilateral
      tACS instead of tDCS. We hypothesize that this choice of a more sophisticated waveform that
      directly enhances synchronization between the two hemispheres may be more effective in
      engaging the target. tDCS modulates overall activity levels of the targeted cortical area in
      a non-specific manner. Here, however, we propose to evaluate a more specific stimulation
      modality, tACS, (10 Hz stimulation frequency) that has been shown to selectively enhance
      cortical alpha rhythms (Neuling et al 2013). Since the targeted patient population exhibits
      specific deficits in the alpha frequency band, our stimulation approach will provide a more
      targeted and therefore possibly a more effective manipulation.

      Please note that we have several ongoing and completed IRB-approved studies (12-0022,
      12-1607, 13-2995, 13-3385) that employ tDCS and/or tACS, including a clinical trial
      registered at clinicaltrials.gov (#NCT01963676).
