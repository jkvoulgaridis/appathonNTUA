      The purpose of the Feasibility study is to characterize the safety of the Valiant Mona LSA
      Thoracic Stent Graft System, including an assessment of the safety and effectiveness of the
      device acutely and at the 30 day visit in the identified subject population. This study will
      also evaluate the current instructions for use and may direct changes to the delivery and
      deployment steps.

      The purpose of the expansion to the Feasibility Study is to characterize the Valiant Mona LSA
      Thoracic Stent Graft System, in particular to assess the safety and effectiveness of the
      device acutely and at the 30 day visit, in subjects enrolled with chronic, Type B
      dissections.
