    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the objective response rate (complete response [CR]+
      partial response [PR]) of the selected dose regimen in participants with metastatic or
      surgically unresectable urothelial cancers that harbor specific FGFR genomic alterations.

      This is a multicenter, open-label study (participants will know the identity of study drugs
      administered) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of erdafitinib in participants with
      urothelial cancer. The study comprises a 30-days Screening Phase, a Treatment Phase comprised
      of 28-day treatment cycles that will continue until disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity occurs, and a post-treatment Follow-up Phase that will extend from the
      End-of-Treatment Visit until the participant has died, withdraws consent, is lost to
      follow-up, or the end of the study, whichever comes first. The end of study is defined as the
      date when all participants have completed the study treatment or 12 months after last
      participant is enrolled, whichever is later. Safety will be monitored throughout the study.

    <description>The objective response rate is defined as the percentage of participants with measurable lesions achieving a Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) based on Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Version 1.1(RECIST v1.1) criteria. Per RECIST v1.1) for target lesions and assessed by MRI or CT: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 30 percent (%) decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR.</description>

    <description>Progression-free survival is defined as the duration from the date of the first dose of study drug until the date of first documented evidence of progressive disease (or relapse for participants who experience a complete response during the study) or death, whichever comes first.</description>

    <measure>Duration of Response</measure>
    <time_frame>From the date of the first dose of study drug until disease progression or death as assessed up to the last efficacy assessment for disease progression (up to 5 years)</time_frame>
    <description>The duration of response (CR or PR) is defined as the earliest date a participant achieved a complete response (CR) or a partial response (PR), calculated from the date of initial documentation of a response to the date of first documented evidence of progressive disease (or relapse for participants who experience CR during the study) or death.</description>

    <measure>Overall survival</measure>
    <time_frame>From the date of the first dose of study drug until death (up to 5 years)</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival is defined as the time interval in days between the date of the first dose of study drug and the participant's death from any cause. If the participant is alive or the vital status is unknown, the participant's data will be censored at the date the participant was last known to be alive.</description>

    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant participating in a clinical study that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the pharmaceutical/biological agent under study. An SAE is any AE that results in: death, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, is life-threatening experience, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect and may jeopardize participant and/or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.</description>

             cancer. Minor components of variant histology such as glandular or squamous
             differentiation, or evolution to more aggressive phenotypes such as sarcomatoid or
             micropapillary change are acceptable

          -  Must have measurable disease according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
             Tumors (RECIST, version 1.1) at baseline

          -  Must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score 0, 1,

             considered to have received chemotherapy in the metastatic setting. These participants
             will be referred to as chemo-refractory participants. (Participants who have shown
             disease progression according to RECIST, version 1.1 following prior treatment with
             anti-Programmed death-ligand 1 (anti PDL1/PD1) antibodies are also eligible)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Received chemotherapy, targeted therapies, definitive radiotherapy, or treatment with

          -  Has a history of or current uncontrolled cardiovascular disease

          -  Females who are pregnant, breast-feeding, or planning to become pregnant within 3

          -  Has not recovered from reversible toxicity of prior anticancer therapy (except
