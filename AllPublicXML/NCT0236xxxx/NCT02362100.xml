      The primary objective is to determine if a difference exists in functional outcomes, as
      measured by the Constant score, when comparing nonoperative management and locking plate
      surgical fixation of low-energy displaced proximal humerus fractures in the elderly
      population over a 2-year follow-up period. Secondary outcomes will include an assessment of
      the ASES score, the SF-36 quality of life score, complication rates, re-operation rates,
      radiographic time to union, radiographic malunion, hardware position and evidence of
      avascular necrosis or posttraumatic osteoarthritis .

      The design of this study is two-fold. The main study will be a prospective, single blind,
      randomized controlled trial (RCT). Patients will be randomized to either (1) non-operative
      treatment or (2) locking plate open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF).

      The second component of this study will be a prospective, cohort study. This option will be
      presented to patients who do not want to enroll in the RCT because they prefer one treatment
      option over the other, and do not wish to be randomized to a treatment. Patients who choose
      either non-operative treatment or ORIF for their proximal humerus fracture will be followed
      for 2 years post injury.

      Study Objectives:

      Objective 1: Does a difference exist in the functional outcome between non-operative
      management and locking plate surgical fixation of low-energy displaced two-part, three-part,
      and four-part proximal humerus fractures in the elderly population based on the Constant
      functional outcome score over a 2-year follow-up period? Objective 2: Does a difference exist
      between non-operative management and locking plate surgical fixation of low-energy displaced
      two-part, three-part, and four-part proximal humerus fractures in the elderly population
      based on the ASES functional outcome score, the short form Patient Reported Outcomes
      Measurement Information System (PROMIS) upper extremity score, the International Physical
      Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) for the elderly, and the EuroQol EQ-5D-5L Health Questionnaire
      Quality of Life (QoL) functional outcome score over a 2-year follow-up period? What is the
      incidence of complications of non-operative management and locking plate surgical fixation of
      low-energy displaced two-part, three-part, and four-part proximal humerus fractures in the
      elderly population based on infection, nerve injury, intra-articular screw penetration and
      bleeding (hematoma), reoperation rate, or hospital readmission over a 2-year follow-up
      period? Objective 3: Does a difference exist between non-operative management and locking
      plate surgical fixation of low-energy displaced two-part, three-part, and four-part proximal
      humerus fractures in the elderly population based on radiographic outcomes including
      non-union, malunion, and joint arthrosis? Objective 4: Does the degree of initial
      displacement or angulation of the fracture fragments correlate with final functional outcome
      measures? Objective 5: Does the quality of the surgical reduction correlate with final
      functional outcome measures?

    <description>The Constant Score reflects an overall clinical functional assessment. This instrument is based on a 100-point scoring system. Subjective findings (pain, activities of daily living, and working in different positions) make up a total of 35 points. Objective measurements make up the remaining 65 points.The test is divided into four sub-categories: (1) pain is measured using 4 likert levels (15 points maximum), where a higher score indicates a better outcome; activities of daily living are measured using a likert scale, where a higher number indicates better outcomes (20 points maximum); mobility is measured by an assessor, and rated using a likert scale where a higher score indicates better outcomes (40 points maximum); finally, strength is measured by an assessor where 1 point is given per 0.5kg of force (maximum 25 points), a higher score indicates better outcomes. All categories are added together, and a total score out of 100 is given (higher score indicates better outcome).</description>

    <measure>Change in American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Standardized Shoulder Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to up until 24-Months Post-Operative</time_frame>
    <description>The ASES is a shoulder specific assessment divided into two sections: pain and activities of daily living (ADL). Pain is recorded on a visual analogue scale (0-10), lower scores indicate better outcomes. There are 10 activities of daily living questions, each are recorded on a 4 level likert scale (0-3), which a higher score indicates a better outcome. The overall score is an equal weight of the two sections and produces a score out of 100. The higher the score, the better the outcome.</description>

    <description>The Short Form 36 (SF-36) is an outcome measure used to determine quality of life. This measure has 8 scaled scores, each question has equal weight and is then translated onto a scale graded from 0-100. A higher number indicates a better outcome.</description>

After 6 weeks: Active mobilization and removal of sling. Light activity permitted and physiotherapy for range of motion permitted as tolerated.
After 6 months: no further restriction will be placed. Full home and work activity permitted.</description>
