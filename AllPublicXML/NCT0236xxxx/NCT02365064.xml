    <textblock>
      The study will determine which of two different types of positive airway pressure (PAP
      therapy) modes are more effective in reducing sleep breathing events in chronic insomnia
      patients and in decreasing insomnia severity.

      Patients presenting to the sleep clinic with a primary complaint of insomnia will be
      potential participants for this study. Following diagnostic polysomnography (PSG) testing,
      insomnia patients diagnosed with SDB and meeting inclusion criteria will be randomized to a
      PAP treatment arm, CPAP or ASV. Participants will complete titration studies with their
      assigned PAP mode and attend clinical follow-up appointments over a 14-16 week timeframe.
      Titration PSG studies will assess PAP pressure needs to ensure that patients are receiving
      optimal therapy at all times during this study. PAP adaptation barriers will be addressed as
      they arise during the study, because it is important that participants are able to use PAP
      therapy nightly during participation in this protocol. Baseline scores on insomnia severity,
      sleep quality, subjective insomnia parameters, sleep related impairment, and quality of life
      will be compared to outcome measures at the 4 month mark. Pre-treatment and post-treatment
      objective improvements on sleep studies will also be compared including sleep breathing
      indices, sleep consolidation indices, and objective data download information.
