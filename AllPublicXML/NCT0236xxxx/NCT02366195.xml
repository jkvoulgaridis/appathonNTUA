    <textblock>
      The study is a phase 2, multi centered, single arm study designed to evaluate the correlation
      between cluster of differentiation 8-positive (CD8+) cell density and objective response rate
      in adults with unresected stage IIIB to IVM1c melanoma. This study will also evaluate the
      safety and tolerability profile of talimogene laherparepvec.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will explore the hypothesis that intratumoral CD8+ cell density at baseline
      correlates with objective response rate in subjects with unresected stage IIIB to IVMIc
      melanoma treated with talimogene laherparepvec

    <measure>Correlation Between Baseline Intratumoral CD8+ Cell Density and Objective Response Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Intratumoral CD8+ cell density was assessed at Baseline. Response was assessed every 12 weeks until disease progression beyond 6 months of treatment or the start of new anticancer therapy; median time on follow-up was 59 weeks (range 3 - 116 weeks).</time_frame>
    <description>A univariate logistic regression model was performed to evaluate baseline log2(CD8+ cell density) as a predictor of objective response.
Response was assessed according to the modified version of the World Health Organization (WHO) response criteria. Objective response rate (ORR) was defined as the percentage of participants with a complete response or partial response according to the modified WHO criteria.
The unadjusted odds ratio of log2(baseline intratumoral CD8+ cell density) for objective response rate is reported.</description>

    <description>A univariate logistic regression model was performed to evaluate baseline log2(CD8+ cell density) as a predictor of durable response.
Response was assessed according to the modified version of the World Health Organization (WHO) response criteria. Durable response rate (DRR) was defined as the percentage of participants with an objective response lasting continuously for 6 months and starting any time within 12 months of initiating therapy.

    <time_frame>Intratumoral CD8+ cell density was assessed at Baseline. Response was assessed every 12 weeks until disease progression beyond 6 months of treatment or the start of new anticancer therapy; median time on follow-up was 59 weeks (range 3 - 116 weeks).</time_frame>
    <description>A Cox proportional hazards regression model was performed to evaluate baseline log2(CD8+ cell density) as a predictor of duration of response.

    <description>Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) was estimated to assess the relationship between baseline log2(CD8+ cell density) and the maximum decrease in measurable tumor burden.
Tumor burden is the sum of the products of the 2 largest perpendicular diameters (SPD) for all index lesions selected at baseline.

    <description>A univariate logistic regression model was performed to evaluate change from baseline to week 6 in log2(CD8+ cell density) in uninjected tumors as a predictor of objective response.

    <description>Objective Response rate is defined as the percentage of participants with either a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on Modified WHO Response Criteria.
CR: Complete disappearance of all index lesions, all non-index lesions, and any new tumors which might have appeared. Any residual cutaneous or subcutaneous index lesions must be documented by representative biopsy to not contain viable tumor.

There is no end date for eligibility to submit a data sharing request for this study.</ipd_time_frame>
    <ipd_access_criteria>Qualified researchers may submit a request containing the research objectives, the Amgen product(s) and Amgen study/studies in scope, endpoints/outcomes of interest, statistical analysis plan, data requirements, publication plan, and qualifications of the researcher(s). In general, Amgen does not grant external requests for individual patient data for the purpose of re-evaluating safety and efficacy issues already addressed in the product labelling. Requests are reviewed by a committee of internal advisors, and if not approved, may be further arbitrated by a Data Sharing Independent Review Panel. Upon approval, information necessary to address the research question will be provided under the terms of a data sharing agreement. This may include anonymized individual patient data and/or available supporting documents, containing fragments of analysis code where provided in analysis specifications.

      <recruitment_details>This study was conducted at 36 centers across 12 countries in Europe. The first participant was enrolled on 07 April 2015.
Results are reported as of the primary analysis cut-off date of 26 June 2017, conducted once all participants had the opportunity to complete 12 months of study treatment.</recruitment_details>

          <title>Talimogene Laherparepvec</title>
          <description>Talimogene laherparepvec was administered by intralesional injection into injectable cutaneous, subcutaneous, and nodal lesions at an initial dose of 10⁶ plaque-forming units (PFU) per mL on day 1 followed by a dose of 10⁸ PFU/mL 21 days after the initial dose and every 14 days thereafter. Participants were treated with talimogene laherparepvec until they achieved a complete response, all injectable tumors had disappeared, clinically significant (resulting in clinical deterioration or requiring change of therapy) disease progression beyond 6 months of treatment, per modified World Health Organization (WHO) response criteria, or intolerance of study treatment, whichever occurred first.</description>

        <title>Duration of Response</title>
        <description>Duration of response (DOR) was defined as the longest individual period from entering an objective response (CR/PR) to the first documented evidence of the participant no longer meeting the criteria for objective response (i.e. an overall response of either stable disease [SD] as compared with baseline or progressive disease [PD]).
SD: Neither sufficient tumor shrinkage of index lesion to qualify for response (PR or CR) nor sufficient tumor increase of index lesion to qualify for PD, with no increase in size of non-index lesions.
PD: A &gt; 25% increase in the sum of the SPD of all index tumors since baseline, or the unequivocal appearance of a new tumor since the last response assessment time point, or unequivocal progression of one or more non-index lesions.
Participants last reported to be either a CR or PR were censored at that time point.</description>
        <time_frame>Response was assessed every 12 weeks until PD beyond 6 months of treatment or the start of new anticancer therapy; median time on follow-up at the time of the data cut-off date (26 June 2017) was 59 weeks (range 3 to 116 weeks).</time_frame>

            <description>Talimogene laherparepvec was administered by intralesional injection into injectable cutaneous, subcutaneous, and nodal lesions at an initial dose of 10⁶ plaque-forming units (PFU) per mL on day 1 followed by a dose of 10⁸ PFU/mL 21 days after the initial dose and every 14 days thereafter. Participants were treated with talimogene laherparepvec until they achieved a complete response, all injectable tumors had disappeared, clinically significant (resulting in clinical deterioration or requiring change of therapy) disease progression beyond 6 months of treatment, per modified World Health Organization (WHO) response criteria, or intolerance of study treatment, whichever occurred first.</description>

    <certain_agreements>
      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>The Clinical Trial Agreement generally does not restrict an investigator's discussion of trial results after completion. The Agreement permits Amgen a limited period of time to review material discussing trial results (typically up to 45 days and possible extension). Amgen may remove confidential information, but authors have final control and approval of publication content. For multicenter studies, the investigator agrees not to publish any results before the first multi-center publication.</restrictive_agreement>
