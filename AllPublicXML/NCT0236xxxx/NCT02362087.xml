    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to document what course of action physicians choose for their
      patients when they develop taxane acute pain syndrome (TAPS) and to identify patients at the
      greatest risk of TAPS by examining specific human genome markers such as single nucleotide
      polymorphisms (SNPs) and Copy Number Variations (CNVs) that may explain the genetic
      (hereditary) component.

          -  Age ≥18 years

          -  ECOG performance status ≤2

          -  Scheduled to receive intravenous taxane-based chemotherapy for either adjuvant or
             metastatic disease

          -  Participants need to have ability to complete questionnaires by themselves or with

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Concurrent use of any agents to try to prevent or treat neuropathy or TAPS, including
             gabapentin, glutamine, vitamin B6, and vitamin E.

          -  Pre-existing history of peripheral neuropathy greater than grade 1 NCI CTCAE version
             4.0 from any cause (chemotherapy, diabetes, alcohol, toxin, hereditary, etc.) other
             medical conditions that would make study participation unreasonably hazardous
