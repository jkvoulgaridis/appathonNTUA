  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS)
      can reduce pain perception associated with the effects of receiving definitive radiation
      therapy or chemoradiotherapy in head and neck cancer (HNCa) patients.

      The goal of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of tDCS as a novel pain relief
      modality for odynophagia due to mucositis in patients with locally advanced head and neck
      cancer undergoing definitive radiation therapy or chemoradiotherapy. Participants will be
      randomized into one of two arms: (1) Treatment: radiation/chemoradiotherapy standard of care
      + tDCS neuromodulation or (2) Control: radiation/chemoradiotherapy standard of care only.

      Patients in the treatment arm will undergo tDCS stimulation on the day of their
      radiation/chemoradiotherapy appointments, prior to receiving treatment when doing tDCS
      session in clinic or after to receiving treatment when doing tDCS session at home. This will
      occur daily (5 days per week) during the second and third weeks of therapy, three times per
      week during the fourth and fifth weeks, and twice per week during the sixth and seventh
      weeks.

      Patients will also have EEG and fNIRS recordings during the study. This will occur at the
      pre-study visit, the first stimulation appointment, the third week, the 7th week, and during
      the follow-up appointments (one-week and one-month).

    <description>tDCS is a method of non-invasive brain stimulation that is based on the application of a weak direct current to the head that flows between two relatively large electrodesâ€”anode and cathode. tDCS offers a unique analgesic modality of central pain neuromodulation by altering the activity of key sensory and motor cortical structures. Participants in this arm will undergo 20 tDCS sessions, tDCS in clinic and remotely supervised tDCS, and 2mA of transcranial direct current stimulation will be applied for 20 minutes.</description>

    <description>tDCS is a non-invasive brain neuromodulatory method that involves sending a weak electrical current to the brain. 2mA of tDCS will be applied for 20 minutes at each session and participants will undergo a total of 20 sessions over a 7-week period.</description>
