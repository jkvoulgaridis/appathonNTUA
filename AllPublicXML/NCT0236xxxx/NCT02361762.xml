  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the project is to better understand executive control—how children manage complex
      or conflicting information in the service of a goal. This skill has been linked to social and
      academic functioning in typically developing children. Executive control is often reduced in
      children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but it has not been a focus of treatment. This
      project will have the goal of determining whether computer-training tasks developed to
      enhance the executive control skills of preschoolers and school-aged children without autism
      are appropriate for children with ASD. The investigators do not yet know if this training is
      beneficial for children with ASD. In addition, because executive control has been found to
      relate to social knowledge and problem solving, the investigators will collect information
      with this type of task to measure possible effects of training.

      Participation will include two phone calls to determine if the study is a good fit and
      collect some preliminary information, five visits to Boston Children's Hospital (3 before
      training and 2 about 6-8 weeks later), caregiver questionnaires, and an optional teacher
      questionnaire packet. The visits will include activities designed to assess verbal and
      nonverbal thinking ability; social skills and general interests; and specific tasks related
      to cognitive and social problem solving. In addition, EEG measurement of brain function will
      be made. EEG is a non-invasive recording of brain activity. Children will be randomly
      assigned (i.e., like flipping a coin) to receive training or to a non-training group. The
      training group will complete tasks designed to improve executive control presented over the
      course of 5-10 1-hour sessions. All tasks are game-like and are presented on a computer with
      child friendly graphics. A staff member will work with each child as he/she completes the
      training activities. Children assigned to the non-training group will be invited to
      participate in training at the end of the study if it is shown to improve executive control.

    <measure>Change Task - Inhibition Function</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Pre Training/Waitlist Phase) and at 11-12 Weeks (Post Training/Waitlist Phase)</time_frame>
    <description>Conflict Processing-Behavior (Post-testing controlling for Baseline) Children indicate the location of a picture by pressing the left and right arrow buttons for 75% of the trials (i.e., the dominant task).
For the remaining 25% of trials, a stop signal appears and a Change response (i.e., space bar) was required. Stop signals occurred equally at 50, 200, 350, and 500 ms before the anticipated response based on the child's reaction time.
The inhibition function estimates the latency of inhibitory responding without adjusting for the reaction time during dominant task. Lower scores indicate more rapid inhibition.</description>

    <measure>Stroop Task (Difference in Percentage of Correct Responses for Congruent Minus Incongruent Trials)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Pre Training/Waitlist Phase) and at 11-12 Weeks (Post Training/Waitlist Phase)</time_frame>
    <description>Conflict Processing-Behavior (Post-testing controlling for Baseline) Trials were presented in three conditions: (1) congruent trials (25%); (2) incongruent trials (25%); and (3) neutral trials (50%). The difference between percent correct for congruent and incongruent conditions was the dependent variable, such that larger differences indicated more difficulty with conflicting information. Lower scores at Post-testing indicate improved ability to suppress interfering/conflicting information.</description>

    <measure>Event-related Potentials Assessed During Child Attention Network Flanker Task</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Pre Training/Waitlist Phase) and at 11-12 Weeks (Post Training/Waitlist Phase)</time_frame>
    <description>Conflict Processing-Event Related Potential (ERP) Brain Response (N2 mean amplitude) Data were compared for congruent and incongruent conditions at each time point (baseline and post testing).
Each trial of the task began with a beep for 150ms paired with a fixation cross for 450ms at the center of the screen. Then, a target and flankers were presented for 2000ms. Congruent trials (50%) consisted of a central target animal flanked by two animals on each side with the same orientation and size as the target. Incongruent trials (50%) were identical except that the target and flankers faced opposite directions. Children pressed a button indicating the direction the target animal faced (50% left, 50% right) and received visual and auditory feedback upon responding.</description>

    <measure>BRIEF Parent Survey (Global Executive Composite)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Pre Training/Waitlist Phase) and at 11-12 Weeks (Post Training/Waitlist Phase)</time_frame>
    <description>Executive Control at home/school-Generalization (Post-testing controlling for Baseline) Global Executive Composite (GEC) scores are available for parents. The GEC is comprised of two sub-scales: Metacognition and Behavioral Regulation.
T-scores are reported for the GEC (range = 30-100). Higher scores reflect more difficulty with executive function. At Post, lower scores represent a better outcome.
Note: Teacher BRIEF was originally planned as an outcome measure, but due to low teacher response (10 teachers provided data for each group at both time points) the results were not analyzed.</description>

    <measure>TOM Test (Theory of Mind Test)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Pre Training/Waitlist Phase) and at 11-12 Weeks (Post Training/Waitlist Phase)</time_frame>
    <description>Theory of Mind Behavior (Post-testing controlling for Baseline). A measure of generalization. Overall percent correct across the three sub-scales (i.e., percent correct calculated across all items of Level 1-Precursors, Level 2-First Order False Belief, and Level 3-Advanced) is reported. The percent correct ranges from 0-100% correct. Higher scores represent better theory of mind (affective and first/second order false belief).</description>

    <measure>Social Skills Improvement System-Parent (SSIS) - Social Standard Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Pre Training/Waitlist Phase) and at 11-12 Weeks (Post Training/Waitlist Phase)</time_frame>
    <description>Social function home (Post-testing controlling for Baseline). A measure of generalization. Scores were available from parents. The SSIS Social Scale organizes prosocial behaviors into seven areas or subscales: Communication, Cooperation, Assertion, Responsibility, Empathy, Engagement, and Self-Control. Scores range from 40-160. Higher scores reflect more prosocial skills (i.e., better social ability). At Post, higher scores represent a better outcome.
Note: Teacher SSIS was originally planned as an outcome measure, but due to low teacher response the results were not analyzed.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (Pre Training/Waitlist Phase) and at 11-12 Weeks (Post Training/Waitlist Phase)</time_frame>
    <description>Conflict Processing (Reward) Behavior (Post-testing controlling for Baseline). Children selected from four doors with varying reward and loss ratios. Two doors have lower rewards but an overall net gain (safe) and two doors have higher rewards but an overall net loss (risky). Scores represent the ratio of safe to risky selections in the final two blocks (of five total blocks administered).</description>

    <measure>Event-related Potentials Assessed During Cued Go/Nogo Task</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Pre Training/Waitlist Phase) and at 11-12 Weeks (Post Training/Waitlist Phase)</time_frame>
    <description>Conflict Processing-ERP Brain Response (N2 mean amplitude) Data were compared for Go and Nogo conditions at each time point (baseline and post testing).
The task included 200 test trials. During 'go' trials (70% of trials), children were instructed to press a single button on a keypad each time a letter appeared on the screen. During 'nogo' trials (30% of trials), children were instructed to withhold their response when a specific letter appeared on the screen. To account for the confound of frequency with condition, two letters were used for go trials - an infrequent go (30% of trials) and a frequent go (40% of trials). Go responses were analyzed only for the infrequent go trials. Each trial was preceded by a fixation cross presented on the screen for 500 ms. Test trials were then presented for 700 ms. Only ERPs for correct trials that followed a correct 'go' response were analyzed in order to ensure consistent motor response on the previous trial.</description>

        <description>Conflict Processing-Behavior (Post-testing controlling for Baseline) Children indicate the location of a picture by pressing the left and right arrow buttons for 75% of the trials (i.e., the dominant task).
For the remaining 25% of trials, a stop signal appears and a Change response (i.e., space bar) was required. Stop signals occurred equally at 50, 200, 350, and 500 ms before the anticipated response based on the child's reaction time.
The inhibition function estimates the latency of inhibitory responding without adjusting for the reaction time during dominant task. Lower scores indicate more rapid inhibition.</description>

Computerized executive control training: Children will play computerized training games designed to improve executive control skills. Each training activity is structured to achieve a particular type of training related to executive control and/or attention shifting.
Sessions last for 1 hour each and the intensity of intervention ranges from 5-10 hours. Children will receive training until all levels of all tasks have been passed or 10 hours, whichever happens first. All training exercises have a number of levels, and children progress to the next level by meeting specific criteria for accuracy and/or speed.
A trainer will be present during all sessions to help children comply with the training demands and to teach skills involved in completing challenging tasks.</description>

        <description>Conflict Processing-Event Related Potential (ERP) Brain Response (N2 mean amplitude) Data were compared for congruent and incongruent conditions at each time point (baseline and post testing).
Each trial of the task began with a beep for 150ms paired with a fixation cross for 450ms at the center of the screen. Then, a target and flankers were presented for 2000ms. Congruent trials (50%) consisted of a central target animal flanked by two animals on each side with the same orientation and size as the target. Incongruent trials (50%) were identical except that the target and flankers faced opposite directions. Children pressed a button indicating the direction the target animal faced (50% left, 50% right) and received visual and auditory feedback upon responding.</description>

          <title>Event-related Potentials Assessed During Child Attention Network Flanker Task</title>
          <description>Conflict Processing-Event Related Potential (ERP) Brain Response (N2 mean amplitude) Data were compared for congruent and incongruent conditions at each time point (baseline and post testing).
Each trial of the task began with a beep for 150ms paired with a fixation cross for 450ms at the center of the screen. Then, a target and flankers were presented for 2000ms. Congruent trials (50%) consisted of a central target animal flanked by two animals on each side with the same orientation and size as the target. Incongruent trials (50%) were identical except that the target and flankers faced opposite directions. Children pressed a button indicating the direction the target animal faced (50% left, 50% right) and received visual and auditory feedback upon responding.</description>

Computerized executive control training: Children will play computerized training games designed to improve executive control skills. Each training activity is structured to achieve a particular type of training related to executive control and/or attention shifting.
Sessions last for 1 hour each and the intensity of intervention ranges from 5-10 hours. Children will receive training until all levels of all tasks have been passed or 10 hours, whichever happens first. All training exercises have a number of levels, and children progress to the next level by meeting specific criteria for accuracy and/or speed.
A trainer will be present during all sessions to help children comply with the training demands and to teach skills involved in completing challenging tasks.</description>

        <description>Conflict Processing-ERP Brain Response (N2 mean amplitude) Data were compared for Go and Nogo conditions at each time point (baseline and post testing).
The task included 200 test trials. During 'go' trials (70% of trials), children were instructed to press a single button on a keypad each time a letter appeared on the screen. During 'nogo' trials (30% of trials), children were instructed to withhold their response when a specific letter appeared on the screen. To account for the confound of frequency with condition, two letters were used for go trials - an infrequent go (30% of trials) and a frequent go (40% of trials). Go responses were analyzed only for the infrequent go trials. Each trial was preceded by a fixation cross presented on the screen for 500 ms. Test trials were then presented for 700 ms. Only ERPs for correct trials that followed a correct 'go' response were analyzed in order to ensure consistent motor response on the previous trial.</description>

Computerized executive control training: Children will play computerized training games designed to improve executive control skills. Each training activity is structured to achieve a particular type of training related to executive control and/or attention shifting.
Sessions last for 1 hour each and the intensity of intervention ranges from 5-10 hours. Children will receive training until all levels of all tasks have been passed or 10 hours, whichever happens first. All training exercises have a number of levels, and children progress to the next level by meeting specific criteria for accuracy and/or speed.
A trainer will be present during all sessions to help children comply with the training demands and to teach skills involved in completing challenging tasks.</description>
