  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized Phase III, multicenter, open-label study designed to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of atezolizumab (an engineered anti-programmed death-ligand 1 [PD-L1] antibody) in
      combination with carboplatin+nab-paclitaxel compared with treatment with
      carboplatin+nab-paclitaxel in chemotherapy-naive participants with Stage IV non-squamous
      NSCLC. Participants will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to Arm A
      (Atezolizumab+Nab-Paclitaxel+Carboplatin) or Arm B (Nab-Paclitaxel+Carboplatin).
