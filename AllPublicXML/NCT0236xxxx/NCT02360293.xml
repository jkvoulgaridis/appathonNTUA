    <textblock>
      This project is Project three of a four project Prevention Coaching Lab CREATE grant entitled
      &quot;Transforming Prevention into Action&quot; aimed at effectively engaging patients and their
      families to improve their health and medical care.

      This project will test the feasibility and effectiveness of the prevention focused, internet
      mediated healthy lifestyle Stay Strong program tailored to the needs, preferences and
      demographics of OEF/OIF/OND Veterans.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Veterans from Afghanistan and Iraq (OEF/OIF/OND) are at high risk for becoming overweight and
      obese. However, existing VA programs are not designed for younger Veterans who are
      comfortable with technology-mediated interventions, may not yet have developed
      obesity-related illnesses, and contain a relatively high percentage of women compared to
      previous Veteran cohorts. Technology-mediated lifestyle interventions that include
      continuous, objective home monitoring of physical activity, automated internet mediated
      feedback, and e-coaching increase physical activity and improve weight loss in non-Veteran
      populations. When delivered on a large scale, such interventions represent low cost but
      effective alternatives to face-to-face lifestyle change interventions that can be implemented
      widely in the VA health care system. Thus, this project will test the feasibility and
      effectiveness of the prevention focused, internet-mediated healthy lifestyle physical
      activity program, Stay Strong w/coaching, tailored to the needs, preferences and demographics
      of OEF/OIF/OND Veterans. Specifically, Stay Strong w/coaching relies on use of a wearable
      device, the Fitbit Charge 2, and incorporates coaching support, tailored messages, and
      personalized physical activity goals. Stay Strong w/coaching will be compared to the use of
      the Fitbit Charge 2 with standard online support (Stay Strong).

      <recruitment_details>Letters were mailed to potential participants. They used the information in the recruitment letter to accessed an online portal and respond to screening question. If eligible, they completed the consent documentation, baseline questionnaire, downloaded and registered the Stay Strong App. Recruitment period was from 10/1/2017 - 4/30/2018.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>After consent and prior to randomization participants were to completed baseline survey, register app, and complete a baseline physical activity (PA) period for randomization. 56 participants were excluded due to failure to complete baseline survey or register app. 52 participants were excluded due to failure to provide baseline PA.</pre_assignment_details>

Stay Strong w/coaching: Pts randomly placed in the Stay Strong w/coaching group receive an app-mediated physical activity intervention. Pts are asked to wear a physical activity monitoring device and weigh regularly using a Bluetooth scale while participating in the study. Pts will be asked to upload the device data at least weekly and will receive tailored push notifications. Each week the pt will receive a new automatically calculated personalized physical activity goal. Stay Strong coaches will call pts up to 3 times in the first 6-8 weeks of the study to help pts meet physical activity goals including problem solving support. Pts will also be reminded to follow-up with their healthcare provider as needed for the remainder of the 12-month program.</description>

Stay Strong w/coaching: Pts randomly placed in the Stay Strong w/coaching group receive an app-mediated physical activity intervention. Pts are asked to wear a physical activity monitoring device and weigh regularly using a Bluetooth scale while participating in the study. Pts will be asked to upload the device data at least weekly and will receive tailored push notifications. Each week the pt will receive a new automatically calculated personalized physical activity goal. Stay Strong coaches will call pts up to 3 times in the first 6-8 weeks of the study to help pts meet physical activity goals including problem solving support. Pts will also be reminded to follow-up with their healthcare provider as needed for the remainder of the 12-month program.</description>
