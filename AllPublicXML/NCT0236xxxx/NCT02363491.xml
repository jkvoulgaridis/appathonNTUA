  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The dose-confirming part of this study, comprising at least 10 patients is designed as a
      single center, prospective, single arm, open label in patients who have failed or are
      unresponsive to Azacitidine (AZA) or Decitabine (they may also have additionally failed an
      Erythropoiesis Stimulating Agent (ESA) followed by a dose expansion part with at least 44
      patients; the objective of the whole study being to assess the safety, efficacy,
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of intravenously infused multiple doses of OPN-305 in
      low and intermediate-1 risk myelodysplastic syndrome (second and third line Lower risk MDS).
