  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase III trial compares memantine hydrochloride and whole-brain radiotherapy
      with or without hippocampal avoidance in reducing neurocognitive decline in patients with
      cancer that has spread from the primary site (place where it started) to the brain. Whole
      brain radiotherapy (WBRT) is the most common treatment for brain metastasis. Unfortunately,
      the majority of patients with brain metastases experience cognitive (such as learning and
      memory) deterioration after WBRT. Memantine hydrochloride may enhance cognitive function by
      binding to and inhibiting channels of receptors located in the central nervous system.
      Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Using
      radiation techniques, such as intensity modulated radiotherapy to avoid the hippocampal
      region during WBRT, may reduce the radiation dose to the hippocampus and help limit the
      radiation-induced cognitive decline. It is not yet known whether giving memantine
      hydrochloride and WBRT with or without hippocampal avoidance works better in reducing
      neurocognitive decline in patients with brain metastases.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine whether the addition of whole-brain radiotherapy with hippocampal avoidance
      (HA-WBRT) increases time to neurocognitive failure at months 2, 4, 6, and 12 as measured by
      neurocognitive decline on a battery of tests: the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised
      (HVLT-R) for Total Recall, Delayed Recall, and Delayed Recognition, Controlled Oral Word
      Association (COWA), and the Trail Making Test (TMT) Parts A and B.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine whether the addition of HA-WBRT preserves neurocognitive function at months 2,
      4, 6, and 12 as separately measured by each test, the HVLT-R for Total Recall, Delayed
      Recall, and Delayed Recognition; COWA; and TMT Parts A and B.

      II. Evaluate the potential benefit of HA-WBRT in symptom burden, as measured by the M. D.
      Anderson Symptom Inventory-Brain Tumor Module (MDASI-BT).

      III. Assessment of quality adjusted survival and cost analysis using the five-level version
      of the EuroQol five-dimensional (EQ-5D-5L).

      IV. Compare cumulative incidence of progression and overall survival after WBRT versus
      HA-WBRT.

      V. Compare adverse events between the treatment arms according to the Common Terminology
      Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v)4.0 criteria.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Collect serum, plasma, and imaging studies for future translational research analyses.

      II. Evaluate magnetic resonance (MR) imaging biomarkers of white matter injury and
      hippocampal volumetry at baseline and 6 months as potential predictors of neurocognitive
      decline and differential benefit from HA-WBRT as compared to WBRT.

      III. Association of symptom burden and anxiety/depression with neurocognitive function.

      IV. Evaluate the potential correlation between the prognostic scoring systems Radiation
      Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) and the
      diagnosis-specific graded prognostic assessment (DS-GPA) and neurocognitive function at
      baseline and overtime.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 12 months.

    <description>Neurocognitive failure is defined as the first failure, defined as a neurocognitive decline using the reliable change index (RCI) on at least one of the following assessments or parts of : Hopkins Verbal Learning Test - Revised (HVLT-R), Trail Making Test (TMT), or Controlled Oral Word Association (COWA). The HVLT-R has 3 parts that were analyzed separately for decline: Total Recall, Delayed Recall, and Delayed Recognition. The TMT has 2 parts that were analyzed separately: Part A and Part B. Neurocognitive failure rate is estimated using the cumulative incidence method. Analysis was planned to occur after 233 events were reported. The protocol specifies that the distributions of failure times be compared between the arms, which is reported in the statistical analysis results. Six-month rates are provided.Analysis was planned to occur after 233 events were reported.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test -Revised (HVLT-R) Total Recall Score (Neurocognitive Decline)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 2, 4, 6, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The HVLT-R assesses verbal learning and memory. The test involves memorizing a list of 12 nouns for 3 consecutive trials (Total Recall), recalling the 12 targets after a 20-minute delay (Delayed Recall), and then identifying the 12 targets from a list of semantically related or unrelated items (delayed recognition). Raw scores are derived for total recall (sum of the number of targets correctly recalled), delayed recall (sum of the number of targets correctly recalled), and a delayed recognition discrimination index (sum of targets incorrectly identified subtracted from the sum of the number of targets correctly identified). The range of scores for total recall is 0 to 36, for delayed recall is 0 to 12, and -12 to 12 for recognition. A higher score indicates better functioning. Scores are standardized, adjusting for age, education, and gender as necessary, such that mean 0 and standard deviation is 1. Change is calculated as baseline score subtracted from post-baseline score.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 2, 4, 6, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The TMT is a neuropsychological test of visual attention and task switching that can provide information about visual search speed, scanning, speed of processing, mental flexibility, and executive functioning. Subject is instructed to connect a set of 25 dots as quickly as possible while still maintaining accuracy. There are two parts to the test: in the first (Part A), the targets are all numbers (1, 2, 3, etc.) and the test taker needs to connect them in sequential order; in the second part (Part B), the subject alternates between numbers and letters (1, A, 2, B, etc.). The score is the amount of time, in seconds, that it takes the patient to complete each maze. The range for Part A is 0 to 180 (3 minutes) and for Part B is 0 to 300 (5 minutes). Lower scores indicate better functioning. Scores are standardized, adjusting for age, education, gender as needed, so that mean is 0 and standard deviation is 1.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  PRIOR TO STEP 1 REGISTRATION:

               -  Brain metastases outside a 5-mm margin around either hippocampus must be visible
                  on contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed =&lt; 21 days prior
                  to Step 1 registration; an allowed exception, regarding ability to image brain
                  metastases, would be that patients who had undergone radiosurgery or surgical
                  resection and are planning adjuvant WBRT do not have to have visible disease but
                  do need a pre-surgery MRI or computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrating brain
                  metastases; however, the brain metastases could not have been within 5 mm of
                  either hippocampus

               -  Patients must have a gadolinium contrast-enhanced three-dimensional spoiled
                  gradient (SPGR), magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo (MP-RAGE), or turbo
                  field echo (TFE) axial MRI scan with standard axial and coronal gadolinium
                  contrast-enhanced T1-weighted sequence and axial T2/FLAIR sequence acquisitions;
                  to yield acceptable image quality, the gadolinium contrast-enhanced
                  three-dimensional SPGR, MP-RAGE, or TFE axial MRI scan should use the smallest
                  possible axial slice thickness not exceeding 1.5 mm; the associated coronal and
                  sagittal contrast-enhanced T1 sequences can be up to 2.5 mm in slice thickness;
                  this MRI must be obtained =&lt; 21 days prior to step 1 registration; the vendor
                  specific MRI protocols are available for download from the Alzheimer's Disease
                  Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)

               -  Patients must provide study-specific informed consent prior to registration

          -  PRIOR TO STEP 2 REGISTRATION:

                  2 registration: HVLT-R, TMT, and COWA;

               -  Pathologically (histologically or cytologically) proven diagnosis of solid tumor
                  malignancy within 5 years prior to Step 2 registration

               -  History and physical examination within 28 days prior to Step 2 registration

               -  Karnofsky performance status of &gt;= 70 within 28 days prior to Step 2 registration

               -  Serum creatinine =&lt; 3 mg/dL (265 umol/L) and creatinine clearance &gt;= 30 ml/min

               -  Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) within institutional upper limit of normal (e.g. &lt; 20
                  mg/dL)

               -  Total bilirubin =&lt; 2.5 mg/dL (43 umol/L)

               -  Patients may have had prior therapy for brain metastasis, including radiosurgery
                  and surgical resection; patients must have completed prior therapy by at least 14
                  days prior to Step 2 for surgical resection and 7 days for radiosurgery

               -  Negative serum pregnancy test (in women of childbearing potential) =&lt; 14 days

(This study only includes the first two classes.) Class I = Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) ≥ 70, primary controlled, age &lt; 65, metastasis in brain only. Class II = KPS ≥ 70 and 1 of the following: primary uncontrolled; primary controlled, age ≥ 65; primary controlled, age &lt; 65, metastases in brain &amp; other sites.</description>

        <title>Time to Neurocognitive Failure</title>
        <description>Neurocognitive failure is defined as the first failure, defined as a neurocognitive decline using the reliable change index (RCI) on at least one of the following assessments or parts of : Hopkins Verbal Learning Test - Revised (HVLT-R), Trail Making Test (TMT), or Controlled Oral Word Association (COWA). The HVLT-R has 3 parts that were analyzed separately for decline: Total Recall, Delayed Recall, and Delayed Recognition. The TMT has 2 parts that were analyzed separately: Part A and Part B. Neurocognitive failure rate is estimated using the cumulative incidence method. Analysis was planned to occur after 233 events were reported. The protocol specifies that the distributions of failure times be compared between the arms, which is reported in the statistical analysis results. Six-month rates are provided.Analysis was planned to occur after 233 events were reported.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test -Revised (HVLT-R) Total Recall Score (Neurocognitive Decline)</title>
        <description>The HVLT-R assesses verbal learning and memory. The test involves memorizing a list of 12 nouns for 3 consecutive trials (Total Recall), recalling the 12 targets after a 20-minute delay (Delayed Recall), and then identifying the 12 targets from a list of semantically related or unrelated items (delayed recognition). Raw scores are derived for total recall (sum of the number of targets correctly recalled), delayed recall (sum of the number of targets correctly recalled), and a delayed recognition discrimination index (sum of targets incorrectly identified subtracted from the sum of the number of targets correctly identified). The range of scores for total recall is 0 to 36, for delayed recall is 0 to 12, and -12 to 12 for recognition. A higher score indicates better functioning. Scores are standardized, adjusting for age, education, and gender as necessary, such that mean 0 and standard deviation is 1. Change is calculated as baseline score subtracted from post-baseline score.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test -Revised (HVLT-R) Delayed Recall Score (Neurocognitive Decline)</title>
        <description>The HVLT-R assesses verbal learning and memory. The test involves memorizing a list of 12 nouns for 3 consecutive trials (Total Recall), recalling the 12 targets after a 20-minute delay (Delayed Recall), and then identifying the 12 targets from a list of semantically related or unrelated items (delayed recognition). Raw scores are derived for total recall (sum of the number of targets correctly recalled), delayed recall (sum of the number of targets correctly recalled), and a delayed recognition discrimination index (sum of targets incorrectly identified subtracted from the sum of the number of targets correctly identified). The range of scores for total recall is 0 to 36, for delayed recall is 0 to 12, and -12 to 12 for recognition. A higher score indicates better functioning. Scores are standardized, adjusting for age, education, and gender as necessary, such that mean 0 and standard deviation is 1. Change is calculated as baseline score subtracted from post-baseline score.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test -Revised (HVLT-R) Delayed Recognition (Neurocognitive Decline)</title>
          <description>The HVLT-R assesses verbal learning and memory. The test involves memorizing a list of 12 nouns for 3 consecutive trials (Total Recall), recalling the 12 targets after a 20-minute delay (Delayed Recall), and then identifying the 12 targets from a list of semantically related or unrelated items (delayed recognition). Raw scores are derived for total recall (sum of the number of targets correctly recalled), delayed recall (sum of the number of targets correctly recalled), and a delayed recognition discrimination index (sum of targets incorrectly identified subtracted from the sum of the number of targets correctly identified). The range of scores for total recall is 0 to 36, for delayed recall is 0 to 12, and -12 to 12 for recognition. A higher score indicates better functioning. Scores are standardized by expressing the deviation from the mean score of the group in units of standard deviation. Change is calculated as baseline score subtracted from post-baseline score.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Trail Making Test (TMT) Part A (Neurocognitive Decline)</title>
        <description>The TMT is a neuropsychological test of visual attention and task switching that can provide information about visual search speed, scanning, speed of processing, mental flexibility, and executive functioning. Subject is instructed to connect a set of 25 dots as quickly as possible while still maintaining accuracy. There are two parts to the test: in the first (Part A), the targets are all numbers (1, 2, 3, etc.) and the test taker needs to connect them in sequential order; in the second part (Part B), the subject alternates between numbers and letters (1, A, 2, B, etc.). The score is the amount of time, in seconds, that it takes the patient to complete each maze. The range for Part A is 0 to 180 (3 minutes) and for Part B is 0 to 300 (5 minutes). Lower scores indicate better functioning. Scores are standardized, adjusting for age, education, gender as needed, so that mean is 0 and standard deviation is 1. Change is calculated as baseline score subtracted from post-baseline score.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Trail Making Test (TMT) Part B (Neurocognitive Decline)</title>
        <description>The TMT is a neuropsychological test of visual attention and task switching that can provide information about visual search speed, scanning, speed of processing, mental flexibility, and executive functioning. Subject is instructed to connect a set of 25 dots as quickly as possible while still maintaining accuracy. There are two parts to the test: in the first (Part A), the targets are all numbers (1, 2, 3, etc.) and the test taker needs to connect them in sequential order; in the second part (Part B), the subject alternates between numbers and letters (1, A, 2, B, etc.). The score is the amount of time, in seconds, that it takes the patient to complete each maze. The range for Part A is 0 to 180 (3 minutes) and for Part B is 0 to 300 (5 minutes). A lower score indicates better functioning. Scores are standardized by expressing the deviation from the mean score of the group in units of standard deviation. Change is calculated as baseline score subtracted from post-baseline score.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Controlled Oral Word Association (COWA) Test (Neurocognitive Decline)</title>
        <description>The COWA is a verbal fluency test that measures spontaneous production of words belonging to the same category or beginning with some designated letter. Patients are given 1 minute to name as many words as possible beginning with the designated letter. The procedure is then repeated for the remaining two letters. Two alternate forms of the COWA are employed to minimize practice effects. The score is the sum of the correct responses with a range of 0 to infinity. A higher score indicates better functioning. Scores are standardized, adjusting for age, education, and gender as necessary, such that mean is 0 and standard deviation is 1. Change is calculated as baseline score subtracted from post-baseline score.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Clinical Trial Battery Composite (CTB COMP) Score [Neurocognitive Decline]</title>
        <description>Clinical Trial Battery Composite score is the arithmetic mean of the HVLT-R (Free Recall, Delayed Recall, Delayed Recognition), TMTA, TMTB, and COWA scores, all of which are standardized, adjusting for age, education, and gender as necessary, such that mean is 0 and standard deviation is 1. A participant must have at least 5 of the 6 scores. A higher composite score indicates better neurocognitive function.Change is calculated as baseline score subtracted from post-baseline score.</description>

        <title>Change in M. D. Anderson Symptom Inventory Brain Tumor (MDASI-BT) Neurologic Factor Score</title>
        <description>The MD Anderson Symptom Inventory for brain tumor (MDASI-BT) is a 28-item multi-symptom patient-reported outcome measure assessing the severity of symptoms experienced by cancer patients and the interference with daily living caused by these symptoms, with 9 items specific to brain tumors. Each item ranges from 0 (best condition) to 10 (worst condition). A subscale score (Neurologic Factor) is the average of the subscale items, given that a specified minimum numbers of items were completed.</description>

First part is 5 items (mobility, self care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression) each with 5 problem levels (1-none to 5-extreme). The 5-item index score is transformed into a utility score between 0 (worst health state) and 1 (best health state). The 2nd part is a visual analogue scale (VAS) valuing current health state, measured on a 20-cm scale ranging from 0 for the worst imaginable health state to 100 for best imaginable health state, marked at 10-point intervals. The index score is reported here.</description>

        <title>Change in EQ-5D-5L Index Score at 6 Months</title>
        <description>The EQ-5D-5L is a 2-part self-assessment questionnaire. First part is 5 items (mobility, self care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression) each with 5 problem levels (1-none to 5-extreme). The 5-item index score is transformed into a utility score between 0 (worst health state) and 1 (best health state). The 2nd part is a visual analogue scale (VAS) valuing current health state, measured on a 20-cm scale ranging from 0 for the worst imaginable health state to 100 for best imaginable health state, marked at 10-point intervals. The index score is reported here.</description>

        <title>Change in EQ-5D-5L VAS Score at 12 Months</title>
        <description>The EQ-5D-5L is a 2-part self-assessment questionnaire. First part is 5 items (mobility, self care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression) each with 5 problem levels (1-none to 5-extreme). The 5-item index score is transformed into a utility score between 0 (worst health state) and 1 (best health state). The 2nd part is a visual analogue scale (VAS) valuing current health state, measured on a 20-cm scale ranging from 0 for the worst imaginable health state to 100 for best imaginable health state, marked at 10-point intervals. The VAS score is reported here.</description>

Intracranial progression-free survival rates are estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Patients last known to be alive are censored at the date of last contact. Analysis was planned to occur after 233 primary endpoint events (neurocognitive failure) were reported. The protocol specifies that the distributions of failure times be compared between the arms, which is reported in the statistical analysis results. Six-month rates are provided.</description>

        <description>Evaluated through MRI scans using physician-contoured and auto-contoured scores. Concordance rates will be assessed using Kappa statistics. The auto-contoured scores will be used for the remaining analyses due to the number of physicians reviewing the scans. White matter injury is measured by FLAIR volume change and is a continuous variable. Hippocampal volume is measured as a continuous variable also and both will be covariates considered in the Cox proportional hazards model to assess the impact on time to neurocognitive failure and the longitudinal modeling of neurocognitive function.</description>
