    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate oral doses of BMS-754807 in combination with
      letrozole or BMS-754807 alone are safe and efficacious in locally advanced or metastatic
      hormone receptor positive breast cancer subjects who have progressed with prior non-steroidal
      aromatase inhibitor treatment.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression Free Survival Rate at 24 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks after initiation of study treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Progression free survival (PFS) rate at 24 weeks after treatment with BMS 754807/letrozole was to be calculated as the total number of subjects neither progressed nor died after 24 weeks of treatment divided by the total number of subjects (with measurable or non-measurable disease) randomized/assigned to combination treatment arm and treated. In participants with measurable disease Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) criteria was to be used to assess disease progression.This outcome was not measured due to early termination of the study.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Objective Response Rate (ORR) in Participants With Measurable Disease</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks after initiation of study treatment</time_frame>
    <description>ORR is defined as the number of participants with best overall response (OR) of confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) divided by the number of participants who received treatment.
Participants were to be evaluated for tumor response per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) for target lesions.: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), &gt;=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR. This outcome measure was not met due to early termination of the study</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs), Serious AEs, Non-serious AEs , Discontinuation Due to AEs and Deaths</measure>
    <time_frame>Non-SAEs: Day 1 to 7 days after the participant discontinues study medication or 7 days after the End of Treatment visit (up to 42 months), For SAEs: during the screening period and within 30 days of discontinuation of dosing ,up to 42 months</time_frame>
    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a pre-existing medical condition in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered an investigational (medicinal) product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response (DOR) in Participants With Measurable Disease</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks after initiation of study treatment</time_frame>
    <description>DOR was to be performed to further characterize the response rate at Week 24. Duration of response is defined as the time between the Week 25 date of response and the date of objectively documented disease progression as defined by modified RECIST 1.1 criteria or death, whichever occurs first. DOR could not be assessed due to early termination of the study.</description>

    <measure>Number of On-study Laboratory Abnormalities: Grade 1-2</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed from day 1 up to within 30 days of last dose (Approximately 42 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Blood and urine samples were obtained at specified times points for laboratory evaluations. Clinical Laboratory Sage Panels included: Hematology: Hemoglobin, Hematocrit, Red blood cell, Total leukocyte count, including differential, Platelet count. Serum Chemistry : Albumin, Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), Alkaline phosphatase (ALK-P), Bilirubin, total (TB). Reflex testing of direct (conjugated) and indirect (unconjugated) bilirubin will be ordered if total bilirubin &gt; 5X ULN, Blood urea nitrogen (BUN or urea), Calcium, Chloride, Cholesterol, Creatinine, serum, Glucose, fasting plasma, Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), Magnesium, Phosphorus, Potassium, Protein, total, Sodium, Triglycerides, Uric acid Urinalysis, Blood, Glucose, Ketones, Leukocyte esterase, pH, Protein. Laboratory tests were graded using the National Cancer Institute-Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.0 criteria</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment Failure Rate (TFR)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks after initiation of study treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The TFR was to be calculated as the total number of subjects who discontinued the treatment for any reason (including disease progression, treatment toxicity, and death) at 24 weeks divided by the total number of subjects randomized/assigned to the arm and treated. In the monotherapy arm, the TFR was to be assessed while subjects were on monotherapy.</description>

    <measure>Changes in Absolute Copy Numbers and Relative Expression of Insulin Receptor Isoform A (IR-A) in Tumor Tissue in Response to Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks after initiation of study</time_frame>
    <description>Absolute copy numbers and relative expression of insulin receptor isoforms (IR-A, IR-B) in pre- and posttreatment fresh tumor tissues were to be measured. This outcome was not measured due to early termination of the study.</description>
