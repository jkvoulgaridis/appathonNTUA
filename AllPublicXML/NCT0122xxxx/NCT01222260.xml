    <textblock>
      The study is being done to see if the combination of bendamustine and dexamethasone will help
      people with amyloidosis that has returned after standard treatment, and to to estimate the
      partial hematologic response rate (PHR).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Systemic light-chain amyloidosis (AL) is a protein conformation disorder due to a clonal
      plasma cell dyscrasia. There are no established and approved second-line therapies for
      patients with systemic AL amyloidosis who fail initial melphalan-based treatment, be it
      high-dose melphalan with stem cell transplant or oral melphalan and dexamethasone (MDex).
      Therefore new treatments are needed for those who fail initial therapy and for those who
      initially respond but subsequently relapse.

      Therapy of AL is generally based on treatment regimens used in multiple myeloma (MM).
      Bendamustine achieves partial response with relapsed/refractory MM. Based on this high
      anti-MM activity, we anticipate that bendamustine will also be very active in clonal plasma
      cell disorder associated with AL.

    <description>Only patients who have received at least 2 cycles of therapy are eligible for response assessment. The proportion of patients with PHR two months post-treatment will be estimated, with a 95% exact binomial confidence interval. Partial response is defined as the reduction of the difference between involved and uninvolved free light chains (dFLC) of ≥ 50% OR a reduction of ≥ 50% of the M-protein if M-spike is ≥ 0.5 g/dL.</description>

Overall hematologic response rate as defined by normalization of the free light chain levels and ratio, negative serum and urine immunofixation OR reduction in the difference between involved and uninvolved free light chains (dFLC) to &lt;4 mg/dL.</description>

    <measure>Organ Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of response-evaluable patients experiencing ORR will be estimated, with a 95% exact binomial confidence interval. Amyloid-related organ response will be evaluated on the basis of the accepted criteria described: Kidneys: 30% reduction or drop below 0.5 g in 24-hour urine protein excretion in the absence of progressive renal insufficiency. Heart: N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) or B-type natriuretic peptide response (&gt;30% and &gt;300 ng/L decrease in patients with baseline NT-proBNP ≥ 650 ng/L or New York Heart Association (NYHA) class response (≥ 2 class decrease in subjects with baseline NYHA class 3 or 4). Liver: 50% decrease of an initially elevated alkaline phosphatase level or reduction in the size of the liver by at least 2 cm. Neuropathy: improvement supported by clinical history, neurologic exam, orthostatic vital signs, resolution of severe constipation or reduction of diarrhea to less than 50% of previous movements/day.</description>

    <measure>Median Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Survival is assessed as time to death from first day of treatment The OS function for response-evaluable will be estimated using the product-limit (Kaplan-Meier) estimator, along with 95% confidence bounds. The median survival will be estimated from the survival function. The analysis will be repeated on all patients who receive any therapy.</description>
