  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a Phase 1, open-label, single-center study of CS-1008, an immunoglobulin G subclass
      1 (IgG1) humanized monoclonal antibody, in subjects with advanced colorectal carcinoma who
      had received ≥ 1 prior chemotherapy regimen for metastatic disease. Primary study objectives
      were to determine the influence of the CS-1008 dose on the biodistribution, pharmacokinetics
      (PK) and tumor uptake of radiolabeled CS-1008 following a single infusion and following
      continuous sequential doses of CS-1008. Secondary objectives were to evaluate changes in
      tumor metabolism, antitumor response, and changes in serum apoptosis biomarkers and tumor
      response markers following treatment with CS-1008.

      Eligible subjects were to be enrolled into one of 5 dose-escalation cohorts to receive
      CS-1008 administered weekly as an intravenous (IV) infusion over 30 ± 10 minutes. Each cohort
      initially comprised 2 subjects but was expanded in up to 5 subjects if additional
      biodistribution and/or PK data were required.

      The initial infusion of CS-1008 on Day 1 was trace labeled with Indium-111 (111^In-CS-1008;
      5-7 mCi) and was investigated at escalating doses up to the standard loading dose, as
      follows: Cohort 1 (0.2 mg/kg), Cohort 2 (1 mg/kg), Cohort 3 (2 mg/kg), Cohort 4 (4 mg/kg),
      and Cohort 5 (6 mg/kg). The initial 111^In-CS-1008 dose was followed by gamma camera imaging
      with blood sampling over a 10-day period to evaluate biodistribution, tumor uptake, PK, and
      serum biomarkers. Day 8 dosing comprised non-labeled CS-1008 at doses of 6 mg/kg in Cohorts
      1-3, 4 mg/kg in Cohort 4, and 2 mg/kg in Cohort 5. Subsequent weekly infusions of standard
      dose CS-1008 (2 mg/kg) were administered on Days 15, 22, 29, 36, and 43. The Day 36 infusion
      of CS-1008 was also trace labeled with 111^In (5-7 mCi), with subsequent gamma camera imaging
      and blood sampling.

      Subjects were assessed for disease status using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
      Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1, serum tumor biomarkers (carcinoembryonic antigen [CEA]), and
      human-anti-CS-1008-antibody development (HAHA). Subjects were assessed for changes in tumor
      metabolism following CS-1008 administration using computed tomography (CT) or
      fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18^F-FDG PET) scans.

      Cycle 1 encompassed the first 7 weeks of therapy. Within 1 week (Days 44-50) after the last
      infusion of CS-1008, subjects completed an End of Study/End of Cycle 1 assessment. Subjects
      with stable disease or better (according to RECIST version 1.1) at the Day 44-50 reassessment
      were permitted to receive additional 4-week cycles of CS-1008 (2 mg/kg) until disease
      progression, unacceptable toxicity, or subject/physician decision.

    <description>Tumor localization was assessed using gamma camera imaging performed after the initial infusion of 111^In-CS-1008 on Day 1 and then on Days 2, 4/5, 7/8, and 11/12 (collectively, &quot;After Day 1 Infusion&quot; in the table) and after the second infusion of 111^In-CS-1008 on Day 36 and then on Days 37, 39/40, and 42/43 (collectively, &quot;After Day 36 Infusion&quot; in the table). Dosimetry calculations were performed to determine the tumor localization properties of 111^In-CS-1008. Calculation of whole body dose and doses to individual organs by 111^In-CS-1008 were performed based on conjugate view images obtained from quantitative whole body images obtained at multiple time points. MIRD formalism was used in the calculation of doses.</description>

    <description>Tumor responses were evaluated using appropriate imaging and categorized according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), Version 1.1, at Screening, at the end of every odd-numbered cycle (i.e., Cycles 1, 3, and 5, as applicable), and at the time of treatment discontinuation. Per RECIST 1.1, target lesions are categorized as follows: Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR): ≥ 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Progressive Disease (PD): ≥ 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Stable Disease (SD): small changes that do not meet above criteria (Eisenhauer et al.

For each FDG-PET performed, the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) corrected for body weight for all target lesions &gt;2 cm identified on CT imaging was calculated using region of interest (ROI). The ROI was determined with the aid of the anatomical detail provided by the CT scan. Tumor metabolic response to CS-1008 was assessed by 18^F-FDG PET/CT calculated using the target lesion with the greatest baseline SUVmax, and was categorized according to the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) guidelines (Young et al.

        <title>Number of Subjects With Tumor Uptake of 111^In-CS-1008 in Target Lesions Based on Gamma Camera Imaging Following the Day 1 and Day 36 Infusions</title>
        <description>Tumor localization was assessed using gamma camera imaging performed after the initial infusion of 111^In-CS-1008 on Day 1 and then on Days 2, 4/5, 7/8, and 11/12 (collectively, &quot;After Day 1 Infusion&quot; in the table) and after the second infusion of 111^In-CS-1008 on Day 36 and then on Days 37, 39/40, and 42/43 (collectively, &quot;After Day 36 Infusion&quot; in the table). Dosimetry calculations were performed to determine the tumor localization properties of 111^In-CS-1008. Calculation of whole body dose and doses to individual organs by 111^In-CS-1008 were performed based on conjugate view images obtained from quantitative whole body images obtained at multiple time points. MIRD formalism was used in the calculation of doses.</description>

          <description>Tumor localization was assessed using gamma camera imaging performed on Days 7/8 and 42/43. Dosimetry calculations were performed to determine the tumor localization properties of 111^In-CS-1008. Calculation of whole body dose and doses to individual organs by 111^In-CS-1008 were performed based on conjugate view images obtained from quantitative whole body images obtained at multiple time points. MIRD formalism was used in the calculation of doses.</description>

        <description>Metabolic response to CS-1008 was assessed by fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18^F-FDG PET) at Screening, Day 15, and at the End of Cycle 1/End of Study visit (Days 44-50). For each FDG-PET performed, the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) corrected for body weight for all target lesions &gt;2 cm identified on CT imaging was calculated using region of interest (ROI). The ROI was determined with the aid of the anatomical detail provided by the CT scan. Tumor metabolic response to CS-1008 was assessed by 18^F-FDG PET/CT calculated using the target lesion with the greatest baseline SUVmax, and was categorized according to the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) guidelines (Young et al.

      <time_frame>All adverse events (AEs) occurring between the signing of informed consent and the off-study date were documented, regardless of the causal relationship to study drug. AEs that occurred or worsened in severity after the first dose of study treatment were considered treatment emergent (i.e., TEAEs). The AE reporting period for this study was up to 7 months.</time_frame>
      <desc>AE documentation included onset/resolution dates, severity using the NCI CTCAE (version 4.0), relationship to study drug, seriousness, study drug intervention, treatment, and outcome. In summaries, preferred terms were counted only once per subject at the maximum reported grade.</desc>
