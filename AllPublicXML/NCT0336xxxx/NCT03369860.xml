  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ability to interact with conspecifics is crucial in life, yet there is no consensus on
      the underlying cognitive and neural mechanisms beyond those associated with imitative
      behaviors. This project aims to define a coherent model of non-imitative (complementary)
      motor interactions. The investigators hypothesize that these might be substantially based on
      the ability to integrate one's own and a partner's action within a unitary, dual- person
      (dyadic), motor plan that incorporates a shared goal.

      With a novel &quot;minimally-joint&quot; paradigm the investigators will test this hypothesis and
      measure with behavioral measures (i.e., reaction times) whether the supposedly automatic
      tendency to imitate others is modulated by the need to coordinate with a partner to achieve a
      shared goal.

      This paradigm will be also applied during a functional MRI experiment to describe the
      underlying neurophysiological patterns; using dynamic causal modeling the investigators will
      measure how the brain regions relevant for dyadic motor control are functionally linked.

      This converging experimental strategy will permit to compare competing psychological and
      neural models of motor interactions in healthy participants, opening new experimental avenues
      for studies in adult neuropsychological patients and in children with typical and atypical
      social development.
