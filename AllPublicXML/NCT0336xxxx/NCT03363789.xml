  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of ultrasound guided brisement,
      brisement without ultrasound guidance and standard conservative treatment in patients who
      have been diagnosed with Achilles tendinosis. We are asking you to take part in this research
      study because you are a patient of the Brigham Foot and Ankle Clinic who has been diagnosed
      with Achilles tendinosis. About 100 people will take part in this research study, all at
      Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH).

      To our knowledge, there has been very little research in the efficacy of the addition of
      briesment injections to standard, conservative treatment of Achilles tendinosis. We hope our
      results will show which method is the most effective conservative treatment for Achilles
      tendinosis. This information will help doctors make decisions in the future.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients enrolled in the study must have a diagnosis of Achilles tendinosis with
             at least 2 weeks of pain at the distal Achilles tendon which is typically worsened
             with activity. Only cases of non-insertional Achilles tendinosis (tendinosis occurring
             above the point of tendon insertion) will be included.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a prior Achilles tendon tear, chronic inflammatory disease, or history
             of posterior calf surgery will be excluded from the study. Additionally, patients with
             prior injuries or fractures to the ankle and hind foot (talus and calcaneus) requiring
             surgery will be excluded.
