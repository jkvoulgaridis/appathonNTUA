  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to assess the feasibility of pembrolizumab (study drug) combined
      with standard radiation to the tumor (tumor boost) before patients undergo standard treatment
      that can consist of one or more of the following: breast-conserving surgery, radiation to the
      entire breast/chest wall after surgery, and chemotherapy.

      Study participants will receive two doses of the study drug intravenously (through the vein)
      before their planned breast surgery or chemotherapy. The study drug will be administered
      three weeks apart. At the time of the second dose, radiation to the tumor in the affected
      breast will be given. This type of radiation treatment is called a &quot;tumor boost&quot;, which is a
      standard part of radiation therapy for breast cancer that may occur either before or after
      planned breast-conserving surgery. Patients will receive breast surgery or begin chemotherapy
      approximately six weeks after your first dose of the study drug.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With more than 1 million new cases diagnosed yearly worldwide, breast cancer is a global
      public health burden. Over the past decade, molecular subtyping of breast cancer has
      identified intrinsic subtypes that may be at enhanced risk for both local and distant
      recurrence. This study focuses on the immunogenicity of high-risk breast cancer subtypes that
      are likely to display a dense lymphocytic infiltration including including TNBC and HR+/HER2-
      tumors.

      Immune build up via immune co-stimulatory molecules permits the ensuing immune response to
      strengthen and destroy cancer systemically. Thus, the effect of the anti-tumor immune
      response initiated by the radiation to an intact tumor by combination with checkpoint
      blockade is increased.

      Pembrolizumab is an optimal immunotherapy agent to study, as this agent has recently been FDA
      approved for use in multiple tumor types. It is therefore ready to be tested for efficacy in
      other disease sites and in combination with other treatments.

               -  Any serious or uncontrolled medical disorder that, in the opinion of the
                  investigator, may increase the risk associated with study participation or study
                  drug administration, impair the ability of the subject to receive protocol
                  therapy, or interfere with the interpretation of study results.

               -  Known history of Hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or known active Hepatitis C

                  fever, rabies, BCG, and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for
                  injection are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however,
                  intranasal influenza vaccines (eg, FluMist®) are live attenuated vaccines and are
                  not allowed.

                  neuropathy may be eligible. Note: If participant received major surgery, they
                  must have recovered adequately from the toxicity and/or complications from the
                  intervention prior to starting study treatment.

               -  Prior radiotherapy within 2 weeks of start of study treatment to sites outside
                  the breast. Participants must have recovered from all radiation-related

               -  Currently participating in or has participated in a study of an investigational
                  agent or has used an investigational device within 4 weeks prior to the first
                  dose of study treatment. Note: Participants who have entered the follow-up phase
                  of an investigational study may participate as long as it has been 4 weeks after
                  the last dose of the previous investigational agent.

          -  For subjects who agree to the research breast MRI sub-study: Four or more previous
             gadolinium contrast scans due to the risk of brain deposits following repeated use of
             gadolinium-based contrast agents.
