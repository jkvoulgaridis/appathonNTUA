  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to the National HIV/AIDS Strategy, men who have sex with men (MSM), young adults,
      Black and Latino men and people in the Southern U.S. are at highest HIV risk and should be
      targeted with cost-effective, scalable interventions. The study team propose a synergistic
      mobile intervention to reduce alcohol and HIV risk in young adult MSM that combines 3
      efficacious approaches.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      New prevention efforts must address alcohol and HIV and be directed to the highest-risk
      groups. While interventions have targeted MSM, few have targeted young MSM specifically.
      Young people and MSM bring particular challenges. Thus, it is important that prevention be
      targeted to them and developed with their input. To that end, the goal of this project is to
      lay the groundwork for a synergistic, mobile intervention to reduce alcohol use and risky sex
      and prevent HIV among young adult MSM. This research study is made up of three related
      sub-projects: 1) a web-based survey; 2) a series of focus groups and 3) a small, preliminary
      acceptability and usability to study to test the mobile intervention. The proposed
      intervention to be tested on a preliminary basis in this study combines brief motivational
      intervention with daily interactive voice response (IVR) monitoring including personalized
      feedback. Ultimately, this combined intervention will also include pre-exposure prophylaxis
      (PrEP), however there will be no medication in this particular study. Each of these
      components has efficacy in enhancing treatment adherence, reducing alcohol and/or HIV risk
      but requires other interventions to maximize its potential benefit. Combining them will
      capitalize on the strength of each, leading to a higher impact alcohol and HIV preventive
      intervention.
