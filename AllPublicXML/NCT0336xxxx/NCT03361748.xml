    <textblock>
      This is an open label, single-arm, multicenter, Phase 2 study to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of bb2121 in subjects with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. A leukapheresis
      procedure will be performed to manufacture bb2121 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) modified T
      cells. Prior to bb2121 infusion subjects will receive lymphodepleting therapy with
      fludarabine and cyclophosphamide.

      Anti-myeloma bridging treatment is allowed for disease control while bb2121 is being
      manufactured.

      Three sites in Japan will be activated in 2019 and will be open for enrollment to patients in
      Japan.
