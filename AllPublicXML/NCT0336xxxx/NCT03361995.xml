      A Multicenter, Prospective, Randomized-Controlled Trial to Assess Cooling as an Adjunctive
      Therapy to Percutaneous Intervention In Patients with Acute Myocardial Infarction. The Phase
      A portion of the trial will include 80 enrollments from up to 15 sites.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this randomized trial is to evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of
      intravascular cooling using the ZOLL Thermogard XP3 IVTM System, as an adjunctive therapy for
      patients presenting with acute anterior myocardial infarction and undergoing PCI.

      The objective of the Phase A trial is to demonstrate successful incorporation of
      intravascular cooling into US standard of care.
