      escalation in Part A and phase II study in Part B.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dose escalation and dose expansion to determine safety and tolerability of AZD3759, and
      explore RP2D in treatment of Chinese patients with EGFRm+ NSCLC with CNS metastasis. Two dose
      cohorts include: 150 and 250mg twice daily. Subjects will receive multiple doses of AZD3759
      for consecutively 21 days each cycle. Dose escalation is planned to be performed in a single
      center, and dose expansion in multiple centers.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

          1. Subjects must provide written informed consent before any study related procedure.

          2. Male or female Chinese patients ≥18 years old.

          3. Histologically or cytologically confirmed non-small cell lung cancer with activating
             mutation in EGFR gene (including Exon19Del and/or L858R). A validated and robust test
             method reviewed and approved by the regulatory authority should be used to determine
             EGFR mutation status in tissue or plasma locally.

          4. Patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (stage IV) with documented BM and/or
             LM. Part A dose escalation can include EGFR TKI-naïve NSCLC patients with measurable
             lung lesion and no BM. Patients with BM and/or LM in each dose group shall account for
             at least one-third.

          5. According to Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Scale, performance status is
             grade 0 to 1, without worsening in the past 2 weeks, and life expectancy of at least 3
             months. If ECOG performance status is grade 2 due to LM disease, the patient can also
             be enrolled.

          6. Non-surgical sterilized women of child-bearing potential and male subjects shall agree
             to take medically acceptable contraception measures during dosing of investigational
             drug and 3 months after completion of study treatment. Non-surgical sterilized women
             of child-bearing potential must have negative blood pregnancy test at screening.

          7. Asymptomatic BM patients who have not received prior treatment with any EGFR TKI or
             symptomatic BM patients who are not warranted temporally for definitive local
             treatment (surgery or radiotherapy). For patients with prior local treatment for BM
             lesion (surgery or radiotherapy), intracranial lesion progression is required.

          8. BM patients must have at least one measurable intracranial lesion; in case of prior
             radiotherapy for BM lesion, progression is required and must meet measurable lesion
             criteria again. Measurable extracranial disease is not required.

          9. LM patients must be confirmed by the presence of malignant cells by cerebrospinal
             fluid (CSF) cytology. Diagnosis of LM disease by MRI alone does not meet inclusion
             criteria. Patients with both BM and LM are considered as LM.

         10. LM patients must have at least one leptomeningeal lesion which shows visible
             abnormality by MRI. Measurable extracranial disease is not required.
