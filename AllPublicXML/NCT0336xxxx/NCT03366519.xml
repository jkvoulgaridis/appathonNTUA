  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary Embolism (PE) is a frequent disease, the third cause of cardiovascular death after
      stroke and myocardial infarction. According to European guidelines of European Society of
      Cardiology (ESC) and of European Respiratory Society (ERS), the prognostic stratification of
      PE severity is mandatory as soon as PE is diagnosed. This stratification includes the
      hemodynamic status, and specific tools : the assessment of the sPESI score, and the
      evaluation of PE's impact on right ventricle (RV) : increased biomarkers (troponin, BNP) and
      right ventricle/left ventricle (RV/LV) ratio.

      the RV/LV ration may be evaluated ideally by transthoracic echo (TTE), or by CT scan.
      Unfortunately, only 10% of patients with PE are evaluated with TTE by a cardiologist in the
      initial time of PE diagnosis. Hence, the CT scan is the most frequent way to assess RV/LV
      ratio. However, CT is not possible for all patients (patients with contra-indication) or may
      have difficulties to provide a clear assessment because of technical issues.

      Then, there is a need for morphological evaluation of RV as soon as PE is diagnosed, in every
      clinical setting. The improvement in technologies allowed the development of clinical
      echography (CE) in emergency departments.

      CE is already available, non-invasive, less expansive, and may be a good way to assess RV/LV
      ratio in patients with PE diagnosed in emergency departments.

      The investigators propose a prospective, multicenter study to assess the sensitivity of CE in
      patients with PE, compared to CT scan to detect RV/LV ≥0.9.
