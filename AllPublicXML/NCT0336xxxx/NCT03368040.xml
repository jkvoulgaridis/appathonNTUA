  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The body core temperature drops during general anesthesia. To maintain homeostasis, patients
      require warming measures. Different methods to measure body core temperature exist, which are
      either highly accurate but invasive, or non-invasive but non-accurate. A new monitoring
      device, Tcore(TM), enables a non-invasive but accurate core temperature assessment.

      This study is performed to quantify accuracy and bias of the Tcore system in comparison with
      the blood temperature, which is the gold standard of core temperature measurement.

    <description>Over the time course of surgery, the body core temperature is actually measured in the bloodstream (Tbl) and estimated by the heat-flux thermometer (Thf). The bias or median prediction error (MPE) is calculated as median of PE, which is (Tbl-Thf)/Tbl.</description>

    <description>Over the time course of surgery, the body core temperature is actually measured in the bloodstream (Tbl) and estimated by the heat-flux thermometer (Thf). The inaccuracy or median absolute prediction error (MAPE) is calculated as median of abs(PE), which is (Tbl-Thf)/Tbl.</description>
