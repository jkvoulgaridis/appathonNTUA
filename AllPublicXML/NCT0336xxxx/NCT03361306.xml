  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study drug elotuzumab, has been clinically shown to be effective in treating
      relapsed/refractory MM in combination with either bortezomib, or lenalidomide and
      dexamethasone. Elotuzumab in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone is currently
      approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of patients with
      multiple myeloma. Carfilzomib is also FDA approved for treating multiple myeloma and
      frequently given in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone for treatment of
      relapsed/refractory MM. Based on these findings, this study will look at how subjects with
      relapsed/refractory MM respond to a combination treatment with the following drugs:
      elotuzumab, carfilzomib, lenalidomide and dexamethasone. The combination of these four drugs
      is not FDA approved and is experimental.

      This single arm, open-label phase II study is designed with the primary objective of
      evaluating the efficacy of induction therapy comprised of 4 cycles of carfilzomib,
      lenalidomide, dexamethasone and elotuzumab (KRd+elotuzumab) in terms of very good partial
      response or better (VGPR+) in subjects with relapsed and/or refractory MM, and comparing to
      relevant historical controls. Post induction, all subjects will undergo disease evaluation
      for assessment of the primary endpoint. Maintenance therapy comprised of elotuzumab and
      lenalidomide (R+elotuzumab) will start directly after induction and continue until relapse or
      progression.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Subject must meet all of the following applicable inclusion criteria to participate in this
        study:

          1. Written informed consent and HIPAA authorization for release of personal health
             information signed by the subject or his/her legally authorized representative.

          2. Age &gt;= 18 years at the time of consent.

          3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0-2 (see Appendix A,
             Section 18.1).

          4. Documented history of relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma per IMWG 2016
             criteria [22] as defined below (biochemical and/or clinical relapse per IMWG
             criteria); (NOTE: subjects refractory to bortezomib and/or lenalidomide are eligible;
             subjects who previously received carfilzomib are eligible provided they experienced a
             minimal response or better and relapsed &gt;60 days after completion of treatment [see
             exclusion criteria #2]):

               1. Relapse is defined as progression of disease after an initial response to
                  previous treatment, more than 6 months after discontinuation of treatment.

               2. Refractory is defined as lack of response to previous treatment, progression of
                  disease during treatment, or progression of disease within 6 months of
                  discontinuation of treatment.

          5. Prior treatment with one line (and no more than one line) of systemic therapy for MM;
             NOTE: A new line of therapy is considered to start when a planned course of therapy is
             modified to include other treatment agents (alone or in combination) as a result of
             progressive disease (PD), relapse, or toxicity or when a planned period of observation
             off therapy is interrupted by a need for additional treatment for the disease.
             Induction therapy and stem cell transplant followed by planned maintenance therapy
             (provided there is no intervening PD) are considered to be a single line.

          6. Subject must have recovered from any treatment-induced toxicities to ≤ grade 1 or
             baseline

          7. Adequate washout from previous therapy:

               1. Prior chemotherapy is completed &gt;3 weeks prior to day 1 of treatment (6 weeks for
                  melphalan, nitrosoureas or monoclonal antibodies).

               2. Autologous transplant completed (referring to day of stem cell infusion) &gt;12
                  weeks prior to day 1 of treatment; allogeneic transplant &gt;16 weeks prior to day 1
                  of treatment.

               3. Prior radiotherapy completed at least 2 weeks prior to day 1 of treatment.

               4. Corticosteroid therapy at a dose equivalent to dexamethasone &gt;4mg/day has been
                  completed at least 2 weeks prior to day 1 of treatment.

          8. Measurable disease defined as:

               1. Serum M-protein &gt; 0.5 g/dL OR

               2. Urine M-protein ≥200 mg/24 h OR

               3. Involved free light chain (FLC) level ≥10 mg/dL provided serum FLC ratio is
                  abnormal.

          9. Demonstrate adequate organ function within 1 week of day 1 of treatment as defined in
             the table in Sec.tion 3.2 of protocol (#8)

         10. Adequate cardiac function as defined by ≥45% Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF)
             by ECHO or MUGA within 28 days prior to day 1 of treatment.

         11. Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) must have a negative serum pregnancy test
             (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 24 hours prior to day
             1 of treatment, and be willing to undergo serial serum or urine pregnancy testing.
             NOTE: Females are considered of child bearing potential unless they are surgically
             sterile (have undergone a hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral
             oophorectomy) or are postmenopausal (at least 12 consecutive months with no menses
             without an alternative medical cause).

         12. FCBP must be willing to use a highly effective contraceptive method (i.e., achieves a
             failure rate of &lt;1% per year when used consistently and correctly) plus a second
             contraceptive method (considered acceptable [failure rate of &gt;1% per year] or highly
             effective) from the time of informed consent until 6 months after the last protocol
             prescribed therapy has been discontinued. NOTE: estrogens may further increase the
             risk of thrombosis (beyond that associated with lenalidomide) and their use should be
             based on a benefit-risk decision. For the highly effective contraceptive method, a
             method with low user dependency is preferable but not required (see tables, adapted
             from:

             http://www.hma.eu/fileadmin/dateien/Human_Medicines/01-About_HMA/Working_Groups/CTFG/2
             014_09_HMA_CTFG_Contraception.pdf).

         13. Male subjects (even those who have had a vasectomy) who are sexually active with a
             FCBP must be willing to use latex or synthetic condoms from the time of informed
             consent until 180 days after the last protocol prescribed therapy has been
             discontinued. The FCBP partner should also consider contraception recommendations (see
             inclusion #11).

         14. As determined by the enrolling physician, ability of the subject to understand and
             comply with study procedures for the entire length of the study.

        Subjects meeting any of the criteria below may not participate in the study:

          1. Discontinuation of previous lenalidomide, carfilzomib or dexamethasone due to
             intolerance.

          2. If previously treated with carfilzomib, lack of response, progression during or
             relapsed within 60 days after completion of treatment.

          3. Any infection, at the time of screening, requiring systemic therapy (i.e. involving IV
             antibiotics) (NOTE: at discretion of investigator, subjects with uncomplicated urinary
             tract infections may be eligible).

          4. Pregnant or breastfeeding (NOTE: breast milk cannot be stored for future use while the
             mother is being treated on study, and any female subject must agree not to donate eggs
             during the study and for 4 months after the last protocol prescribed therapy has been
             discontinued).

             ng/mL or other cancer for which the subject has completed treatment, been disease-free
             for at least five years, and is considered by Sponsor-Investigator to be at &lt;30% risk
             of relapse, or on hormonal therapy for a history of either prostate cancer or breast
             cancer, provided that there has been no evidence of disease progression during the
             previous three years.

          6. Non-secretory MM.

          7. Active involvement of the central nervous system by MM.

             suspected amyloidosis, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, psychiatric illness/social
             situations that would limit compliance with study requirements as determined by the
             investigator, or any other condition (including laboratory abnormalities) that would,
             in the opinion of the Sponsor-Investigator, place the subject at unacceptable risk if
             he/she were to participate in the study.

         14. Known allergies, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to monoclonal antibodies or human
             proteins, elotuzumab or its excipients or known sensitivity to mammalian-derived

                  polymerase chain reaction (PCR) measurement of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA
                  levels. Subjects who are PCR positive will be excluded. Exception: subjects with
                  serologic findings suggestive of HBV vaccination (anti-HBs positivity as the only
                  serologic marker) and a known history of prior HBV vaccination do not need to be
                  tested for HBV DNA by PCR.
