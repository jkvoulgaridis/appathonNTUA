  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop and pilot test a new type of patient-centered,
      family-based treatment for children aged 8-12 with obesity and their caregivers. The
      treatment will focus specifically on improving children's self-regulation (SR) skills to help
      them better manage their feelings, behaviors, and thoughts to help them live a healthier
      lifestyle.

      We aim to: (1) To determine the treatment needs of children ages 8-12 with obesity and their
      families with a focus on understanding cognitive function challenges that are related to
      self-regulation (using focus groups i.e. FG and feedback sessions i.e. FB). (2) To evaluate
      the feasibility and acceptability of this novel family-based treatment. (3) Explore potential
      associations between pediatric cardiovascular (CVD) risk factors and self-regulation in
      children with and without overweight or obesity. (4) To refine the F-ABT protocol and to
      maximize participant feasibility, acceptability, safety, and tolerability of F-ABT. (5) To
      provide pilot, proof-of-concept, and preliminary efficacy data of beneficial effects of F-ABT
      on SR and BMI in children with SR deficits and their caregivers.

    <description>Family acceptance-based behavioral treatment (ABBT) will be piloted with 16 child-caregiver pairs. At weeks 0 (pre-treatment), 9 (mid-treatment), and 18 (post-treatment), feedback regarding the feasibility and acceptability will be collected from participants through surveys and semi-structured group interviews to refine the family ABBT protocol.</description>

  <intervention>
    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Acceptance-based Behavioral Treatment (ABBT)</intervention_name>
    <description>ABBT is rooted in behavioral therapy but also cultivates self-regulation skills including experiential acceptance of potentially uncomfortable internal experiences (e.g., emotions, cravings), mindful awareness of decision making (e.g., mindful eating), and values clarification and behavioral commitment (e.g., practicing daily physical activity to be a contributing member on a sports team). ABBT has been used effectively to help youth and adults manage various medical and psychological problems. Moreover, components of ABBT have been shown to improve child and adult EF including inhibitory control and cognitive flexibility. Recently, ABBT has been integrated with components of standard behavioral treatment of obesity and applied with robust efficacy to weight management in adults.</description>

        beginning of treatment; (3) can read, write, and speak English, along with their caregiver;
        (4) plan to stay living in the local area during the study period; (5) have a consenting
        caregiver who can commit to all study procedures and provide reliable travel.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        - Children who:(1) comorbid developmental/intellectual disability/traumatic brain
        injury/other identified condition known to substantially impact EF and/or weight
        management; (2) taking medication that is known to affect weight or appetite, (3) recent
        infection that may cause confounds of acute inflammation, (4) have an uncorrected visual or
        hearing impairment that would prohibit completion of cognitive testing, and (5) are unable
        to use an iPad with appropriate training for cognitive testing. The children without
        obesity (n=32) will have &quot;normal-range&quot; BMI scores (5th ≤BMI percentile&lt; 85th) but
        otherwise follow the same inclusion/exclusion criteria.
