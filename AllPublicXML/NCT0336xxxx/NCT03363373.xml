  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children and adults diagnosed with high-risk neuroblastoma patients with primary refractory
      disease or incomplete response to salvage treatment in bone and/or bone marrow will be
      treated for up to 101 weeks with naxitamab and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating
      factor (GM-CSF). Patients will be followed for up to five years after first dose.

      Naxitamab, also known as hu3F8 is a humanised monoclonal antibody targeting GD2
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each patient will receive treatment for up to 101 weeks following the first Naxitamab
      administration. After the end of trial visit, each patient will enter a long-term follow-up
      where they will be monitored for up to 5 years after first treatment cycle.

      Each investigational cycle is started with 5 days, days -4 to 0, of Granulocyte-Macrophage
      Colony Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF) administered at 250 µg/m2/day in advance of the start of
      Naxitamab administration. GM-CSF is thereafter administered at 500 µg/m2/day on days 1 to 5.
      As standard treatment, Naxitamab is administered at 3 mg/kg/day on days 1, 3, and 5,
      totalling 9 mg/kg per cycle.

      Treatment cycles are repeated every 4 weeks (±1 week) until complete response or partial
      response followed by 5 additional cycles every 4 weeks (±1 week). Subsequent cycles are
      repeated every 8 weeks (±2 weeks) through 101 weeks from first infusion at the discretion of
      the investigator. End of treatment will take place around 8 weeks after the last cycle and
      thereafter long-term follow-up will continue.
