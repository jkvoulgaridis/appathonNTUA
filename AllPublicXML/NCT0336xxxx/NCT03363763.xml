  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of sirolimus (0.2% and
      0.4% formulations) and its vehicle when applied topically once daily for 12 weeks for the
      treatment of cutaneous angiofibromas in pediatric subjects with tuberous sclerosis complex
      (TSC).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study designed
      to assess the safety and efficacy of topically-applied sirolimus for the treatment of
      cutaneous angiofibromas in pediatric subjects with TSC. Approximately 45 subjects will be
      enrolled at investigational sites in the United States (US) and China, though other countries
      may be added in the future. Approximately 45 subjects who meet the study entry criteria will
      randomly be assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive 1 of 3 treatments: sirolimus 0.2% ointment,
      sirolimus 0.4% ointment, or placebo ointment. The randomization is stratified by site.
      Subjects, or a parent/guardian, will apply the study medication topically to the cutaneous
      angiofibromas on the face once daily at night before going to bed for 12 weeks. Subjects who
      complete the double-blind phase of the study, with an overall compliance rate &gt;80% as
      determined by the dosing diary, will be offered entry into an open-label period for an
      additional 12 weeks.

      The maximum study duration for each subject will be approximately 30 weeks and includes a
      screening period of up to 4 weeks, a blinded treatment period of 12 weeks, optional
      open-label period of 12 weeks, and a follow-up period of 2 weeks.

      An interim analysis will be performed when all subjects have completed the double-blind phase
      (Visit 5 - Week 12). The data will be unblinded to assess for efficacy and results reported.
