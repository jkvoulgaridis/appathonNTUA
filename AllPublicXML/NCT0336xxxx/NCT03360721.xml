  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well apalutamide and abiraterone acetate work in treating
      participants with castration resistant prostate cancer that has spread to other places in the
      body. Abiraterone acetate and apalutamide may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some
      of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Immunosuppressive therapy, such as prednisone, is used
      to decrease the body's immune response and may improve bone marrow function. Giving
      apalutamide, abiraterone acetate, and prednisone may work better in treating participants
      with castration resistant prostate cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess the radiographic progression free survival (PFS) of men with metastatic
      castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who are selected for treatment based on positive
      biomarker signature.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Safety. II. Composite progression free survival (PFSc) defined by Prostate Cancer Working
      Group 2 (PCWG2) (radiographic progression, prostate specific antigen [PSA] progression, or
      clinical deterioration).

      III. Overall survival. IV. Exploratory biomarker analyses. V. Measures of prostate specific
      antigen (PSA) decline and associations with outcome.

      VI. Radiologic response by PCWG2 criteria. VII. Measures of circulating tumor cell (CTC) and
      conversion to undetectable and/or favorable &lt; 5.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive abiraterone acetate orally (PO) once daily (QD), apalutamide PO QD, and
      prednisone PO QD on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up for up to 16 months.
