    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this proof of concept clinical study is to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of the study drug, ACH-0144471, in participants who have been diagnosed with either
      C3GN or dense deposit disease (DDD) based on renal biopsy. Participants will be randomized
      1:1 to receive either study drug ACH-0144471 or placebo for a period of 6 months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Initial diagnosis of C3GN or DDD 3 months prior to the first dose of study drug and
             prior to age 55 years.

             biopsy obtained no more than 30 days (and preferably within 2 weeks) of first dose of
             study drug by the study's central pathology laboratory

          -  Clinical evidence of ongoing disease based on significant proteinuria, defined as â‰¥1
             g/day of protein in a 24-hour urine, attributable to C3G disease in the opinion of the
             Principal Investigator (PI), and present prior to study entry and confirmed during
             Screening
