    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this proof of concept clinical study is to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of the study drug, ACH-0144471, in participants who have been diagnosed with either
      C3GN or dense deposit disease (DDD) based on renal biopsy. Participants will be randomized
      1:1 to receive either study drug ACH-0144471 or placebo for a period of 6 months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Initial diagnosis of C3GN or DDD 3 months prior to the first dose of study drug and
             prior to age 55 years.

          -  Confirmation of DDD or C3 glomerulonephritis (C3GN) diagnosis by review of a renal
             biopsy obtained no more than 30 days (and preferably within 2 weeks) of first dose of
             study drug by the study's central pathology laboratory

          -  Clinical evidence of ongoing disease based on significant proteinuria, defined as ≥1
             g/day of protein in a 24-hour urine, attributable to C3G disease in the opinion of the
             Principal Investigator (PI), and present prior to study entry and confirmed during
             Screening

             old (based on &quot;Bedside Schwartz&quot; equation [2009]) at the time of screening or at any
             time over the preceding four weeks

          -  Have C4 levels &lt;80% lower limit of normal (LLN)

          -  Have evidence of monoclonal gammopathy of unclear significance (MGUS), infections,
             malignancy, autoimmune diseases, or other conditions to which C3G may be secondary

          -  Have other renal diseases that would interfere with interpretation of the study

          -  Have comorbid conditions that would interfere with completion of the trial (e.g.,

             antibody [HIV Ab]), hepatitis B infection (positive hepatitis B surface antigen
             [HbsAg]), or hepatitis C infection (positive anti-HCV antibody [HCV Ab]) at Screening
             or historically

          -  Have any of the following laboratory abnormalities at screening:

               -  Absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) &lt;1,000/μL

               -  Total bilirubin &gt;1.5× ULN

               -  Indirect bilirubin &gt; ULN

               -  Any laboratory abnormality that, in the opinion of the PI, would make the
