        Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, 1, or 2

        Exclusion:

        Previous or Current Medical Conditions

          -  Acute myeloid leukemia.

          -  Any myeloid malignancy.

          -  Myelodysplastic syndrome. Baseline bone marrow biopsy is not required to rule out MDS.
             However, if a bone marrow biopsy and cytogenetics were performed as part of diagnostic
             or staging work-up, these results will be collected to confirm.

          -  Myeloproliferative disease.

          -  Multiple myeloma.

          -  Within 4 months prior to enrollment, any history of active congestive heart failure
             (New York Heart Association [NYHA] Class III to IV), symptomatic ischemia,
             uncontrolled arrhythmias, clinically significant electrocardiogram (ECG)
             abnormalities, screening ECG with corrected QT (QTc) interval of 470 msec, pericardial
             disease, or myocardial infarction.

          -  Major surgery ≤ 28 days or minor surgery ≤ 3 days prior to enrollment.

          -  New or uncontrolled venous thromboembolism or thrombotic events within 3 months prior
             to screening. To be eligible, subjects must have received at least 14 days of
             anticoagulation for a new thrombotic event and considered to be both stable and
             suitable for continued therapeutic anticoagulation during trial participation.

          -  History of arterial thrombosis (eg, stroke or transient ischemic attack) within 6
             months of screening.

          -  Evidence of active infection within 2 weeks prior to first dose of study treatment.

          -  Known human immunodeficiency virus infection. Subjects without a documented diagnosis
             in their medical history will require a central laboratory assessment at screening.

          -  Known active chronic hepatitis B or C infection. Subjects without a documented
             diagnosis in their medical history will require a central laboratory assessment at
             screening. Hepatitis B and C infection is based on the following results:

          -  Positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) (indicative of chronic hepatitis B or
             recent acute hepatitis B).

          -  Negative HBsAg and positive for hepatitis B core antibody: hepatitis B virus DNA by
             polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is necessary. Detectable hepatitis B virus DNA
             suggests occult hepatitis B.

          -  Positive Hepatitis C virus antibody (HCVAb): hepatitis C virus RNA by PCR is
             necessary. Detectable hepatitis C virus RNA suggests chronic hepatitis C.

          -  In addition to the conditions listed in exclusion criteria 201 through 206, secondary
             malignancy within the past 5 years except:

          -  Adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer or lentigo maligna without evidence of
             disease.

          -  Adequately treated urothelial papillary noninvasive carcinoma or carcinoma in situ.

          -  Malignancy treated with curative intent and with no known active disease present for 3
             years before enrollment and felt to be at low risk for recurrence by the treating
             physician (excluding malignancies listed in exclusion criteria 201 - 206).

          -  Thrombocytopenia due to another etiology other than CIT (eg, chronic liver disease,
             prior history of immune thrombocytopenia purpura).

        Prior/Concomitant Therapy

        • Previous use of romiplostim, pegylated recombinant human megakaryocyte growth and
        development factor, eltrombopag, recombinant human TPO, any other TPO receptor agonist, or

             estimated creatinine clearance as assessed by central laboratory during screening.

             information.

          -  Males unwilling to use contraception* (male condom or sexual abstinence) or their
             female partner(s) of childbearing potential who are unwilling to use a highly
             effective method of contraception during treatment (and chemotherapy) and for an
             additional 6 months after treatment (and chemotherapy) discontinuation.

             *If the male's sole partner is of non-childbearing potential, he is not required to

          -  Male subjects with a pregnant partner who are unwilling to practice abstinence or use
             a condom during treatment (and chemotherapy) and for an additional period of 6 months

    <ipd_time_frame>Data sharing requests relating to this study will be considered beginning 18 months after the study has ended and either 1) the product and indication (or other new use) have been granted marketing authorization in both the US and Europe or 2) clinical development for the product and/or indication discontinues and the data will not be submitted to regulatory authorities. There is no end date for eligibility to submit a data sharing request for this study.</ipd_time_frame>
    <ipd_access_criteria>Qualified researchers may submit a request containing the research objectives, the Amgen product(s) and Amgen study/studies in scope, endpoints/outcomes of interest, statistical analysis plan, data requirements, publication plan, and qualifications of the researcher(s). In general, Amgen does not grant external requests for individual patient data for the purpose of re-evaluating safety and efficacy issues already addressed in the product labelling. Requests are reviewed by a committee of internal advisors, and if not approved, may be further arbitrated by a Data Sharing Independent Review Panel. Upon approval, information necessary to address the research question will be provided under the terms of a data sharing agreement. This may include anonymized individual patient data and/or available supporting documents, containing fragments of analysis code where provided in analysis specifications.
