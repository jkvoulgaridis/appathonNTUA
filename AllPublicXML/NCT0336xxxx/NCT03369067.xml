    <textblock>
      This proposal aims to demonstrate the superiority of the Closed-Loop Control (CLC), also
      known as Artificial Pancreas (AP) named Tandem t:slim X2 with Control-IQ Technology and
      assess usability in a supervised setting in a controlled environment compared with
      state-of-the-art Sensor-Augmented Pump (SAP) therapy for the treatment of type 1 diabetes
      (T1D) in adolescents.

    <description>Subjects will use the Tandem t:slim X2 with Control-IQ Technology and Dexcom G6 CGM to control their glycemia. The Tandem t:slim X2 with Control-IQ device is an automated insulin delivery pump that automatically adjusts insulin delivery to predicted and prevailing glucose levels, as measured by a Dexcom G6 continuous glucose monitor [CGM].</description>

    <description>The Dexcom G5 CGM is a subcutaneous glucose sensor that provides an estimate of the prevailing blood glucose concentration approximately every 5 minutes.The Dexcom G5 sensor alerts the user if the prevailing glucose concentration is higher or lower than predetermined thresholds, or if it is changing too fast. In addition, the Share/Follow functionality of the Dexcom G5 allows up to 5 people (&quot;followers&quot;) to receive in real-time information about the current blood glucose concentration and rate of change.
The Dexcom G5 system will be used by participants and clinical study staff to monitor glucose levels 24h/day during the camp, ensure participants safety, and compute glycemic control outcomes</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Criteria for documented hyperglycemia (at least 1 must be met):

               -  Clinical diagnosis of type 1 diabetes (C-peptide levels and antibody
                  determinations are not required)

               -  The diagnosis of type 1 diabetes is based on the investigator's judgment

          2. Criteria for requiring insulin at diagnosis (both criteria must be met):

               -  Daily insulin therapy for ≥ 6 months

               -  Insulin pump therapy for ≥ 3 months (note: must be willing to disable any glucose
                  suspend, predictive suspend, or artificial pancreas functionality on insulin pump
                  during study)

          3. Virginia camp: age 13-18 years; Colorado/Stanford camps: 6-12 years

          4. Avoidance of acetaminophen-containing medications (i.e. Tylenol) while wearing the
             continuous glucose monitor.

          5. Willingness to wear a continuous glucose sensor and physiological monitor for the
             duration of the study

          6. Not being pregnant at the start of the trial. All female subjects of childbearing
             potential will be screened for pregnancy.

        request it, at least one parent commit to stay with the study subject at the camp site 9. A
        parent/caregiver is available for system training and will commit to be the main
        responsible person for the use of the AP system at home

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Diabetic ketoacidosis in the past 6 months

          2. Hypoglycemic seizure or loss of consciousness in the past 6 months

          3. History of seizure disorder (except for hypoglycemic seizure)

          7. Cystic fibrosis

          8. Current use of oral glucocorticoids, beta-blockers or other medications, which in the
             judgment of the investigator would be a contraindication to participation in the
             study.

          9. History of ongoing renal disease (other than microalbuminuria).

         10. Subjects requiring intermediate or long-acting insulin (such as NPH, Detemir or
             Glargine).

         11. Subjects requiring other anti-diabetic medications other than insulin (oral or
             injectable).

         12. Pregnancy

         13. Presence of a febrile illness within 24 hours of start ski camp or acetaminophen use
             while wearing the CGM. The camp study subject will not participate in the trial if
             these conditions are met.

         14. Medical or psychiatric condition that in the judgment of the investigator might
             interfere with the completion of the protocol such as (for parent and/or child):

               -  Inpatient psychiatric treatment in the past 6 months

               -  Uncontrolled adrenal insufficiency

               -  Alcohol abuse
