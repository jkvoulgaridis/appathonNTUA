  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Education research shows that healthcare professional training can be made more efficient and
      effective with the integration of simulation technology. Despite the relevance of this
      technology in the training of medical students, evidence on its effectiveness in
      physiotherapy manual skills training is limited.

      To compare the effectiveness of real-object three dimensional (3D) produced by Photogrammetry
      versus two dimensional (2D) images for the introduction of manual therapy skills to
      undergraduate physiotherapy students, with a blended learning activity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Using a randomised controlled trial design, first-year students enrolled in a 4-year bachelor
      with honours physiotherapy degree, participated in a 2-hour blended learning session. Three
      manual assessment techniques were presented - cervical compression, distraction and
      flexion-rotation tests. The techniques were demonstrated through two sets of learning
      materials with either real-object rotatable 3D images using Close-range Photogrammetry
      (experimental group) or traditional 2D computer images (control group). Students were
      examined after the training using an objective structured clinical evaluation (OSCE)
      procedure. The OSCE required the participants to demonstrate the three techniques learnt with
      the assessment criteria as therapist's position and skills, patient's position and overall
      management of the physical examination. The score of the standardized 9 item-practical
      performance test, with a maximum score of 54, was used as the primary outcome measure for
      analyses.
