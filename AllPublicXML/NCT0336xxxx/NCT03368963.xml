      This phase I/II trial studies the best dose and how well trifluridine/tipiracil hydrochloride
      combination agent TAS-102 (TAS-102) and nanoliposomal irinotecan work in treating patients
      with gastrointestinal cancers that have spread to other places in the body (metastatic) or
      cannot be removed by surgery. Drugs used in the chemotherapy, such as trifluridine/tipiracil
      hydrochloride combination agent TAS-102 and nanoliposomal irinotecan, work in different ways
      to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from
      dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the recommended phase II dose for the combination of TAS-102 and nanoliposomal
      irinotecan (nanoliposomal [nal]-IRI). (Phase I)

      II. Evaluate the activity of the combination of TAS102 and nal-IRI in previously treated
      patients with metastatic colorectal cancer and pancreatic cancer. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Define the toxicity profile of the combination of TAS-102 and nal-IRI.

      II. Evaluate the response duration, progression free, and overall survival of the combination
      of TAS-102 and nal-IRI in previously treated patients with metastatic colorectal cancer and
      pancreatic cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive nanoliposomal irinotecan intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes on day 1 and
      trifluridine/tipiracil hydrochloride combination agent TAS-102 orally (PO) twice daily (BID)
      on days 1-5. Cycles repeat every 2 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days and then every 8 or
      12 weeks thereafter.
