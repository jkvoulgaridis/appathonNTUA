  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effects of the Nurse Family Partnership (NFP), an established
      home-visiting program, using a scientifically rigorous individual-level randomized controlled
      trial. The study will be based in South Carolina, where a Medicaid waiver in combination with
      a pay-for-success contract will allow expansion of the program to women on Medicaid. The
      study plans to enroll 4000 low-income, first time mothers and their children into the
      intervention group, and another 2000 into the control group. The study will evaluate the
      program's impacts on outcomes using administrative records. This study aims to yield new
      evidence on the effect of NFP in a modern context, applied to a new population, across a
      broad range of outcomes, and financed by a novel public-private partnership based on
      accountability for outcomes.

      This study is an individual-level randomized controlled trial, with randomization
      post-consent. The study will enroll pregnant women who are income-eligible for Medicaid, less
      than 28 weeks pregnant, and have not had a previous live birth. All eligible applicants who
      provide written consent will be randomly assigned either to a treatment group that is offered
      access to NFP or to a control group that is not. Two-thirds of those recruited will be
      randomized to the treatment group and one-third to the control group. Control group members
      will have access to the standard of care and whatever other programs and services are
      available in the community.

      The investigators will assess the effect of NFP on a range of short- and long-run maternal
      and child outcomes using administrative data that will be available for all members of both
      treatment and control groups. Several of the outcomes the investigators will evaluate are
      required as part of the Medicaid waiver and pay-for-success financing model.

    <intervention_model_description>The Nurse-Family Partnership (NFP) was launched by pediatrician David Olds in the early 1970s in response to the observation that low-income mothers are less likely to engage in positive health and parenting behaviors that are associated with better child development outcomes (Olds et al. 1986). NFP is a prenatal and infancy home visiting program for low-income, first-time mothers and their families. Registered nurses begin visiting their clients as early in the pregnancy as possible, helping the mother-to-be make informed choices. The nurses continue visiting regularly until the child is two years old.</intervention_model_description>
