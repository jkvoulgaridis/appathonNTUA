  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is the second stage of the previous anti-CD19 CAR-T therapy (NCT02965092). The study
      aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of consolidative allo-HSCT following CAR-T therapy
      in patients with relapsed or refractory B cell Malignancies.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anti-CD19 CAR-T therapy has been confirmed effective for relapsed/refractory B-cell
      malignancies. However, its ability to keep patients in maintained remission is limited. In
      order to keep patients in long-term remissions, patients who had achieved MRD-negative
      complete remissions through CAR-T therapy (NCT02965092) will, on their own accord, receive
      allo-HSCT if there are no previous HSCT, contraindications, and other restrictions.
