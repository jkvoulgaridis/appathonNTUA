      According to WHO Reportin 2002, iron deficiency anemia was considered to be the most
      important contributing factor to the global burden of anemia. Children and women in
      reproductive ages are more at risk factor for developing iron deficiency anemia.No previous
      study has been held to assess prevalence of oral manifestations of iron deficiency anemia as
      a hospital-based cross-sectional study on a sample of Egyptian patients in hematology
      department (no previous data recorded).

      Study will be held in at the Hematology department at El Qasr Al-Einy Cairo University
      Hospital data collection started from February 2018 till end of April 2018 primary
      completion.

      Clinical examination performed for oral mucosa, the number and type of lesions will be
      recorded. Patients' age, sex, duration of illness, type of anemia, location of any oral
      lesion or abnormality, history of drug and alcohol consumption, and presence or absence of
      dentures, will be recorded participants will not followed up and data will be collected
      prospectively.

      A copy of participant's blood record will be obtained from the hematology department upon its
      approval.

      Participants:

      Egyptian patients diagnosed with Iron deficiency anemia that attending the Hematology
      department at El Qasr Al-Einy Cairo University Hospital will be enrolled in the study. The
      age of participant enroll will be up to 70 years old, males and females will be included.

      For each eligible participant, a full history will be obtained according to an assessment
      sheet, followed by clinical examination which will be done through an interview between the
      investigator and the patient.

      All participants will be asked to sign a study-related informed consent. Oral manifestations
      of these patients will be evaluated by an oral medicine master student (the investigator).
