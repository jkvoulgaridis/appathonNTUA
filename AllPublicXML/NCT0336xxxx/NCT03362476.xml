  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will harness the multidisciplinary expertise of our research team to develop a
      brief, computer-based, alcohol reduction intervention tailored for HIV/HCV co-infected women
      and evaluate its efficacy. The intervention, if effective, may be an efficient and
      cost-effective alcohol reduction strategy, that is scalable and can be readily disseminated
      and integrated in clinical care at other AIDS Centres in Russia to enhance women's health and
      reduce HIV/HCV transmission risk.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women co-infected with human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) and Hepatitis C (HCV) are at
      elevated risk for adverse health outcomes associated with alcohol use. Evidence-based alcohol
      reduction interventions for this vulnerable population are limited. To address this gap, the
      proposed study will harness the multidisciplinary expertise and experience of collaborative
      Russian-U.S. research team to develop a brief, computer-based, alcohol reduction intervention
      tailored for HIV/HCV co-infected women and evaluate its efficacy. The proposed study will be
      conducted in three sequential stages: (1) Adaptation, (2) Implementation, and (3) Evaluation.
      Participants will be randomized to one of two conditions: (1) adapted computer-based alcohol
      reduction intervention, or (2) standard-of-care control condition. The proposed trial design
      and analysis provide an appropriate conceptual and methodological framework to assess the
      efficacy of the computer-based intervention. The intervention, if effective, may be an
      efficient and cost-effective alcohol reduction strategy that is scalable and can be readily
      disseminated and integrated in clinical care at other AIDS Centres in Russia to enhance
      women's health and reduce HIV/HCV transmission risk.

It combines α2-macroglobulin, haptoglobin, γ-glutamyl transpeptidatse, apolipoprotein A1, alanine transaminase, and total bilirubin.</description>

    <description>Brief computer-based version of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) used in conjunction with standard clinical care for current substance users. Modules and follow up assignments focus on key concepts in substance use, including cravings, problem solving and decision making skills. The multimedia presentation, based on elementary level computer learning games, requires no previous experience with computers.The intervention was adapted to be linguistically, gender- and HIV/HCV-appropriate for Russian women living with HIV/HCV.</description>
