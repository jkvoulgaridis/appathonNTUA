  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase IV, multicenter study will evaluate whether participants with Hemophilia A (PwHA)
      with or without inhibitors receiving emicizumab prophylaxis can safely undergo minor surgical
      procedures without additional prophylactic bypassing agents (BPA; for participants with
      inhibitors) or factor VIII (FVIII; for participants without inhibitors).

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    The Sponsor decided to terminate the study early for several reasons (low enrollment, limited
    variety of surgery types, and available scientific data).

             (for PwHA with inhibitors)

          -  Diagnosis of hemophilia A and no history of an inhibitor (Bethesda titer &lt;0.6 Bethesda

             treatment is not currently ongoing) or current signs of thromboembolic disease

          -  Other conditions (e.g., certain autoimmune diseases, including but not limited to
             diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, inflammatory bowel disease, and
             antiphospholipid syndrome) that may increase the risk of bleeding or thrombosis

          -  Treatment with any of the following: An investigational drug to treat or reduce the
             risk of hemophilic bleeds within 5 half-lives of last drug administration before Study
             Day 1; A non-hemophilia-related investigational drug within the last 30 days or 5
             half-lives before Study Day 1 (whichever is longer); An investigational drug
             concurrently

          -  History of clinically significant hypersensitivity associated with monoclonal antibody
             therapies or components of the emicizumab injection

          -  Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection with CD4 count &lt; 200
