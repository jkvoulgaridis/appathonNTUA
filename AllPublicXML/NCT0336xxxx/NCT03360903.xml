  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At present clinicians have no way to reverse anesthesia. Patients wake when their bodies
      clear the anesthetic. Most people wake quickly, but some do not. All patients have memory and
      other cognitive problems after waking from anesthesia. In studies on animals, the
      investigators observed that caffeine caused rats to wake much more rapidly from propofol
      anesthesia. This was true for all the animals tested. The investigators would like to see if
      this holds true in humans. Will caffeine accelerate waking from anesthesia? Will it reverse
      the cognitive deficits associated with anesthesia, after waking?

      The propose investigators carrying out a modest trial with 8 test subjects. Each volunteer
      will be anesthetized twice. Each volunteer will be anesthetized one time and receive an
      infusion of saline (placebo control), without the aid of any other drugs and the other time
      the volunteer will receive an infusion of a relatively low dose of caffeine. The order of
      saline versus caffeine will be randomized and the study will be done in a double blind
      manner. We will determine whether emergence from propofol anesthesia will be significantly
      accelerated by the caffeine infusion. And whether any adverse events are observed.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Waking Time - Time Between Terminating Anesthesia and Subject Opening Eyes.</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The goal of the study is to determine whether caffeine speeds emergence from anesthesia. The time between terminating delivery of anesthetic and the subject opening their eyes will be measured. The time to &quot;emerge&quot; from anesthesia will be defined as the time between terminating the anesthesia and the test subject opening their eyes.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cognitive Test1 - Visual Analog Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 120 minutes after terminating anesthesia.</time_frame>
    <description>Normally patients receiving anesthesia exhibit significant cognitive problems for hours after anesthesia is terminated. The goal is to determine whether caffeine helps ameliorate the cognitive issues. Fifteen minutes after terminating anesthesia each subject will be asked to complete a series of psychomotor tests, if they are able. Otherwise the testing started at 30 minutes. The tests will be repeated every 15 minutes. The first test, a visual analog scale (VAS) test consisted of two 100-mm lines, each labelled with of &quot;feel good&quot; or &quot;feel bad&quot; displayed on a computer screen. Test subjects will be asked to rate how they currently felt by placing a cursor on each of the line (0=not at all, 100=extremely). The test will be repeated every 15 minutes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cognitive Test2 - Sternberg Test of Memory</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 120 minutes after terminating anesthesia.</time_frame>
    <description>Normally patients receiving anesthesia exhibit significant cognitive problems for hours after anesthesia is terminated. The goal is to determine whether caffeine helps ameliorate the cognitive issues. The test will be applied at 15 minutes following anesthesia, if the subject is awake and then repeated every 15 minutes. In the Sternberg Test of Memory (STM) participants are asked to memorize a string of numbers. Afterwards, a computer will flash a series of random numbers on the screen and the participant is asked whether the number on the computer screen are part of the earlier string or not. In three rounds, participants are given a string of 2, then 4, then 6 numbers. The latency until the subject answers the question is also monitored.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cognitive Test3 - Divided Attention Task</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 120 minutes after terminating anesthesia.</time_frame>
    <description>Normally patients receiving anesthesia exhibit significant cognitive problems for hours after anesthesia is terminated. The goal is to determine whether caffeine helps ameliorate the cognitive issues. The test is first applied at 15 minutes following anesthesia, if the subject is awake and then repeated every 15 minutes. In the Divided Attention Task (DAT), participants are asked to fly an airplane over the center of a winding road with a joystick and simultaneously press a button whenever targets randomly flash on the screen. The computer program tracks the root mean squared (RMS) deviation of the plane from the center of the road and the latency for pressing the trigger when the target appears.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Bispectral Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 120 minutes after terminating anesthesia.</time_frame>
    <description>A bispectral index (BIS) measurement system is employed to measure depth of anesthesia. In particular, we wish to determine whether BIS exhibits more rapid recovery after caffeine compared to control.</description>

    <measure>Mean Arterial Blood Pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 120 minutes after terminating anesthesia.</time_frame>
    <description>This measurement is made in order to determine whether caffeine alters blood pressure in a deleterious manner.</description>

The time between terminating delivery of anesthetic and the subject opening their eyes will be measured. The time to &quot;emerge&quot; from anesthesia will be defined as the time between terminating the anesthesia and the test subject opening their eyes.</description>

        <title>Cognitive Test1 - Visual Analog Scale</title>
        <description>Normally patients receiving anesthesia exhibit significant cognitive problems for hours after anesthesia is terminated. The goal is to determine whether caffeine helps ameliorate the cognitive issues. Fifteen minutes after terminating anesthesia each subject will be asked to complete a series of psychomotor tests, if they are able. Otherwise the testing started at 30 minutes. The tests will be repeated every 15 minutes. The first test, a visual analog scale (VAS) test consisted of two 100-mm lines, each labelled with of &quot;feel good&quot; or &quot;feel bad&quot; displayed on a computer screen. Test subjects will be asked to rate how they currently felt by placing a cursor on each of the line (0=not at all, 100=extremely). The test will be repeated every 15 minutes.</description>

        <description>Normally patients receiving anesthesia exhibit significant cognitive problems for hours after anesthesia is terminated. The goal is to determine whether caffeine helps ameliorate the cognitive issues. The test will be applied at 15 minutes following anesthesia, if the subject is awake and then repeated every 15 minutes. In the Sternberg Test of Memory (STM) participants are asked to memorize a string of numbers. Afterwards, a computer will flash a series of random numbers on the screen and the participant is asked whether the number on the computer screen are part of the earlier string or not. In three rounds, participants are given a string of 2, then 4, then 6 numbers. The latency until the subject answers the question is also monitored.</description>

The goal is to determine whether caffeine helps ameliorate the cognitive issues. The test is first applied at 15 minutes following anesthesia, if the subject is awake and then repeated every 15 minutes. In the Divided Attention Task (DAT), participants are asked to fly an airplane over the center of a winding road with a joystick and simultaneously press a button whenever targets randomly flash on the screen. The computer program tracks the root mean squared (RMS) deviation of the plane from the center of the road and the latency for pressing the trigger when the target appears.</description>
