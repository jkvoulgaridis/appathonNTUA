  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is challenging to cope with cancer. The investigators want to understand if it is helpful
      for patients with serious mental illness (SMI) to be connected to a psychiatrist and case
      manager when cancer is diagnosed. Many people with illnesses like major depression,
      schizophrenia and bipolar disorder face barriers to receiving high quality cancer care. It
      can be difficult to get to appointments, have many different doctors, and experience
      depression or worry. Better communication between the patient, the oncology team, and mental
      health providers may improve care. As for all patients, it is important for people with
      mental illness to have access to high quality cancer treatment that is patient-centered and
      coordinated. Having a case manager and psychiatrist at the cancer center who collaborates
      with the oncology team starting at cancer diagnosis may help patients to receive the cancer
      care that they need.

      This study includes a single-arm open pilot (n=8) to pilot patient and caregiver measures and
      refine the intervention manual; a run-in period (n=6) to pilot the randomized trial
      procedures; and a randomized controlled trial (n=120) to compare the impact of the Bridge
      model with enhanced usual care on disruptions in cancer care.

    <description>Proactive Psychiatry Consultation and Case Management is:
Patient-centered: Based on the patient's needs, the team aims to build a relationship, increase engagement, and promote continuity.
Team-based: A psychiatrist and case manager identify goals for cancer treatment, assess psychiatric history and symptoms with a focus on impact on cancer care, collaborate with community-based clinicians and caregivers, and address barriers to care.
Integrated into cancer care delivery: The psychiatry and oncology teams collaborate starting at cancer diagnosis to support patient through cancer treatment.
Systematic: The team monitors psychiatric and cancer-related symptoms and cancer care delivery to measure progress toward goals and rapidly adjust treatment as needed.</description>
