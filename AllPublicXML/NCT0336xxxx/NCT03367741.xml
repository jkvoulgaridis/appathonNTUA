  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well cabozantinib s-malate and nivolumab work in
      treating patients with endometrial that has come back (recurrent) or spread to other places
      in the body (advanced or metastatic). Cabozantinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal
      antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may
      interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving cabozantinib and
      nivolumab may work better in treating endometrial cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the clinical anti-tumor activity of cabozantinib s-malate (XL184
      ([cabozantinib]) and nivolumab based on progression free survival (PFS) in patients with
      advanced, recurrent or metastatic endometrial cancer previously treated with at least one
      line of platinum-based chemotherapy compared to patients receiving nivolumab alone.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the efficacy of XL184 and nivolumab in terms of overall response rate (ORR)
      compared to nivolumab alone.

      II. To evaluate overall survival (OS) of patients receiving XL184 and nivolumab compared to
      patients receiving nivolumab alone.

      III. To evaluate the safety of combination treatment using XL184 and nivolumab in patients
      with advanced, recurrent metastatic endometrial cancer.

      IV. To evaluate correlation between PD-L1 expression, CD3, CD4 and CD8 infiltrates and
      outcome (PFS, ORR, OS).

      V. To compare PD-L1 expression, CD3, CD4 and CD8 infiltrates in the primary tumor (archival
      tissue) and in the tissue from baseline biopsy.

      VI. To assess activity (PFS, ORR and OS) of nivolumab alone or in combination with XL184
      according to microsatellite instability (MSI)/mismatched repair (MMR) status.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess activity (PFS, ORR and OS) of XL184 and nivolumab in patients progressed after
      previous exposure to anti PD-1, PD-L1 or PD-L2 agents or crossed-over from single agent
      nivolumab, and in patients with diagnosis of carcinosarcoma.

      II. To compare microsatellite (MS) and MMR status, in the primary tumor (archival tissue) and
      in the tissue from baseline biopsy.

      III. To assess the genomic and immune-markers landscape at baseline on tumor tissue and
      changes in immune landscape in peripheral blood during treatment and correlate with outcome.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive cabozantinib s-malate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 and
      nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1 and 15, then on day 1 beginning cycle
      5.

      ARM B: Patients receive nivolumab as in Arm A. Patients may cross-over to Arm A at the time
      of disease progression.

      In both arms, cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30-37 days, then every 8-12
      weeks.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy (including investigational cytotoxic chemotherapy),
             biologic agents (e.g. targeted therapy or antibodies) or radiotherapy within 4 weeks

          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents

          -  Patients should be excluded if they have had prior treatment with anti-CTLA-4 antibody
             or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell co-stimulation; previous
             treatment with anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1 or anti-PD-L2 is allowed and patients will be
             enrolled in the exploratory cohort (arm C) at the time of progression from last line
             of treatment (treatment with immune check point inhibitor does not have to necessary
             be the last line of treatment)

             requiring active treatment with the exception of basal or squamous cell skin cancer,
             superficial bladder cancer, carcinoma in situ of any site

          -  Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial
             because of their poor prognosis and because of the possible increased risk of bleeding
             if treatment with antiangiogenic agents is provided; patients with history of brain
             metastases can enroll provided the brain metastases were removed and controlled with
             no radiological evidence within the past 6 months

          -  Patients requiring concomitant treatment, in therapeutic doses, with anticoagulants
             such as warfarin or warfarin-related agents, heparin, thrombin or factor Xa
             inhibitors, antiplatelet agents (e.g. clopidogrel) or new oral anticoagulants;
             low-dose aspirin (=&lt; 81 mg/day), and prophylactic low molecular weight heparin (LMWH)
             are permitted

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to cabozantinib or nivolumab

          -  Patients require chronic concomitant treatment of strong CYP450 3A4 inducers (e.g.
             dexamethasone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampicin, rifabutin, rifapentine,
             phenobarbital, St. John's wort) or inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, miconazole,
             itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, clarithromycin, telithromycin, indinavir,
             saquinavir, ritonavir, nelfinavir, amprenavir, fosamprenavir nefazodone, lopinavir,
             troleandomycin, mibefradil and conivaptan); because the lists of these agents are
             constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated list,
             medical reference texts such as the Physicians' Desk Reference may also provide this
             information; as part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will
             be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new
             medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new
             over-the-counter medicine or herbal product

                         -  Intra-abdominal abscess; Note: complete resolution of an
                            intra-abdominal abscess must be confirmed prior to initiating treatment
                            with cabozantinib even if the abscess occurred more than 6 months
                            before the first dose of study treatment

          -  Other disorders associated with a high risk of fistula formation including
             percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement

          -  Other clinically significant disorders such as:

               -  Active infection requiring systemic treatment within 28 days before the first
                  dose of study treatment

               -  Serious non-healing wound/ulcer/bone fracture within 28 days before the first
                  dose of study treatment

               -  History of organ transplant

               -  Concurrent uncompensated hypothyroidism or thyroid dysfunction within 7 days
                  before the first dose of study treatment

               -  History of major surgery as follows:

                    -  Major surgery within 3 months of the first dose of cabozantinib if there
                       were no wound healing complications or within 6 months of the first dose of
                       cabozantinib if there were wound complications

                    -  Minor surgery within 1 month of the first dose of cabozantinib if there were
                       no wound healing complications or within 3 months of the first dose of
                       cabozantinib if there were wound complications

               -  In addition, complete wound healing from prior surgery must be confirmed at least
                  28 days before the first dose of cabozantinib irrespective of the time from
                  surgery

          -  Known active human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), acquired immunodeficiency syndrome
             (AIDS) related illness, or hepatitis B or C infection

          -  Administration of a live vaccine within 4 weeks prior to start of protocol therapy

          -  Subjects with diagnosis of immunodeficiency or who are receiving systemic steroid
             therapy or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the
             first dose of trial treatment; the following are exceptions to this exclusion
             criteria: intranasal, inhaled, topical steroids, or local steroids injections (e.g.
             intra-articular injection); systemic corticosteroids at physiologic dose not to exceed
             10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent; steroids as premedication for hypersensitivity
             reactions (e.g., computed tomography [CT] scan premedication)

          -  History of autoimmune disease, such as, but not restricted to: rheumatoid arthritis,
             inflammatory bowel disease, systemic lupus erythematous, ankylosing spondylitis,
             scleroderma, or multiple sclerosis requiring treatment within the last two years;
             patients with vitiligo or diabetes are not excluded; replacement therapy (e.g.
             thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or
             pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment;
             patients with recent history of thyroiditis; subjects with remote history (greater
             than 5 years) of thyroiditis are not excluded

          -  Psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
             requirements

          -  The subject has a corrected QT interval calculated by the Fridericia formula (QTcF) &gt;
             500 ms within 28 days before randomization; Note: if initial QTcF is found to be &gt; 500
             ms, two additional electrocardiogram (EKG)s separated by at least 3 minutes should be
             performed; if the average of these three consecutive results for QTcF is =&lt; 500 ms,
             the subject meets eligibility in this regard

          -  Patient is not able to swallow pills

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because XL184 and nivolumab are agents
             with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there is an
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother with XL184 and nivolumab, breastfeeding should be discontinued
             if the mother is treated with XL184 and nivolumab
