  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single center, randomized, 15-day clinical trial is being conducted to assess the
      changes to the skin microbiome of induced wounds on the back in approximately 35 healthy
      adult subjects aged 18-55 years, with Fitzpatrick Skin Types I - III. Microbiome and skin
      physiology assessments will be completed.

        <title>Redness: Wound Area Oxyhemoglobin Level- Baseline (Day 0)</title>
        <description>Quantification of oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin at the wound area was achieved from apparent absorption spectrum acquired from diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) at the site. Absorption spectra of fully oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin molecules were employed to quantify the contribution of each molecule to the total apparent absorption of the wounded skin in the spectral range of 560 nm -- 700 nm. The numbers of oxyhemoglobin are in arbitrary unit and higher values describe higher erythema levels.</description>

        <title>Redness: Wound Area Oxyhemoglobin Level - Day 2</title>
        <description>Quantification of oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin at the wound area was achieved from apparent absorption spectrum acquired from diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) at the site. Absorption spectra of fully oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin molecules were employed to quantify the contribution of each molecule to the total apparent absorption of the wounded skin in the spectral range of 560 nm -- 700 nm. The numbers of oxyhemoglobin are in arbitrary unit and higher values describe higher erythema levels.</description>

        <title>Redness: Wound Area Oxyhemoglobin Level - Day 4</title>
        <description>Quantification of oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin at the wound area was achieved from apparent absorption spectrum acquired from diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) at the site. Absorption spectra of fully oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin molecules were employed to quantify the contribution of each molecule to the total apparent absorption of the wounded skin in the spectral range of 560 nm -- 700 nm. The numbers of oxyhemoglobin are in arbitrary unit and higher values describe higher erythema levels.</description>

        <title>Redness: Wound Area Oxyhemoglobin Level - Day 6</title>
        <description>Quantification of oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin at the wound area was achieved from apparent absorption spectrum acquired from diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) at the site. Absorption spectra of fully oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin molecules were employed to quantify the contribution of each molecule to the total apparent absorption of the wounded skin in the spectral range of 560 nm -- 700 nm. The numbers of oxyhemoglobin are in arbitrary unit and higher values describe higher erythema levels.</description>

        <title>Redness: Wound Area Oxyhemoglobin Level - Day 14</title>
        <description>Quantification of oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin at the wound area was achieved from apparent absorption spectrum acquired from diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) at the site. Absorption spectra of fully oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin molecules were employed to quantify the contribution of each molecule to the total apparent absorption of the wounded skin in the spectral range of 560 nm -- 700 nm. The numbers of oxyhemoglobin are in arbitrary unit and higher values describe higher erythema levels.</description>
