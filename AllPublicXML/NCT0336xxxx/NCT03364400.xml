  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an an open-label Phase I trial of VT1021 in patients with advanced solid
      tumors. Patients must have recurrent or advanced cancer (i.e., solid tumors) for which
      standard therapy offers no curative potential.

    <textblock>
      This is an open-label Phase I study of VT1021 in patients with advanced solid tumors. The
      study will include a Dose Escalation Phase and a Dose Expansion Phase. Upon determination of
      the Recommended Phase 2 Dose in the Dose Escalation Phase, the Dose Expansion Phase will be
      opened. The Dose Expansion Phase will include cohorts in ovarian, pancreatic, triple negative
      breast cancer, glioblastoma and CD36-high patients in order to confirm the tolerability of
      VT1021 against specific tumor types.
