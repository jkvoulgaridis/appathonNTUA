    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, Phase 1, dose-escalation (Segment 1) and expansion (Segment 2) study
      to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or the recommended phase two dose (RPTD),
      and to assess the safety, preliminary efficacy, and pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of ABBV-744
      in participants with relapsed/refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML).
