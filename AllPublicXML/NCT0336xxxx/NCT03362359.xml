  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be an open-label, single-arm, rater-blinded, multicenter, diagnostic phase 1/2
      study to assess safety and diagnostic performance of Ga-68-PSMA-11 positron emission
      tomography / computer tomography (PET/CT) imaging to detect tumour tissue in patients with
      newly diagnosed PCA and a high risk for metastasis. As standard of truth, comprehensive
      histopathology covering prostate and the tributary pelvic lymph node system, will be used.
      Therefore, only patients scheduled for RP with EPLND (as part of their standard of care) will
      be eligible.

      Patients will be recruited at up to 11 uro-oncological sites in Germany, Austria, and
      Switzerland, with access to a radiopharmaceutical laboratory, experienced to prepare
      68Ga-labelled compounds, and high-quality PET/CT imaging. Upon histological confirmation of
      PCA, pre-operative staging will be performed according to European Association of Urology
      (EAU) guideline [Mottet et al. 2015] (to include pelvic MRI or CT and a 99mTc-bone scan), to
      establish the indication for RP with EPLND. If the indication is confirmed, patients will be
      invited to participate in the present study. After consenting, review of inclusion and
      exclusion criteria, as well as screening investigations will be performed by the
      uro-oncologist (day 0). Thereafter, patients are referred to the collaborating nuclear
      medicine department for tracer injection, imaging, and post-dose safety evaluations (day 1).
      Subsequent investigations (day 2 and at end of study) will be made by the uro-oncologist or
      experienced nuclear medicine physician. Study participation ends on day 7. Routine surgery
      (RP with EPLND) will be performed after end of study, but no later than 42 days after study
      inclusion. This sequence allows adequate characterisation of tracer safety, while at the same
      avoiding unnecessary delay of, or confounding safety signals from therapy.

      In total, 150 evaluable patients will be included to receive a single 68Ga dose of 150 MBq (±
      50 MBq), administered as i.v. infusion. Due to an assumed dropout rate of 15%, up to 173
      patients will be included in study.
