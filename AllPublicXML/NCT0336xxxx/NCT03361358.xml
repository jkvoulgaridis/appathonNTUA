      Study AG270-PS-001 is a pre-screening study to identify subjects with advanced solid tumors
      or lymphoma in which the MTAP protein has been lost. Subjects whose tumor tissue has lost the
      MTAP protein may be considered for future enrollment into a Phase 1 clinical study of an
      experimental drug, AG-270, that is designed to inhibit the growth of tumors lacking this
      protein.

      Identification of the loss of MTAP will rely solely on the evaluation of archival tumor
      tissue samples by IHC. This study is therefore non-interventional

        Subjects appropriate for this study will be identified by the Investigators at the study
        sites based on their clinical judgment. This study may be conducted in subjects who are not
        currently eligible for an experimental therapy, recognizing that determination of the
        tumor's MTAP status could be useful in making future decisions about options for treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Be â‰¥18 years of age.

          2. Have a histologically confirmed diagnosis of an advanced solid tumor (other than a
             primary CNS malignancy) or lymphoma.

          3. Have archival tumor tissue that can be provided for assessment of MTAP deletion
             status.

          4. Have given written informed consent to participate in this study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Have a primary CNS malignancy (eg, GBM).

          2. Have a medical or psychological condition deemed by the Investigator likely to
