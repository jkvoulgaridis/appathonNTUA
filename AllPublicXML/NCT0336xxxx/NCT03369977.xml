      A multi-center, randomized, controlled clinical trial is designed to investigate the safety
      and efficacy of BioGlue as an adjunct for structural repair and hemostasis in Chinese
      subjects with acute type A aortic dissection. The trial consists of three phases:

      Phase One - A non-randomized, lead-in phase. During the lead-in phase, the first 2-3 eligible
      subjects at each center will receive BioGlue in open surgery. These subjects will be
      evaluated for safety separately from the randomized phase of the trial.

      Phase Two - A randomized, controlled phase. Type A aortic dissection subjects will be
      randomized into TSR group (control group) and surgical repair with BioGlue group (test group)
      with a ratio of 1:1, so that equal number of subjects in test and control groups can be
      ensured.

      Phase Three - A Follow-up of Late Safety Outcomes of using BioGlue in &quot;The CHINA Trial&quot; .
      Subjects enrolled in &quot;The CHINA Trial,&quot; from both the BioGlue and the control (TSR) group,
      will be invited to participate. Clinical data evaluating mortality, adverse events, and
      re-operation rates will be collected from subject's medical charts.

    <measure>Evaluate the successful hemostasis at the anastomotic site</measure>
    <time_frame>The measurement begins intraoperatively after either BioGlue or Traditional Surgical Repair is applied to the anastomotic suture line(s) and the bypass cross clamp is released.</time_frame>
    <description>Hemostasis is assessed visually (i.e. lack of any observable extravascular bleeding) and is monitored until hemostasis is achieved at each applied anastomotic site.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment failure of the aortic dissection repair site identified in &quot;The CHINA Trial&quot; which leads to either post-discharge mortality or re-operation.</measure>
    <time_frame>The measurement begins at discharge and will end when the retrospective chart review is performed by the hospital (could be up to 3 years post-op)</time_frame>
    <description>Post-operative mortality and re-operation(s) will be collected from the subjects' medical charts retrospectively and during informed consent telephone notification.</description>

    <measure>Proportion of subjects with device-related or procedure-related adverse events, determined by the investigators.</measure>
    <time_frame>The measurement begins at discharge and will end when the retrospective chart review is performed by the hospital (could be up to 3 years post-op).</time_frame>
    <description>Post-operative adverse event(s) will be collected from the subjects' medical charts retrospectively. Assessment will only be performed on the surgical site from &quot;The CHINA Trial,&quot; defined as obliteration of the false lumen (BioGlue group) or repair of acute type A aortic dissection (control group) and anastomosis (both BioGlue and control groups).</description>

    <description>BioGlue (produced by CryoLife in Kennesaw, GA) is a surgical adhesive with two components respectively purified bovine serum albumin (BSA) and Glutaraldehyde (their proportions are 4:1). Crosslinked bonds (covalent bonds) of Glutaraldehyde cross-link the protein on the surface of the tissue and the amino residue of the bovine serum albumin. BioGlue also adheres to the synthetic matrix material by a mechanical interlocking mechanism in the space of graft matrix.</description>

             participate or give informed consent for trial participation, will not be enrolled
             into the trial, and will be offered equivalent, non-trial surgical or other treatment,
             as judged appropriate by the investigator.

          -  Subjects with previous cardiac and aortic surgery.

          -  End stage malperfusion syndromes (i.e. end-organ failure such as coma, paraplegia,
