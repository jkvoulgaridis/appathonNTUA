  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The clinical study investigates the course of disease in patients with chronic inflammatory
      skin diseases (atopic eczema and psoriasis). For this purpose, patients are asked in the
      context of their routine visits to take part in an examination and data collection, and are
      asked to donate biomaterials (blood, skin biopsies, skin swabs, tape strips, stool samples).
      Blood samples are used to analyze inflammation messengers. 4mm punch biopsies from lesional
      and non-lesional skin areas are used to analyze gene expression in the skin. Tape strips are
      pieces of transparent adhesive tapes to strip off most of the horny layer. The skin smears
      are superficial smears of three areas of skin with cotton swabs, which are used to examine
      bacteria on the skin. Overall, the study will help to monitor the disease course clinically
      and on the molecular level in participating patients for at least ten years and to collect
      information about the impact of various external factors including treatments. The study has
      no effect on the therapies of the disease, it serves only the accompanying data collection

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atopic dermatitis and psoriasis are the most common chronic inflammatory skin diseases in
      dermatology. Due to genetic predispositions, inflammatory changes of the skin occur. The
      specific mechanisms are only partly understood for both diseases and targeted therapies are
      established in psoriasis therapy and are becoming available for atopic dermatitis. In order
      to better understand the course of the disease and to characterize the changes in the
      inflammatory mechanisms during the course of the disease and under the influence of external
      factors such as therapies, longitudinal prospective studies are needed to evaluate clinical
      data and biological samples. This study investigates long-term clinical and epidemiological
      data from affected patients, as well as biological samples, including blood samples, skin
      biopsies, non-invasive skin swabs for microbiome detection, and tape strips for the molecular
      characterization of the disease. Data collection and biosampling will be done during routine
      visits, typically at week 0, 2 and 12.
