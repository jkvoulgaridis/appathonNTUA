  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study are to investigate the efficacy and safety of topical
      steroid ointment (clobetasol 0.05%) for the treatment of the cutaneous manifestations of
      toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN).

      The experimental focus of this trial is thus to evaluate the safety and clinical outcomes of
      topical steroid (clobetasol 0.05% ointment) for treatment of the cutaneous manifestations of
      toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN).

      The design of the study is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind split-body Phase II
      clinical trial in which clobetasol 0.05% or placebo ointment will be topically applied to
      opposite arms for a period of fourteen days. The primary endpoints of the study are to
      determine the time to cessation of skin detachment in both groups as well as the safety of
      topical clobetasol to treat the cutaneous manifestations of TEN. Secondary outcome measures
      will evaluate efficacy by comparing the time to re-epithelialization and the percentage of
      affected skin between the clobetasol and placebo arms at various time points.

      An additional aim of the study is to characterize the genes expressed during the TEN disease
      state and any changes in gene expression following treatment with topical steroids,
      particularly those genes involved in the regulation of programmed cell death (apoptosis).
      This will be accomplished though molecular analysis of skin biopsy specimens obtained after
      treatment with clobetasol and placebo ointments. The specific hypothesis being tested is that
      two weeks of topical clobetasol will promote epidermal keratinocyte survival through
      suppression of TNF signaling, decreased granulysin expression and inhibition of other
      pro-apoptotic pathways resulting in shorter disease duration and decreased time to
      re-epithelialization.

    <description>Local infection (cellulitis) is a potential complication of treatment with topical steroid ointment. A primary outcome measure of the study will be to determine if any difference in local infection rate exists between between control and clobetasol-treated skin in patients with toxic epidermal necrolysis, determined by daily assessments and assignment of a numeric cellulitis score.</description>
