  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2 randomized, 2-period, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple ascending
      dose study to evaluate the safety, efficacy, PK and PD of PF-06252616 administered to
      ambulatory boys diagnosed with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. Three intravenous (IV) dose
      levels will be investigated in a within subject dose escalating fashion. Subjects will be
      randomly assigned to 1 of 3 sequence groups for approximately 96 weeks (2 periods of 48 weeks
      each). In period 1, two of the sequence groups will receive PF-06252616 and one sequence
      group will receive placebo. In period 2, the placebo group will switch to PF-06252616 and the
      two remaining sequence groups will either receive placebo or PF-06252616. Efficacy will be
      based on an observed mean change from baseline on function (4 stair climb) of PF-06252616 as
      compared to the placebo at the end of period 1. Period 2 provides an opportunity to evaluate
      PK. Subjects will receive monthly IV infused doses of either PF-06252616 or placebo and will
      undergo safety evaluations (Laboratory, cardiac monitoring, physical exams, x-ray, MRI),
      functional evaluations (pulmonary function testing, 4 stair climb, range of motion, strength
      testing, Northstar Ambulatory Assessment, upper limb functional testing and the six minute
      walk test), pharmacokinetic testing and pharmacodynamic testing to evaluate changes in muscle
      volume (MRI).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Ambulatory boys age 6 to &lt;16 years old (at the time of randomization), diagnosed with
             DMD. Diagnosis must be confirmed in subject's medical history and by genetic testing
             obtained during routine clinical care for diagnostic purposes as reported from an
             appropriate regulated laboratory using a clinically validated genetic test (genetic
             testing is not provided by the sponsor).

          2. Subjects who are able to perform the 4 stair climb in &gt; or = 0.33 but &lt; or =1.6
             stairs/second.

          3. Subjects must be receiving glucocorticosteroids for a minimum of 6 months prior to
             signing informed consent. There should be no significant change (&gt;0.2 mg/kg) in dosage
             or dose regimen (not related to body weight change) for at least 3 months immediately
             prior to signing the informed consent and a reasonable expectation that dosage and
             dosing regimen will not change significantly for the duration of the study.

          4. Adequate hepatic and renal function on screening laboratory assessments.

          5. No underlying disposition for iron accumulation on screening laboratory assessments.

          6. Iron content estimate on the screening liver MRI is within the normal range.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects with known cognitive impairment or behavioral issues that would impede the
             ability to follow instructions.

          2. History of major surgical procedure within 6 weeks of signing the informed consent or
             planned surgery during the study.

          3. Any injury which may impact functional testing. Previous injuries must be fully healed
             prior to consenting. Prior lower limb fractures must be fully healed and at least 3
             months from injury date.

          4. Presence or history of other musculoskeletal or neurologic disease or somatic disorder
             not related to DMD including pulmonary and cardiac disease.

          5. Compromised cardiac function (left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;55% as determined on
             a screening cardiac MRI or echocardiogram). Subjects may be receiving ACE (angiotensin
             converting enzyme) inhibitors or beta blockers, ARB (angiotensin II receptor
             antagonist) or aldosterone blocker/thiazide diuretic; however they must have initiated
             treatment more than 3 months prior to screening to ensure stable therapy.

          6. Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular (including uncontrolled hypertension),
             hepatic, neurologic, or allergic disease (including drug allergies, but excluding
             untreated, asymptomatic, seasonal allergies at time of dosing).

          7. Documented history of iron overload including hemochromatosis, beta thalassemia major,
             beta thalassemia intermedia or hemolytic anemia.

          8. Unwilling or unable (eg, metal implants, requires sedation) to undergo examination
             with closed MRI without sedation.

          9. Participation in other studies involving investigational drug(s) for a minimum of 30
             days or within 5 half lives (whichever is longer) prior to signing the informed
             consent and/or during study participation.

         10. Current or prior treatment with anti-myostatin, exon skipping, nonsense mutation
             targeted therapies ever or more than 30 days of treatment with utrophin modifiers and
             treatment with utrophin modifiers within 30 days prior ot signing the informed consent
             and/or during study participation.

         11. Current or prior treatment within the past 3 months with androgens or human growth
             hormone.

         12. Current treatment with immunosuppressant therapies (other than glucocorticoid
             steroids), aminoglycosides (eg, gentamicin), multi vitamins with iron and iron
             supplements and other investigational therapies (including idebenone).

        <title>Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) by Week 49</title>
        <description>An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a product; the event did not need to have a causal relationship with the treatment. A serious adverse event (SAE) was any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that resulted in death; was life threatening; required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; resulted in congenital anomaly/birth defect. AEs included both SAEs and AEs. TEAEs were AEs occurred following the start of treatment or AEs increasing in severity during treatment. Severe TEAEs were TEAEs that interfered significantly with participants' usual function. Treatment-related TEAEs were determined by the investigator.</description>

        <title>Categorical Summary of Liver Iron Accumulation by Week 49</title>
        <description>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of Liver was obtained to quantify liver iron accumulation for safety monitoring. MRIs were sent to an independent central radiology imaging facility for calculation of the average transverse relaxation rate (R2*) value which was used to monitor for iron accumulation in the liver. Number of participants meeting the following criteria is presented as follows: 1) normal: R2*&lt;=75Hz at 1.5T or &lt;=139 Hz at 3.0T; 2) above normal: R2*&gt;75Hz and &lt;=190Hz at 1.5T or R2* &gt;139Hz and &lt;=369Hz at 3.0T; 3) mild overload: R2*&gt;190Hz at 1.5T or R2*&gt;360Hz at 3.0T.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Physical Examination Findings Reported as SAEs by Week 49</title>
        <description>Physical examination included head, ears, eyes, nose, mouth, skin, heart and lung examinations, lymph nodes, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, and neurological systems. A targeted nose and throat mucosal exam were also performed to monitor for any signs of mucosal telangiectasias. An SAE was any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that resulted in death; was life threatening; required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; resulted in congenital anomaly/birth defect. Investigators determined which physical examination findings were reported as SAEs.</description>

        <title>Summary of Tanner Stage Rating by Week 49</title>
        <description>Tanner staging was performed before the first dose of each dose escalation to monitor for signs of accelerated sexual development. The physical changes in pubertal development (pubic hair, penis and testes) were assessed using the system described by Marshall and Tanner. Stage 1 is preadolescent, Stages 2, 3, and 4 are initiation of puberty and Stage 5 is mature adult. Details about the system can be referred to Tanner JM. Growth at Adolescence. Blackwell Scientific Publications 1962; 2nd edition.</description>

          <title>Summary of Tanner Stage Rating by Week 49</title>
          <description>Tanner staging was performed before the first dose of each dose escalation to monitor for signs of accelerated sexual development. The physical changes in pubertal development (pubic hair, penis and testes) were assessed using the system described by Marshall and Tanner. Stage 1 is preadolescent, Stages 2, 3, and 4 are initiation of puberty and Stage 5 is mature adult. Details about the system can be referred to Tanner JM. Growth at Adolescence. Blackwell Scientific Publications 1962; 2nd edition.</description>
          <population>This analysis population included all participants who received at least 1 dose of investigational drug. Number of participants analyzed signifies number of participants who were evaluable for this outcome measure. Number analyzed refers to number of participants evaluable for specified rows of categories.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) as Compared to Placebo by Week 49</title>
        <description>The LVEF was the ratio of blood ejected during systole to blood in the ventricle at the end of diastole. LVEF was measured by cardiac magnetic resonance image (MRI) or echocardiogram. The same method of cardiac imaging was used consistently within a single participant. Cardiac MRIs were read by a central imaging vendor and echocardiograms were read locally at each site. The LVEF values measured by cardiac MRI and echocardiogram are combined in the following presentation. The analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model was used to analyze the change from baseline for domagrozumab compared to placebo on LVEF. The baseline result, age, use of angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB)/beta blocker/angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and treatment were included as fixed effects in the model.</description>

        <description>The 4SC quantified the time required for a participant to ascend 4 standard steps. Mixed effect model for repeated measures (MMRM) was used to analyze the change from baseline on 4SC for domagrozumab compared to placebo. The baseline result, treatment, time and treatment by time interaction were included as fixed effects in the model. Participants were included as a random effect and the model was fit with an unstructured covariance for the repeated measures.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline as Compared to Placebo on the Ankle Range of Motion (ROM) at Weeks 17, 33 and 49</title>
        <description>ROM was evaluated by using goniometry to evaluate the loss of motion in the ankles. MMRM was used to analyze the change from baseline on ROM for domagrozumab compared to placebo. The stratification factor, baseline result, treatment, time and treatment by time interaction were included as fixed effects in the model. Participants were included as a random effect and the model was fit with an unstructured covariance for the repeated measures.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline as Compared to Placebo on the Performance of Upper Limb (PUL) Overall Score at Weeks 17, 33 and 49</title>
        <description>The PUL was used to assess motor performance of the upper limb. The PUL scale includes 22 items; an entry item defining the starting functional level, and 21 items subdivided into three levels: shoulder (4 items), middle (9 items) and distal (8 items). Scoring options per item may not be uniform and may vary from 0-1 and 0-6, according to the performance, with higher values corresponding to better performance. A total maximum score of 74 is achieved by adding the individual level scores. MMRM was used to analyze the change from baseline for domagrozumab compared to placebo. The stratification factor, baseline result, treatment, time and treatment by time interaction were included as fixed effects in the model. Participants were included as a random effect and the model was fit with an unstructured covariance for the repeated measures.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline as Compared to Placebo on Muscle Strength of Elbow Extension at Weeks 17, 33 and 49</title>
        <description>Muscle strength was quantified by means of a handheld dynamometer. The following muscle groups were evaluated: knee extension, elbow flexion, hip abduction, elbow extension and shoulder abduction. MMRM was used to analyze the change from baseline on muscle strength for domagrozumab compared to placebo. The stratification factor, baseline result, treatment, time and treatment by time interaction were included as fixed effects in the model. Participants were included as a random effect and the model was fit with an unstructured covariance for the repeated measures.</description>

        <description>Muscle strength was quantified by means of a handheld dynamometer. The following muscle groups were evaluated: knee extension, elbow flexion, hip abduction, elbow extension and shoulder abduction. MMRM was used to analyze the change from baseline on muscle strength for domagrozumab compared to placebo. The stratification factor, baseline result, treatment, time and treatment by time interaction were included as fixed effects in the model. Participants were included as a random effect and the model was fit with an unstructured covariance for the repeated measures.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline as Compared to Placebo on Muscle Strength of Hip Abduction at Weeks 17, 33 and 49</title>
        <description>Muscle strength was quantified by means of a handheld dynamometer. The following muscle groups were evaluated: knee extension, elbow flexion, hip abduction, elbow extension and shoulder abduction. MMRM was used to analyze the change from baseline on muscle strength for domagrozumab compared to placebo. The stratification factor, baseline result, treatment, time and treatment by time interaction were included as fixed effects in the model. Participants were included as a random effect and the model was fit with an unstructured covariance for the repeated measures.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline as Compared to Placebo on Muscle Strength of Knee Extension at Weeks 17, 33 and 49</title>
        <description>Muscle strength was quantified by means of a handheld dynamometer. The following muscle groups were evaluated: knee extension, elbow flexion, hip abduction, elbow extension and shoulder abduction. MMRM was used to analyze the change from baseline on muscle strength for domagrozumab compared to placebo. The stratification factor, baseline result, treatment, time and treatment by time interaction were included as fixed effects in the model. Participants were included as a random effect and the model was fit with an unstructured covariance for the repeated measures.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline as Compared to Placebo on Muscle Strength of Shoulder Abduction at Weeks 17, 33 and 49</title>
        <description>Muscle strength was quantified by means of a handheld dynamometer. The following muscle groups were evaluated: knee extension, elbow flexion, hip abduction, elbow extension and shoulder abduction. MMRM was used to analyze the change from baseline on muscle strength for domagrozumab compared to placebo. The stratification factor, baseline result, treatment, time and treatment by time interaction were included as fixed effects in the model. Participants were included as a random effect and the model was fit with an unstructured covariance for the repeated measures.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 49 on 4SC for Participants in Sequence 3 Compared to the Natural History Control Group</title>
        <description>The 4SC quantified the time required for a participant to ascend 4 standard steps. MMRM was used to analyze the change from baseline on 4SC for the natural history control group compared to placebo group (Sequence 3). This MMRM was established to assess the appropriateness on using the natural history control group as a comparator. The natural history control group was established by filtering the CINRG (Cooperative International Neuromuscular Research Group) natural history database. Participants who met the following requirements at baseline and had evaluable 4SC data on Week 49 were included in this group: 1) age: 6 to &lt;16 years; 2)treatment of glucocorticoid steroids &gt;=6 months prior to baseline and continuous use until the latest visit week; 3) 4SC: 2-15.9 seconds; 4) participants who were ambulatory at baseline; 5) LVEF: &gt;=55% or missing.</description>

        <description>FVC was measured by spirometry to evaluate respiratory muscle function. MMRM was used to analyze the change from baseline on FVC for the natural history control group compared to placebo group (Sequence 3). MMRM was used to analyze the change from baseline on FVC for the natural history control group compared to placebo group (Sequence 3). This MMRM was established to assess the appropriateness on using the natural history control group as a comparator. The natural history control group was established by filtering the CINRG natural history database. Participants who met the following requirements at baseline and had evaluable FVC data on Week 49 were included in this group: 1) age: 6 to &lt;16 years; 2)treatment of glucocorticoid steroids &gt;=6 months prior to baseline and continuous use until the latest visit week; 3) 4SC: 2-15.9 seconds; 4) participants who were ambulatory at baseline; 5) LVEF: &gt;=55% or missing.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline to Week 49 on 6MWD for Participants in Sequence 3 Compared to the Natural History Control Group</title>
          <description>6MWD evaluated ambulation ability by measuring the distance walked in 6 minutes. MMRM was used to analyze the change from baseline on 6MWD for the natural history control group compared to placebo group (Sequence 3). This MMRM was established to assess the appropriateness on using the natural history control group as a comparator. The natural history control group was established by filtering the CINRG natural history database. Participants who met the following requirements at baseline and had evaluable 6MWD data on Week 49 were included in this group: 1) age: 6 to &lt;16 years; 2)treatment of glucocorticoid steroids &gt;=6 months prior to baseline and continuous use until the latest visit week; 3) 4SC: 2-15.9 seconds; 4) participants who were ambulatory at baseline; 5) LVEF: &gt;=55% or missing.</description>
          <population>This analysis population included all participants randomized in Sequence 3 and received at least 1 dose of randomized treatment. Number of participants analyzed signifies number of participants who were evaluable for this outcome measure.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline as Compared to Placebo on FVC at Week 49 in Pre-specified Subsets</title>
        <description>FVC was measured by spirometry to evaluate respiratory muscle function. A subset analysis was performed by categorizing participants into 3 subsets according to the baseline 4SC time: 1) &lt;3.5 seconds, 2)&gt;=3.5 seconds and &lt;=8 seconds, 3) &gt;8 seconds. MMRM was used to analyze the change from baseline on FVC for domagrozumab compared to placebo in subsets. The stratification factor, baseline result, treatment, time and treatment by time interaction were included as fixed effects in the model. Participants were included as a random effect and the model was fit with an unstructured covariance for the repeated measures.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline as Compared to Placebo on NSAA at Week 33 in Pre-specified Subsets</title>
        <description>The NSAA is a 17-item test that measured gross motor function. Each individual item received a score of 0-unable to perform independently, 1-able to perform with assistance, or 2-able to perform without assistance. A total score was achieved by summing all the individual items. The total score could range from 0 to 34 (fully-independent function). A subset analysis was performed by categorizing participants into 3 subsets according to the baseline 4SC time: 1) &lt;3.5 seconds, 2)&gt;=3.5 seconds and &lt;=8 seconds, 3) &gt;8 seconds. MMRM was used to analyze the change from baseline for domagrozumab compared to placebo in subsets. The stratification factor, baseline result, treatment, time and treatment by time interaction were included as fixed effects in the model. Participants were included as a random effect and the model was fit with an unstructured covariance for the repeated measures.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline as Compared to Placebo on PUL Overall Scores at Week 17 in Pre-specified Subsets</title>
        <description>The PUL was used to assess motor performance of the upper limb. The PUL scale includes 22 items; an entry item defining the starting functional level, and 21 items subdivided into three levels: shoulder (4 items), middle (9 items) and distal (8 items). Scoring options per item may not be uniform and may vary from 0-1 and 0-6, according to the performance, with higher values corresponding to better performance. A total maximum score of 74 is achieved by adding the individual level scores. A subset analysis was performed by categorizing participants into 3 subsets according to the baseline 4SC time. MMRM was used to analyze the change from baseline .The stratification factor, baseline result, treatment, time and treatment by time interaction were included as fixed effects in the model. Participants were included as a random effect and the model was fit with an unstructured covariance for the repeated measures.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline as Compared to Placebo on PUL Overall Score at Week 49 in Pre-specified Subsets</title>
        <description>The PUL was used to assess motor performance of the upper limb. The PUL scale includes 22 items; an entry item defining the starting functional level, and 21 items subdivided into three levels: shoulder (4 items), middle (9 items) and distal (8 items).Scoring options per item may not be uniform and may vary from 0-1 and 0-6, according to the performance, with higher values corresponding to better performance. A total maximum score of 74 is achieved by adding the individual level scores. A subset analysis was performed by categorizing participants into 3 subsets according to the baseline 4SC time. MMRM was used to analyze the change from baseline.The stratification factor, baseline result, treatment, time and treatment by time interaction were included as fixed effects in the model. Participants were included as a random effect and the model was fit with an unstructured covariance for the repeated measures.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in Whole Thigh Muscle Volume as Compared to Placebo by Weeks 17, 33 and 49</title>
        <description>The whole thigh muscle volume was measured by the proton density weighted sequence with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) which was used to segment the entire thigh region into 3 primary regions for volumetric measure including 1) muscle; 2) inter/intra-muscular fat, 3) subcutaneous fat. MMRM was used to analyze the percent change from baseline for domagrozumab compared to placebo. The stratification factor, baseline result, treatment, time and treatment by time interaction were included as fixed effects in the model. Participants were included as a random effect and the model was fit with an unstructured covariance for the repeated measures.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 17, 33 and 49</time_frame>
        <population>This analysis population included all participants randomized and who had received at least 1 dose of randomized treatment. Number of participants analyzed signifies number of participants who were evaluable for this outcome measure. Number analyzed refers to number of participants evaluable for specified rows of time points.</population>

          <description>The whole thigh muscle volume was measured by the proton density weighted sequence with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) which was used to segment the entire thigh region into 3 primary regions for volumetric measure including 1) muscle; 2) inter/intra-muscular fat, 3) subcutaneous fat. MMRM was used to analyze the percent change from baseline for domagrozumab compared to placebo. The stratification factor, baseline result, treatment, time and treatment by time interaction were included as fixed effects in the model. Participants were included as a random effect and the model was fit with an unstructured covariance for the repeated measures.</description>
          <population>This analysis population included all participants randomized and who had received at least 1 dose of randomized treatment. Number of participants analyzed signifies number of participants who were evaluable for this outcome measure.
