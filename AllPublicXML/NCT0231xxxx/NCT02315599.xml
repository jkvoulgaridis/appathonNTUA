  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - Gene therapy involves changing the genes inside the body s cells to stop disease. It is
      very closely regulated. People who have had this therapy may have problems months or even
      years later. Researchers do not know the long-term side effects, so they want to study people
      who have had the therapy. They want the study to continue over the next 15 years.

      Objective:

      - To study over time the negative side effects from genetically engineered cellular therapy.
      This will be studied in people who have been in Pediatric Oncology Branch (POB) gene therapy
      trials.

      Eligibility:

      - People who are currently or were previously in a research study with gene therapy in the
      National Cancer Institute POB.

      Design:

        -  Participants blood will be tested right before they get the genetically changed cells.
           They will get the cells as part of another study.

        -  For the next year, they will come back to the clinic or see their doctor at home at
           least every 3 months. They will answer questions about their health and blood will be
           drawn.

        -  For the next 5 years, they will go to the clinic or see their own doctor once a year.
           They will have physical exam and blood will be drawn.

        -  For 10 years after that, they will be asked every year for health information.

        -  Participants will keep their contact information up to date with researchers. They may
           be phoned for more health information.

        -  If the participant was under 18 years old when given the gene therapy and turns 18
           during this follow-up, they will be asked to sign a new consent form when they turn 18.

      Background:

        -  Study subjects exposed to gene therapy interventions may be at risk for delayed or long
           term adverse consequences. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued Draft
           Guidance for Industry: Long Term Follow-up After Administration of Human Gene Therapy
           Products, which outlines a framework to assess the risk of gene therapy-related delayed
           adverse events and the essential elements appropriate for the conduct of long-term
           follow up observations.

        -  Accordingly some vector designs (i.e. use of an adenovirus), based on duration of
           persistence accompanied by cumulative preclinical and clinical evidence, may require
           shorter periods of observation than other vector designs (i.e. use of a lentivirus).

      Objectives:

      - To conduct long term safety evaluations after administration of genetically engineered
      cellular therapy to subjects who have participated in POB clinical trials.

      Eligibility:

      -Subjects who have received at least one dose of a genetically engineered cellular therapy on
      a POB gene therapy clinical trial are eligible to participate.

      Design:

        -  Subjects will be evaluated for long term safety and occurrence of adverse events
           according to the requirements established by the POB gene therapy parent protocol, the
           FDA guidance and the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic
           Nucleic Acid Molecules (NIH Guidelines), to include:

        -  Long term follow up after genetically engineered cellular therapy:

             -  Post-cell infusion evaluations for T-Cell persistence (if applicable)

             -  Monitoring for replication-competent retrovirus (RCR) or replication-competent
                lentivirus (RCL)

             -  For 5 years: Physical examination

             -  For 10 additional years: Complete Questionnaire

        -  To ensure adequate follow up for patients in POB receiving genetically engineered
           cellular therapy, a maximum accrual of 500 patients will be allowed on this study. To
           accommodate 15-year follow-up of all patients, this study will remain open until 2050
