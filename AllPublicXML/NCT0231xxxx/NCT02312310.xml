      to assess the effect of differing amounts of a cocoa-derived dietary flavanol (epicatechin )
      on dentate gyrus function and corresponding cognitive function
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this double blinded trial, the participants, age 50-75 years, will be randomized to
      receive 0, 260, 510, or 770 mg daily* for 12 weeks and will be tested before and after the
      intervention. Cognitive testing will be conducted prior to randomization, and at weeks 4, 12,
      and 20 of the study.

      In an optional substudy, fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) with gadolinium
      contrast will be conducted to measure dentate gyrus function before randomization and then
      after completion of the 12-week intervention portion of the trial.

    <measure>Modified Benton Recognition Task (ModBent)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The ModBent task is divided into two parts. During the matching trials (top), participants were shown a complex stimulus for 10 s. Following a 1-s inter-trial interval, they were required to select, via a key press, which of two stimuli matched the one they had just studied, as quickly and as accurately as possible. Following 41 matching trials, participants were shown a series of 82 stimuli (bottom), 41 of which appeared on the initial study set during the matching trials and 41 of which were foils. They were required to indicate, as quickly as possible, whether each stimulus appeared earlier (yes response) or was new (no response). The primary variable of the ModBent task is the mean RT for correct rejections of foils during the recognition trials</description>

    <measure>Dentate Gyrus Cerebral Blood Volume</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>measured in functional MRI. we generated high-resolution CBV brain maps using gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted scans acquired perpendicular to the hippocampal long-axis, with sub-millimeter in-plane resolution of 0.68 × 0.68 mm and slice thickness of 3 mm. To perform group-wise voxel-based analyses on the whole hippocampal circuit, we first isolated hippocampal subfields using FreeSurfer segmentations and thresholded posterior probabilities to generate a composite mask of the bilateral hippocampal formation. These masked T1-weighted images were then used to generate a group-wise template to which individual images were co-registered using a diffeomorphic technique that maximizes cross-correlation among images.</description>

    <measure>Modified Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>In learning Trials 1 to 3 the participant is read 20 unique, semantically/phonemically unrelated words (List A) and is to free recall those words after each trial. Next the participant is read a list of 20 unique words (List B) and is to recall as many as possible. This trial is followed by a short delay free recall trial: the participant is to recall as many words as possible from List A. After a 1.5-hour, the participant is asked to long delay free recall words from List A and then from List B. This is followed by a 66-item forced recognition trial: the participant is read a list of 66 words and asked to distinguish List A words from semantic and phonemic distractors, including words from List B. Finally, a source memory trial is administered: the examiner serially reads words from List A and B. The participant is to specify from which list each word came.Higher score indicates better performance. score ranges from 0 to 60.</description>

    <measure>NIH Toolbox Cognition Battery (NIHTB-CB): The List Sorting Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants are presented with a series of stimuli, each of which is both visually and auditorily presented by computer. A picture of each stimulus is displayed on the computer monitor for 2 seconds while the name of the stimulus is simultaneously being read via a computerized voice; stimuli are presented one after another. The participant must remember each stimulus in a series, mentally reorder them from smallest to largest, and recite the names of the stimuli in this order. List Sorting scores are based upon Total Score. Higher score indicated better performance.Score ranges from 0-100.</description>

          <description>We used the Block 2005 food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) (NutritionQuest, Berkeley CA) to estimate customary dietary intake. The food list for this questionnaire was developed from the NHANES III dietary recall data. The nutrient database was developed from the USDA (United States Department of Agriculture) Nutrient Database for Standard Reference. Individual portion size was measured using pictures provided. From these data, we computed the alternative Healthy Eating Index (aHEI). The total aHEI score ranged from 0 (nonadherence) to 110 (perfect adherence).</description>

          <description>gVLM is a nutritional biomarker of flavan-3-ol intake. Detection was achieved with a Waters Quattro Micromass spectrometer fitted with an electrospray interface (ESI; Waters). MS analysis was carried out in negative ionization mode by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). Detection of gVL-3′-sulphate and -3′-O- glucuronide utilized transitions from 287 m/z to 207 m/z and 383 m/z to 207 m/z, respectively, and both with a dwell time of 0.02 s, a cone voltage of 32 V, and a collision energy of 20 V.</description>

        <title>Modified Benton Recognition Task (ModBent)</title>
        <description>The ModBent task is divided into two parts. During the matching trials (top), participants were shown a complex stimulus for 10 s. Following a 1-s inter-trial interval, they were required to select, via a key press, which of two stimuli matched the one they had just studied, as quickly and as accurately as possible. Following 41 matching trials, participants were shown a series of 82 stimuli (bottom), 41 of which appeared on the initial study set during the matching trials and 41 of which were foils. They were required to indicate, as quickly as possible, whether each stimulus appeared earlier (yes response) or was new (no response). The primary variable of the ModBent task is the mean RT for correct rejections of foils during the recognition trials</description>

            <other_analysis_desc>The flavanol effect on the change in each outcome from baseline to 12 weeks was tested using linear mixed effects models controlling for the respective baseline measures, four categories of treatment, sex, age, and education. Regression adjusted mean within-group tests of change were estimated and tested for statistical significance from the model. The primary test used for assessing the treatment effect was the linear trend contrast from the model across: placebo, low, medium and high dose. The model for cognitive measures incorporated additional outcome measurement times at 4 weeks and 20 weeks and included categorical time (4, 12, 20 weeks) as a predictor as well as a treatment (4 category) by time interaction, and a random intercept to control for repeated measures within individuals (results for 4 and 20 weeks not presented).</other_analysis_desc>

        <description>measured in functional MRI. we generated high-resolution CBV brain maps using gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted scans acquired perpendicular to the hippocampal long-axis, with sub-millimeter in-plane resolution of 0.68 × 0.68 mm and slice thickness of 3 mm. To perform group-wise voxel-based analyses on the whole hippocampal circuit, we first isolated hippocampal subfields using FreeSurfer segmentations and thresholded posterior probabilities to generate a composite mask of the bilateral hippocampal formation. These masked T1-weighted images were then used to generate a group-wise template to which individual images were co-registered using a diffeomorphic technique that maximizes cross-correlation among images.</description>

Following a 1-s inter-trial interval, they were required to select, via a key press, which of two stimuli matched the one they had just studied, as quickly and as accurately as possible. Following 41 matching trials, participants were shown a series of 82 stimuli (bottom), 41 of which appeared on the initial study set during the matching trials and 41 of which were foils. They were required to indicate, as quickly as possible, whether each stimulus appeared earlier (yes response) or was new (no response).

Next the participant is read a list of 20 unique words (List B) and is to recall as many as possible. This trial is followed by a short delay free recall trial: the participant is to recall as many words as possible from List A. After a 1.5-hour, the participant is asked to long delay free recall words from List A and then from List B. This is followed by a 66-item forced recognition trial: the participant is read a list of 66 words and asked to distinguish List A words from semantic and phonemic distractors, including words from List B. Finally, a source memory trial is administered: the examiner serially reads words from List A and B. The participant is to specify from which list each word came.Higher score indicates better performance. score ranges from 0 to 60.</description>
