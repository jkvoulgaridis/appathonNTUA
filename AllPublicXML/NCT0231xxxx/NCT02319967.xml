  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chicago is an epicenter for asthma health disparities in the U.S., with African-American
      children 5-11 yrs bearing a disproportionate share of the burden. Among the most visible of
      these disparities is the high rate of visits to the Emergency Department (ED) for
      uncontrolled asthma. Clinical uncertainties regarding the real-world effectiveness of
      guideline recommendations for ED discharge and strategies to reduce environmental triggers at
      home contribute to practice variation and poor adherence to guidelines. The CHICAGO Plan
      tests both ED- and home-level interventions to improve clinically meaningful outcomes in a
      minority pediatric ED population with uncontrolled asthma.

        <description>Raw scores (0-32) were converted to T-scores to measure change from index visit to 6-month primary endpoint. Low scores indicate better asthma; high scores indicate worse asthma.
PROMIS Asthma Impact Scale, Pediatric: Min possible T-score: 31.5; Max possible T-score: 76.2 Possible range for change in T-score is [-44.7 to 44.7]

The reported value represents a change in T-score from baseline to 6 months after index ED discharge.
A negative change in score indicates improvement in asthma. A positive change in score indicates worsening of asthma. A score of 0 indicates no change.</description>

          <description>Raw scores (4-20) were converted to T-scores to measure change from index visit to 6-month primary endpoint. Low scores indicate less satisfaction among caregivers; high scores indicate more satisfaction among caregivers.
PROMIS Satisfaction With Participation in Social Roles: Min possible T-score: 29.0; Max possible T-score: 64.1 Possible range for change in T-score is [-35.1 to 35.1]
The reported value represents a change in T-score from baseline to 6 months after index ED discharge.
A negative change in score indicates less satisfaction among caregivers. A positive change in score indicates a more satisfaction among caregivers. A score of 0 indicates no change.</description>

          <title>PROMIS Sleep Disturbance (v1.0, SF4a)</title>
          <description>Raw scores (4-20) were converted to T-scores to measure change from index visit to 6-month primary endpoint. Low scores indicate less sleep disturbance; high scores indicate more sleep disturbance.
PROMIS Sleep Disturbance (v1.0, SF4a): Min possible T-score: 32.0; Max possible T-score: 73.3 Possible range for change in T-score is [-41.3 to 41.3]
The reported value represents a change in T-score from baseline to 6 months after index ED discharge.
A negative change in score indicates improvement in sleep disturbance (i.e., less sleep disturbance). A positive change in score indicates worsening of sleep disturbance (i.e., more sleep disturbance). A score of 0 indicates no change.</description>
