      DARWIN II is a multi-arm non-randomised phase II trial, Eligible patient will be those who
      relapse with NSCLC (clinical trials.gov ref. NCT02183883). Patients must have at least two
      tissue/DNA samples of their disease available for sequencing.

      The trial will investigate assess if intra-tumour heterogeneity (clonal vs subclonal
      actionable mutation) is associated with PFS.

      Patients without an actionable mutation will receive MPDL3280A (atezolizumab), a monoclonal
      antibody targeting anti-PDL1, as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy, The options
      for combination therapy will vary depending on the histology of the NSCLC (i.e. non-squamous
      or squamous).

      Patients with BRAFV600 mutations, HER2 Amplification, ALK/RET gene rearrangements will be
      enrolled into arms treating with vemurafenib, trastuzumab emtansine and alectinib
      respectively.

      DARWIN II will include extensive exploratory biomarker analysis to investigate a number of
      genomic and immune markers that may predict response to MPDL3280A (atezolizumab) and help
      guide future clinical trial design.

      DARWIN II is an exploratory phase II study examining the role of intra-tumour heterogeneity
      and predicted neo-antigens on the anti-tumour activity of anti-PDL1 immunotherapy.

      It will examine how clonal dominance and intratumour heterogeneity influence outcomes after
      treatment, offering a unique opportunity to decipher mechanisms of resistance to
      immunotherapy with anti-PDL1. These data will help improve future study design by developing
      greater understanding of patient selection for immunotherapies in patients with NSCLC. The
      relationship between intratumour heterogeneity and cfDNA/CTCs will also be explored in DARWIN
      II, which may develop tools for patient selection and monitoring to be examined further in
      future studies. Results from DARWIN II will help to identify a biomarker for anti-PD-L1
      therapy which could be used for patient stratification in future phase III trials of
      molecules targeting this T-cell inhibitory checkpoint. DARWIN II will also provide
      preliminary data on efficacy of MPDL3280A, which could be used to design randomised studies.

      This is a multicentre non-randomised phase II study based on patients with relapsed NSCLC,
      who have provided a biopsy sample at the time of relapse.

      The study arms:

        -  Arm 1: Patients without an actionable mutation - MPDL3280A (atezolizumab) monotherapy or
           in combination with chemptherapy

        -  Arm 2: BRAFV600 - vemurafenib

        -  Arm 3: ALK/RET gene rearrangement - alectinib

        -  Arm 4: HER2 Amplification - trastuzumab emtansine

          -  Multi-region sequencing data of the primary tumour available. Non-TRACERx patients
             must have two tissue/DNA samples of their disease. Non-TRACERx patients may be
             recruited to ARM1 pending UCL GCLP MiSeq or equivalent NGS panel if EGFR sensitising
             mutations and ALK fusions have been excluded (according to local testing procedures).
             Patients with confirmed ALK aberration by local testing are eligible for ARM 3
             providing they have two tissue/DNA samples of their Disease. Central testing for ALK
             will be performed separately. Patients with a confirmed BRAFV600 mutation by local
             testing or other non TRACERx NGS panel are eligible for ARM2, providing they have two
             tissue/DNA samples of their Disease. Central testing for BRAFV600 will be performed
             separately. Patients with squamous cell carcinoma do not require local testing for
             EGFR sensitising mutations and ALK fusions prior to inclusion for the trial.

          -  Subjects must be willing to have a biopsy of relapsed disease. Consent will be
             obtained through the TRACERx study (TRACERx patients) or using the DARWIN2 'trial
             entry tissue sample' consent form (non-TRACERx patients). Procurement of the biopsy
             sample is not necessary at the time of trial registration. However, patients must
             undergo a biopsy prior to commencement of any trial treatment. If a patient does not
             have a biopsy at recurrence then in exceptional circumstances the patient may still be
             eligible to join DARWIN2. Site must contact the CTC to discuss. There will be no other
