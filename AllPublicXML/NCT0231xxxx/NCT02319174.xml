      The purpose of the study is to help make a lower cost automatic blood pressure monitor device
      for diagnosis and monitoring of pre-eclampsia in pregnant women, where automatic blood
      pressure monitoring is limited or not available. The study will compare this low cost device
      to a commercially available system used for pre-eclamptic women in many United States
      hospitals that the investigators will be bringing to Malawi as a part of this study.

      The team hopes to show that this lower cost blood pressure machine works well and can help
      women with pre-eclampsia. The study also aims to see if this machine is easy for the nurse to
      use.

      70 pregnant women who are either at-risk or diagnosed with pre-eclampsia will be enrolled at
      University of Texas Health Science Center Houston. Patient arm circumference will be measured
      with measurement tape.

      They will be seated upright in a comfortable chair with arm at heart level and an arm blood
      pressure cuff from either the automatic blood pressure monitor or a manual sphygmomanometer
      will be placed on the left arm.

      The cuff will be inflated and then deflated until measurement concludes. Heart rate will be
      measured with tactile arterial palpation.The process will be repeated for a total of up to
      nine measurements, alternating between measurements with the automatic blood pressure monitor
      and the manual sphygmomanometer. There will be a waiting period of 45-60 seconds between each
      measurement.

      The results of this study will help researchers understand the performance and usability of
      this device in Malawi and help decide if any design changes are needed.

      The research team has developed an automatic blood pressure monitor to be used for the
      monitoring and diagnosis of pre-eclampsia in pregnant women, particularly in low-resource
      settings where current monitoring is limited. This study aims to evaluate the accuracy of the
      device's blood pressure measurements in pregnant and pre-eclamptic women. This device must be
      evaluated with the above described population because blood pressure measurement devices are
      known to perform differently in pregnant and pre-eclamptic women than in normal healthy
      adults.

      This study will take place at the University of Texas Health Science Center (UTHSC) where up
      to 70 subjects will be recruited to participate during their regularly scheduled antenatal
      care checkups.

        1. The Patient arm circumference will be measured with measurement tape.

        2. The Patient will be seated upright in a comfortable chair with arm at heart level.

        3. An arm blood pressure cuff from either the automatic blood pressure monitor or a manual
           sphygmomanometer will be placed on the left arm of the patient over the brachial artery.

        4. Cuff will be inflated to ~200 mmHg and then deflated until measurement concludes.

        5. Heart rate will be measured with Tactile Arterial Palpation.

        6. Steps 3-4 will be repeated for a total of up to nine measurements, alternating between
           measurements with the automatic blood pressure monitor and the manual sphygmomanometer.
           There will be a waiting period of 45-60 seconds between each measurement.

Devices are graded according to the cumulative percentage of readings that have an absolute difference between the more favorable observer's mercury sphygmomanometer readings and the test device of &lt; 5 mmHg, &lt; 10 mmHg, and &lt; 15 mmHg. A letter grade of &quot;A&quot; requires that over 60%, 85%, and 95% were achieved in the &lt; 5 mmHg, &lt; 10 mmHg, and &lt;15 mmHg categories, respectively. A letter grade of &quot;B&quot; requires that over 50%, 75%, and 90% were achieved in the &lt; 5 mmHg, &lt; 10 mmHg, and &lt;15 mmHg categories, respectively. The test device achieved a grade of (A/A) with the validation data from this study.</description>
        <time_frame>Blood pressure was measured an average of 9 times for each participant during their single measurement period, and the average of those measurements was recorded. Each measurement period lasted approximately 30-45 minutes</time_frame>
        <population>Of 41 participants who completed the study, 5 participants were excluded on account of the observer reporting a difficulty in hearing, movement, or uncertainty with the measurement. This left 36 participants, 18 of which were used to train the device. The data presented here is from the remaining 18 participants.</population>
