    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to investigate the efficacy of fresh, frozen or lyophilized
      fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) via colonoscopy in patients with recurrent C.
      difficile associated diarrhea (RCDAD). Frozen, lyophilized or fresh fecal microbiota
      transplantation (FMT) inoculum will be generated from well-screened healthy volunteer donors
      of ≥150 gram/sample. Delivery of FMT will be performed colonoscopically. Fecal samples from
      donors and recipients will be saved for later metagenomic studies to characterize the
      microbiome of the gut in patients before and after FMT.
