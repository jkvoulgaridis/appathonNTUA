  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MSC2490484A is an investigational drug that is being evaluated for the treatment of subjects
      with advanced solid tumors or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) that likely differs from
      other cancers in how it repairs damaged DNA (genetic material). This is a first-in-man Phase
      I study, which means that it is the first time the study drug is being used in humans. The
      main purpose is to determine the highest dose that does not cause unacceptable side effects.
      The second is to determine the appropriate dose to use in future research for subjects with
      cancer. Othergoals of the study are to learn about the drug's safety and side effects, how it
      affects the tumor, and how the body processes the drug.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, first-in-human, open-label, dose escalation, and dose expansion trial
      designed to explore the safety, tolerability, PK and PD profiles, and clinical activity of
      MSC2490484A administered daily as a single agent to subjects with advanced solid tumors or
      CLL likely to have alterations in DNA repair mechanisms.

      Dose Escalation : Subjects will receive MSC2490484A continuously at the starting dose of 100
      mg once daily. Sequential treatment cohorts will receive ascending doses of MSC2490484A once
      daily or twice daily (if determined to be appropriate by the Safety Monitoring Committee
      [SMC]) following a standard &quot;3+3&quot; design. The SMC will make dose escalation decisions based
      on review of available safety, tolerability, Pharmacokinetic (PK), and Pharmacodynamic (PD)
      data. Once the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) has been established, an Recommended Phase II
      Dose (RP2D) will be defined by the SMC, either at the MTD level or another dose level,
      depending on the available data on safety, efficacy, PK, and PD observed in the trial. The
      SMC may decide to stop dose escalation at any time during the trial.

      Up to 12 subjects will be enrolled at the RP2D/Optimal biologic dose (OBD) to confirm safety
      and tolerability and explore the PK and PD profile of MSC2490484A.

      Expansion cohorts: Once subjects have been evaluated at the RP2D, additional subjects will be
      enrolled into 2 or more expansion cohorts (20 evaluable subjects per expansion cohort) to
      evaluate clinical efficacy in tumors likely to have alterations in the DNA repair mechanism
      (eg, CLL and other tumor types). Subjects are evaluable for efficacy if they have received at
      least 1 dose of study drug and have radiographic baseline. Subjects who are not evaluable for
      efficacy will be replaced.

          -  Receiving medications or herbal supplements that are known to be potent inhibitors of
             cytochrome P450 3A4 or inducers of cytochrome P450 3A4.

          -  Not recovered from toxicity due to prior therapy to baseline or an AE CTCAE Grade of 1
             or less (except alopecia)

          -  Poor vital organ function as defined in the protocol

          -  Significant cardiac conduction abnormalities as defined in the protocol

          -  Central nervous system metastases unless previously radiotherapy treated, stable by
             computerized tomography (CT) scan for at least 3 months without evidence of cerebral
             edema, and no requirements for corticosteroids or anticonvulsants
