  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate serum soluble human ST2 protein, the receptor for
      Interleukin-33 (IL-33) and a member of the proinflammatory Interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor
      superfamily, as a surrogate biological marker predictive of disease outcome and therapeutic
      response to golimumab treatment in participants with moderate to severe UC who have failed on
      prior conventional therapies. The primary endpoints of this study are to correlate serum
      soluble ST2 levels with endoscopic activity (endoscopic subscore of the Mayo score) and
      histological activity (Geboes index) of disease.

    <measure>Serum ST2 Level at Week 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>ST2, a serum biomarker, was collected at Week 6. ST2 levels were used to determine whether or not there is a correlation with endoscopic or histologic activity, or a clinical response to treatment in participants with moderate to severe Ulcerative Colitis.</description>

    <measure>Correlation of Serum Soluble ST2 Levels With Endoscopic Activity of Disease (Assessed by Endoscopy Subscore of Mayo Score) at Week 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>ST2, a serum biomarker, was collected at Week 6. Endoscopic Mayo subscore is one of 4 components that comprise the total Mayo Score, a scale for assessing ulcerative colitis (UC) activity. Endoscopic Mayo subscore ranges from 0-3: 0 = normal or inactive disease, 1 = mild disease (erythema, decreased vascular pattern, mild friability); 2 = moderate disease (marked erythema, absent vascular pattern, friability, erosions); 3 = Severe disease (spontaneous bleeding, ulceration). A higher score indicates more severe disease. Moderate correlation was defined as a Spearman correlation (rs) coefficient between -0.5 to -0.3 or 0.3 to 0.5.</description>

    <measure>Correlation of Serum Soluble ST2 Levels With Histological Activity (Assessed by Geboes Index) at Week 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>ST2, a serum biomarker, was collected at Week 6. Geboes index, is a validated score for evaluating histologic disease activity in UC as follows: grade 0 = structural and architectural changes; grade 1 = chronic inflammatory infiltrate; grade 2 = lamina propria neutrophils and eosinophils; grade 3 = neutrophils in the epithelium; grade 4 = crypt destruction; grade 5 = erosions or ulceration. A higher score indicates more severe disease. Moderate correlation was defined as rs coefficient between -0.5 to -0.3 or 0.3 to 0.5.</description>

    <measure>Correlation of Serum Soluble ST2 Levels With Faecal Calprotectin Levels at Baseline and Week 6 and Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 6 and 16</time_frame>
    <description>ST2 and faecal calprotectin, serum biomarkers, were collected at Week 6 and Week 16. Faecal calprotectin is a surrogate marker for the presence of intestinal inflammation and response to treatment in participants with Inflammatory Bowel Disease. Moderate correlation was defined as rs coefficient between -0.5 to -0.3 or 0.3 to 0.5.</description>

    <measure>Correlation of Serum Soluble ST2 Levels With Clinical Activity (Assessed by Total Mayo Score) at Week 6 and Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 6 and 16</time_frame>
    <description>ST2, a serum biomarker, was collected at Week 6 and Week 16. The total Mayo Score, is a scale for assessing UC activity and is the sum of 4 subscores (assessment of stool frequency [0-3], rectal bleeding [0-3], Physician's Global Assessment [0-3], and endoscopic Mayo subscore [0-3]) and has values that range from 0 to 12. Clinical remission: ≤2 points with no individual subscore &gt; 1; Mildly active disease: 3-5 points; Moderately active disease: 6-10 points; Severely active disease: 11-12 points. A higher score indicates more severe disease. Moderate correlation was defined as rs coefficient between -0.5 to -0.3 or 0.3 to 0.5.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>ST2, a serum biomarker, was collected at Baseline and Week 6. Active Ulcerative Colitis was defined as an endoscopic Mayo subscore ≥2 and inactive Ulcerative Colitis was defined as an endoscopic Mayo subscore of 0 or 1.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 6 in ST2 Level According to Participant's Mayo Endoscopic Response at Week 16 (Maintained Response at Week 16 or Did Not Maintain Response at Week 16)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>ST2, a serum biomarker, was collected at Baseline and Week 6. Comparison of participants who achieved endoscopic response [endoscopic Mayo subscore 0 or 1] at Week 6 and maintained response through Week 16 versus participants who did not maintain response throughout Week 16, regarding serum soluble ST2 at baseline, Week 6 and change between baseline and Week 6.</description>

    <measure>Correlation of Endoscopic Mayo Subscore With Ulcerative Colitis Endoscopic Index Of Severity (UCEIS©) Overall Score at Week 6 and Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 6 and Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>UCEIS© is a 3-item (vascular pattern, bleeding and erosion/ulceration) validated tool for assessing endoscopic severity of UC. Each item has 3 or 4 levels of severity and is given a score. The scores for each individual item are combined into a total score ranging from 1 to 11. A higher score indicates increased endoscopic severity of UC. Moderate correlation was defined as rs coefficient between -0.5 to -0.3 or 0.3 to 0.5.</description>

        <description>ST2, a serum biomarker, was collected at Week 6. Endoscopic Mayo subscore is one of 4 components that comprise the total Mayo Score, a scale for assessing ulcerative colitis (UC) activity. Endoscopic Mayo subscore ranges from 0-3: 0 = normal or inactive disease, 1 = mild disease (erythema, decreased vascular pattern, mild friability); 2 = moderate disease (marked erythema, absent vascular pattern, friability, erosions); 3 = Severe disease (spontaneous bleeding, ulceration). A higher score indicates more severe disease. Moderate correlation was defined as a Spearman correlation (rs) coefficient between -0.5 to -0.3 or 0.3 to 0.5.</description>

The total Mayo Score, is a scale for assessing UC activity and is the sum of 4 subscores (assessment of stool frequency [0-3], rectal bleeding [0-3], Physician's Global Assessment [0-3], and endoscopic Mayo subscore [0-3]) and has values that range from 0 to 12. Clinical remission: ≤2 points with no individual subscore &gt; 1; Mildly active disease: 3-5 points; Moderately active disease: 6-10 points; Severely active disease: 11-12 points.
