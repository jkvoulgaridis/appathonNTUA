      Background:

      - People respond differently when asked about their values. They also respond differently
      when they learn about how their actions affect their lives and health. Researchers want to
      learn more about these differences. This can help them improve public health messages.

      Objective:

      - To see how people respond differently to questions about their values and to information
      about alcohol and breast cancer.

      Eligibility:

      Study 1

      - Women age 18 and older.

      Study 2 &amp; Study 3

      -Women and men aged 18 and older to take part in these studies if they do not meet the US
      recommendations of eating 5 or more servings of fruits and vegetables per week.

      Design:

        -  This study will take place online.

        -  Participants will be randomly assigned to a group that will complete a certain task.

        -  Researchers will ask participants to complete 2 small studies:

        -  Values Study. Some participants may write briefly about a value that is important to
           them or to someone they are close to. Some participants will complete a short
           questionnaire instead of the writing exercise.

        -  Study 1:

      Alcohol and Breast Cancer Study. Participants will read a health message. This will be about
      the link between alcohol use and increased breast cancer risk. Participants will then answer
      questions about what they read and their beliefs about alcohol and breast cancer.

      -Study 2:

      Fruit and Vegetable Consumption and Health Study. Participants will read a health message
      about the fruit and vegetable consumption. Participants will then answer questions about what
      they read and their beliefs about fruit and vegetable consumption.

      -Study 3:

      Fruit and Vegetable Consumption and Health Study. Participants will read a health message
      about the fruit and vegetable consumption. Participants will then answer questions about what
      they read and their beliefs about fruit and vegetable consumption. Complete a follow-up
      survey that will be emailed to you through the mTurk system a week after you complete the
      main study.

        -  Both studies in either Study 1, Study 2 and Study 3 should take about 30 minutes.

    <textblock>
      Self-affirmation, a process by which individuals reflect on cherished personal values is a
      potent means of augmenting the effectiveness of threatening health communications.
      Individuals tend to be defensive against information suggesting their behavior puts them at
      risk for disease or negative health. Previous evidence suggests that self-affirmation may
      reduce defensiveness to threatening health information, increasing openness to the message
      and resulting in increased disease risk perceptions, disease-related worry, intentions to
      engage in preventive behavior, and actual behavioral change. Understanding the mechanisms
      that explain these robust effects would yield evidence important for dissemination, including
      ways to refine self-affirmation interventions and make them more potent, which could change
      the ways that public health messages are constructed. Thus, we aim to elucidate potential
      mechanisms underlying the effectiveness of self-affirmation, including self-activation,
      general affirmation, and domain-specific affirmation. In study 1, female human subjects will
      be randomly assigned to one of eleven affirmation or self- activation conditions. Following
      the affirmation or activation task, subjects will read about the documented link between
      alcohol and breast cancer. Finally, they will be asked a series of questions about their
      intentions to reduce drinking, their perceived risk of breast cancer, and their worry about
      breast cancer. Study 2 will replicate study 1, but in a different behavioral domain (physical
      activity) and a different sample (both males and females who do not meet physical activity
      recommendations). Study 3 will extend Studies 1 and 2 by examining whether the most effective
      self-affirmations identified in these studies produce short-term increases in fruit and
      vegetable consumption. Drawing on previous research, we hypothesize these inductions will be
      effective to the degree that they involve a self-affirmation, but will not be effective if
      they involve only other-affirmation or self-activation.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Study 1:

        Amazon mTurk workers will be invited to participate if they are women over the age of 18.
        They will also be screened to meet alcohol consumption inclusion criteria. Women will be
        eligible to complete the study if they drink seven or more drinks per week (consistent with
        the alcohol consumption level the health message links to increased breast cancer risk
        (which is based on evidence in the extant breast cancer risk literature). If women report
        drinking 7 or more drinks in a sitting, they will be eligible regardless of how many times
        they drank in the past year. If they report drinking less than 7 drinks in a sitting, an
        average will be calculated to determine whether they meet inclusion criteria. For example,
        women who report drinking twice per week on average, and who drink an average of 4 drinks
        in a sitting, would be eligible for the study.

        Study 2:

        Prolific participants will be invited to take part in the study if they are over the age of
        18. They will also be screened to meet fruit and vegetable consumption inclusion criteria.
        Individuals will be eligible to complete the study if they eat fewer than 5 servings of
        fruits and vegetables per day, on average (consistent with the consumption level the health
        message, and consistent with US consumption recommendations).

        Study 3:

        Amazon mTurk workers will be invited to participate if they are over the age of 18. They
        will also be screened to meet fruit and vegetable consumption inclusion criteria.
        Individuals will be eligible to complete the study if they eat fewer than 5 servings of
        fruits and vegetables per day, on average (consistent with the consumption level the health
        message, and consistent with US consumption recommendations).

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Study1

        All men, and women who report a lower threshold of alcohol consumption, will be excluded.

        Study 2

        All individuals who report a higher threshold of physical activity will be excluded

        Study3

        All individuals who report a higher threshold of fruit and vegetable. consumption, will be
        excluded. All individuals who participated in Studies 1 and 2 will be excluded.
