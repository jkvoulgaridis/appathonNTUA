  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the long-term safety of C1-esterase inhibitor (C1-INH) in
      preventing hereditary angioedema (HAE) attacks when it is administered under the skin of
      subjects with HAE. The safety of participating subjects will be assessed for up to 54 weeks.
      The long-term efficacy of C1-INH will also be assessed. Each eligible subject will enter the
      treatment phase, wherein subjects will be randomized to treatment with either low- or
      medium-volume C1-INH. Subjects who have an insufficient treatment response during the study
      will be given an opportunity to undergo a dose increase. The study aims to enroll eligible
      subjects who completed study CSL830_3001 (NCT01912456). Subjects who did not participate in
      study CSL830_3001 may also participate, if eligible and if space permits. Subjects from the
      United States (US) who complete Treatment Period 2 will be allowed to participate in an
      Extension Period. During the Extension Period participating US subjects will continue to
      receive treatment with open-label CSL830 for up to an additional 88 weeks.

    <description>The number of subjects having at least 1 solicited local AE during a treatment were divided by the number of subjects in the corresponding treatment.

    <description>The percent of injections followed by at least one solicited adverse event. The analysis population for this endpoint was the Safety Population: The Safety Population comprised all subjects who provided informed consent / assent, who were randomized, and who received at least 1 dose or a partial dose of CSL830. This was assessed across all participants, calculated as total number of events following injections / total number of injections across all participants, in each Arm.</description>

    <description>A responder was defined as a subject with a ≥ 50% reduction in the time-normalized number of HAE attacks on CSL830 relative to the time-normalized number of HAE attacks used to qualify for participation in the current study. The analysis population for this endpoint was the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population: The ITT Population comprised all subjects who provided informed consent / assent and were randomized, regardless of whether or not they received CSL830.
