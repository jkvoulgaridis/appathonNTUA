  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot early phase I trial studies talazoparib to determine if certain characteristics of
      the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) affect how the disease responds to therapy in patients with
      ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer that has spread to other places in the
      body and usually cannot be cured or controlled with treatment (advanced). Studying samples of
      tissue in the laboratory from patients receiving talazoparib may help doctors learn more
      about the effects of talazoparib on cells and may help doctors understand how well patients
      respond to treatment.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore basal levels and effects of talazoparib (BMN 673) on DNA copy number, loss of
      heterozygosity and mutation, and level of ribonucleic acid (RNA) and protein expression
      (together described as &quot;molecular results&quot;) in homologous recombination-related pathways
      before and after treatment in women with primary advanced high grade serous ovarian,
      fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To correlate molecular results to clinical endpoints including response and survival.

      II. To correlate molecular results to pathologic endpoints including tumor volume and
      apoptosis.

      III. To compare DNA copy number and level of RNA and protein expression in homologous
      recombination-related pathways in tissue from patients treated with BMN 673 to those
      untreated with BMN 673 in the preoperative period.

      IV. To determine the toxicity of daily BMN 673 given preoperatively, with a focus on
      postoperative wound healing.

      V. To determine feasibility of daily BMN 673 given preoperatively.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive talazoparib orally (PO) once daily (QD) for up to 28 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3
      months thereafter.
