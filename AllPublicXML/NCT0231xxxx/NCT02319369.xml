    <textblock>
      This study will take place in parts:

        -  Dose Escalation (Part 1): Participants receive milademetan alone with different dose
           schedules

        -  Dose Escalation (Part 1A): Participants receive milademetan in combination with
           5-azacytidine (AZA), with different dose schedules

      The recommended dose for Part 2 will be selected.

        -  Dose Expansion (Part 2): After Part 1A, participants will receive the recommended Part 2
           dose schedule. There will be three groups - those with:

             1. refractory or relapsed acute myelogenous leukemia (AML)

             2. newly diagnosed AML unfit for intensive chemotherapy

             3. high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)

        -  End-of-Study Follow-Up: Safety information will be collected until 30 days after the
           last treatment. This is the end of the study.

      The recommended dose for the next study will be selected.

      The primary analysis will occur after all participants have either discontinued the study or
      completed at least 6 months of treatment. After the primary analysis, the main study will be
      closed. Participants who are still on study at least 6 months after enrollment of the last
      participant in the study may be eligible to continue receiving study drug in a separate
      extension phase of the protocol
