  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a three-arm, open-label, randomised Phase II study to evaluate whether the different
      sequencing of dabrafenib and trametinib monotherapies and the upfront combination has an
      impact on translational or clinical activity in subjects with BRAF mutant metastatic
      unresectable stage IIIc or IV melanoma. Both dabrafenib and trametinib have demonstrated
      clinical activity as monotherapies and in combination in BRAF-mutant melanoma. However,
      duration of responses seem to be limited due to acquired drug resistance. The goal of this
      protocol is to study the sequential effects of BRAF and MEK inhibition on skin, blood and
      tumour biomarkers and to study the correlation between biomarkers and response to treatment
      and intrapatient toxicity. Approximately 54 eligible subjects will be randomised in the ratio
      of 1:1:1 to one of the three treatment arms.

    <measure>Number of Participants With Percentage Change From Baseline in Extracellular Signal-regulated Kinase (ERK) Phosphorylation (p-ERK) H Score From Week 0 to Week 2</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0) and up to 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Intra-tumoral expression levels of ERK measured using immunohistochemistry methods. The H score value ranged from 0 to a maximum score of 300 (strongest expression) was derived by summing the percentages of cells staining at each intensity multiplied by the weighted intensity of staining (0 [no staining], 1+ [weak staining], 2+ [medium staining] and 3+ [strongest staining]). Baseline was defined as the most recent non-missing value prior to the first dose of study treatment. Percentage change from Baseline was calculated by dividing change from Baseline value by Baseline value and multiplied by 100. The data has been presented for combination therapy calculated from Week 0 to Week 2. The analysis was based on the biomarker Population which included all participants with biopsy performed at screening and at least once during treatment.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>This is an open label, randomized, phase II study to compare the combination of dabrafenib with trametinib versus the combination after eight weeks of monotherapy with dabrafenib or trametinib in metastatic and unresectable stage III or IV melanoma. The study was terminated early due to slow enrollment and limited numbers of viable tissue samples.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>This study was planned to enroll 54 participants randomized in 1:1:1 ratio into the three treatment arms; dabrafenib followed by combination therapy, trametinib followed by combination therapy and only combination therapy. The study was early terminated with 48 participants enrolled.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Number of Participants With Percentage Change From Baseline in Extracellular Signal-regulated Kinase (ERK) Phosphorylation (p-ERK) H Score From Week 0 to Week 2</title>
        <description>Intra-tumoral expression levels of ERK measured using immunohistochemistry methods. The H score value ranged from 0 to a maximum score of 300 (strongest expression) was derived by summing the percentages of cells staining at each intensity multiplied by the weighted intensity of staining (0 [no staining], 1+ [weak staining], 2+ [medium staining] and 3+ [strongest staining]). Baseline was defined as the most recent non-missing value prior to the first dose of study treatment. Percentage change from Baseline was calculated by dividing change from Baseline value by Baseline value and multiplied by 100. The data has been presented for combination therapy calculated from Week 0 to Week 2. The analysis was based on the biomarker Population which included all participants with biopsy performed at screening and at least once during treatment.</description>

        <description>Clinical response was evaluated by ORR, which was defined as the number of participants with a confirmed or an unconfirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) at any time per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1. CR was defined as disappearance of all target lesions. PR was defined as at least a 30 percent decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions. Number of participants with ORR (CR+PR) has been presented. The analysis was based on the Intent-to-Treat Population (ITT) which included all the randomized participants whether or not randomized treatment was administered.</description>

        <description>Vital signs including systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and heat rate (HR) were measured. Baseline was defined as the most recent non-missing value prior to the first dose of study treatment. Change from Baseline was defined as any visit value minus the Baseline value. The number of participants with heart rate &quot;decrease to &lt; 60&quot; and &quot;increase to &gt;100&quot; have been presented. For SBP and DBP, &quot;any grade increase&quot; have been presented. Any grade increase in SBP, including grade 0 (&lt;120), grade 1 (120-139), grade 2 (140-159), grade 3 (&gt;=160) and DBP including grade 0 (&lt;80), grade 1 (80-89), grade 2 (90-99), grade 3 (&gt;=100) have been presented. The analysis was based on the Safety Population which included all participants who received at least one dose of randomized treatment and was based on the actual treatment received.

        <title>Number of Participants With Change in Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status Scores From Baseline</title>
        <description>The ECOG scale of performance status describes the level of functioning of participants in terms of their ability to care for themselves, daily activity, and physical ability. The ECOG performance was recorded as per ECOG performance status grades ranging from 0 (fully active, able to carry on all pre-disease performance without restriction) to 5 (dead). Baseline was defined as the most recent non-missing value prior to the first dose of study treatment. Change from Baseline was defined as any visit value minus Baseline value. The Baseline performance status of participants with respect to worst-case on-therapy performance status has been presented.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Change in Clinical Chemistry Parameters From Baseline</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected for evaluation of clinical chemistry parameters including sodium, potassium, calcium, albumin, total protein, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GCT), phosphate, C-reactive protein (CRP), hypercalcemia, hyperkalemia, hypernatremia, hypocalcemia, hypokalemia, hyponatremia, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin and estimated creatinine clearance (CRTCE). Baseline was defined as the most recent non-missing value from a central laboratory prior to the first dose of study treatment. Change from Baseline was defined as any visit value minus Baseline value. The worst-case on therapy value for number of participants with any grade increase in clinical chemistry parameters for has been presented. Only those participants available at specified time point were analyzed (represented by n=x in category titles).</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected for evaluation of hematology parameters including hemoglobin, white blood cell (WBC), platelet count, basophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, total neutrophils, lymphocytopenia and lymphocytosis. Baseline was defined as the most recent non-missing value from a central laboratory prior to the first dose of study treatment. Change from Baseline was defined as any visit value minus Baseline value. The worst-case on therapy value for number of participants with any grade increase in hematology parameters for has been presented.</description>
