    <textblock>
      HIV-infected individuals on antiretroviral therapy (ART) are at increased risk for
      cardiovascular disease (CVD), likely due to chronically increased inflammation. Low-dose
      methotrexate (LDMTX) may reduce CVD risk in people with rheumatoid arthritis, who like those
      with HIV, have increased levels of inflammation. The NHLBI is funding a clinical trial
      targeting the excess inflammation in HIV. That &quot;Parent Study&quot; is a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled trial (NCT01949116) that will assess whether 24-week treatment with LDMTX:
      i) is safe, ii) reduces circulating inflammatory biomarkers and levels of immune cell
      activation and iii) improves brachial artery reactivity. However, neither the biomarkers nor
      endothelial function tests measured as part of the parent study will report on
      atherosclerotic inflammation, (the desired pathobiological target of LDMTX therapy in HIV).
      As such, the direct evaluation of arterial inflammation would substantially enhance the
      scientific value of the trial. In this imaging sub-study, the overall goal is to determine if
      treating virologically suppressed, HIV-infected individuals with LDMTX will reduce
      inflammation within the arterial wall.

      This fully integrated ancillary study would, in a subset of patients enrolled in the parent
      trial: (i) assess the impact of LDMTX on arterial inflammation, (ii) evaluate mechanisms
      responsible for arterial inflammation in HIV and iii) explore mechanisms responsible for
      actions of LDMTX on the artery wall. Accordingly, the proposed study would provide unique and
      highly complementary information that would greatly increase the knowledge and mechanistic
      insights gained from Parent Study. The ancillary study has two specific aims1) To determine
      the impact of anti-inflammatory treatment with LDMTX on arterial inflammation, as assessed by
      FDG-PET/CT imaging, in virally suppressed HIV-infected individuals., and 2) To evaluate the
      cellular and biochemical basis of the effect of LDMTX therapy on arterial inflammation in
      HIV.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HIV infection is associated with a substantially increased risk of CVD that is not fully
      accounted for by traditional risk factors. Several lines of evidence suggest that chronic
      immune cell activation may be complicit. In support of this concept, we recently used
      18F-FDG-PET/CT to demonstrate that HIV-infected individuals have increased arterial
      inflammation compared to non-HIV, FRS-matched controls and that the degree of arterial
      inflammation is related to markers of monocyte activation. Further, we and others have shown
      that increased arterial FDG uptake predicts future CVD events in non-HIV cohorts. Together,
      these observations support the concept that targeting arterial inflammation may provide
      benefit for HIV infected individuals.

      The NHLBI recently provided funding for a clinical trial targeting the excess inflammation in
      HIV. The &quot;Parent Study&quot; is being performed as a collaboration with the National Institute of
      Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) AIDS Clinical Trials Group and the NHLBI. That
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial will assess whether 24-week treatment with
      very low-dose methotrexate (LDMTX): i) is safe, ii) reduces levels of circulating
      inflammatory biomarkers and activated immune cells and iii) improves brachial artery
      reactivity (BART). However, neither the biomarkers nor the BART studies measured as part of
      Parent Study will report on atherosclerotic inflammation, (the desired pathobiological target
      of LDMTX therapy in HIV). As such, the direct evaluation of arterial inflammation would
      substantially enhance the scientific value of the Parent Study.

      Atherosclerotic inflammation can be non-invasively and reproducibly measured with FDG-PET/CT
      imaging, a well-validated quantitative technique that can sensitively detect changes in
      atherosclerotic inflammation. FDG-PET/CT imaging has been employed in several multi-center
      trials to measure changes in arterial inflammation in response to anti-inflammatory
      treatments. Accordingly, we propose a time sensitive ancillary imaging study to determine if
      treating virologically suppressed, HIV-infected individuals with LDMTX reduces
      atherosclerotic inflammation, assessed by FDG-PET/CT. Our central hypothesis is that
      persistent immune cell activation results in chronic arterial inflammation, which
      subsequently contributes to the CVD risk observed in HIV. This fully integrated ancillary
      study would, in a subset of patients enrolled in the parent trial: (i) assess the impact of
      LDMTX on arterial inflammation, and (ii) identify the immune cell subtypes whose changes
      (with LDMTX) are associated with changes in arterial inflammation. Accordingly, the proposed
      ancillary study would provide unique and highly complementary information that would greatly
      increase the knowledge and mechanistic insights gained from the Parent Study. The ancillary
      study has two specific aims:

      Specific Aim 1: To determine the impact of anti-inflammatory treatment with LDMTX on arterial
      inflammation, as assessed by FDG-PET/CT imaging, in virally suppressed HIV-infected
      individuals. [Primary and secondary outcomes]

      Knowledge Gap/Need: The parent study does not provide for assessment of the target pathology
      (arterial inflammation) hence insights regarding effects of LDMTX treatment on arterial
      inflammation are needed.

      Hypothesis 1: LDMTX therapy will reduce arterial inflammation (to a greater extent than
      placebo).

      To test hypothesis 1: We will determine in 91 patients (a subset of the parent study) if
      arterial inflammation (measured with PET/CT at 0 and 24 weeks) is reduced by LDMTX (relative
      to placebo).

      Specific Aim 2: To evaluate the cellular and biochemical mediators associated with arterial
      inflammation in HIV and to explore the potential mechanism of the effect of LDMTX therapy on
      arterial inflammation in HIV. [Exploratory outcomes]

      Knowledge Gap/Need: The parent study, on its own, does not provide the tools to directly
      evaluate arterial inflammation in HIV. Evaluation of the relationships between circulating
      inflammatory mediators and arterial inflammation in the context of this study would yeild
      mechanistic insights regarding atherosclerotic disease in HIV and provide a greater
      understanding of the effect of LDMTX on arterial inflammation in HIV.

      Hypothesis 2.1:At baseline, arterial inflammation is closely associated with measures of
      activated immune cells (CD14+/CD16+ monocytes). Additional relationships might be seen
      between arterial inflammation and other cellular subsets (e.g. T-cells), inflammatory
      cytokines, and endothelial function.

      Hypothesis 2.2: Post-treatment changes in arterial inflammation are positively correlated
      with changes in measures of activated immune cells (especially activated monocytes).

      To test these hypotheses: We will evaluate if arterial inflammation (by PET) correlates with
      inflammatory cell activation and other measured biomarkers separately. We will then compare
      the strength of the associations and test their independence. The evaluation of associations
      will be performed: comparing baseline measurements (SA 2.1), and comparing post-randomization
      changes (SA2.2).

      We expect that LDMTX therapy will improve arterial inflammation and that this mechanistic,
      proof-of-concept study will demonstrate the importance of inflammation and immune activation
      in HIV. This would thus form the basis for event-driven trials to evaluate whether
      anti-inflammatory strategies reduce CVD risk in individuals with treated HIV infection.
      Accordingly, the study has the potential to shift the paradigm in the approach to treating
      atherosclerosis in HIV-infected individuals, and potentially in other populations as well.

        NOTE: The term &quot;licensed&quot; refers to a US FDA-approved kit, which is required for all IND
        studies.

        WHO (World Health Organization) and CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)
        guidelines mandate that confirmation of the initial test result must use a test that is
        different from the one used for the initial assessment. A reactive initial rapid test
        should be confirmed by either another type of rapid assay or an E/CIA that is based on a
        different antigen preparation and/or different test principle (e.g., indirect versus
        competitive), or a Western blot or a plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load.

        1.2 Currently on continuous ART for ≥24 weeks prior to study entry. This is defined as
        continuous active therapy for the 24-week period prior to study entry with no treatment

        assay used for eligibility can be performed by any US laboratory that has a CLIA
        certification or its equivalent.

        NOTE: Single determinations that are between the assay quantification limit and 200
        copies/mL are allowed as long as the preceding and subsequent determinations are below the
        level of quantification.

        1.5 The following laboratory values obtained within 60 days prior to study entry by any US
        laboratory that has a CLIA certification or its equivalent;

        1.6 Females subjects who are postmenopausal (i.e., of non-childbearing potential), defined
        as having either:

          1. Appropriate medical documentation of prior hysterectomy and/or complete bilateral
             oophorectomy (i.e., surgical removal of the ovaries, resulting in &quot;surgical menopause&quot;
             and occurring at the age at which the procedure was performed), OR

          2. Permanent cessation of previously occurring menses as a result of ovarian failure with
             documentation of hormonal deficiency by a certified healthcare provider (i.e.,
             &quot;spontaneous menopause&quot;). Hormonal deficiency should be properly documented in the
             case of suspected spontaneous menopause as follows:

               1. If age &gt;54 years and with the absence of normal menses for at least 24
                  consecutive months: serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level elevated to
                  within the post-menopausal range based on the laboratory reference range where
                  the hormonal assay is performed;

               2. If age ≤ 54 years and with the absence of normal menses for at least 24
                  consecutive months: Negative serum or urine (β-HCG) performed within 48 hours
                  prior to study entry with concurrently elevated serum FSH level in the
                  post-menopausal range, depressed estradiol (E2) level in the post-menopausal
                  range, and absent serum progesterone level, based on the laboratory reference
                  ranges where the hormonal assays are performed.

        1.7 Male subjects must agree not to participate in a conception process (i.e., active
        attempt to impregnate, sperm donation). If participating in sexual activity that could lead
        to pregnancy, the male subject must agree to the use of TWO reliable forms of
        contraceptives simultaneously while on study and for a minimum of 3 months after therapy.

        At least TWO of the following contraceptives MUST be used appropriately by male subjects
        and their female partners:

          -  Condoms (male or female) with or without a spermicidal agent

          -  Diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide

          -  Intrauterine device (IUD)

          -  Tubal ligation

          -  Hormone-based contraceptive

        NOTES: Sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy is not applicable to sexual activity
        with an infertile partner.

        Acceptable documentation for the use of two methods of contraceptives is the male subject's
        report of use of a second form of contraceptive by his female partner.

        1.8 Subjects who are not of reproductive potential (defined as women who have been
        postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months or men who have documented vasectomy) are
        eligible for the study without requiring the use of contraceptives. In order to verify lack
        of reproductive potential, written documentation or verbal communication by the clinician
        or clinician's staff of one of the following must be in the source documents:

          -  Physician report/letter.

          -  Operative report or other source documentation in the patient record.

          -  Discharge summary.

          -  Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) measurement elevated into the menopausal range as
             established by the reporting laboratory.

        NOTES: Any statement of self-reported sterility or infertility (or that of a partner's)
        should be entered into the source document.

        Females who report being postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months but who do not
        have documentation of postmenopausal status from a clinician will have the hormonal
        assessments performed prior to study entry.

        1 ounce of spirits.

        2.17 Active drug or alcohol use or dependence that, in the opinion of the site
        investigator, would interfere with adherence to study requirements.

        2.18 Changes in lipid-lowering or antihypertensive medication within 90 days prior to study
        entry or expected need to modify these medications during the study.

        NOTE: Lipid-lowering medication includes: statins, fibrates, niacin (dose ≥250 mg daily),
        and fish-oil/omega 3 fatty acids (dose &gt;1000 mg of marine oils daily).

        2.19 Vaccination (e.g., influenza, pneumococcal polysaccharide) within 14 days prior to
        study entry.

        2.20 Anticipated need to receive vaccination (e.g., influenza, pneumococcal polysaccharide)
        within 1 week prior to week 4, 12, 24, or 36 study visits.

        2.21 Excess extracompartmental fluids including ascites, pericardial fluid, and pleural
        effusions which, in the opinion of the study investigators, would result in difficulty in
        monitoring the dose of MTX.

        2.22 Use of drugs that alter folic acid metabolism such as trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or
        reduce tubular excretion such as probenecid within 14 days prior to study entry.

        2.23 New York Heart Association Class IV congestive heart failure.

        2.24 Diabetes mellitus with HbA1C &gt;8.0% within the past 90 days prior to study entry.

        2.25 Patients who report any significant radiation exposure over the course of the year
        prior to randomization. Significant exposure is defined as:

        i) More than 2 PCI within 12 months of randomization ii) More than 2 myocardial perfusion
        studies within the past 12 months iii) More than 2 CT angiograms within the past 12 months
        iv) Any subjects with history of radiation therapy.

        2.26 Current daily use of insulin.

          <title>Change in Arterial FDG Uptake (From Baseline) in the Aorta</title>
          <description>Arterial FDG Uptake provides a measure of inflammation in the artery wall.
TBR is target-to-background ratio (a measure of the ratio of the activity in the vessel wall divided by the blood background). A negative number for the change in TBR implies a reduction in activity over time.
The entire ascending aorta is used for this analysis.
The results are expressed as the change in the median value, of the TBR, from baseline to week 24</description>

          <title>Low Dose Methotrexate</title>
          <description>Subjects will take 1 mg folic acid once daily plus 5 mg methotrexate (MTX) . If clinically stable at the week 1 visit, the dose of MTX will be increased to 10 mg once weekly through week 12. For subjects who remain clinically stable on 10 mg MTX or placebo through the week 12 visit, the dose of MTX will be increased to 15 mg once weekly through week 24. If the subject does not meet the criteria for dose escalation at the week 1 or 12 study visit, then the subject will remain on his/her current dose until the next study visit at which time he/she will be re-evaluated for dose escalation.
