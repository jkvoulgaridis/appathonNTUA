  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Intranasal Tear
      Neurostimulator applied intranasally compared with the same device applied extranasally
      (control) in treating the symptoms of dry eye exacerbated by the Controlled Adverse
      Environment (CAE) Model.

    <measure>Change From Pre-Application to Post-Application in the Ora Calibra Ocular Discomfort Scale (ODS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-application to Post-application on Day 0</time_frame>
    <description>The participant graded their eye discomfort prior to CAE entry, during CAE exposure to threshold, then starting 1 minute after treatment application every 5 minutes in each eye separately using the Ora Calibra ODS where: 0=no discomfort to 4=constant discomfort. Data from the analysis eye was used to determine effectiveness. The analysis eye was defined as the first eye that reached the threshold and resulted in the device application. If both eyes reached the threshold at the same time point, the analysis eye was the eye with the lowest baseline Schirmer test score (a test to determine if the eye produces enough tears to keep it moist; &gt;10 mm is normal) or, if the Schirmer test scores were equal, the right eye. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>

    <description>The participant rated their eye dryness (both eyes simultaneously) at all visits and every 5 minutes during CAE exposure by placing a vertical mark on the 100 mm horizontal line to indicate the level of eye dryness. 0 corresponds to &quot;no dryness&quot; and 100 corresponds to &quot;maximal dryness&quot;.

          <title>Change From Pre-Application to Post-Application in Dry Eye Symptoms (DES) Using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS)</title>
          <description>The participant rated their eye dryness (both eyes simultaneously) at all visits and every 5 minutes during CAE exposure by placing a vertical mark on the 100 mm horizontal line to indicate the level of eye dryness. 0 corresponds to &quot;no dryness&quot; and 100 corresponds to &quot;maximal dryness&quot;. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>
          <population>PP Population was defined as all participants that were able to return to the threshold level following both treatments and did not have any significant protocol violations that might be expected to alter the outcome of their study results</population>
