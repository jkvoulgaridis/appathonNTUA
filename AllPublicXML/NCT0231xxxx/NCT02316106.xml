      The purpose of this study is to evaluate three daratumumab dose schedules in participants
      with Smoldering Multiple Myeloma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label (identity of assigned treatment will be known to
      participants and study staff), 3-arm (3 treatment groups), multicenter study of daratumumab
      in participants diagnosed with intermediate or high-risk Smoldering Multiple Myeloma (SMM
      [ie, early disease without any symptoms]). Participants will be randomized (assigned by
      chance) to one of 3 treatment groups (arm A [long intense], arm B [intermediate] and arm C
      [short intense]) to receive daratumumab. Each treatment group will investigate 1 of 3 dosing
      schedules of daratumumab. The study will include a 28-Day Screening Phase, a Treatment Phase
      of 1 to 20 treatment cycles (each cycle is 8 weeks in duration for total period of 8 to 160
      weeks), and a Follow up Phase of 4-weeks from the last dose of study drug. For participants
      in Arm A (long intense) and Arm B (intermediate), there is a possibility to extend treatment
      with IV daratumumab (Q8W) after the end of Cycle 20 if, as per investigator discretion, there
      is a positive benefit/risk ratio, absence of Grade &gt;=3 treatment related toxicity, and at
      least stable disease has been achieved. For participants participating in treatment
      extension, the duration of infusion may be shortened to a 90-minute infusion or can switch to
      daratumumab 1800mg subcutaneous (Q8w). The Follow-up Phase will continue until death, lost to
      follow up, consent withdrawal, or study end, whichever occurs first. The end of the study
      will occur approximately 5 years after the last participant enrolled receives a first dose of
      study drug. 'Disease assessment will be performed locally per Standard of Care.
