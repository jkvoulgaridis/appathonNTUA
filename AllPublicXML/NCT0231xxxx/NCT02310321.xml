  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of phase 1 part in this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
      and/or recommended expansion dose (RED) of ASP2215 concomitant with cytarabine/idarubicin as
      induction chemotherapy based on the status of the onset of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in
      newly diagnosed Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) subjects. Phase 1 part will also evaluate safety
      and tolerability and characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of ASP2215 concomitant
      with induction and consolidation chemotherapy as well as evaluate the PK parameters of
      cytarabine concomitant with ASP2215.

      The purpose of phase 2 part is to evaluate efficacy of ASP2215 in combination with induction
      therapy. Phase 2 cohort will also evaluate safety and characterize the PK parameters of
      ASP2215 in combination with induction and consolidation therapy followed by maintenance
      therapy in newly diagnosed FLT3-mutated AML subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is composed of Phase 1 part (the dose-evaluation part and the expansion part) and
      Phase 2 part.

      In the dose-evaluation part of Phase 1 part, at least 3 subjects will receive ASP2215 at each
      dose (low, middle, and high) for determination of MTD and/or RED. Treatment of AML in Phase 1
      part is composed of 3 periods of therapy: remission induction, consolidation, and
      maintenance. The decision of whether or not to proceed to the next dose will be made based on
      the occurrence of DLT during Cycle 1 of the induction period.

      In the expansion part of Phase 1 part, a maximum of 3 subjects will receive ASP2215 at RED
      that has been recommended in the dose-evaluation part and the safety will be assessed based
      on the onset of DLTs during Cycle 1 of the induction and consolidation periods.

      In Phase 2 part, Subjects will receive ASP2215 at the recommended dose established in Phase 1
      part. The target population will be limited to newly diagnosed FLT3-mutated AML.

      New locations for Phase 2 part will be selected and added, while locations for Phase 1 part
      are shown as 'Completed'.
