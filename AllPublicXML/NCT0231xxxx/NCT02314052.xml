  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of the investigational
      anticancer drug DCR-MYC. DCR-MYC is a novel synthetic double-stranded RNA in a stable lipid
      particle suspension that targets the oncogene MYC. MYC oncogene activation is important to
      the growth of many hematologic and solid tumor malignancies. In this study the Sponsor
      proposes to study DCR-MYC and its ability to inhibit MYC and thereby inhibit cancer cell
      growth.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this second study in humans, DCR-MYC will be administered by 2 hour intravenous (IV)
      infusion, once weekly for 2 weeks followed by a rest week (3 weeks = 1 cycle), to patients
      with hepatocellular carcinoma who are either sorafenib-refractory, sorafenib-intolerant
      despite dose reduction and best supportive care, or for whom neither sorafenib nor other
      suitable therapy is available. During the Phase 1b portion of the study, the highest safe
      dose of DCR-MYC that can be administered will be identified. In addition, the pharmacokinetic
      (PK) profile, potential pharmacodynamic (PD) effects, as well as the preliminary antitumor
      activity of DCR-MYC will be evaluated. During the Phase 2 portion of the study, up to 30
      patients will be treated at the MTD identified in Phase 1b in order to further evaluate
      safety and tolerability, as well as assess the antitumor activity, of DCR-MYC.

DCR-MYC: Dosing: 2 hour IV infusion on Day 1 and 8 of each 21 day cycle.
Starting dose: 0.125mg/kg/dose
Number of cycles: until progression or unacceptable toxicity develops.
PHASE 1b Dose escalation: 50% or 25% increase in subsequent cohorts depending upon toxicity until maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is identified.
PHASE 2 Cohort expansion at the MTD: Additional patients to be treated at the highest dose tolerated to assess efficacy and further assess safety</description>

        <description>Collection of blood samples for cytokine measurements (Day 1, 2, and 4). No noteworthy increases were observed across dose groups or time for GM-CSF, IFNα, IFNɣ, or IL-1β. Changes that were observed for the other cytokines were not dose-dependent since they occurred sporadically and primarily in Cohorts 3 (0.3 mg/kg) and 4 (0.45 mg/kg). Pre-dose, 4 hours post-dose, and 24 hour post-dose results for TNF-α, IL-10, IL-6, IL-8, IL-1RA, and MCP-1 are summarized here.</description>
