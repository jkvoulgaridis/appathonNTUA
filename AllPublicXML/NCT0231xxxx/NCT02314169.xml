    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well nivolumab with or without ipilimumab works in treating
      patients with anal canal cancer that has not responded to previous treatment (refractory) and
      has spread to other places in the body (metastatic). Immunotherapy with monoclonal
      antibodies, such as nivolumab and ipilimumab, may help the body's immune system attack the
      cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate overall response rate (ORR) with nivolumab in patients with previously treated
      metastatic squamous cell carcinoma (SCCA) of the anal canal. (Part A) II. To determine an
      improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) when nivolumab is combined with ipilimumab
      versus (vs.) nivolumab alone in patients with previously treated metastatic SCCA (Part B).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate progression-free survival (PFS) of nivolumab in patients with previously
      treated metastatic SCCA of the anal canal. (Part A) II. To evaluate overall survival (OS) in
      patients with previously treated metastatic SCCA of the anal canal treated with nivolumab.
      (Part A) III. To evaluate the grade 3 and 4 toxicity rate in patients with previously treated
      metastatic SCCA of the anal canal when treated with nivolumab. (Part A) IV. To evaluate the
      overall response rate (ORR) of nivolumab plus or minus ipilimumab in patients with previously
      treated metastatic SCCA of the anal canal. (Part B) V. To evaluate overall survival (OS) in
      patients with previously treated metastatic SCCA of the anal canal treated with nivolumab
      plus or minus ipilimumab. (Part B) VI. To evaluate the grade 3 and 4 toxicity rate in
      patients with previously treated metastatic SCCA of the anal canal when treated with
      nivolumab plus or minus ipilimumab. (Part B)

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate ORR, PFS, and OS based on expression of programmed cell death 1 ligand 1
      (PD-L1), programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), peritumoral cluster of differentiation (CD)8+ tumor
      infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), peritumoral CD4+ TILs, and regulatory T cells as analyzed
      from tumor biopsies in previously treated patients with metastatic SCCA of the anal canal
      when treated with nivolumab. (Part A) II. To evaluate radiographic responses according to
      relative changes in proportions of anti-human papillomavirus (HPV) specific CD8+ and CD4+
      TILs and regulatory T cells in patients with previously treated metastatic SCCA of the anal
      canal following treatment with nivolumab, analyzed from serial peripheral blood samples.
      (Part A) III. To evaluate ORR, PFS, and OS based on expression of PD-L1, PD-1, peritumoral
      CD8+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), peritumoral CD4+ TILs, and regulatory T cells as
      analyzed from tumor biopsies in previously treated patients with metastatic SCCA of the anal
      canal when treated with nivolumab plus or minus ipilimumab. (Part B) IV. To evaluate
      radiographic responses according to relative changes in proportions of anti-HPV specific CD8+
      and CD4+ TILs and regulatory T cells in patients with previously treated metastatic SCCA of
      the anal canal following treatment with nivolumab plus or minus ipilimumab. (Part B)

      OUTLINE:

      PART A: Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes once every two weeks.
      Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PART B: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive nivolumab IV over 30 minutes once every 4 weeks. Treatment continues
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive nivolumab as in Arm I. Patients also receive ipilimumab IV over 30
      minutes once every 8 weeks. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 100 days and then every 3
      months for 2 years.

             investigational product; these durations have been calculated using the upper limit of
             the half-life for nivolumab (25 days) and are based on the protocol requirement that

             been pregnant at the time of investigational product exposure, including during at
             least 6 half-lives after product administration, the investigational product will be
             permanently discontinued in an appropriate manner (e.g., dose tapering if necessary

             pregnancy that occurs in a female partner of a male study participant should be
             reported to the sponsor. Information on this pregnancy will be collected on the
             Pregnancy Surveillance Form; protocol-required procedures for study discontinuation
             and follow-up must be performed on the subject unless contraindicated by pregnancy
             (e.g., X-ray studies); other appropriate pregnancy follow-up procedures should be
             considered if indicated. In addition, the investigator must report and follow-up on

             study requirements

          -  Patients with active autoimmune disease or history of autoimmune disease that might
             recur, which may affect vital organ function or require immune suppressive treatment
             including chronic prolonged systemic corticosteroids (defined as corticosteroid use of
             duration one month or greater), should be excluded; these include but are not limited
             to patients with a history of immune related neurologic disease, multiple sclerosis,
             autoimmune (demyelinating) neuropathy, Guillain-Barre syndrome, myasthenia gravis;
             systemic autoimmune disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), connective
             tissue diseases, scleroderma, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn's, ulcerative
             colitis, and patients with a history of toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN),
             Stevens-Johnson syndrome, or anti-phospholipid syndrome should be excluded

          -  Patients should be excluded if they have a condition requiring systemic treatment with
             either corticosteroids (&gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other
             immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of study drug administration; inhaled or
             topical steroids and adrenal replacement doses =&lt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents
             are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease; patients are permitted to
             use topical, ocular, intra-articular, intranasal, and inhalational corticosteroids
             (with minimal systemic absorption); physiologic replacement doses of systemic
             corticosteroids are permitted, even if =&lt; 10 mg/day prednisone equivalents; a brief
             course of corticosteroids for prophylaxis (e.g., contrast dye allergy) or for
             treatment of non-autoimmune conditions (e.g., delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction
             caused by contact allergen) is permitted

          -  No other prior malignancy is allowed except for the following: adequately treated
             basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, adequately treated
             stage I or II cancer from which the patient is currently in complete remission, or any
             other cancer from which the patient has been disease free for at least three years
