  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Consistent treatment with anti-retroviral therapy (ART) suppresses viral load (VL),
      prolonging life and improving quality of life for HIV+ persons. Suppressing VL benefits
      communities by reducing transmission to others. Mere availability of ART and care, however,
      is insufficient; the benefits of ART depend upon HIV+ persons' continuous visits to the
      health care provider, regular monitoring and regular delivery of medications, - known as
      retention in HIV care. In spite of national efforts, up to a quarter of HIV+ persons,
      especially low-income minorities are out of care. Innovative interventions are therefore
      urgently needed to maximize engagement and retention in HIV care, self-reported adherence, as
      well as HIV-1 RNA viral load suppression. In pursuit of these aims, the proposed study will
      assess outcomes of the following interventions in comparison to usual care: 1) contingency
      management (CM) only; 2) peer navigation (PN) only; and 3) a combined approach that
      integrates both CM and PN (CA) which the investigators hypothesize to be most effective in
      improving HIV clinical outcomes.
