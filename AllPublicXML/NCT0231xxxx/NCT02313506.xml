  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical activity is an essential first-line treatment for patients with knee osteoarthritis
      (OA). However, a 2013 systematic review found only 13% met the activity recommendation of 150
      minutes or more per week. The primary goal of this pilot randomized controlled trail is to
      assess the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a multi-component intervention/model of
      care involving a group education session, use of the Fitbit Flex (a wireless physical
      activity tracking device), and weekly telephone counselling by a physiotherapist (PT) to
      improve physical activity and reduce sedentary time in patients with knee OA.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is common (affecting 1 in 10), painful, and debilitating. Being
      physically active improves pain, mobility and quality of life for people living with knee OA;
      however, less than half of patients are active. Combining the best evidence in OA care and
      digital technology, the investigators propose a new model of care for improving physical
      activity in patients with OA.

      The investigators primary objective is to determine the feasibility and preliminary efficacy
      of a multi-component model of care involving 1) a group education and structured goal-setting
      session, 2) the use of Fitbit Flex (a commercially available physical activity tracker) and
      3) weekly telephone activity counselling by a physiotherapist for improving physical activity
      and reducing sedentary time in patients with knee OA.

      In this pilot randomized controlled trial the investigators hypothesize that compared to a
      control group (i.e. the Delayed Intervention group), participants in the Immediate
      Intervention Group will 1) increase moderate/vigorous physical activity (MVPA), 2) reduce
      sedentary time, 3) improve OA disease status, and 4) improve abilities to self-manage their
      condition.

    <time_frame>Baseline; 1 month and 2 months from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Participants wore a SenseWear Mini device for 7 days at baseline, and Months 1 and 2. We calculated the average time spent in MVPA accumulated in bouts per day. A bout is defined as 10 consecutive minutes or more at the level of 3 or higher METs, with allowance for interruption of up to 1 minute below the threshold.</description>

    <measure>KOOS - Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; 1 month and 2 months from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Symptoms were measured by Knee Injury and OA Outcome Score (KOOS). The KOOS measures knee osteoarthritis disease status and consists of five sub-scales: knee pain, stiffness, daily activity, sports/recreation, and quality of life. Scores range from 0 to 100, with higher being better.</description>

            <description>Education session, Fitbit Flex, and remote coaching by a PT. These three components of the intervention will be delivered to the participants in Month 1. At the end of the education session, the PT will help participants set personal activity goals. In Month 1, participants will use the Fitbit Flex. The PT will review the progress with participants via 20-minute weekly phone calls and progressively modify their activities. In Month 2, they will continue using the Fitbit and have access to a PT via email as needed, but no weekly phone calls.
Education session, Fitbit Flex, and remote coaching by a PT: Participants will receive a brief education session, use of a commercially available physical activity tracker (Fitbit Flex), and remote counselling by a PT. Intervention will be received immediately.</description>
