    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of talazoparib when given together
      with carboplatin and paclitaxel in treating patients with solid tumors that have spread to
      other places in the body (advanced) or cannot be removed by surgery. Talazoparib may stop the
      growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as carboplatin and paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth
      of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping
      them from spreading. Giving talazoparib with carboplatin and paclitaxel may kill more tumor
      cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of
      talazoparib (BMN 673) seven day schedule in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel.

      II. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of
      talazoparib (BMN 673) three day schedule in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity of talazoparib (BMN 673) in combination with
      carboplatin and paclitaxel.

      II. To determine whether the pharmacokinetic parameters of talazoparib (BMN 673) when given
      in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel correlate with thrombocytopenia.

      III. To observe and record anti-tumor activity of talazoparib (BMN 673) alone after the
      combination with carboplatin, paclitaxel and talazoparib (BMN 673).

      IV. To observe the safety and tolerability of talazoparib (BMN 673) in combination with
      paclitaxel and carboplatin and talazoparib (BMN 673) alone after the combination therapy.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To serially evaluate pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics parameters and use indirect
      pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics models to correlate with tumor response and resistance to
      the combination talazoparib (BMN 673), carboplatin, and paclitaxel therapy.

      II. To explore mechanisms of resistance to the combination of talazoparib (BMN 673) with
      carboplatin and paclitaxel.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of talazoparib. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2
      dosing schedules.

      SCHEDULE A: Patients receive talazoparib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-7, paclitaxel
      intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15, and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on
      day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4-6 cycles in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      SCHEDULE B: Patients receive talazoparib PO QD on days 1-3, paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on days
      1, 8, and 15, and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days
      for 4-6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      At any time after 4-6 cycles of treatment, patients may continue combination study therapy
      with talazoparib, carboplatin, and paclitaxel, talazoparib and carboplatin, talazoparib alone
      (continuous dosing), or observation without therapy at the discretion of the treating
      physician.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.

             to the combination of carboplatin/paclitaxel OR b) BRCA 1/2 germline mutation is
             present; due to the longstanding acceptance of BRCA 1 and 2 mutation testing through
             Myriad, results from Myriad will be acceptable; if testing for BRCA 1 and 2 germline
             mutations is done through another organization, a report from a genetics consult with
             a qualified medical professional confirming that the laboratory results show a
             recognized germline deleterious BRCA 1 or 2 mutation or rearrangement is required; if
             the latter cannot be obtained, principal investigator (PI) or study chair review of
             the lab results and confirmation of BRCA mutation or rearrangement will be required OR

             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because talazoparib (BMN 673) is a PARP
             inhibitor with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there
             is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother with talazoparib (BMN 673), breastfeeding should be
             discontinued if the mother is treated with talazoparib (BMN 673); these potential
             risks may also apply to other agents used in this study

          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients on combination antiretroviral
             therapy are ineligible because of the potential for interactions with study treatment;
             in addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated
             with marrow-suppressive therapy; appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated

          -  No clinically significant bleeding (i.e. gastrointestinal [GI] bleed, intracranial
             bleeding) within 6 months or major surgery within 4 weeks; minor surgeries (i.e. port
             placement, cataract surgery) are allowed within 2 weeks

          -  Anticoagulation and anti-platelet therapies are not permitted (this includes coumadin,
             low molecular weight heparins, factor Xa inhibitors, aspirin and non-steroidal
             anti-inflammatory drug [NSAIDS] or other medicines with similar effects)
