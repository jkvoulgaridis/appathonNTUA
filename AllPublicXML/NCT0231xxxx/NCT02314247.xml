  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, multi-center, open-label phase 2 study of the SINE™ compound selinexor
      given orally to patients with relapsed or refractory PTCL or CTCL.

      Approximately 60 patients with relapsed or refractory PTCL or CTCL who meet the eligibility
      criteria and have none of the exclusion criteria will be enrolled to receive selinexor until
      either disease progression or intolerance has occurred.

      This is a single-arm, multi-center, open-label phase 2 study of the SINE™ compound selinexor
      given orally to patients with relapsed or refractory PTCL or CTCL.

      Approximately 60 patients with relapsed or refractory PTCL or CTCL who meet the eligibility
      criteria and have none of the exclusion criteria will be enrolled to receive selinexor until
      either disease progression or intolerance has occurred.

      Enrolled patients will be given selinexor as an oral fixed 60 mg dose (equivalent to ~35
      mg/m²) on Days 1 and 3 of Weeks 1-4 of each 4-week cycle (total 8 doses per cycle).

      There is no maximum treatment duration. Patients will receive supportive therapy to mitigate
      selinexor side effects, as well as best supportive care (BSC).

      Patients enrolled under Protocol Versions &lt;3.0 were to receive selinexor orally, at a fixed
      dose of 60 mg (equivalent to ~35 mg/m²) on Days 1 and 3 of Weeks 1-3 of each 4-week cycle
      (total of 6 doses per cycle). Selinexor was not taken during Week 4.

      For all patients enrolled in this study (regardless of the protocol version) who continued
      onto Cycle 3 and forward, the dose was to be increased by 20 mg to 80 mg (administered on
      Days 1 and 3 of Weeks 1-4), only after consultation with the Sponsor's Medical Monitor.

    <description>Overall Response (OR) = Complete Response (CR) + Partial Response (PR). Objective disease response assessment in PTCL patients was made according to the revised response criteria based on the International Working Group (IWG) guidelines for malignant lymphoma (Cheson, 2007). Objective disease response assessment in CTCL patients was assessed according to the revised CTCL Consensus Response Criteria (Olsen, 2011) using physical examination, including the Modified Severity Weighted Assessment Tool (mSWAT) for skin assessment. CTCL Global Response Score was used as a secondary efficacy assessment. Progression was defined as the first occurrence of progressive disease (PD) per the revised response criteria. Clinical disease progression in the absence of formal criteria for PD must be documented by a physician.</description>

Objective disease response assessment in PTCL patients was made according to the revised response criteria based on the International Working Group (IWG) guidelines for malignant lymphoma (Cheson, 2007). Objective disease response assessment in CTCL patients was assessed according to the revised CTCL Consensus Response Criteria (Olsen, 2011) using physical examination, including the Modified Severity Weighted Assessment Tool (mSWAT) for skin assessment. CTCL Global Response Score was used as a secondary efficacy assessment. Progression was defined as the first occurrence of progressive disease (PD) per the revised response criteria. Clinical disease progression in the absence of formal criteria for PD must be documented by a physician.</description>
        <time_frame>Disease response was assessed at screening and every 8 weeks (patients with PTCL); or at Cycle 1 Day 1 and every 4 weeks (patients with CTCL), until disease progression.</time_frame>
        <population>Due to the limited enrollment in this study, only the Intent to Treat (ITT) Population, consisting of all patients who received at least 1 dose of study treatment (which is identical to the Safety Population), was evaluated for efficacy.</population>

        <description>Patients whose best overall response to study treatment was PD. Progression was defined as the first occurrence of progressive disease (PD). Objective disease response assessment in PTCL patients was made according to the revised response criteria based on the International Working Group (IWG) guidelines for malignant lymphoma (Cheson, 2007). Objective disease response assessment in CTCL patients was assessed according to the revised CTCL Consensus Response Criteria (Olsen, 2011) using physical examination, including the Modified Severity Weighted Assessment Tool (mSWAT) for skin assessment. CTCL Global Response Score was used as a secondary efficacy assessment. Clinical disease progression in the absence of formal criteria for PD must be documented by a physician.</description>
        <time_frame>Disease response was assessed at screening and every 8 weeks (patients with PTCL); or at Cycle 1 Day 1 and every 4 weeks (patients with CTCL), until disease progression.</time_frame>

    <certain_agreements>
      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>There IS an agreement between Principal Investigators and the Sponsor (or its agents) that restricts the PI's rights to discuss or publish trial results after the trial is completed. </restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>Due to unexpectedly slow recruitment, the Sponsor decided to terminate the study after 16 patients had been enrolled. The small study population limits the evaluation of both efficacy and safety of selinexor in patients with PTCL or CTCL.</limitations_and_caveats>
