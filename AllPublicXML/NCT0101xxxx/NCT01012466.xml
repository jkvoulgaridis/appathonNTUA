  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether labor self-efficacy (as determined by
      scores for the Lederman PSEQ II (self-efficacy scores) impacts the second stage 2 length
      (nromal vs. prolonged) as determined by quartile ranges for our sample. Other studies have
      shown that women who experience intense pain in the earliest stages of labor have a higher
      risk of complications. The investigators want to know if negative thoughts can predict this
      outcome.

      Subjects will complete questionnaires at three timepoints: during the prenatal period, within
      24-48 hours of giving birth, and 4-8 weeks postpartum. The questionnaires will measure pain
      catastrophizing, depression, maternal support, support and control in birth, and childbirth
      satisfaction. Chart review following delivery will record data such as length of labor,
      medication used, need for augmentation or surgical delivery, complications.
