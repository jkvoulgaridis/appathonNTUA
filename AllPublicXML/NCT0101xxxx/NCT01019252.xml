  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will be an initial test of a cognitive-behavioral intervention for
      adolescents with ADHD who are receiving medication treatment. It is based on our successful
      work with adults with ADHD who have been treated with medicines but are still having
      symptoms. It involves learning skills for organization and planning, attention, and mood.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent, distressing, and interfering
      condition that affects between 2% and 6% of adolescents. Although medications have been
      widely used as an effective treatment for many years as the sole treatment for ADHD, for
      many, clinically significant and interfering continued symptoms remain. Even after medication
      treatment, adolescents still experience residual ADHD symptoms and continue to have problems
      with inattention, concentration, disorganization, and other symptoms. However, research
      suggests that adolescents who have received some benefit from medication treatment can then
      experience further symptom reduction from participation in skills-based cognitive behavioral
      therapy. This study, adapted from a similar research study for adults with ADHD, will examine
      whether cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) plus medication is more effective at treating ADHD
      than medication therapy alone in adolescents with ADHD.

      Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to receive twelve weekly treatment sessions
      either immediately upon enrolling in the study or after a four-month waiting period.
      Questionnaires (that participants complete and ones that are done with an interviewer) will
      be used to assess participants' ADHD symptoms at study entry, after receiving the treatment,
      and at 4 month follow-up. Parents will have some involvement in therapy.

      Note: participants must be able to come to Boston or another study location in the Greater
      Boston area for 4 assessment visits and 12 weekly therapy visits in order for participation
      to be feasible.

    <description>-Independent blinded evaluator rated adolescent report of symptom severity (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Rating Scale-IV). The independent evaluator administered the ADHD rating scale-IV to adolescent participants. This scale, updated for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Ed. (DSM-IV), assesses each of 18 individual symptoms of ADHD using an identical four-point severity grid (0 = not present up to 3 = severe; minimum total score = 0, maximum total score =54, with higher scores indicating greater symptomatology). The CBT for ADHD change score was calculated by combining the data for all participants who received CBT for ADHD (both those who received it between baseline and the 4-month assessment and those who received it between the 4-month and the 8-month assessment). The wait list control score represents only those participants who were in the wait list condition between the baseline and the 4-month assessment points.</description>

    <description>-Independent, blinded evaluator rating of ADHD symptom severity (Clinical Global Impressions - severity scale). The Clinical Global Impression (CGI) Scale is a widely used rating scale to measure overall severity related to ADHD symptoms. The Global Severity rating ranges from; 1=not ill, to 7= extremely ill, with higher scores indicating greater severity.The CBT for ADHD change score was calculated by combining the data for all participants who received CBT for ADHD (both those who received it between baseline and the 4-month assessment and those who received it between the 4-month and the 8-month assessment). The wait list control score represents only those participants who were in the wait list condition between the baseline and the 4-month assessment points.</description>

          <description>All participants completed seven modules of treatment over twelve sessions, ten of which were 1:1 with the therapist and adolescent, and two of which also included the parent. Two additional optional parent-only sessions were offered as well. For each 1:1 session the parent was included for approximately ten minutes, generally at the end of the session, to discuss progress, the course of intervention content, and how the parent could assist with any take-home practice. 21 of the participants crossed-over to the wait list condition (received no further treatment) between the 4-month and 8-month assessments.
Modules were adapted from the PI's intervention designed for ADHD in adults. Modules included: psychoeducation and organization/planning (4 session); distractibility (2 sessions); adaptive thinking/cognitive restructuring (2 sessions); procrastination (1 session); parent-adolescent sessions (2 sessions); parent-only sessions (1 session); relapse prevention (1 session).</description>

For those who were still willing to cross-over to receive CBT, the research assistant contacted parents to schedule the 4-month assessment visit with the independent evaluator and the first CBT session after the evaluation for participants. 19 participants crossed-over to receive CBT between the 4-month and 8-month assessments. Of the 19 who crossed-over, 15 completed the CBT treatment.</description>

The independent evaluator administered the ADHD rating scale-IV to adolescent participants. This scale, updated for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Ed. (DSM-IV), assesses each of 18 individual symptoms of ADHD using an identical four-point severity grid (0 = not present up to 3 = severe; minimum total score = 0, maximum total score =54, with higher scores indicating greater symptomatology). The CBT for ADHD change score was calculated by combining the data for all participants who received CBT for ADHD (both those who received it between baseline and the 4-month assessment and those who received it between the 4-month and the 8-month assessment). The wait list control score represents only those participants who were in the wait list condition between the baseline and the 4-month assessment points.</description>
