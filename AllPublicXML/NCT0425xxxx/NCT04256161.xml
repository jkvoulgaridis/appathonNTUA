  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the investigators's previous work, measurements of intra-prostatic concentrations of sex
      steroids were determined on samples taken from the operating room using a punch.

      In order to study the in-vivo intra-prostatic concentrations of sex steroid, it is necessary
      to validate a measurement technique performed on samples obtained by a biopsy needle used in
      standard care for prostate biopsy punctures allowing the diagnosis and follow-up of prostate
      cancer.

      The aim of this project is to validate this measurement technique carried out on samples
      obtained by the biopsy needle and to define the optimal number of carrots obtained by biopsy
      offering dosage results comparable to the punch.
