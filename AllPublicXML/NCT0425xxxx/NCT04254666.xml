  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the feasibility of a physical literacy and food literacy
      intervention for children with Intellectual Disabilities ages 12-16 years. The Investigators
      plan to assess preliminary efficacy of the intervention for increasing 1) physical literacy
      including movement skills, physical self-concept, and desire to participate in physical
      activity and 2) food literacy including knowledge around making healthy food choices, basic
      food preparation skills, and engaging in healthy eating behavior.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children with intellectual disabilities (ID) are more likely than typically developing
      children to have higher cardio-metabolic risk factors, lower levels of health-related
      fitness, and be overweight and obese. As such, they represent a health disparities
      population. Low physical activity levels, increased sedentary time, and poor diet quality are
      likely contributors to these inequities. The goal of the Investigators is to develop
      strategies that enable children with ID to attain optimal health by meeting US Physical
      Activity Guidelines and Dietary Guidelines for Americans. To achieve this goal, children with
      ID must develop physical literacy and food literacy - the knowledge, skills, confidence and
      desire to participate in physical activity and make healthy food choices. This project seeks
      to:1) test the feasibility of a physical literacy and food literacy intervention for children
      with ID, and 2) preliminarily assess the efficacy of the intervention for increasing physical
      literacy including movement skills, confidence, and desire to participate in physical
      activity, and food literacy including knowledge around making healthy food choices, basic
      food preparation skills, and engaging in healthy eating behavior. Thirty male (n=15) and
      female (n=15) children with ID ages 12-16 will participate in a 12-week combined sport
      sampling and healthy eating education program. Weekly sessions will include 60 minutes of
      sports activities and 45 minutes of educational and skill activities to promote healthy
      eating. Sport sampling activities will aim to develop locomotor and object control skills via
      3 sports: soccer, basketball, and Run-Jump-Throw. Healthy eating sessions will focus on
      increasing knowledge to identify healthy foods and to make healthy choices, basic skills for
      preparing food, and a taste test thematically related to the lesson. The intervention will
      also include an at-home component called &quot;Bring it Home, Give it Try.&quot; Children will be
      provided with a piece(s) of sports equipment (e.g., soccer ball, jump rope) and skill cards
      with instructions and fun ideas for practicing sport skills outside of program sessions, and
      will be provided recipes related to the weekly taste test to promote healthy eating at home.
      The pilot intervention will be delivered in 2 waves of 15 participants each at YMCAs/Boys &amp;
      Girls Clubs in eastern/central MA. Process measures of demand, acceptability, and
      implementation will be obtained to test feasibility, and a pre-test/post-test design will
      allow for preliminary data on efficacy of the intervention. Measures of physical literacy
      include the Canadian Agility and Movement Skill Assessment, Physical Self-Inventory-ID, and
      Children's Self- Perceptions of Adequacy in and Predilection for Physical Activity scale.
      Measures of food literacy include a questionnaire of food knowledge, a test of rudimentary
      food preparation skills, and parent proxy report of dietary patterns based on a modified food
      frequency questionnaire (FFQ), and questions from the Youth Risk Behavioral Surveillance
      Survey. This early phase study is a step toward promoting health and reducing the inequities
      that exist for children with ID.

    <measure>Physical Self Concept</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Post intervention (within 1 month)</time_frame>
    <description>Physical Self-Concept will be measured using the Very Short Form of the Physical Self-Inventory-Intellectual Disability (PSI-VSF-ID). The PSI-VSF-ID is a 12-item questionnaire that measures six dimensions of self-concept: 1) Global Self-Concept; 2) Physical Self-Worth; 3) Sport Competence; 4) Physical Attractiveness; 5) Physical Condition; and 6) Physical Strength. Four response options range from &quot;very true&quot; to &quot;not at all true&quot;, and a visual answer scale uses smiling/frowning faces effective for use with adolescents with ID. Higher scores indicate higher self-concept in the aforementioned domains. We will examine changes in participants' physical self-concept between baseline and post-intervention.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Movement Skills</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Post intervention (within 1 month)</time_frame>
    <description>Will be measured with the Canadian Agility and Movement Skill Assessment (CAMSA). The CAMSA requires participants to travel a distance of 20 m in a movement/agility course while completing 7 different movement skills in succession. Performance on the CAMSA is evaluated using an aggregate of time to complete the course and the quality of skills performed based on established criteria. Time is converted to a predefined point score (range 1-14), and the quality of each skill is scored as either performed (score of 1) or not (score of 0) (range 0-14). Thus, the total score which is time and skill combined has a range of 1-28; higher scores connote higher motor skill/ability.We will examine changes in participants' motor skills between baseline and post-intervention.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Desire to participate in physical activity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Post intervention (within 1 month)</time_frame>
    <description>Will be measured via the Canadian Assessment of Physical Literacy - Second Edition (CAPL-2) Questionnaire will estimate the participant's desire to participate in physical activity. The 6-item questionnaire subscale includes 3 items that assess perceived adequacy (i.e., self-perception that one has the capability to achieve an acceptable standard of success conceptualized by the self and others) and 3 items that assess perceived predilection for physical activity (i.e., likelihood of selecting physical activity over sedentary behavior when given the choice). The CAPL-2 Questionnaire subscale will be verbally administered. Total scores will range from 0-6 with an item response assigned 0 or 1. Higher scores indicate higher self-perception and higher predilection for engagement in physical activity. We will examine changes in participants' desire to participate in physical activity between baseline and post-intervention.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Food Knowledge and Skills</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Post intervention (within 1 month)</time_frame>
    <description>Will be measured with a hands-on Food Knowledge/Skills test adapted from knowledge tests for typically developing children and children with ID developed by the investigative team. Participants will be asked to classify individual foods into food groups (e.g., an apple belongs in the fruit group), and other healthy eating concepts such as identifying whole grains, choosing the healthiest meal between two pictures of plates with food on them, and identifying beverages that have less sugar. For each item, answers will be scored as correct or incorrect (0 or 1) or &quot;I don't know&quot; (0) and summed for a total of percent correct. We will examine changes in participants' food knowledge/skills between baseline and post-intervention.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Healthy eating (dietary) behavior</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Post intervention (within 1 month)</time_frame>
    <description>Will be measured by parent proxy using the dietary assessment questions asked as part of the Youth Risk Behavioral Surveillance Survey. There are a 9 questions related to dietary intake, yielding the frequency with which foods were eaten in the past 7 days (range: 0 to 4+ times per day).We will examine changes in participants' dietary behavior between baseline and post-intervention.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Post intervention (within 1 month)</time_frame>
    <description>We will administer a modified food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) that we have developed for other studies that contains lists of foods organized by food group. Parents will be asked to indicate which foods their teen eats, which foods their teen will not eat, and whether any of the foods are never served to the teen. There is also a single question that asks parents to indicate how willing their teen is to try new foods. The FFQ will allow us to assess whether the teen's willingness to try new foods changes as a result of the intervention and whether there is an increase in the proportion of foods of the total that they consume post-intervention compared to baseline.</description>
