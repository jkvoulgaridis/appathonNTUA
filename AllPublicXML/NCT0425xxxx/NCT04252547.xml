      The study will be conducted with the Crossover Randomized Controlled Method. The infants who
      have attained oral feeding in the neonatal intensive care unit will be divided into two
      groups via randomization in the computer environment. After the randomization, kangaroo care
      will be applied to the infants in Group 1 during the first feeding hour when they are
      included in the study and they will be breastfed by their mothers without any other
      application during the next feeding. On the other hand, no application will be performed on
      the infants in Group 2 during the first feeding hour when they are included in the study and
      kangaroo care will be applied to them during the second feeding hour. The infants in both
      groups will be breastfed by their mothers during the feeding hours.

      Test weighing is a feeding evaluation method which is used for evaluating the increase in
      infant's body weight and the amount of food intake before and after breastfeeding. Each gram
      is evaluated to be equivalent to one cc breast milk. The aim of the study is to evaluate the
      effect of kangaroo care applied to the preterm infants that have attained oral feeding and
      are breastfed by their mothers, on their physiological parameters, feeding condition and body
      weight increase. After weighing the infant only in his/her diaper before the feeding and
      applying kangaroo care in which skin-to-skin contact will be provided for half an hour, the
      mother will breastfeed the infant. The infant will be weighed once again after the feeding
      without diaper change and the effect of kangaroo care on test weighing and physiological
      parameters during the feeding process will be evaluated. Sample size of the study has been
      determined by the power analysis, in line with the results obtained from the studies which
      have been conducted using a similar research method. According to the analysis results, it
      has been calculated as 23 for each group and 46 in total. Parents of the infants meeting the
      study inclusion criteria will be informed both in written and verbally and then the study
      will be conducted with mothers who agree to participate in the study with their infants.

Their heart rate and oxygen saturation will be recorded for half an hour. At the end of the kangaroo care, the infant will be breastfed by his/her mother.
During the second feeding hour, his/her heart rate and oxygen saturation will begin to be recorded ten minutes before the feeding hour. The data will be recorded for ten minutes and then the infant will be taken out of the incubator and weight is measured only in his/her clean diaper. He/she will be handed over to the mother to breastfeed.</description>

A chronometer will be started at that moment he/she begins sucking and terminated when he/she stops. The infant's heart rate and oxygen saturation will also continue to be recorded during the breastfeeding process. When the breastfeeding process is over, the infant will be allowed to rest in his/her mother's arms for two minutes and his/her physiological parameters will be recorded. Following the breastfeeding process, the infant will be weight is measured without a diaper change and his/her weight will be recorded. Then he/she will be taken back in the incubator to sleep.</description>
