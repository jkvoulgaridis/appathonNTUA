  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To test the variability of specific ribonucleic acid (RNA) and proteins as well as frataxin
      levels in samples of blood and buccal cells taken directly from patients with Friedreich's
      ataxia (FRDA) in order to confirm potential new biomarkers of disease in patients with FRDA.

      Primary Objective:

      The primary objective of this study is to identify whether frataxin levels and specific RNAs
      and proteins in blood and buccal cells differ between patients with FRDA and controls.

      Secondary Objective:

      The secondary objectives of this study are:

        -  To understand the variability of frataxin and specific RNAs and proteins identified in
           buccal cells.

        -  To correlate levels of frataxin and specific RNAs and proteins with features of FRDA.

        -  To correlate levels of frataxin and specific RNAs and proteins with triglycerides, high
           density lipoprotein (HDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, and other lipids.

        FRDA patients will be recruited using the Principal Investigator's (PI's) clinical
        practice.

        Control patients will be obtained through family members or friends of affected
        individuals, as well as non-FRDA patients in the PI's practice.
