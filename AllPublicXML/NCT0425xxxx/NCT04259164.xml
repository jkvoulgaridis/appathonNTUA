  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Double-blind, randomized, two-way cross-over study with two treatment periods. 28 subjects
      with asthma will be randomized in 1:1 ratio to treatment A) Indacaterol/Mometasone 150/160 μg
      once daily and treatment B) Indacaterol/Glycopyrronium/Mometasone 150/50/80 μg once daily for
      period 1. For period 2, subjects will be crossed over to the other treatment arm. Subjects
      will be screened during the first visit. After inclusion subjects will be seen for 3 visits
      during the Run-in period, 3 visits during treatment period 1 and 3 visits during treatment
      period 2. During these visits patients will be clinically characterized and exposed to
      allergen challenge tests.

          -  Patients with presence of allergy against house dust mite, cat or grass pollen.

          -  PC20 histamine or equivalent ≤ 8 mg/ml.

          -  Drop in FEV1 &gt; 20% during the early asthmatic response and drop in FEV1 &gt; 15% during
             the late asthmatic response, i.e. between 3-8 hours after allergen challenge.

          -  Patients able to produce sputum of sufficient quality for evaluation of cell
             differential counts 24 hours after the baseline allergen challenge at Visit 3.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Smoking history ≥ 10 pack-years. Ex-smokers are eligible for inclusion if they quit
             smoking for at least 6 months prior to Visit 1.

          -  Diagnosed with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).

          -  FEV1 &lt; 70% of predicted at baseline or &lt; 1.5 liters.

          -  An asthma attack/exacerbation requiring systemic steroids or hospitalization or
             emergency room visit within 6 weeks of Visit 1.

             Investigator within 4 weeks prior to Visit 1.

          -  Ever required intubation for a severe asthma attack/exacerbation.

          -  Presence of clinical condition which is likely to be worsened by ICS administration
             (e.g. glaucoma, cataract and fragility fractures).
