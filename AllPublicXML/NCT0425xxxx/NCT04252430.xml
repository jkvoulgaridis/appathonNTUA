  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, multicentric, open-label,two arms to assess and compare the effect of
      single oral administration of MD1003 on the pharmacokinetic parameters in renal impaired
      patients and healthy subjects with normal renal function.

      The planned enrollment is 36 subjects (18 impaired patients and 18 healthy subjects).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a multicentric, open label, phase I, two arms study to compare pharmacokinetics
      of MD1003 after a single oral dose of MD1003 100 mg in 18 healthy male volunteers and in 18
      renal impaired patients.

      It is planned to enroll a total of 36 subjects to receive a single oral dose of
      investigational medicinal product (IMP):

        -  6 patients with mild renal impaired function, 6 patients with moderate renal impaired
           function and 6 patients with severe renal impaired function will be enrolled in four
           Hungarian centers;

        -  18 Healthy volunteers will be enrolled by Eurofins Optimed in Gières, France. Healthy
           volunteers will be matched with impaired renal function patients on ethnic group, sex,
           age and BMI.

      Subjects will be screened for eligibility to participate in the study up to 21 days prior to
      the first administration. For both arms, subjects will be admitted into the Clinical Research
      Unit (CRU) on Day -3. On the morning of Day 1, subjects will receive a single 100 mg oral
      dose of MD1003 following an overnight fast (i.e., at least 10 hours). Subjects will be
      confined to the CRU until discharge on Day 8 with PK blood sample draws for measurement of
      MD1003 and its main metabolites being taken throughout the confinement (Predose, 0.5, 1, 1.5,
      2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 168 hours post-dose). Urine sample
      draws for measurement of MD1003 and its main metabolites will also be taken throughout the
      study (pre-dose, ]D1T0h - D1T4h], ]D1T4h - D1T8h], ]D1T8h - D1T12h], ]D1T12h - D2T24h],
      ]D2T24h - D2T36h], ]D2T36h - D3T48h], ]D3T48h - D4T72h], ]D4T72h - D5T96h], ]D5T96h -
      D6T120h], ]D6T120h - D7T144h], ]D7T144h - D8T168h] post-dose). Then, subjects will come back
      to the CRU for 4 ambulatory visits on Day 10, Day 12, Day 14 and Day 16 for blood sampling
      (respectively 216, 264, 312, 360 hours post dose).

      A follow-up post study visit will occur on Day 23 (±2 days) post-dose to ensure the ongoing
      wellbeing of the subjects.

      Adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory evaluations, vital signs assessments, 12-lead ECG
      and physical examination (PE) findings will be monitored at screening and at specified times
      during the study. All AEs will be recorded throughout the study (i.e., from signing of the
      Informed Consent Form until Study Completion).

      The Study Completion is defined as the last subject's end-of-study assessment.

          2. Females participating in this study must be of non-childbearing potential or using
             highly effective contraception for the full duration of the study and for 1 month
             after the end of treatment, as described below:

               -  Cessation of menses for at least 12 months due to ovarian failure;
