  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare to the patients undergoing nonintubated general
      anesthesia with laryngeal mask and undergoing intubated general anesthesia with double-lumen
      endotracheal intubation in Video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although general anesthesia with double-lumen intubation is generally mandatory for
      Video-assisted thoracic surgery procedures intubation with double lumen tube is related to
      several risks. Nonintubated general anesthesia with laryngeal mask in patients with
      spontaneous breathing may be an alternative choice for minor VATS procedures.
