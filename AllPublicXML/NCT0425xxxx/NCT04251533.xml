    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether treatment with alpelisib in combination
      with nab-paclitaxel is safe and effective in subjects with advanced triple negative breast
      cancer (aTNBC) who carry either a PIK3CA mutation (Study Part A) or have PTEN loss without
      PIK3CA mutation (Study Parts B1 and B2)

             significantly alter the absorption of the study drugs (e.g., ulcerative diseases,
             uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malabsorption syndrome, or small bowel
             resection) based on investigator discretion

          -  Subject has a history of acute pancreatitis within 1 year of screening or past medical
             history of chronic pancreatitis

          -  Subject has currently documented pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease

          -  Subject has a history of severe cutaneous reactions, such as Steven-Johnson Syndrome
             (SJS), erythema multiforme (EM),Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN) or Drug Reaction with
