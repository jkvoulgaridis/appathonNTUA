  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the current study is to examine the effect of emphasizing values in the
      treatment rationale on treatment response, willingness to tolerate distress, and
      acceptability of a one-session interoceptive exposure intervention for the reduction of
      anxiety sensitivity. A standard treatment rationale without values emphasis will serve as a
      control.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive behavioral models of panic disorder maintain that recurrent, unexpected panic
      attacks result from anxiety sensitivity, or the fear of anxiety-related physiological
      sensations (e.g., fear of increased heart rate) and catastrophic misinterpretations regarding
      the danger of those sensations (e.g., misinterpreting increased heart rate as an oncoming
      heart attack). From these models and subsequent clinical research, interoceptive exposure has
      emerged as the most efficacious component of cognitive behavioral therapy for panic disorder
      treatment and, as expected, an efficacious intervention for decreasing anxiety sensitivity.
      Nevertheless, small-to-moderate effect sizes, wide variability in response rates and dropout
      rates indicated that panic disorder treatments may benefit from modifications to improve upon
      retention, response rates, and symptom reduction.

      Patient motivation and lack of engagement have been identified as factors to intervene upon.
      Numerous therapeutic techniques have been used to facilitate patient motivation in treatment;
      however, one specific direction that has gained increasing empirical interest is the
      inclusion of values identification. Values have been incorporated as a motivational component
      in empirically supported behavioral techniques and treatments, including Motivational
      Interviewing, Behavioral Activation Treatment for Depression packages, and Acceptance and
      Commitment Therapy. Evidence from randomized controlled trials have generally supported the
      inclusion of packages containing values components in facilitating exposure therapy, and
      preliminary evidence has specifically favored the inclusion of packages containing values
      components in exposure therapy in cognitive behavioral therapy for panic disorder. However,
      there is no research known by the author that examines the influence of values on motivation
      in interoceptive exposure. Therefore, research examining the effect of a values component in
      isolation motivation in and acceptability of interoceptive exposure exercises has the
      potential to further improve treatment efficacy reducing costs associated with panic disorder
      and the many other conditions treated by interoceptive exposure. Therefore, the purpose of
      the current study is to examine the effect of emphasizing values in the treatment rationale
      on treatment response, willingness to tolerate distress, and acceptability of a one-session
      interoceptive exposure intervention among a clinical analogue sample with elevated anxiety
      sensitivity.

    <measure>Willingness to tolerate distress</measure>
    <time_frame>change from pre-intervention to immediately post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Willingness to tolerate distress will be assessed by identifying the activity item on the Albany Panic and Phobia Questionnaire (APPQ) - Agoraphobia subscale to which the participant responded with the highest score indicating most fear. The participant will then be asked, &quot;How willing would you be to do [most feared activity] next week?&quot; Responses will range from 0% to 100%.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Straw breathing BAT peak fear ratings</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked to engage in hyperventilation via breathing through a cocktail straw for three consecutive minutes pre-intervention. Participants will be asked to rate their peak fear ranging from 0 (&quot;no fear&quot;) to 100 (&quot;extreme fear or panic&quot;) on a 100-point visual analog scale after each minute. A peak fear rating will be calculated by computing the average of the three ratings.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overbreathing BAT peak fear ratings</measure>
    <time_frame>immediately post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked to engage in one last overbreathing task post-intervention to see how long they can overbreathe. After discontinuation, participants will be asked to report their current level of fear ranging from 0 (&quot;no fear&quot;) to 100 (&quot;extreme fear or panic&quot;) on a 100-point visual analog scale.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Between trial fear ratings</measure>
    <time_frame>change from pre-intervention to immediately post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>After each voluntary hyperventilation trial, participants will be asked to provide ratings of their peak fear. Participants will be asked to rate their peak fear during the trial ranging from 0 (&quot;no fear&quot;) to 100 (&quot;extreme fear or panic&quot;) on a 100-point visual analog scale.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Anxiety Sensitivity Index - 3 (ASI-3)</measure>
    <time_frame>change from pre-intervention to immediately post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The ASI-3 is an 18-item self-report measure of the fear of physiological arousal-related sensations. Scores on the ASI-3 can range from 0 to 72, with higher scores reflecting greater fear of arousal-related symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Albany Panic and Phobia Questionnaire (APPQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>change from pre-intervention to immediately post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The APPQ is a 27-item self-report measure of the fear of activities often avoided by individuals with agoraphobia and social phobia, and activities that typically produce physical sensations. Scores on the APPQ can range from 0 to 216, with higher scores reflecting higher levels of fear.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Between trial tolerability ratings</measure>
    <time_frame>change from pre-intervention to immediately post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>After each voluntary hyperventilation trial, participants will be asked to provide ratings of tolerability of physiological sensations. Participants will be asked to rate the extent they perceived themselves as able to tolerate the physiological sensations during hyperventilation from 0 (&quot;unable to tolerate them at all&quot;) to 100 (&quot;completely able to tolerate them&quot;) on a 100-point visual analog scale.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment Acceptability Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>immediately post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>A three-item self-report questionnaire was administered to participants to assess acceptability of the treatment provided. Participants will rate treatment acceptability, likeability, and aversiveness from &quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;extremely&quot; on a five-point Likert scale. Scores on the Treatment Acceptability Questionnaire can range from 0 to 12, with higher scores reflecting greater acceptability.</description>
