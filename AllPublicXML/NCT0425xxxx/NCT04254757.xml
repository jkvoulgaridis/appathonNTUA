  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) is the most common spinal degenerative disease. For conservative
      treatment failure, open lumbar decompression and fusion surgery is the main surgical
      treatment. After decades of development, open lumbar decompression and fusion surgery has
      been the standard treatment. However, there are still people and conditions that cannot be
      covered, such as elderly people who intolerable surgery, severe osteoporosis, and re-stenosis
      at adjacent segments after fusion. Percutaneous spinal endoscopic lumbar spinal decompression
      technique could be performed under local anesthesia, soft tissue damage is minimized, and
      effective spinal decompression can be achieved. There are still some controversial points of
      LSS decompression under percutaneous endoscope surgery, such as the range of decompression,
      choice of approach, postoperative spinal stability, learning curve, surgical safety,
      long-term effects of endoscopic treatment of restenosis at adjacent segments after fusion
      surgery. The purpose of this study was to solve these controversial points. A multi-center,
      prospective registration study based on the real world is planned. The total sample size is
      about 600 cases (300 cases in endoscopic surgery group, 300 cases in open decompression and
      fusion group). The mid- to long-term clinical efficacy and safety were evaluated.
