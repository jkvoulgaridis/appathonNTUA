  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effects of a novel integrated clinical prediction tool on antibiotic
      prescription patterns of nurses for acute respiratory infections (ARIs). The intervention is
      an EHR-integrated risk calculator and order set to help guide appropriate, evidence-based
      antibiotic prescriptions for patients presenting with ARI symptoms.

      The proposed project will fill a critical gap in the evidence base and answer the important
      question: can pivoting ARI CDS tools towards nurses overcome established implementation
      barriers to reducing antibiotic use? The proposal is highly innovative in three ways: It uses
      CDS tools to embed evidence-based risk stratification to enable nurse-led ARI management. It
      creates a nurse training program to support this nurse-led ARI treatment pathway. It will be
      evaluated and optimized using evidence-based implementation frameworks that will guide
      assessment of the fidelity, acceptability, adoption, cost, and sustainability of the tool.
      This will provide comprehensive implementation measures, formative and summative, and enable
      a rigorous understanding of barriers and facilitators to implementing nurse-led CDS tools for
      reducing antibiotic overprescribing. This study will provide much needed guidance on how to
      implement CDS-enabled, nurse-led ARI assessment and treatment to reduce antibiotic
      overprescribing.

    <description>A &quot;near-live&quot; clinical laboratory for refining iCPR workflows with a high likelihood of adoption. Using &quot;think-aloud&quot; and thematic protocol analysis procedures, written simulations of sore throat and cough patient encounters with 6-8 RNs will be observed and analyzed. RNs will be instructed to follow &quot;think-aloud&quot; protocols throughout, which call for them to verbalize all thoughts as they interact with the system. Subsequent cohorts of 6-8 RNs will participate in rapid-cycle, low-cost, &quot;near-live&quot; usability sessions where they interact with a simulated patient rather than a written scenario. Simulations will be conducted &quot;in-situ&quot; at a representative practice location. All will be audio-taped and screen-capture software will be used to record all human-EHR interactions.</description>

Simulations will be conducted &quot;in-situ&quot; at a representative practice location. Additional cycles of &quot;near-live&quot; usability testing will be conducted if required to model the impact of proposed changes to the iCPR tools or workflows. All sessions will be audio-taped and screen-capture software will be used to record all human-EHR interactions.</description>

    <description>The iCPR tool consists of an electronic calculator that can be used to determine whether the patient is at low, intermediate or high risk for having the diagnosis and a bundled order set. When a provider at an intervention group clinic enters data in the EHR that may indicate a patient has strep throat or pneumonia, the iCPR tool will be triggered and the provider will see a best practice alert recommending that they use the iCPR too. The iCPR tool through the use of order sets will guide the provider in the patient's care. The order set for patients at low risk for these diseases will recommend supportive care including over the counter cold remedies and pain relievers. At intermediate risk of these disease will recommend diagnostic tests to help determine if they have the disease. At high risk will recommend antibiotics. The provider can decline to use the tool at any time while working in the EHR.</description>
