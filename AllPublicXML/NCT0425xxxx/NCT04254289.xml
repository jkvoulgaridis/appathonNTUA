  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The researchers are investigating if changing an individual's behaviors may have an impact on
      outcomes for patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). This research will test the
      efficacy of a home-based exercise program to improve exercise tolerance and physical
      activity.

    <masking_description>An independent statistician will develop the randomization schedule and an unblinded study team member will document and maintain the treatment assignment log. The investigators will be adjusting the exercise regimens of those randomized to the exercise program and are unable to be blinded. All patients will receive weekly telephone calls to review activity logs. Outcomes included in the primary and secondary analysis will be blinded as possible. The staff performing the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) and interpreting echocardiograms will be blinded to the group assignment.</masking_description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Health related quality of life assessed using the EuroQol EQ-5D-5L. There is a descriptive system comprises the following 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 3 levels: no problems, some problems, extreme problems. The respondent is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking (or placing a cross) in the box against the most appropriate statement in each of the 5 dimensions.
The survey visual analog scale (VAS) records the respondent's self-rated health on a 20 cm vertical, visual analogue scale with endpoints labelled 'the best health you can imagine' and 'the worst health you can imagine'.
The users guide gives details of the scoring system: https://euroqol.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/EQ-5D-5L_UserGuide_2015.pdf</description>

    <description>PAH-SYMPACT (Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension-Symptoms and Impact) is a self-rating questionnaire to assess symptoms and their physical and cognitive/emotional impact. The PAH-SYMPACT™ questionnaire consists of four domains: Cardiopulmonary Symptoms Domain (scored 0-24), Cardiovascular Symptoms Domain (scored 0-20), Physical Impacts Domain (scored 0-28), and the Cognitive/Emotional Impacts Domain (scored 0-16). In each domain a higher score indicates worse symptoms.</description>
