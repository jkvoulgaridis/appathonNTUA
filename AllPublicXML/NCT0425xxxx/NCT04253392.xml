      The RETHINK REFLUX Registry is a post-market prospective, multi-center, observation, single
      arm, long-term safety surveillance registry of subjects implanted with the LINX device. The
      primary objective of the study is to confirm the long-term safety profile of the LINX device
      and procedure (implant/explant) up to 10 years post-implant.

      The RETHINK REFLUX Registry or Research to further inform thinking about the role of LINX for
      Reflux Disease is sponsored by Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc. This is a post-market prospective,
      multi-center, observation, single arm, long-term safety surveillance registry of subjects
      implanted with the LINX device. Up to 500 subjects will be enrolled and implanted at up to 50
      centers in both the US and selected countries outside the US with regulatory approval for the
      LINX Reflux Management System. The study will collect data from patients 10 years post
      implant. The primary objective of the study is to confirm the long-term safety profile of the
      LINX device and procedure (implant/explant). Secondary objectives include Effectiveness,
      Health Economics and Health Utilization.

    <description>Follow-up questionnaires Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease Esophageal Health Related Quality of Life Questionnaire (GERD-HRQL), Foregut Symptoms Questionnaire (FSQ) and GERD Medication Survey] will be collected and compared to baseline with evaluation to include:
Percentage of subjects reporting &gt;or=50% reduction in GERD-HRQL scores
Percentage of subjects reporting the following on the FSQ:
Elimination of moderate or severe regurgitation
Reduction in extra-esophageal symptoms

    <description>Measure of the impact of GERD on a subject's ability to work will be collected through the responses on the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI) questionnaire. Percentages of impairment at baseline will be compared to scores collected annually. Four types of scores will be analyzed:
Absenteeism (work time missed)
Presenteeism (impairment of work/ reduced on-the-job effectiveness)
Work productivity loss (overall work impairment/ absenteeism plus presenteeism)
Activity impairment</description>

    <description>The LINX Reflux Management System consists of a series of titanium beads each with a magnetic core connected with independent titanium wires to form an annular shape when implanted. The attractive force of the magnetic beads is designed to provide additional strength to keep a weak lower esophageal sphincter (LES) closed. During swallowing, the magnetic beads slide away from each other on the independent titanium wire &quot;links&quot; to allow esophageal distention as the bolus passes by.</description>
