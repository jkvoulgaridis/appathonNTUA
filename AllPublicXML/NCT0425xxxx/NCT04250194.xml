    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate which procedure is the best for patients referred for biopsy of a
      lung nodule (growth in the lung) meeting the size and location requirements of the protocol.
      Two different procedures are available for lung nodule biopsy:

        1. a computed tomography guided biopsy (&quot;CT-guided biopsy&quot;) which consists of sampling the
           nodule from the &quot;outside-in&quot;, through the chest wall with CT guidance, and

        2. navigation bronchoscopy, which is a procedure using technology designed to guide a
           catheter through the natural airway route (wind-pipe and bronchi) to access the nodule.

      Endpoints:

      Primary:

      â€¢ To evaluate diagnostic yield

      Secondary:

        -  To evaluate rate of pneumothorax.

        -  To evaluate rate of pneumothorax requiring chest tube placement.

        -  To evaluate clinically significant bleeding (defined by bleeding requiring
           intervention).

        -  To evaluate need for hospitalization after procedure.

        -  To evaluate duration of the procedure.

        -  To evaluate procedural factors associated with improved yield (type of biopsy, number of
           biopsies, use of radial ultrasound, presence of a bronchus sign, biopsy site).

        -  To evaluate need for additional nodule biopsy.

        -  To evaluate need for additional procedure for staging.

        -  To evaluate radiation exposure from fluoroscopy-guided bronchoscopy and CT for CT-guided
           biopsy.

        -  To evaluate need for F-Nav during navigation bronchoscopy.

        -  To evaluate bronchoscopy yield defined as the combination of the primary endpoint
           (navigation diagnostic yield) and yield from endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal
           and/or hilar lymph node biopsies.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is referred for biopsy of a single indeterminate pulmonary nodule, with the
             following characteristics regarding size, location, accessibility, and probability of
             malignancy:

               -  Intermediate pre-test probability of malignancy as defined by a pre-test
                  probability of malignancy between 10% and 70%, using a validated clinical
                  prediction model, which is either:

                    -  The Brock model14 if no PET scan data are available, or

                    -  The Herder model15 if PET-CT data are available.

               -  Size between 10 and 30 mm (long diameter).

               -  Location peripheral, here defined as occupying the middle or outer third lung
                  zones.

               -  Accessible via navigation bronchoscopy and also accessible via CT-guided biopsy
                  (i.e. the nodule is clinically suited to equal access by either procedure), as
                  confirmed by an independent interventional panel.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with proximal nodules, as defined by nodules present in the proximal 1/3 of
             the lung by dedicated software analysis (described below) will not be eligible for the
             study.

          -  Patients with multiple nodules requiring biopsy (patients may have other nodules not
             considered for biopsy).
