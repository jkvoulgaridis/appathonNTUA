  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an experimental randomized controlled clinical trial. To explore the effect of
      infant massage on parental pressure and parent-child attachment of premature infants. The
      intervention time was from 5 days after birth to discharge from premature infants. Data were
      collected at five time points in longitudinal, before massage (T0), one week (T1), four weeks
      (T2), and eight weeks ( T3), 12 weeks (T4). Parents in the experimental group were given
      massage interventions when visiting premature babies, while parents in the control group
      visited premature babies as usual and contacted premature babies according to general nursing
      instructions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The organ development of premature infants is not yet mature, leading to higher morbidity and
      mortality. Even with advanced technology, parents and families still need to put more effort
      into taking care of these premature babies so that they can survive. Empirical evidence
      indicates that baby massage can help parents reduce stress and establish parent-child
      relationships, but few studies have been applied to parents of premature babies during
      hospitalization. Based on this, the purpose of this study is: 1. To explore the effect of
      infant massage on reducing parental pressure; 2. To compare the gender differences of
      parental pressure; 3. To explore the effect of infant massage on parent-child attachment; 4.
      Compare the gender difference of parent-child attachment relationship between parents of
      premature infants. An experimental randomized controlled clinical trial study design was
      adopted to collect data at five points in time, namely before massage (T0), one week (T1),
      four weeks (T2), eight weeks (T3), and 12 weeks (T4 ). Using the parental stress scale and
      parent-child attachment scale. Parents in the experimental group were given massage
      interventions when visiting premature babies, while parents in the control group were
      routinely visiting premature babies. The effects of infant massage on parental pressure and
      parent-child attachment of premature babies at different time points were discussed, and the
      differences gender of parental pressure and parent-child attachment were compared. The
      results can increase the empirical research on baby massage, use the empirical knowledge to
      arouse the attention of nursing staff to baby massage, improve the quality of family-centered
      care, and pay attention to the needs of parents of different genders.

    <description>Parents Stress Index-Short Form is a tool for measuring parental stress in premature babies. There are 36 questions in total. Each question uses the Liker's five-point scoring, with a maximum of 180 points and a minimum of 36. The greater the pressure.</description>

    <description>Maternal Attachment Inventory consists of 26 questions, each of which uses the Liker's four-point scoring method, with a maximum of 104 points and a minimum of 26 points. The higher the score, the better the relationship between mother and baby.</description>

    <description>The steps are as follows:1. Monitor the physiological indicators before massage, 2. Assist premature babies to lie on prone, take off their clothes and diapers, and then apply the baby's massage oil to the hands of both parents to warm them. 3. In the incubator, slight pressure touch the baby's body with warm palms and fingers.</description>
