  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching aim of the Success Over Stress Prevention Project is to reduce African
      American youth suicide. This study examines the impact of a 15-session, group-delivered,
      culturally-grounded, cognitive-behavioral intervention (i.e., PI Robinson's Adapted-Coping
      with Stress Course [A-CWS]), on the outcomes of interest, when it is delivered by social
      workers who are indigenous to the school system. The main objectives of this project are to
      (a) determine whether the intervention is effective when facilitated by social workers who
      are indigenous to the school system and (b) enhance resilience, increase adaptive coping
      strategies, and reduce both intrapersonal and interpersonal violence among youth receiving
      the prevention intervention. It is expected that increases in adaptive coping will lead to an
      increased ability for youth to manage stressors, thereby decreasing the incidence of suicide
      and violence among the youth. In addition, it is expected that evidence of the intervention's
      effectiveness, when facilitated by social workers who are indigenous to the school system,
      will lead to greater dissemination and sustainability of the intervention, thus, providing
      access to effective intervention resources to greater numbers of African American youth.

      This study will establish the effectiveness of Robinson's Adapted-Coping with Stress Course
      (A-CWS) and test hypotheses pertaining to the mechanism of change by which the A-CWS reduces
      suicide risk. Additionally, this study is expected to augment current theoretical models of
      adolescent suicidality. This effectiveness trial will inform procedures for scaling up
      efficacious, high quality, and culturally-grounded suicide prevention programs for
      low-resourced, urban African American youth; as such, this study is practice relevant and
      expected to inform best practices for the prevention of suicide among African American
      adolescents. The specific aims are:

        1. To examine the effectiveness of the A-CWS intervention, as delivered by social workers
           who are indigenous to the school system, to reduce active suicidal ideation, within a
           sample of low-resourced, urban African American adolescents.

        2. To understand the mechanism by which the A-CWS intervention reduces suicide risk for
           low-resourced, urban African American adolescents.

        3. To establish the fidelity of an evidence-based, culturally-grounded coping with stress
           intervention (i.e., the A-CWS), developed for low-resourced, urban African American
           adolescents, delivered by social workers indigenous to the school system.

        4. To understand the extent that thwarted belongingness, perceived burdensomeness, and
           socio-ecological factors influence the development of active suicidal ideation.

    <description>Participants randomized to the experimental condition will take part in the Adapted Coping with Stress Course (A-CWS). The A-CWS is a 15-session, cognitive-behavioral group intervention designed to develop and enhance African American youths' skills to adaptively cope with stress, using standard cognitive-behavioral strategies such as relaxation training and cognitive restructuring. Emphasis is given to the identification of individual and contextual factors associated with suicide risk and the unique day-to-day experiences of the youth, providing options for adaptive coping (e.g., positive thinking) that are culturally consistent. The A-CWS is structured and manualized to allow its transportability to service providers working in similar environments with similar youth.</description>
