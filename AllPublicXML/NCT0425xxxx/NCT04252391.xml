    <textblock>
      This study seeks to determine the effectiveness of a specific treatment protocol using dry
      needling with perineural electrical stimulation in comparison to standard treatment in
      physical therapy for patients with migraine headaches. This will be a randomized cross-over
      study in which participants will be in the first arm of the study, have a washout period,
      then cross over to the other arm of the study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      From current understanding of migraine pathophysiology, the investigators know that it
      involves excitability of the trigeminovascular system. Intercranial vasculature containing
      nociceptor innervation consists of unmyelinated (c-fibers) and thinly myelinated (a-delta
      fibers ) axons which hold vasoactive neuropeptides including substance P and (CGRP)
      calcitonin gene related peptide. When a migraine occurs, there is a cortical spreading
      depolarization, which on a molecular level involves a release of ATP, glutamate, potassium,
      hydrogen ions, glia or vascular cells, and CGRP and nitric oxide by activated perivascular
      nerves. These substances, including CGRP diffuse to come in contact with nociceptors causing
      neurogenic inflammation (vasodilation), thus propagating a headache.

      Electrical perineural dry needling causes the release of substance-P and CGRG predominantly
      from non-neural structures, facilitating a negative feedback loop to neural and neuroactive
      components of the target tissue. This causes a lowering of the levels of CGRP which in turn
      decreases the inflammatory component thought to play a role in migraine headaches.

    <description>A functional status scale ranging from 0% to 100% (0%= no activity limitation, 100% =complete activity limitation).

    <measure>Trends with use of perineural electrical dry needling with or without CGRP antagonist drugs.</measure>
    <time_frame>following 4 weeks of treatment in the standard care plus perineural electrical dry needling arm.</time_frame>
    <description>Because this is a small trial it is unlikely that we will be able to determine if migraine drugs significantly modify the effect perineural electrical dry needle treatment has on pain and the neck disability index. However we will look for any trends in interaction between perineural electrical dry needle treatment and migraine drugs using exploratory data analysis and box plot comparisons.</description>

    <description>This arm will consist of standard care with perineural electrical dry needling, using a high frequency stimulation placed near the nerve, differing from addressing muscular trigger points. For example, a dry needle placed in the semispinalis capitus muscle along the greater occipital nerve pathway, stimulated at 80 Hz.</description>

    <description>Standard care plus use of perineural electrical dry needling involving use of a monofilament needle of 15 or 30 mm length, 0.25 mm diameter will be placed utilizing the therapist's dominant hand following palpation of correct needle location. An electrical stimulation unit will be used to conduct an electrical impulse. The unit used will be an ES-130 by ITO (Japan) using a DC 9V battery producing an asymmetrical biphasic waveform. The unit has 6 available leads with alligator clamps, connecting to needle shafts. Parameters of PNED will include intensity set at a strong yet comfortable setting according to patient feedback. Treatment duration will be 15 minutes. Treatment frequency will be set to Medium at level 8 (80 Hz). Parameters will be set to elicit a sensory response.</description>
