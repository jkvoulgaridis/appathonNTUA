  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the methods of formula preparation and feeding
      practices in Latin American households in the first 12 months of life. There is limited
      published information on the feeding practices of infants in disadvantaged households, and
      still less information is available regarding disadvantaged Latin American households.

      Studies have shown that certain feeding practices such as diluting infant formula, warming
      bottles in a microwave, or storing partially used bottles in the refrigerator can be
      dangerous for the infant. Previous pilot data in other states have documented that up to
      15-21% of parents dilute infant formula. Motives for doing so included an attempt to avoid
      infant hunger, save money, or make formula last longer.

      The study will include 2 visits, both occurring at the CommUnity Care clinic during the
      infant's regularly scheduled doctor's visit. Study visits will coincide with the American
      Academy of Pediatrics' (AAP) recommendations for timing of visits in the first year of life:
      prior to 2 months of age a baby will be scheduled for 2 visits (usually at 1 and 2 weeks of
      life), with subsequent well-child visits scheduled for 2, 4, 6, and 9 months of age. The
      investigators will seek to enroll subjects (Parent/Caregiver of infant less than 1 year of
      age) when the child attends any visit prior to the 9 month visit so that the investigators
      can complete both study visits prior to 1 year of age.

      Visit 1 - Parent/Caregiver will complete a questionnaire about breastfeeding/formula feeding
      practices and food insecurity. The questionnaire includes a nutrition history, asking how
      much formula is consumed, number of times they are breastfed per day, what types and amounts
      of solid foods are consumed, and if vitamins and/or iron drops are given (including frequency
      and amount). After the questionnaire, the participant will be asked to demonstrate how they
      typically prepare infant formula. Finally, the PI or designee will provide a brief education
      about appropriate feeding practices as recommended by the AAP.

      typically prepare infant formula. Finally, the PI or designee will provide a brief education
      about appropriate feeding practices as recommended by the AAP. This will include appropriate
      formula preparation methods, use of juice, introduction of cow's milk and solids, as well as
      basic nutrition information.

      Visit 2 - If the family returns for a clinic visit again before the child turns 1 year of
      age, the same procedures as Visit 1 will be performed, including reinforcement of education.

      The infant's anthropometrics and medical history will be obtained from the EMR.

      This pilot data would be the foundation for a larger, more intensive study to determine
      prevalence of inappropriate feeding strategies among Latin American families and best
      strategies to educate and inform.
