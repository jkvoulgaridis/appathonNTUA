      A Post-market Clinical Follow-up Study to provide safety, performance and clinical benefits
      data on the Exceed ABT acetabular cup (implants and instruments) when used in combination
      with ceramic liners or polyethylene articulating liners bearing Options.

      Study Aim: To collect survivorship and clinical outcomes long-term data confirm-ing safety,
      performance and clinical benefits of the Exceed ABT ce-mentless cup when used in combination
      with ceramic and polyeth-ylene articulating liners

      Objectives: Primary Objectives:

      Clinical performance - as measured by clinical score data (HHS, WOMAC and Oxford Hip Score),
      radiographic as-sessments and survivorship which will be based on removal of the device.

      Secondary Objectives:

      Safety will be evaluated by monitoring incidence of adverse events. Length of study: 13 years
      (3 years enrollment plus 10 years follow-up): Post-operative follow-up visits at: 1, 3, 5, 7
      and 10 years
