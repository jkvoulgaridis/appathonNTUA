  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a pilot study investigating the feasibility of using pressurized irrigation of
      the stomach mucosa to obtain gastric aspirate cell samples for analysis and identification of
      premalignant lesions of the stomach.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gastric cancer is an important public health concern, accounting for 26,240 new cases in the
      United States (US) annually. Outcomes are poor, with 5-year survival of 31%, but improve when
      lesions are detected at early stages amenable to curative therapy. Research has shown that
      lesions such as atrophic gastritis and gastric intestinal metaplasia are precursors to more
      advanced lesions such as dysplasia and adenocarcinoma, thus providing a potential target for
      early intervention. Gastric cancer screening programs have decreased mortality in
      high-prevalence countries like Japan. However, providers in low-prevalence settings are less
      experienced at detecting precursor lesions endoscopically on visual inspection. This pilot
      study will investigate a novel approach to screening for precursor lesions and early
      detection of gastric cancer by utilizing pressurized irrigation of the gastric mucosa. The
      study will target patients with a known history of gastric precursor lesions (atrophic
      gastritis, intestinal metaplasia, history of dysplasia) who are presenting for routine
      surveillance endoscopy. Following routine endoscopic evaluation, the investigators will
      utilize the ERBEJET 2 device (ERBE USA Inc), which is commercially available for the
      treatment of mucosal lesions, to sample cells from the mucosal surface of the stomach. The
      aspirate will be collected for cytologic/pathologic assessment. The goal is that this
      technique will simplify testing for precursor lesions of gastric cancer, making screening
      more effective in regions of lower prevalence where providers are less experienced with
      visual identification of such lesions.

    <description>Investigators will compare how the diagnosis determined from pathologic/cytologic analysis gastric aspirate samples will compare with diagnosis obtained from standard endoscopic inspection and biopsies. The diagnoses of interest will be normal mucosa, atrophic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia, or malignancy. This will be reported as the percentage of concordant diagnoses.</description>
