  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will investigate the effects of a home-based occupational therapy
      telerehabilitation (TR) via smartphones in enhancing functional and motor performances, and
      fall efficacy, for outpatients receiving day hospital rehabilitation after hip fracture
      surgery.

      This is a feasibility randomized controlled trial with two groups - experimental and
      comparison groups, involving older adults after hip fracture surgery within 12 weeks
      attending the Geriatric Day Hospital. Patients will be assessed at baseline, immediately post
      3-weeks intervention, and follow-up after 3-weeks for motor performances, daily activities
      functioning and fall efficacy. The experimental group will receive home program using the use
      of Caspar Health e-system and a mobile app in smartphones, while the comparison group will
      receive paper-and-pencil instructions for the home program on weekly basis, for 3 weeks.

    <measure>The Pain Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measure assessing change between three time points (baseline, post 3-week intervention and follow-up after 3 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>It measures pain intensity. It consists of a 100mm horizontal line anchored with two opposite labels, i.e. labelled at the left end as 'no pain' (0mm) and at the right end as 'very severe pain' (100mm).

    <measure>The Hong Kong Chinese version of the Modified Barthel index (MBI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measure assessing change between three time points (baseline, post 3-week intervention and follow-up after 3 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>It measures performance in basic activities of daily living. The item scores range from '0', which indicates an inability to perform, to a maximum of '5, 10 or 15', which represents total independence. The total items score of 100 indicates complete independence in self-care performance. (Change from baseline at post 3-week intervention and follow-up after 3 weeks)</description>

    <time_frame>Measure assessing change between three time points (baseline, post 3-week intervention and follow-up after 3 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>It assesses nine domains of function skills (ability to use telephone, shopping, meal preparation, laundry, housekeeping, handyman work, and transportation, medication and money management) The item scores range from '0' which indicates an inability to perform, to a maximum of '2,3 or 4' which represents total independence (Change from baseline at post 3-week intervention and follow-up after 3 weeks)</description>

    <measure>The Fall Efficacy Scale (FES)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measure assessing change between three time points (baseline, post 3-week intervention and follow-up after 3 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>FES is a questionnaire to assess the level of confidence when patient perform activities of daily living without fear of fall. FES is a ten-item test rated on a 10-point scale from not confident at all to completely confident (Change from baseline at post 3-week intervention and follow-up after 3 weeks)</description>

    <measure>The Morse Fall Scale (MFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measure assessing change between three time points (baseline, post 3-week intervention and follow-up after 3 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>MFS predict the likelihood of falls. It consists of 6 variables: history of fall, the presence of a secondary diagnosis, the use of ambulatory aids, the administration of intravenous therapy, types of gait and mental status. MFS is rated as follows, 0: No risk for falls; &lt;25: Low risk; 25-45: Moderate risk ; &gt;45: High risk (Change from baseline at post 3-week intervention and follow-up after 3 weeks)</description>

    <description>The experimental group will receive home-based treatment program through mobile apps while control group will receive through a written home program sheets. The training contents will be equivalent, including trunk and lower limb strengthening and stretching, coordination, balance, and functional exercises that will be related to patients' daily living activities in their home.
The frequency and duration of the home program will be compromised by both the therapist and the patient. The videos of the home program will be sent to patients' app in smartphone by the therapist in the experimental group. Patients will perform the exercises while watching the videos in the app. After each exercise will be done, patient's performance feedback will be captured by the smartphone and will be sent back to the case therapist each time through the app while those in the control group will record their performance in a log sheet given by the therapists.</description>
