  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the difference in prostatitis symptoms in men with localized prostate
      cancer following brachytherapy taking Prosta-Q relative to placebo.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial assessing the safety of Prosta-Q
      use after brachytherapy placement in patients with localized prostate cancer. Patients will
      be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive Prosta-Q/Placebo twice daily for 4-6 weeks after
      brachytherapy placement. Questionnaires will be administered pre- and post-treatment to
      assess the change in prostatitis symptoms and quality of life measures. The mean values
      between groups will be compared.

      An interim analysis will be conducted for futility and efficacy after 42 patients have been
      enrolled (21 to each arm) and reviewed by the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC). If
      the analysis is favorable, as defined in the Statistical Analysis section, the trial will
      open to the enrollment of 98 additional subjects, 49 per arm. However, if the analysis does
      not demonstrate standards defined in the statistical analysis, the trial will be closed to
      accrual.
