  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This post market clinical follow-up study is a multi-center, non-randomized, unblinded,
      observational registry of the performance of the FRx Automated external defibrillator (AED)
      used in conjunction with electrodes with or without use of the infant/child key. The registry
      is focused only on on post-event data collection and does not prescribe any device usage.
      This registry has several safeguards in place to prevent against selections bias, including
      enrollment of all participants who have pads placed. This registry will evaluate the safety
      and verify the clinical performance of the device in relation to its claims, when used in
      accordance with the Device Manual.

        Use of the HeartStart FRx AED is intended for the following populations in addition to
        adults: newborns, neonates, infant, children, and adolescents. It may also be used on
        pregnant women. Devices are located in public access spaces and with first responders
        around the world.
