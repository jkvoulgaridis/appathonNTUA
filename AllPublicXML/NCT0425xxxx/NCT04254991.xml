      To externally validate the diagnostic accuracy and assess the clinical utility of a
      host-response based diagnostic tool called ImmunoXpert™, for differentiating between
      bacterial and viral etiologies in pediatric patients &gt;3 months old with suspicion of
      Respiratory tract infection (RTI) or Fever without Source (FWS)

        The study population will include eligible subjects from both genders that present to the
        ED due to suspected RTI, FWS, GE, UTI or non-febrile non-infectious disease (Control). Each
        of these subjects falls into one of the following categories:

          1. Patients with an acute bacterial infection

          2. Patients with an acute viral infection

          3. Patients with an acute mixed co-infection (bacterial and viral)

          4. Patients with an undetermined disease etiology

          5. Patients with a non-infectious disease (control group)
