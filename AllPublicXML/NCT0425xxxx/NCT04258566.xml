      Background:

      Liver cancer is the sixth most common cancer worldwide. Diagnosing liver cancer usually
      requires a liver sample. Getting the best sample helps determine whether cancer is present
      and what kind of cancer it is. But sampling can be difficult. This study will look at
      combining two devices to provide better liver samples.

      Objective:

      To see if combining fusion imaging and optical imaging can better sample areas of concern in
      the liver and determine the presence of disease.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 18 and older who need a liver biopsy as part of diagnosis or treatment.

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with:

      Review of imaging

      Medical history

      Physical exam

      Blood test results

      Participants will have a dye injected into a vein 24 hours before their biopsy. They will be
      monitored for 30 minutes for any side effects.

      For the biopsy, participants skin will be numbed. They may have stickers placed on their
      belly to help guide the needle. They will have a CT scan to plan the needle s pathway. For
      the scan, they will lie in a machine that takes pictures of the body. A small camera will be
      placed near the needle to take pictures of the liver. A medical GPS tracking system will be
      used. This will guide the needle into the area of the participant s liver where the biopsy
      will be taken.

      After the biopsy, participants will recover in the hospital for 4 6 hours.

      After the procedure, researchers will take the participants biopsy tissue and look at it to
      try to compare new ways to picture the sample.

      -  Pilot study to evaluate the combination of optical molecular imaging (OMI) and EM
           tracking in localizing intrahepatic lesions and assess the concordance between
           fluorescence ICG and histopathology for the diagnosis of liver cancer.

        -  Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) is the 3rd most common cause of cancer globally with an
           increasing incidence worldwide. Percutaneous sampling of focal hepatic lesions is a
           cornerstone in management of patients with hepatic pathology. In a retrospective study
           of patients with small hepatic lesions, up to 45% of the lesions biopsied were
           insufficiently visualized and resulted to a false negative rate (defined as patients
           with benign biopsies who were subsequently found to have malignant lesions at the
           attempted site of biopsy). Thirty seven percent of those were for HCC.

        -  EM navigation and fusion of real-time images with pre-acquired scans has been used in
           hepatic biopsies at the NIH for more than 15 years. NIH / NCI clinical trials have
           performed fusion biopsies with EM tracking in &gt; 2000 patients, &gt; 40,000 biopsies over
           the past 12 years.

        -  Indocyanine green (ICG) is an FDA approved optical molecular imaging fluorescent dye
           used for visualization of cells and tissues. ICG has been used for decades in
           ophthalmology for imaging retinal blood vessels. ICG was FDA cleared in 1959 and has
           been widely used to assess liver function perioperatively. ICG is administered as an
           injection. Adverse effects are rare and most often minor.
