  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Drowning is the 3rd leading cause of accidental death in the world. One of the tools used by
      lifeguards to help ER assess gravity, is pulse oximetry. Its measure is variable even in
      optimal condition and its accuracy can be altered by factors specific to the patient and by
      environmental factors. The conditions gathered during a drowning rescue are thus propitious
      to a misleading evaluation. Assessing its reliability and looking for influencing factors of
      the measure of pulse oximetry could help for pre-hospital care management.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The research focuses on the measurement of pulse oximetry among lifeguard on the Atlantic
      coast of Gironde, France, before and after their daily training, using a standardized
      measurement protocol.

      The follow-up will be done during the beach monitoring period during the summer of 2020. A
      total of 3 months of measurement collection is expected.
