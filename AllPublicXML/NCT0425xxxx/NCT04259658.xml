  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this phase II study we investigate the effect of calcium electroporation on cancer in the
      skin investigated by histopathology.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this non randomized phase II study, we will explore histopathological tumour cell death
      mechanisms in 12 patients with breast cancer metastases and 12 patients with other cutaneous
      or subcutaneous malignancy. The primary endpoint of the biopsy study is to evaluate
      differences in tumour infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) population in tissue samples from treated
      cancer tumours two days after calcium electroporation treatment compared to samples taken on
      the day of treatment before the calcium electroporation procedure. TIL content in biopsies
      will be evaluated by pathological examination and specified in percent of cells. Patients
      will be followed up to 3 months and depending on number of treated tumors, biopsies will be
      taken at different timepoints after one or two treatments with calcium electroporation. Other
      analyses will include differences regarding tumour type, immune marker expression levels over
      time, vascular effects and regressive changes as well as examining changes in systemic
      immunological markers.

    <intervention_model_description>Prospective phase II clinical study: Patients with cutaneous metastases will be recruited at the Department of Oncology, Zealand University Hospital (ZUH). Two cohorts of each 12 patients with respectively disseminated breast cancer or other solid tumour malignancies, will be included. This will be a non-randomized trial.
All patients will have been offered the standard of care and all available alternatives before entering the protocol. Calcium electroporation will not be compared to other means of treatment.
All patients will be treated once and patients with over 3 metastases will be offered retreatment of some of their metastases. A maximum of 2 treatments per patient will be conducted with an interval of minimum 4 weeks. The patients will be followed with regular examinations for 3 months, starting from first treatment day.</intervention_model_description>
