  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Each year, around 1500 infected Total Hip Arthroplasties (THA) need non-conservative surgery,
      remaining an issue for patients and healthcare units. The recommended treatment, relying on
      cohort reviews and international consensus follows a two-stage protocol. This protocol
      implies a first surgery to remove all infected implants and at least 6 weeks of antibiotic
      treatment without implant, then usually an antibiotic-free period and only then a second
      surgery to put back new implants and start the rehabilitation protocol, with usually more
      than a week of a second hospital stay. Between both surgeries, full-weight bearing is
      prohibited and joint stiffness and/or pain are rather usual complications. Failure rate is
      estimated at 10% in this two-stage strategy. The single-stage procedure (i.e. implanting back
      a new prosthesis during the same surgery after implant removal, synovectomy and lavage) is
      thought to be less susceptible to late functional complications (i.e. pain, stiffness and
      muscle deficiency) with a shorter, single hospital stay.

      Although, with single-stage surgery, infection control could be less efficient because most
      pathogens produce during the first hours of infection an antibiotic-resistant layer called
      biofilm, allowing them to colonize and adhere to foreign objects like implants. This
      single-surgery protocol thus highly relies on antibiotics and has a list of
      contra-indications (based on experts' consensus): the presence of damaged soft tissues or a
      sinus tract, unknown pathogens, difficult to treat micro-organisms, severe immunosuppression
      and for many surgeons, each time a bone graft is necessary. Most of these contra-indications
      are directly related to the biofilm.

      As no randomized control trial has ever compared single-stage versus two-stage surgery, the
      level of evidence for recommending one procedure over the other is low.

      We conducted a survey that showed that most of the French reference centers have already
      switched to single stage surgery for single-stage non contra-indicated cases.

      An antibiotic-loaded hydrogel coating (Defensive Antiadhesive Coating®, Novagenit SRL), has
      been proven to mechanically prevent the biofilm formation, while allowing a prolonged
      intraarticular antibiotic release, in a randomized controlled trial in primary prevention of
      infection in THA.

      The addition of this biofilm inhibitor to a single-stage surgery might stand as a promising
      strategy for secondary prevention of peri-prosthetic hip joint infection. Moreover, using
      this device to prevent biofilm formation could expand one stage surgery to patients that are
      &quot;normally&quot; contra-indicated to one stage surgery.
