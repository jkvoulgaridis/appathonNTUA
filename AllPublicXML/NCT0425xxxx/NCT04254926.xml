      The main objective of the present study is to evaluate the effects of the Revie ⊕
      intervention on the self-esteem of patients diagnosed with an advanced cancer. A pragmatic,
      two-arm parallel-group, waitlist randomized controlled trial is conducted. The study takes
      place in the oncology department of the University Hospitals of Geneva at 3 outpatient units
      with 102 participants (51 per group).

      The main objective of the present study is to evaluate the effects of the Revie ⊕
      intervention on the self-esteem of patients diagnosed with an advanced cancer. The secondary
      objectives are to evaluate the effects of the Revie ⊕ intervention on spiritual well-being,
      personal development, life satisfaction, and the perception of the interaction with the
      nurses. A pragmatic, two-arm parallel-group, waitlist randomized controlled trial (WLRCT) is
      conducted in which participants are randomized into (i) intervention, or (ii) waitlist
      control groups. The intervention group (IG) receive the Revie ⊕ intervention early on and the
      control group (CG) the same intervention but later on (i.e., after eight weeks).This
      monocentric study takes place in the oncology department of the University Hospitals of
      Geneva (HUG) at two outpatient units. The required sample size is 102 participants (51 per
      group).

    <description>Revie ⊕ is a positive approach centered on the resources and strengths of the patient, and it consists of an intervention that focuses on the individual's life review. Revie ⊕ allows specialist nurses to discuss life events with cancer patients, to identify the significant elements, and to explore how the diagnosis has changed their values and preferences. The intervention is geared toward working with the patient to discover their potential, to identify their strategies for coping with the events of their life, and to thereby accompany them in achieving a better understanding of themselves and what defines their identity. The intervention also allows their concerns surrounding death to be addressed, in addition to providing clarity in regard to the life projects. In the end, as a conclusion to the intervention, the patient is provided a booklet recounting the salient features of their life review along with photographs, quotes, or images.</description>
