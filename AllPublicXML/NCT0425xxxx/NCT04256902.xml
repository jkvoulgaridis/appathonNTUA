      Despite increased visibility and acceptance of the LGBT community (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and
      Transgender), in some parts of society, many LGBT people struggle with self-acceptance.
      Minority Stress Theory, described in the scientific literature, explains that health
      disparities among populations such as the LGBT population can be explained by stressors
      induced by a hostile, homophobic culture, which results in harm suffered, expectations of
      rejection, and internalized homophobia. The harm suffered may include acts of discrimination,
      harassment, violence (physical or linguistic). But more deeply, two important points of this
      theory: 1) the expectations of the LGBT person to experience rejection based on their
      identity and the anti-LGBT social stigma, 2) internalized homophobia, which is a social
      internalization from negativity against homosexuality and transgender to the initial stages
      of the identity development of an individual who can continue throughout his life. Perceived
      harm, stigma and lived rejection are associated with an increased propensity to experience
      significant psychological pain. LGBT people are more likely to develop self-identification
      based on sexual orientation or gender, making them more vulnerable to any rejection signal.

      There is a growing scientific interest around Cognitive and Behavioral Therapies (CBT) of 3rd
      wave, also called therapies derived from Buddhism, or therapies based on meditation. These
      programs aim to observe and test, through an experiential meta-cognitive practice, the dogmas
      or preconceptions (about ourselves, others, and the world) and mental attitudes that guide
      our choices without our knowledge and are at the origin of suffering, in order to gain inner
      freedom. These practices constitute an experiential scientific methodology of self-knowledge
      and reality. These secular programs have become a standard treatment in the management of
      stress, chronic pain, and the prevention of relapsing depression. In addition, the interest
      of these practices has been demonstrated in many areas of somatic and psychiatric medicine
      (including depression and suicidal behavior), but also for the promotion of mental health in
      the general population. This topic is the subject of more than 15,000 international
      scientific publications with reading committee (Medline indexed), and of strong interest and
      shared by both the scientific community and the general public.

      Scientists are currently deepening these therapies with a focus on wisdom-based
      self-identification. Beyond the name &quot;therapies&quot;, this educational information is key to life
      for everyone. Who am I ? Am I defined by my social roles, my physical characteristics, my
      preferences? How to face external challenges? How to develop real self-confidence?

      Dr Déborah Ducasse offers a conference on the theme: &quot;Sexual orientation, gender: where is
      the problem?&quot; Nowhere. Self-identification. &quot;. This conference will take place on 05/15/2020,
      on the occasion of World Day Against Homophobia.

      In line with the OECD press release in 2019 &quot;The LGBT challenge: how to improve the
      integration of sexual and gender minorities? &quot;(Panorama de la société 2019: Social Indicators
      of the OECD), the investigators want to assess whether an intervention targeting valid
      self-identification can 1) have a positive impact on the acceptance and discrimination
      indicators of the OECD ; 2) have an impact on valid self-identification.

      Direct benefits are expected, psychologically and socially, in the fight against
      discrimination, inclusion and self-acceptance.

      In the medium and long term: major public health interest via the adaptation of
      psychoeducational interventions based on self-identification in order to prevent psychosocial
      risks and suicidal behavior in connection with an altered self-identification based on sexual
      orientation and gender.

      A wide communication (media, social networks) will be organized around this conference which
      is free to enter A prior registration will be requested by email. For each person sending an
      email to register, they will be offered to participate in the research by following the web
      link to the Google Form questionnaire (&quot;pre-conference&quot;) with information on the proposed
      research. Refusal to participate in the research will not prevent you from attending the
      conference, this will be mentioned when sending the link to the questionnaire.

      At the end of the conference, another email will be sent to those who have agreed to
      participate with a new Google Form link to answer specific &quot;post-conference&quot; questions.

      The impact of the conference will be studied by comparing the pre and post conference
      questionnaires

      Main objective: Evaluate the impact of an educational intervention on self-identification
      (conference &quot;Sexual orientation, gender: where is the problem? Nowhere. Self-identification.&quot;
      Lasting 2 hours), on the acceptance of homosexuality and transgender, in people coming to
      attend this intervention (evaluations before and after)

      Secondary objectives: Evaluate the impact of an educational intervention on
      self-identification (2 hours), on the representations of stigmatization of homosexuality and
      transgender, in people coming to attend this intervention (evaluations before- after).
