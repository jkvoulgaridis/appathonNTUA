    <description>Avelumab 10 mg/kg will be administered every two weeks. Avelumab is administered as a 1-hour iv infusion, diluted with 0.9% saline solution; Axitinib 5 mg should be taken orally twice daily approximately 12 hours apart with or without food. They should be swallowed whole with a glass of water. If the patient vomits or misses a dose, an additional dose should not be taken. The next prescribed dose should be taken at the usual time.
The duration of treatment cycle is 28 days.</description>
