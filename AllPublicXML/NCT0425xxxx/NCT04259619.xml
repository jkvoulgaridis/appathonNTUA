  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Around 30 to 90 percent of all breastfeeding women suffer from painful and sore nipple
      lesions. Reasons for these lesions are still not completely clarified. Nevertheless,
      irrespective of the underlying cause, these painful nipple lesions lead to an early stop of
      breastfeeding, which has negative consequences for the infant as well as for the mother. Even
      if the painful nipple lesions do not lead to a weaning of the baby, they cause an increased
      psychological distress for the mother and therefore may negatively influence the mother-child
      relationship.

      Since breastfeeding is the natural and best possible type of nutrition for healthy, full term
      babies problems causing an early stop of breastfeeding should be addressed.

      The low-level laser therapy (LLLT) represents a simple and low risk treatment to reduce pain
      and accelerate wound healing. It is supposed to improve tissue organization and should have a
      positive anti-inflammatory and immune modulating effect. Therefore, this therapy is more and
      more frequently used to also treat painful nipple lesions, although hardly any studies have
      been conducted. Furthermore, in women with too little mother milk, the LLLT seems to increase
      the milk production.

      The aim of this study is to investigate the positive effects of LLLT on painful and sore
      nipple lesions. This would justify a LLLT for women with painful nipple lesions on a wider
      scale, with the overall goal to reduce early stopping of breastfeeding and therefore having a
      positive impact on both, the child's health as well as the mother's wellbeing.

      This study is conducted at the department of obstetrics of the University hospital of Zurich.
      194 breastfeeding or expressing participants with sore and painful nipple lesions who fulfill
      the inclusion criteria are included in this study. If the participant meets any exclusion
      criteria she is excluded from this study. After being enrolled in the study, the participant
      is randomized to get either 3 low-level laser therapy (LLLT) treatments or 3 placebo
      treatments within 1 to 3 days.

      Women having signed the declaration of consent and fulfill all inclusion criteria are then
      examined by a breastfeeding consultant. During this examination nipple lesions are classified
      into four different stages, causes for the lesions are evaluated and the nipple form is
      recorded. A swab of the milk is taken to rule out a pathogenetic colonization with germs.
      Then a blood sample is collected to analyze inflammatory parameters (C-reactive protein
      (CRP), leucocyte (Lc)), inflammation modulators (interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor
      alpha (TNF-Î±)) and the lactating hormone (prolactin). The taking of blood is repeated at the
      end of the third therapy. In the beginning and at the end of the last treatment, nipple
      lesions are classified and photographically documented. Specific instructions regarding the
      correct positioning and removal of the baby at the breast as well as breastfeeding positions
      are given to the women before starting the treatment. Women then breastfeed their baby once
      before and once after the entire therapy. Two hours after breastfeeding, the amount of milk
      is being measured after 15 minutes of pumping. Additionally, the sensation of pain is
      evaluated on the basis of a visual analog scale (VAS) from 1-10 and the satisfaction of the
      treatment is recorded before and after every single treatment. At the end of the last
      therapy, a final examination is conducted.

      For the statistical analysis of the primary and secondary endpoints a proportional odds model
      is used.

    <masking_description>The low-level laser and the placebo-laser cannot be differentiated visually. The lasers are marked with the names &quot;Geraet1&quot; and &quot;Geraet2&quot;.

    <description>The primary goal is to evaluate the pain reduction with the help of a visual pain scale form 1 to 10 (0 = no pain; 10 = pain as bad as can be).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Wound Healing</measure>
    <time_frame>though individual study completion, an average of 3 days</time_frame>
    <description>One secondary goal is to evaluate the effect of the low-level laser therapy (LLLT) on wound healing. For this evaluation the nipple lesions are staged from 1-4 and photo documented and inflammatory markers (C reactive protein (CRP) and leucocytes (Lc)) and modulators (interleukin 6 (IL6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) are analyzed in the blood.</description>

    <time_frame>though individual study completion, an average of 3 days</time_frame>
    <description>Another secondary goal is to evaluate the effect of the low-level laser therapy (LLLT) on milk production. This is done through measuring the milk production after 15 minutes pumping of both breasts and analyzing the prolactin in the blood.</description>

    <description>An additional secondary goal is to evaluate the participants' degree of satisfaction with the LLLT. This is accomplished with the help of a visual analogue scaled.</description>
