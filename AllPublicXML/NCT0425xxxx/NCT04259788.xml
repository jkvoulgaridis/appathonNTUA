    <textblock>
      The investigators are conducting this study to examine if a healthy diet based on the
      Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI) influences pain symptoms, quality of life, and
      inflammatory markers measured in blood samples in women with endometriosis who are currently
      experiencing pain symptoms.

    <description>The intervention group will receive in-person dietary counseling from a registered dietitian to help participants consume a diet that is consistent the AHEI dietary guidelines. Participants in this arm will be asked to consume this diet for a 12-week period and discontinue any vitamin or supplement intake during this time. During the first 4 weeks 2 meals and 1 snack/day will be shipped to the participant. During the last 8 weeks of the intervention, the study will provide the participants with a 14-day meal plan (3 meals and 2 snacks) that adheres to the AHEI maximum score criteria to help facilitate adherence to the diet.</description>
