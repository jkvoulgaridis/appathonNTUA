      The aim of this study is to compare the effects of clinical pilates and whole body vibration
      exercises in postmenopausal osteoporotic women in terms of strength, flexibility, balance,
      bone turnover markers and quality of life. Thirty-four women who are diagnosed with
      postmenopausal osteoporosis will be recruited into the study. Participants will be divided
      into two groups: (1) clinical pilates group, (2) vibration exercises group. Exercise programs
      will be performed two times per week for twelve weeks. The strength of the extensor muscles
      of the hip, knee, back, elbow will be measured with a hand-held dynamometer. Flexibility will
      be assessed measuring the fingertip-to-floor distance in flexion and lateral bending. The
      balance performance will be assessed using the timed up and go test, Tetrax fall index and
      the maximum hold time on unipedal stance and on tandem stance. The short form-12
      questionnaire will be used to assess the quality of life. Also, bone turnover markers will be
      measured. All assessments will be performed before and after exercise programs.
