  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Two arms RCT is design, patients with pancreatic body or tail adenocarcinoma will be randomly
      assigned to the Radical Antegrade Modular Pancreaticosplenectomy (RAMPS) group or Standard
      Retrograde Pancreatosplenectomy (SRPS) group. The primary objective is to evaluate the effect
      of RAMPS on the overall survival of patients with resectable body and tail pancreatic ductal
      adenocarcinoma. And the secondary objective is to evaluate the disease-free survival, R0
      resection rate, number of retrieved lymph nodes and perioperative outcomes like postoperative
      complication rate, severe complications, mortality and functional recovery time between the
      experimental group and control group.

    <measure>Overall survival</measure>
    <time_frame>21 months</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival was defined as the time from surgery to either death or last follow-up.

    <description>Radical antegrade modular pancreatosplenectomy (RAMPS) includes the following aspects. Firstly, the surgical approach is &quot;antegrade&quot;, which means from the right to the left, the pancreatic neck will be transected at first and the spleen will be seperated at last. Secondly, lymph nodes dissection includes not only the regional lymph nodes(No.10,11,18 lymph nodes), but also N1 station lymph nodes (N1: 6, 8a, 8p, 12a2/b2/p2, 13a/b, 14b/c/d, 14v, 17a/b), No.7, 9 lymph nodes, the lymph nodes anterior and left of superior mesenteric artery, as well as the peripheral nerve of celiac trunk. Thirdly, the transection platform is in the pancreatic neck, which is mandatory. At last, left prerenal fascia will be resected. When the tumor abuts or infiltrates the left adrenal gland, left adrenalectomy will be performed, which is also called &quot;posterior approach RAMPS&quot;. While in normal cases, left adrenal gland will be preserved.</description>

    <description>Standard retrograde pancreatosplenectomy(SRPS) includes several key points. Firstly, the surgical approach is &quot;retrograde&quot;, which means from the left to the right, spleen will be seperated at first and the pancreas will be transected later on. Secondly, only the regional lymph nodes will be dissected, which include No.10, No.11, No.18 lymph nodes, and No.9 lymph nodes should be dissected only when the lesion is in pancreatic neck. Thirdly, the transection platform is in the left side of the lesion, but transection at pancreatic neck is not mandatory. At last, the surgical plane is anterior to the left renal fascia, prerenal fascia will be preserved.</description>
