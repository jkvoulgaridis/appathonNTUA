      Main objective: To assess the efficacy of a phase III cardiac rehabilitation program (CRP),
      based on counseling in the maintenance of physical exercise (time of physical exercise per
      week) for patients with myocardial ischemia (MI), once the supervised physical exercise
      program of phase II of CRP is completed.

      Secondary objectives: To assess the efficacy of a phase III program of CRP based on
      counseling in the maintenance of physical exercise for the patient with MI in: 1) the energy
      expenditure per week, 2) body mass index and abdominal perimeter, 3) control of
      cardiovascular risk factors (smoking, high blood pressure, dyslipidemia and diabetes
      mellitus), 4) quality of life related to health, 5) assess the adherence to cardiac
      pharmacological treatment.

      Method: Randomized clinical trial in conglomerates, open and controlled. The intervention
      group will carry out phase III of CRP based on counseling in the maintenance of physical
      exercise. The control group will receive the usual care. The main outcome will be the
      physical exercise time per week after finish the supervised physical exercise program of
      phase II of CRP and at 6 and 12 month later according to the 7-day Physical Activity Recall.

    <description>The usual care in patients with myocardial ischemia without other cardiovascular risk factors (CVFR) will be to attend one visit per year with doctor and nurse of the local health center. In this visit, it will be done a blood test and an electrocardiogram. Blood pressure, weight, body mass index, abdominal circumference will be measured and, in case of detecting enolic habit, smoking or sedentary lifestyle, generic advice will be done. If the patient, apart from myocardial ischemia, presents diabetes mellitus type 2, 3-4 follow-up visits per year will be recommended and will be increased according to specific needs. In case of presenting hypertension, will be recommended 2 visits with the nurse and one visit with the doctor per year and will be increased according to specific needs. In addition, in this case the blood pressure is checked every 6 months. During all visits, professionals will reinforce the control of CVRF and the maintenance of a long-term cardio-healthy lifestyle.</description>

    <description>Patient will go to health center to visit the cardiac rehabilitation (CR) reference team, which is composed for a doctor and a nurse. This team will establish the guideline of action in the maintenance and/or increase in the physical exercise practice, in function of the resources of each zone and the preferences and motivations of the patient. They also reinforce the control of CVRF and the maintenance of a long-term cardio-healthy lifestyle.
At the end of the visit, control visit will be given with the CR reference team at 3, 6 and 12 months after completing the supervised physical exercise program of phase II of the CRP. In case of detecting specific needs for the patient and/or relapses, the team will consult with the appropriate professional (cardiologist, cardiology nurse, physiotherapist, rehabilitator, nutritionist and/or psychologist). At the same time, the patient will be informed of the possibility of re-evaluating the CR reference team.</description>
