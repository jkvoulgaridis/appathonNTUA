      Background: One of the many consequences of pregnancy that may negatively affect a woman's
      quality of life is stress urinary incontinence caused by activities of daily living
      especially those associated with increased intraabdominal pressure. Objective: This study
      aimed to investigate the effect of global postural correction exercises on stress urinary
      incontinence among pregnant women. Participants and Methods: Forty primigravida women (aged
      between 30-39 years), with a single fetus, diagnosed with stress urinary incontinence
      participated in the study. Participants were assigned randomly into two groups: Study group
      (group A; n=20) and control group (group B; n=20). The participants were tested twice, before
      and after a 12-week period, during which group A received global postural correction
      exercises in addition to Kegel exercises, while group B performed only Kegel exercises. A
      perineometer was used to evaluate the change in vaginal squeeze pressure both before and
      after conducting the study. Urogenital Distress Inventory Questionnaire (UDI-6) was used to
      assess changes in incontinence severity symptoms.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Forty primigravida women with singleton fetus in their third trimester and diagnosed
             with pregnancy related SUI participated in this study.

        All participants suffered from a mild to moderate grade of SUI identified by clinical
        grading (Ingelman-Sundberg) (Wlazlak et al., 2015) as follows: Grade I (mild), the leakage
        of urine occurs on straining; and grade II (moderate), the leakage occurs following abrupt
        movement

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Females were excluded from the study if they had severe grade SUI; infections in their
             lower urinary tract; neurological conditions; gestational diabetes; and chronic chest
             diseases. Females who smoked, used any medications or medical/surgical interventions
             for SUI, or who suffered any other type of urinary incontinence were also excluded
             from the study
