  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to quantitatively record the opinions regarding the pros and cons of
      this treatment of the caregivers of children with cerebral palsy who had botulinum toxin
      applied in investigators' clinic.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Spasticity is defined as an increase in physiological resistance of the muscles associated
      with a lack of supraspinal inhibition against passive strain. It is a common and prohibitive
      problem associated with an increase in tendon reflex and tension reflex associated with upper
      motor neuron dysfunction. One of the most common problems in patients with CP.

      Methods used in the treatment of spasticity; medical therapy, physical therapy, intrathecal
      baclofen pump, botulinum toxin injection, and orthopedic correction operations. However,
      botulinum toxin type-A (BTX-A) injections, which are applied to the muscles especially for
      localized spasticity, have become an effective adjuvant option that increases the
      effectiveness of classical methods and diversifies the treatment options.

      BTX-A, which is basically a chemodenervation method; It is a treatment method that blocks the
      transmission of signal in the neuromuscular junction by preventing the release of
      acetylcholine vesicles into the presynaptic space. In spastic muscles, relaxation can be
      achieved by correct injection. Botulinum toxin type A has been shown to be an effective and
      safe treatment for children to reduce spasticity.

      In Turkish society, there is no study evaluating the caregivers' experiences and opinions
      about botox treatments of patients with the diagnosis of cerebral palsy and limited studies
      in the literature are from countries with different sociodemographic features such as the
      United States and the United Kingdom. Although these patients have been receiving this
      treatment in investigators' center for years, there is no study in the literature that
      evaluates the plus and minus aspects of caregivers' experiences in this regard.
