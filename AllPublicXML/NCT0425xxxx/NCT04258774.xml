    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to better understand how blood flow and metabolism are
      different between normal controls and patients with disease.

      The investigators will examine brain blood flow and metabolism using magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI). The brain's blood vessels expand and constrict to regulate blood flow based on
      the brain's needs. The amount of expanding and contracting the blood vessels can do varies by
      age. The brain's blood flow changes in small ways during everyday activities, such as normal
      brain growth, exercise, or deep concentration. Significant illness or physiologic stress may
      increase the brain's metabolic demand or cause other bigger changes in blood flow. If blood
      vessels are not able to expand to give more blood flow when metabolic demand is high, the
      brain may not get all of the oxygen it needs. In less extreme circumstances, not having as
      much oxygen as it wants may cause the brain to grow and develop more slowly than it should.

      One way to test the ability of the blood vessels to expand is by measuring blood flow while
      breathing in carbon dioxide (CO2). CO2 causes blood vessels in the brain to dilate without
      increasing brain metabolism. The study team will use a special mask to control the amount of
      oxygen and carbon dioxide patients breath in so that we can study how their brain reacts to
      these changes. This device designed to simulate carbon dioxide levels achieved by a
      breath-hold and target the concentration of carbon dioxide in the blood in breathing
      patients. The device captures exhaled gas and provides an admixture of fresh gas and
      neutral/expired gas to target different carbon dioxide levels while maintaining a fixed
      oxygen level. The study team will obtain MRI images of the brain while the subjects are
      breathing air controlled by the device.
