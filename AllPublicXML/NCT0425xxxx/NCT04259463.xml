    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate, wheather the sedation or general anesthesia in third
      molar extractions influence the patient's psycho-emotional status. It is believed that the
      type of anesthesia may influence not only the psycho-emotional status after the procedure,
      but also before the procedure.

      A prospective pilot study was conducted on adult patients who were admitted to the Faculty of
      Surgery at LSMU KK hospital for removal of all four wisdom teeth with sedation or general
      anesthesia. The patients were given one day to complete the given questionnaires. They were
      asked to complete three questionnaires: a) before the surgery, i.e. at the time the patient
      was hospitalized; b) the same day prior to surgery; c) ten days after the surgery. The
      operating doctor also filled out a questionnaire ten days after the surgery.

    <description>Anesthesia effect on patients pre-operative psycho-emotional status. The following scales are used: Universal Scale in Oral Surgery for psycho-emotional rating (1-3 raiting with higher rating meaning more negative psycho-emotional status); Modified Corah's Dental Anxiety Questionnaire (1-5 scores with with higher rating meaning more negative psycho-emotional status); visual analogue scales on fear of tooth extraction and fear of general anesthesia (1-5 scores with higher rating meaning higher fear)</description>

Also the pain that was felt immediately after the procedure, 6 hours after the procedure, 24 hours after the procedure, 2-10 days after the procedure was evaluated. The linear scale of 10cm was used, where the less points ment lower pain. Patient had to point the vertical dash on a line to represent the pain</description>
