  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      toSense, Inc. has developed a novel, non-invasive, body-worn sensor -CoVa Patch-that offers
      an alternative to invasive continuous cardiac output monitoring. To validate this new
      sensor's measurements of stroke volume and cardiac output, toSense, Inc. will conduct a study
      that compares its measurement performance to that from a pulmonary artery catheter using the
      thermodilution method.

      This in an introductory clinical study with cardiac ICU patients featuring CoVa Patch. This
      is a single site, non-blinded, non-randomized study. It will employ a retrospective analysis
      comparing the accuracy of SV and CO. The 'test sensor', CoVa Patch, which will measure SV and
      CO quasi-continuously and non-invasively, approximately every 5-30 minutes for a period of
      time lasting approximately 12-48 hours. These measurements will be compared to those from a
      'reference device', which is the pulmonary arterial catheter. It uses an invasive technique
      called thermodilution that will be made approximately every 4 hours. Measurements between the
      test and reference devices will be compared in a retrospective analysis once the study has
      completed.

    <description>The primary objective of this study is to validate stroke volume (the amount of blood pumped by the left ventrical of the heart in one contraction) measurements made using CoVa Patch to those made using a pulmonary artery catheter and the thermodilution method.
Thermodilution requires a pulmonary artery catheter and are calculated by a monitoring system based on temperature changes in the heart when a cooler solution is injected into the right atrium via the proximal port of a pulmonary artery catheter.</description>
