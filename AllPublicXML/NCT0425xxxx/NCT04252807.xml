  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Millions of children in low resource settings are at high risk of poor
      development due to factors such as undernutrition, inadequate stimulation and maternal
      depression. Evidence based interventions to address these risk factors exist, but often as a
      separate and overlapping packages delivered through disjointed systems, therefore posing
      problems in scale-up. A common elements approach based intervention that combines
      evidence-based elements from packages of care addressing early stimulation, responsive
      feeding and maternal distress have been developed.

      Objectives: The current study aims to develop an online training curriculum to train lay
      health workers in common elements based intervention to improve maternal psychological
      well-being and improve mother-infant interaction among distressed mothers in low resource
      rural community settings of Pakistan. The impact of intervention on maternal well-being,
      infant growth, nutrition and development will be evaluated at 12-months post-partum.

      Method: A two arm, single blind, individual randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be carried
      out in the community settings of the rural sub-district of Gujar Khan in Rawalpindi,
      Pakistan. 250 Pregnant women in third trimester of pregnancy, screened positive for
      psychological distress on Self-Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ), cut-off score ≥ 9, will be
      randomized on 1:1 allocation ratio into intervention (n=125) and Treatment as Usual (TAU)
      arms (n=125). The participants in the intervention arm will receive 15 monthly sessions of
      intervention by community volunteers at home. First three sessions will be delivered in the
      third trimester of pregnancy followed by one monthly session for 12 months. The primary
      outcome will be caregiver-infant interaction at 12-months post-partum. The maternal secondary
      outcomes include maternal psychological wellbeing, quality of life, social support and
      empowerment. Maternal outcomes will be measured at baseline, 6-months and 12-months
      post-partum. Infant secondary outcomes include growth, nutrition and development and will be
      measured at 12 months. A mixed-methods process monitoring and evaluation will be conducted to
      inform the feasibility of intervention delivery.

      Discussion: The outcomes of the study will be a common-elements based online training
      curriculum for training of community volunteers in intervention to improve maternal
      psychological well-being and mother-infant interaction in low resource rural community
      settings at-scale.

    <measure>Observation of Mother and Child Interaction Tool (OMCI)</measure>
    <time_frame>At 12-months postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>Maternal responsive caregiving behaviours will be assessed using the Observation of Mother and Child Interaction (OMCI) tool . OMCI tool is based on responsive parenting framework proposed by Landry and colleagues. The research assistants will observe a live 5-minute mother-infant interaction while mother and infant will play together with a picture book. The tool comprises of 19 items covering maternal affect, maternal touch, maternal verbalization, sensitivity and contingent responses, scaffolding, language stimulation, focus, child affect, child focus, child's communication efforts, and mutual enjoyment. The scoring format is based on the frequency of the occurrence of behaviours with higher scores indicating more responsive interactions. The OMCI tool has been validated for use in similar population in Pakistan.</description>

    <measure>Ages and Stages Questionnaire 3rd Edition (ASQ3)</measure>
    <time_frame>At 12-months postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>Ages and Stages Questionnaire 3rd Edition (ASQ3) will be used to measure developmental delays in communication, gross motor, fine motor, problem solving, and personal social domains. It provides cut-off score in 5 domains of development that indicates possible need for further evaluation. It highlights results that fall in a &quot;monitoring zone,&quot; to make it easier to keep track of children at risk. Items are rated on 3-point likert scale, yes (10), sometime (5) and not yet (0). Higher score indicates that child is developing well.</description>

    <description>Quality and quantity of stimulation and support in the child's home will be measured using home inventory. It has 45 items, rated on dichotomous scale, yes (1) or no (0). It has six sub-scales including parental responsiveness, acceptance of child, organization of environment, learning materials, parental involvement, variety in experience. Higher score shows more enriched home environment.</description>

    <measure>Early breastfeeding (EBF) scale</measure>
    <time_frame>At 6-months postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>Assessors will document what the infant was fed in the last 24 hours at 6 months postpartum. This information will be categorized as either EBF, partial breastfeeding (giving an infant some breastfeeding, and some artificial foods, either milk, cereal, or other food items), or no breastfeeding, using three items scale. The items will be rated on 3-point likert scale; yes (1), no (0) and don't know (888). Lower score represents that infant is not exclusively breastfed. If the infant will not exclusively breastfeed, details of when (age of infant) and why EBF was discontinued will be recorded. At the first follow-up immediately after delivery, details about early initiation, discarding colostrum, use of pre-lacteals, and reasons for delaying or not initiating breastfeeding will be assessed۔</description>

    <time_frame>At baseline and 12-months' post-partum</time_frame>
    <description>Women's empowerment will be measured using a questionnaire consisting of: (a) two items previously used in the same population that assess financial empowerment (i.e., whether a woman is given a lump-sum of money for day-to-day expenses and whether she can make independent decisions about its use) and (b) 7 items to measure relative freedom from domination within the family (i.e., whether in the past year family had taken money, land, jewellery or livestock from her against her will, prevented her from visiting her parental home, or prevented her from working outside the home) and economic security and contribution (i.e., does she possess any land, productive assets, and or cash). Women who answer 'yes' to both items on financial empowerment and three items from economic security and contribution subscales and 'no' to all items regarding family domination will be classified as 'empowered'.</description>

    <description>In addition to the routine care delivered by Lady Health Workers (LHWs), the participants in the intervention arm will receive common elements based integrated intervention. The providers of the intervention are lay health workers who will be trained in the intervention using an online course. The lay health worker will complete the online training course in a group, with interactive group activities and role plays. Lay health workers will be supported online and in-person by the trainers in monthly supervision meetings. The lay health workers will deliver intervention to distressed mothers in 15 monthly sessions. The intervention consists of three modules including 1) mothers' well-being, 2) infant nutrition,early stimulation and breastfeeding and 3) mother-infant interaction.</description>
