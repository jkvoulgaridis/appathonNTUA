      This study aims to elucidate the impact of SGLT2 inhibition on peripheral vascular function,
      renal function, fluid volume, neurohormonal activation and inflammatory/fibrotic pathways in
      patients with T2D at high cardiovascular risk and non-T2D patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In light of EMPA-REG OUTCOME, CANVAS Program and DECLARE trials, we aim to elucidate the
      impact of SGLT2 inhibition on peripheral vascular function while also exploring the effects
      of this therapy on renal function, fluid volume, neurohormonal activation and
      inflammatory/fibrotic pathways in patients with T2D at high cardiovascular risk to best
      replicate the patient populations in recent cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOT), who are
      also participating in ongoing CVOTs such as VERTIS (ertugliflozin), as well as non-T2D
      patients in other ongoing trials examining cardiorenal effects of these therapies. We will
      test the hypothesis that in a high- risk population, regardless of T2D status, SGLT2
      inhibition will improve markers of arterial stiffness (decreases in pulse wave velocity and
      augmentation index) in the study cohort - a surrogate marker of cardiovascular risk
      independent of glucose lowering. In addition, dapagliflozin will improve endothelial function
      (&quot;flow-mediated vasodilatation&quot; - FMD) and increase natriuresis (fractional excretion of
      sodium or FENa+), thereby reducing blood pressure, without inducing renal vasoconstriction or
      activation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). Based on extensive experimental
      literature, we also hypothesize that SGLT2 inhibition will suppress levels of
      pro-inflammatory/fibrotic mediators (see below) that have been linked with progression of
      cardiovascular and renal disease. The systematic understanding of the effects of SGLT2
      inhibitors in the setting of patients at high cardiovascular risk will enable the design of
      rational physiology-based strategies to decrease the burden of cardiorenal disease, which
      could have important clinical and research implications. Data from DAPA-SWEET will also be
      valuable to better understand the results of trials that include patients using SGLT2
      inhibitors as primary prevention strategies, such as in DECLARE TIMI-58.
