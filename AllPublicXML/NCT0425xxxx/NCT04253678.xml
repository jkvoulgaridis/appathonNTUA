      The purpose of this observational antidepressant study is to determine the efficacy of
      vortioxetine on depression and cognitive function, and elucidate its potential effects on
      quality of life in patients with cancer (of any origin). We hypothesise that given its unique
      mechanism of action as a multimodal serotonin modulator, vortioxetine is set to achieve the
      above goals while maintaining a favourable side effect profile.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancer is always a feared illness and the diagnosis of cancer has huge psychological impact
      on the patients. Depression is one of the most common psychiatric sequelae and affects the
      disease outcome in cancer patients. Along with depression, cancer patients are also
      vulnerable to develop cognitive impairment. It could be related to the cancer or its
      treatment. Cognitive impairment that occurs among cancer patient is known as cancer related
      cognitive impairment (CRCI). Depression together with cognitive impairment adversely affect
      the quality of life of cancer patients. To date, the optimal treatment of depression in
      cancer is not established. The number of studies investigated the efficacy of pharmacotherapy
      for depression in cancer patient is limited. The evidence of treatment for cognitive
      impairment in depressed cancer patients is even more scarce.

      Vortioxetine is one of the latest marketed antidepressants in Malaysia. It has numerous
      additional effects as compared to other conventional antidepressants. In addition to blockade
      of the serotonin transporter (SERT), vortioxetine has affinity for 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT3, and
      5-HT7 receptors and as such, it is described as a 'multimodal serotonin modulator'. This may
      explain the additional benefit of vortioxetine in the treatment of depression as compared to
      other antidepressants. Furthermore, the unique mechanism of action of vortioxetine was also
      reported to improve cognitive function in patients with depression.

      General Objective:

      To examine the effect of vortioxetine in improving the depressive symptoms, cognitive
      impairment and quality of life in cancer patients who have major depressive disorder.

      Specific Objectives:

        1. To determine whether treatment with antidepressant vortioxetine is effective to improve
           depressive symptoms in patients diagnosed with cancer (of any origin) and major
           depressive disorder.

        2. To determine whether treatment with antidepressant vortioxetine is effective to improve
           cognitive impairment in patients diagnosed with cancer (of any origin) and major
           depressive disorder.

        3. To determine whether treatment with antidepressant vortioxetine is effective to improve
           quality of life in patients diagnosed with cancer (of any origin) and major depressive
           disorder.

    <measure>Changes in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline (week 1), week 2, week 4, week 8, week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The MADRS is a widely used clinical rating scale for depression. It consists of 10 items evaluating core symptoms of depression (Montgomery &amp; Ã„sberg, 1979; Montgomery et al., 1978). Nine of the items are based upon patient report, and one is on the rater's observation during the rating interview. MADRS items are rated on a 0-6 continuum (0=no abnormality, 6=severe). The MADRS is relatively quick to administer and addresses core mood symptoms of depression such as sadness, tension, lassitude, pessimistic thoughts, and suicidal thoughts.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Perceived Deficits Questionnaire - 5 items (PDQ-5)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline (week 1), week 2, week 4, week 8, week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The PDQ-5 is a brief patient-rated scale to assess subjective cognitive dysfunction in people with depression. The PDQ originally is a 20-item questionnaire developed by Dr. Michael Sullivan at McGill University as a scale for use in patients with multiple sclerosis that generates a total score and 4 subscale scores (attention/concentration, retrospective memory, prospective memory, and planning/organization) (Sullivan et al., 1990). A 5-item version (PDQ-D-5) is a brief version and has been adapted and validated for use in patients with major depressive disorder.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Clinical Global Impression (CGI)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline (week 1), week 2, week 4, week 8, week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI allows psychiatrist to assess the patient's condition relative to baseline and rate the change on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in EORTC-QLQ-C30</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline (week 1), week 2, week 4, week 8, week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The EORTC QLQ-C30 is widely used clinical scale for measurement of cancer-specific quality of life. It contains five functioning scales (physical, social, role, cognitive, and emotional functioning), eight symptom scales (fatigue, nausea/vomiting, pain, dyspnea, sleep disturbances, appetite loss, constipation, and diarrhea), financial impact, and overall quality of life. All scale scores are linearly converted to range from 0 to 100. For the functioning scales and global QOL higher scores indicate better functioning; for the symptom scales higher scores indicate higher symptom burden (Aaronson et al., 1993).</description>

The assessment timelines will be at week 2, week 4, week 8, and week 12.
Side effects, if any, will be recorded using the Antidepressant Side-effect Checklist (ASEC).</description>
