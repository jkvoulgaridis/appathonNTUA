  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the superiority of the effectiveness of
      canagliflozin 100 milligram (mg) daily versus placebo in participants with symptomatic heart
      failure (HF) in improving the overall Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) Total
      Symptom Score (TSS).

    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in KCCQ-TSS will be reported. The KCCQ is a 23-item, self-administered questionnaire with score range of 0 to 100, and higher scores indicating better health.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Total Daily Step Count from Baseline to Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in total daily step count will be reported. Step count will be measured from the Fitbit device data. The Fitbit app on the participant's phone will collect all data from the Fitbit device.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in KCCQ Individual Domain Scores to Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The KCCQ is a 23-item self-administered questionnaire developed to independently measure the patient's perception of their health status over eight domains: physical limitation; symptom stability; symptom frequency; symptom burden; total symptom; social limitation; self-efficacy; and quality of life. Summary scores will be computed: the &quot;Clinical Summary Score&quot; including total symptom and physical limitation scores; and the &quot;Overall Summary Score&quot; including the total symptom, physical limitation, social limitations and quality of life scores. Scores are transformed into values ranging from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating more favorable health status. Improvement in physical limitation, quality of life, clinical summary, and overall summary will be assessed.</description>
