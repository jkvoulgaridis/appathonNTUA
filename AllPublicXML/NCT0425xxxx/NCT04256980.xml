        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Men and women, aged 18 or older.

          2. Histologically or cytologically confirmed cholangiocarcinoma which was considered to
             be advanced/metastatic or surgically unresectable by the investigator through image
             examination.

          3. Radiographically measurable disease per RECIST v 1.1

          4. Documentation of FGFR2 rearrangement.

          5. Documented disease progression after at least 1 line of prior systemic therapy.

          6. ECOG performance status of 0~1.

          7. Life expectancy ≥12 weeks.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior receipt of a selective FGFR inhibitor.

          2. History of calcium and phosphate hemostasis disorder or systemic mineral imbalance
             with ectopic calcification of softy tissues ( exception: skin, kidney, tendons or
             vessels due to injury, disease, and aging, in the absence of systemic mineral
             imbalance).

          3. Currently evidence of clinically significant corneal or retinal disorder confirmed by
             ophthalmologic examination.

          4. Use of any potent CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers within 14 days or 5 half-lives,
             whichever is shorter, before the first dose of study drug. Topical ketoconazole will
             be allowed.
