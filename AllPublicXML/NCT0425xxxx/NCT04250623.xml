      and/or left participant back for 3 consecutive weeks. After 10 days, will have another
      application of the same product, which will be removed in 24 hours. Medical evaluation will
      be available throughout the study to assess possible adverse events.

      40 subjects, aged 18 to 70 years, phototypes II to III (according to Fitzpatrick
      classification). The patch test will be used to verify the absence of photoallergy and
      phototoxicity by the investigational products. The products will be applied twice a week for
      3 consecutive weeks, as they are over semi-occlusive dressings. The product will remain in
      contact with the skin for 24 hours, after product removal the area will be irradiated with
      ultraviolet lamp A and B (UVA/UVB). Then, the procedure will be repeated after 10 days of
      wash out.
