      The purpose of this open label study is to evaluate longer term tolerability and early
      efficacy of transcranial ultrasound in the treatment of patients with refractory depression
      and anxiety.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present study is designed as an open label study of patients with refractory depression
      and anxiety to evaluate longer term tolerability and early efficacy of transcranial
      ultrasound treatment. Baseline and outcome measures in this study utilize validated tests
      that are appropriate for repeated measures which are not affected by practice effects. For
      patients with refractory depression, the target will be the subgenual cingulate (Brodmann's
      area 25) through a trans temporal scalp window. For patients with anxiety, the target will be
      the amygdala. Targeting will include reference to scalp fiducials based on the obtained MRI
      and Doppler waveform confirmation will be obtained because of the ability of TCD to record
      Doppler signal from the posterior cerebral artery that runs medial to the mesial temporal
      lobe.

      On the day of the ultrasound appointment, patients will undergo ten to thirty minutes of
      transcranial ultrasound treatment. The sonification device will be aimed at the subgenual
      cingulate or amygdala, depending on the predetermined condition. Targeting will include
      reference to scalp fiducials based on the obtained MRI; confirmation of target accuracy will
      either be obtained by Doppler waveform confirmation or optical tracking technology which
      co-registers patient neuroimaging with real space. Patients will undergo 8 total sessions of
      focused ultrasound. Patients will be evaluated at baseline and upon final ultrasound
      treatment using the same measures obtained upon entry. Safety and any adverse events will be
      monitored closely.

    <description>The BDI-II is a 21-question multiple-choice self-report inventory. Each question involves four possible responses, ranging in intensity from &quot;0&quot; (this item does not apply) to &quot;3&quot; (this item applies severely). The test is scored as the sum of all of the response values; this number is used to determine the severity of depressive symptoms. A score of 0 to 3 is possible for each question with a maximum total score of 63 points. The standard cutoff scores are as follows: 0-13 total points = minimal depression; 14-19 total points = mild depression; 20-28 total points = moderate depression; and 29-63 total points = severe depression. A reduction in the total score by at least 30% is considered to be clinically significant.</description>

    <description>The PDQ-9 is a 9-item, self-report questionnaire to evaluate for depressive symptoms. Each question asks the patient if they have experienced a particular depressive symptom over the past two weeks. Answers may range from &quot;0&quot; (not at all), &quot;1&quot; (several days/week), &quot;2&quot; (more than half of the days), and &quot;3&quot; (nearly every day). Maximum total score is 27 points. A higher score indicates more severe depressive symptoms. A reduction in total score by at least 30% is considered clinically meaningful.</description>

    <description>The BAI is a 21-question multiple-choice self-report inventory that is used for measuring the severity of anxiety symptoms. Each of the 21 items asks whether the patient has experienced various anxiety symptoms in the last two weeks, and if so, how severely. Each question/answer is scored on a scale value of &quot;0&quot; (not at all) to &quot;3&quot; (severely). Higher total scores indicate more severe anxiety symptoms. The maximum total score possible is 63 points. The standard cutoff scores are: 0-7 = minimal anxiety; 8-15 = mild anxiety; 16-25 = moderate anxiety; 26-63 = severe anxiety. A reduction in score by at least 30% is considered clinically meaningful.</description>

    <description>The FDA has determined that power intensity limits of 720 mW/cm squared at 2 megaHertz is safe for clinical use; the proposed equipment works within these parameters. Furthermore, monitoring sessions up to one hour as proposed in this study are routinely used in patients even with acute brain injury at 2 megaHertz without any reports of complications induced by the ultrasound device. No brain heating, cavitation or bleeding has been identified with the proposed equipment and protocol. For each individual safety can be followed by performing a selective mental status exam at each session completion.</description>
