  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary study objective is to evaluate the optimization of Nano-Pulse Stimulation (NPS)
      energy settings for lesion clearance of Sebaceous Hyperplasia (SH) lesions from facial areas
      of healthy adult subjects.

      -  Evaluate lesion clearance of treated facial Sebaceous Hyperplasia lesions using multiple
           sized treatment tips with microneedles.

        -  Evaluate lesion clearance of the treated Sebaceous Hyperplasia lesions using multiple
           energy settings levels at various time points.

        -  Evaluate skin effects and adverse event rate.
