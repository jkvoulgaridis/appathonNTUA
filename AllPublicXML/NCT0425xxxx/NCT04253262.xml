      This is a single arm Phase Ib/II, open label, safety, pharmacokinetic and efficacy clinical
      study in adult patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).
      Patients will be treated with the combination of copanlisib and rucaparib for as long as the
      patient does not have clinically significant progressive disease and/or unacceptable toxicity
      and/or as long as the investigator deems that the patient is benefiting from treatment.
      Treatment may also be stopped if the patient withdraws consent, or study termination occurs.
