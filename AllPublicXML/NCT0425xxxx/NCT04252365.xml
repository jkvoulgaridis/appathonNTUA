      This study is a single-center, randomized controlled, phase II clinical trial, aiming at
      giving a comparison of Sintilimab and Pembrolizumab in stage IIIB-IV NSCLC patients at
      first-line treatment setting.

      This trial has been set up with two arms. Screened patients would be included into one of the
      arms based on tumor PD-L1 expression. The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of
      the approved checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab and home-made drug Sintilimab in patients
      with advanced NSCLC whose tumor have high PD-L1 expression and low or negative expression.

    <description>Patients with PD-L1 high expression (TPS≥50%) receive Sintilimab injection 200mg i.v. on day 1 every three weeks (Q3W). Courses repeat every 21days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
Patients with PD-L1 low or negative expression (TPS＜50%) receive Sintilimab injection 200mg i.v. in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy every three weeks (Q3W) for 4 cycles. After that, patients receive Sintilimab injection on day 1 Q3W during the maintenance phase (Cycle 5 onward).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age≥18 years. Signed Informed Consent Form.

          2. Stage IV NSCLC confirmed by histology/ cytology or Stage IIIB-IIIC NSCLC that could
             not be treated with radical radiation therapy (8th edition of IASLC Lung Cancer
             Staging System).

          3. Fresh tumor tissue or paraffin tissue within 6 months is adequate for PD-L1 expression
             (TPS) testing in the central laboratory.

          4. Tumor tissue without EGFR mutation or ALK rearrangement must be confirmed.

          5. Per RECIST 1.1 the efficacy evaluation criteria for solid tumors, at least one
             radiologically measurable lesion which was not treated with radiotherapy or had
             obvious disease progression after radiotherapy.

          6. Patients who received no systemic chemotherapy or any other systemic treatment for
             advanced NSCLC. For patients who received preoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy or
             postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy or radical chemoradiotherapy, if the disease
             progresses occurred one six months after the last treatment, they can be enrolled.
             Patients who received targeted therapy or immunotherapy can not be enrolled.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Active hepatitis B. Active hepatitis B is defined as HBsAg positive and the detected
             HBV-DNA copy number is larger than the upper limit of normal value in the laboratory
             of the study site.

          2. Currently or prior clinically active interstitial lung disease. Currently active
             pneumonia. Current radiation pneumonitis for which corticosteroid treatment is
             required.

          3. Known HIV antibody positive, or other acquired or congenital immunodeficiency
             diseases, or history of organ transplantation.

          4. Fever and the body temperature is above 38°C or clinically significant infection
             within 1 week prior to the enrollment.

          5. Active tuberculosis. Evidence of severe or uncontrollable systemic diseases (such as
             severe mental, neurological diseases, seizure, or dementia, unstable or
             non-compensatory respiratory, cardiovascular, hepatic or renal diseases, and
             uncontrolled hypertension [CTCAE Grade 2 hypertension or above after drug treatment]).

          6. Patients with active bleeding or new thrombotic diseases who are orally taking with
             anticoagulant drugs or have bleeding tendency.
