  <brief_summary>

      The primary objective will be to study changes in putamen structural connectivity in healthy
      teens with meditation training. Hypothesis: Putamen structural node strength will increase in
      the training group compared to controls.

      R61 Go/No-Go Criteria. Detect an effect size (a threshold of Cohen's d &gt; 0.20) in changes of
      the primary mechanistic outcome (Putamen structural node strength) by the described
      meditation training in 100 healthy adolescents that are 14-18 years old and retain at least
      80% of randomized participants for primary outcome measurement at the end of the study
      regardless of adherence to the intervention.

      The secondary objective will be to study changes in emotional problems in healthy teens with
      meditation training. Hypothesis: There will be a significant decrease in emotional problems
      measured with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) in the training group
      compared to controls.

      Design and Outcomes: The current research study design will utilize an individually
      randomized group treatment, open-label, waitlist-controlled clinical trial to test the
      efficacy and safety of the investigator's innovative mindfulness meditation intervention
      (Training for Awareness Resilience and Action [TARA]) on the primary outcome (Putamen
      structural node strength) and secondary outcome (emotional problems measured with the
      Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire [SDQ]) in healthy adolescents between the ages of 14
      to 18 years old.
