    <textblock>
      Aortic disease is the direct cause of close to 10000 deaths annually in the United States. 1

      Aneurysmal disease can affect any segment of the aorta, from the aortic root to the aortic
      bifurcation. Juxtarenal Aortic Aneurysms (JAA) (where a specialty designed custom -made
      device (endograft)which has holes, or fenestrations ,on the graft body to maintain the
      patency of the visceral arteries) account for approximately 15% of abdominal aortic
      aneurysms.2

      Successful aortic aneurysm treatment depends on either open replacement or endovascular
      exclusion of the aneurysmal segment with healthy artery proximal and distal to the repair.

      The decision to treat an AAA is based on the associated risk of treatment, the risk of
      aneurysm rupture, the patient's life expectancy, and patient preference.

      The primary determinant of rupture risk is maximum aneurysm diameter, with negligible rupture
      risk in aneurysms &lt;4cm in diameter compared with aneurysms &gt;8 cm . 3, 4.

      The Society for Vascular Surgery recommends repair for all patients of acceptable
      perioperative risk with an AAA ≥5.5 cm in diameter as well as all patients with saccular and
      symptomatic aneurysms.5 ,6

      These guidelines also suggest repair for women at a diameter of 5.0 cm.

      Fenestrated Endovascular Aneurysm Repair (FEVAR) and Chimney Endovascular Aneurysm Repair
      (CHEVAR)are both effective methods to treat JAAs

Preoperative Imaging
CTA is the cross-sectional imaging modality of choice.
Preoperative evaluation
a-Renal evaluation
b_ cardiac evaluation C-Pulmonary evaluation
Surgical techniques
Anesthesia The use of general anesthesia due to the duration of the procedures and the necessity to control patient breathing to allow precise imaging and accurate device deployment.
Intra operative imaging A &quot;hybrid&quot; operating room with high-quality fixed imaging is needed for the performance of FEVAR.
C-Device delivery and deployment all FEVAR procedures begin with access of the femoral arteries by either open or percutaneous technique.</description>
