    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a phase 1, open label, single arm study to evaluate the safety,
      pharmacokinetics and antiviral activity of single intravenous infusions of 3BNC117-LS and
      10-1074-LS, each monoclonal antibody (mAb) dosed at 30 mg/kg in viremic human
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals.

      The proposed study is a phase 1, open label, single arm study to evaluate the safety,
      pharmacokinetics and antiviral activity of single intravenous infusions of 3BNC117-LS and
      10-1074-LS in viremic HIV-infected individuals.

      Ten eligible participants will be enrolled sequentially in the study and will receive each
      mAb, dosed at 30 mg/kg intravenously and in sequence on study day 0. Following mAb
      administration, study participants will return for safety assessments on days 1 and 3, and
      weeks 1, 2, 3 and 4 following dosing, then bi-weekly or monthly until the end of study follow
      up. All participants will be followed for 24 weeks after 3BNC117-LS and 10-1074-LS
      administration.

      Safety assessments will be performed at multiple time points following 3BNC117-LS and
      10-1074-LS infusions. Serum samples for pharmacokinetic (PK) measurements will be collected
      before and at the end each mAb infusion administration and at multiple subsequent time points
      during study follow up. Samples will also be collected for measurement of HIV-1 plasma RNA
      levels before 3BNC117-LS and 10-1074-LS infusions (screen and day 0) and at every follow up
      visit. T cell subsets will also be monitored during study follow up. Assessments will also
      include measurement of anti-drug antibody responses and sequencing of plasma envelope before
      infusions and after viral rebound (first time point after viremia nadir is reached and viral
      load (VL) is &gt; 1,000 copies/ml).

      Participants will be advised and encouraged to start antiretroviral therapy (ART) within 4
      weeks of receiving 3BNC117-LS and 10-1074-LS infusions or sooner if: VL fails to decrease by
      &gt; 0.5 log10 copies/ml within 2 weeks of antibody infusions, VL increases &gt; 0.5 log10
      copies/ml between weekly measurements or significant T-cell decline (confirmed CD4+ T cells &lt;
      200 cells/μl) is noted.
