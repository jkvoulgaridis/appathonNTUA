  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Forward head posture (FHP) is known to have a large influence on respiratory function by
      weakening the respiratory muscles. This cross-sectional study is designed to examine the
      relationship between the tonus, stiffness, and elasticity of head posture muscles and
      pulmonary capacity. Sixteen FHP individuals and seventeen NFHP individuals were evaluated.
      The muscle tonus, stiffness and elasticity of upper trapezius (UT), semispinalis capistis
      (SSC), pectoral muscles (PM) and sternocleidomastoideus muscles (SCM) were measured by using
      MyotonPro® device. Functional capacity was measured with six-minute walk test. Pulmonary
      function tests was evaluated with spirometer. The neck disability index (NDT) was applied.
      The forward head posture was determined by measurements of craniovertebral angle (CVA).
      Physical activity levels of participants were evaluated by Physical Activity Index (FIT).

    <description>The measurements of muscle tone, stiffness and elasticity were made by using MyotonPro® device. Participants were seated on the chair and hands were placed on the knee, UT, SSC and SCM muscles were measured in this position. The pectoralis major muscle was measured in the supine position.</description>

    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Pulmonary function tests was evaluated with spirometer.It is the volume of air that comes out with rapid and powerful exhalation following deep inspiratory. Healthy people can normally extract 80% of their lung volume in 6 seconds or less.</description>

    <measure>Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Pulmonary function tests was evaluated with spirometer.It is the volume of air released in the first second from the beginning of the difficult vital capacity maneuver. In general, it gives information about the restriction in major airlines. FEV1 / FVC ratio decrease shows obstruction, FEV1 shows the severity of obstruction.</description>

    <measure>The neck disability index</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The neck disability index was applied. the total score is 50. As the test score rises, disability increases.0-4 score no disability, 5-14 mild disability, 15-24 moderate degree, 25-34 severe disability, 35 and above completely disabled</description>

    <measure>Physical Activity Index</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The FIT index was used to classify the individuals' physical activity levels. This research instrument used to classify and assign a score from 1 to 100 to a person's physical fitness level based on their frequency, intensity, and time engaged in physical fitness activities. The physical activity score was obtained by multiplying the frequency, intensity and time of the activity. According to the FIT score, the physical activity level is interpreted as 0-20 sedentary, 21-40 weak, 41-60 normal, 61-80 good and 81-100 very good.</description>

    <measure>Forward head posture assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Forward head posture was assessed by a goniometric method which is accepted as a reliable method. Participants were assessed in a relaxed sitting position. To measure the craniovertebral angle (CVA) of FHP, the center of the goniometer is placed at the level of the orifice of the external ear with the fixed arm pointing vertically towards the ceiling and the moving arm against the subject's 7th neck bonee.</description>
