  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a monocentric, prospective, non-comparative phase II study with minimal risks and
      constraints. The study will aim to assess the curative treatment of radio-induced mucositis
      by photobiomodulation using LED lamp.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of the treatment of radio- or
      radio-chemotherapy-induced early stage mucositis (stage 1 and 2) by photobiomodulation using
      LED lamp (PLED) in terms of controlling the mucositis assessed at the end of radiotherapy or
      radio-chemotherapy treatment.

      Other objectives of the study include:

        -  To assess the pain evolution over-time, both overall over the evaluation period until
           the end of radiotherapy and at each session

        -  To assess the needs of level 3 analgesics (morphine, oxycodone, fentanyl, hydromorphone)
           during the PLED protocol.

        -  To assess the quality of life variation between inclusion and the end of treatment by
           radiotherapy or radio-chemotherapy.

        -  To estimate the frequency of radiotherapy or radio-chemotherapy treatment (temporary or
           permanent interruption, dose modification), and eventually, the reason of this
           modification.

        -  To assess the feasibility of photobiomodumation by LED (PLED) in this context.

        -  To assess the tolerability of photobiomodumation by LED (PLED) in a short term.

        -  To assess the frequency of the needs of nutritional support by nasogastric tube or
           gastrostomy tube during the PLED protocol.

        -  To assess the weight and general condition variation during the treatment.

    <measure>Mucositis assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline mucositis assessment at 7 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The mucositis will be assessed at least once a week between the inclusion and the end of treatment by radiotherapy or radio-chimiotherapy. It will be graded according to the NCI-CTCAE v5 scale. The scale ranging from 1 to 5. Where 1 is mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated and where 5 is death related to adverse event.
We will consider as success the non-occurrence of stage 3 or higher mucositis between the inclusion and the end of radiotherapy. All patient presenting stage 3 or higher mucositis, which means, aphagia leading to an indication of nutritional support between the inclusion and the end of radiotherapy will be considered as a failure.
A patient receiving less than 60 grey for an other reason than mucositis will be concidered as not assessable for the primery outcome.</description>

    <measure>Pain related to the mucositis</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, during each session - at least 3 times a week during 7 weeks, at the end of the study (week 7)</time_frame>
    <description>Pain will be assessed with a decimal numerical scale (END) from 0 to 10. Where 0 is no pain felt and 10 is the maximal pain felt.
An estimation of the average difference between each mesure will be performed.</description>

    <description>The quality of life will be evaluated using the EORTC-QLQ-C30 questionnaire. This questionnaire aim to assess the quality of life of cancer and it's composed of 30 questions.
In this questionnaire, the items are scored from 1-4, where 1 = not at all, 2 = a little, 3 = quite a bit and 4 = very much.
Only 2 items in the EORTC-QLQ-C30 questionnaire are scored from 1-7, where 1 is very poor and 7 is excellent.
After that, questions from 31 to 65 are about H&amp;N35, still to assess the quality of life of cancer.
The items are scored from 1-4, where 1 = not at all, 2 = a little, 3 = quite a bit and 4 = very much.
Only 5 items are scored from 1-2, where 1 = No and 2 = Yes.</description>
