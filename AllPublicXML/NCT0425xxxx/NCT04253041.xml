  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      From magazines to Miss America, the media has consistently contributed to the spread of
      sociocultural beauty standards for decades. While initial research on the effects of media on
      body image primarily focused on magazine and television, recent research has shifted towards
      exploring the effects of social media due to its rapid and constant accessibility. Current
      research has associated the promulgation of the thin-ideal with bulimia, dieting, supplement
      use, negative affect, and body dissatisfaction. Literature related to thin-ideal media
      (thinspiration), decreased body dissatisfaction, and negative mood is robust with a common
      understanding that thin-ideal media instigates increased appearance comparisons to seemingly
      unattainable beauty standards. Literature has also suggested that depression and anxiety have
      increased with the growth of social media and pressure to achieve unattainable beauty. The
      fit-ideal, often referred to as Fitspiration, was created as an &quot;antidote&quot; to thin-ideal
      beauty standards. However, research has found that though well intended, fitspiration content
      continues to promote the thin-ideal and has been associated with similarly detrimental
      outcomes of body dissatisfaction and negative mood. Over the last decade, body image research
      has shifted the focus on body disturbance to examining concepts related to positive body
      image. However, to date there are no known studies examining the impacts of fit-ideal content
      versus body positive content on women's body appreciation, body satisfaction, and state mood.
      The purpose of the present study is to experimentally examine the impact of exposure to body
      positive and fitspiration Instagram content on the body satisfaction, body appreciation, and
      mood of undergraduate women at Arizona State University. Participants will be 90 female
      undergraduate students (18-29 years old) currently attending Arizona State University.
      Participants will be randomly allocated to view either fitspiration, body-positive, or
      appearance neutral Instagram images. Dependent variables including state body appreciation,
      state body dissatisfaction, and state mood will be measured using Visual Analogue Scales.
      Trait thin-ideal internalization and trait social comparison will also be measured as
      moderators using the Sociocultural Attitudes Towards Appearance Questionnaire-4 and the
      Physical Appearance Comparison Scale-Revised. We hypothesize that viewing body positive
      content from Instagram will result in greater state body satisfaction, greater state body
      appreciation, and greater state positive mood compared to participants exposed to
      fitspiration and appearance neutral content. We also hypothesize that viewing fitspiration
      content from Instagram will result in greater state body dissatisfaction, decreased state
      body appreciation, and greater state negative mood compared to participants exposed to body
      positive and appearance neutral content. Short answer qualitative interview questions will
      also be included as an exploratory aim of this study where we intend to fill a gap in the
      literature regarding the specific aspects of each content topic that elicit the observed
      quantitative outcomes.

    <masking_description>To mask the true purpose of the current research and avoid biased answers related to sensitive topic such as body image and satisfaction, we will present this research as a study exploring social media's impact on lifestyle satisfaction. Visual Analogue Scales will be used to test measures of body satisfaction and appreciation, but will also include scales related to financial, social, home, and school satisfaction. At the end of this study, participants will be debriefed on the true purpose using the statement: The true purpose of this study was to examine the impacts of exposure to different Instagram images on women's body satisfaction, body appreciation, and mood. In order to understand the true effects of such without giving away the intervention, these questions were masked within a lifestyle satisfaction intervention. All of your answers will remain anonymous and will not be linked to your personal information in any way. Do you have any questions?</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>State Body Satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion (1 day with pretest and posttest measures)</time_frame>
    <description>State body satisfaction will be measured using Visual Analogue Scales. Subjects will be asked to indicate their responses by marking a position on the scale between '0' to '100'. The three body satisfaction scales will be: 'At this moment, I am satisfied with my weight,' 'At this moment, I am satisfied with my overall appearance,' and 'At this moment, I am satisfied with my body shape.' A series of statements related to lifestyle satisfaction (i.e. relationship satisfaction, household living satisfaction, fiscal satisfaction) will also be added to this scale to uphold the cover story of this study being the effects of social media on Lifestyle Satisfaction.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>State Body Appreciation</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion (1 day with pretest and posttest measures)</time_frame>
    <description>State body appreciation will be measured using three Visual Analogue Scales. These questions were adapted from the Body Appreciation Scale (Avalos, Tylka, &amp; Wood-Barcalow, 2005) into state measures and were found to have high internal reliability within the previous study (Slater, Varsani, &amp; Diedrichs, 2017). Subjects will be asked to indicate their responses by marking a position on the scale between '0' to '100'. The three body satisfaction scales will be: 'Right now, despite my flaws, I accept my body for what it is' 'right now, my feelings towards my body are positive for the most part,' and 'right now, my self-worth is independent of my body weight or shape'</description>

    <measure>State Mood</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion (1 day with pretest and posttest measures)</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective mood will be measured at both pre-intervention and post-intervention in the laboratory using Visual Analogue Scales. These scales will ask participants to indicate how they feel &quot;at this moment&quot; with regards to the following emotions: anxiety, anger, confidence, happiness, and depression</description>

    <description>Participants will complete initial measures of sociodemographic information, the Sociocultural Attitudes Towards Appearance Scale, The Physical Appearance Comparison Scale-Revised, and baseline measures of body appreciation, body satisfaction, and mood using online Visual Analogue Scales via Qualtrics. Female undergraduate students will be randomly assigned to one of three groups. The Fitspiration and Body Positive groups will view a series of 15 Fitspiration or Body Positive images sourced from Instagram while the control group will view 15 interior design images sourced from Instagram. After viewing images, participants will complete posttest measures of body satisfaction, body appreciation, and mood using Visual Analogue scales. Thereafter, participants will be provided with four, brief short answer questions regarding their perspective on the images observed.</description>
