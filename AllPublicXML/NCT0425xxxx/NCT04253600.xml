  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For most children, language acquisition might appear like an effortless phenomenon, mostly
      arising from informal daily interaction with their surrounding people. Despite an adequate
      learning environment however, some children encounter major difficulties in learning their
      native tongue and develop a Developmental Language Disorder (DLD). Although the existence of
      a multi-factorial etiology has seemed to reach an agreement, presumably combining genetic and
      environmental factors to some kind of neural disruption, the underlying mechanisms leading to
      DLD are, to date, poorly understood.

      Many studies have attempted to identify risk factors and early predictors associated with the
      future development of a language impairment. However, despite the constant efforts to
      identify early markers able to differentiate between transient and persistent language
      difficulties, early detection of children who will be developing a DLD remains highly
      difficult, partially due to the lack of direct and ecological measures of early language and
      communication development. In addition research on the causal neural correlates of DLD is in
      its infancy, and often compromised by small sample sizes or analyses methods that lack
      anatomical specificity to determine the neural correlates of language impairment.

      Hence, In order to improve early detection and, therefore, language intervention, this
      longitudinal research project aims at investigating the early predictive factors as well as
      the neurocognitive basis of DLD by means of an integrative, multi-dimensional, and
      multi-methodological approach. To substantially gain insight, this research ideally
      integrates risk factors at multiple different levels, including the cognitive,
      neurobiological, parental and environmental level. From a methodological perspective, we will
      combine direct and indirect behavioral methods with neuroimaging methods in order to propose
      an early predictive model of language development.

      The present research project can be divided into four main data collection steps. The first
      step concerns families' recruitment through a principle of population-based screening.
      Parents and/or caregivers of children aged from 0 to 18 months will be asked to complete a
      screening questionnaire that aims to evaluate families' general risk profile associated with
      the development of DLD. A subsample of at-risk and control families will be selected based on
      the screening phase for longitudinal follow-up. The second step consists of the investigation
      of the neural correlates of DLD by using a natural-sleep MRI protocol in infants of 6 to 12
      months old. The third step concerns the evaluation of predictive factors leading to DLD using
      indirect measures based on digital assessment of language development, parental and
      environmental characteristics (i.e., parents will have to fill in online questionnaires every
      6 months during a 3-year timeframe). This step will also be dedicated to the development of
      an application that aims at evaluating early development of language and communication (i.e.,
      LANCOM app). Finally, the fourth step comprises additional in-depth investigation of DLD's
      predictive factors, by means of direct measures, including individual cognitive and
      behavioral assessment, as well as an automated analysis of the child's language environment
      using the Language ENvironment Analysis digital language processor recording device (LENA®).
      Data collection for this last step will take place once a year over the whole project's
      timeframe.

    <description>MRI data acquisition will take place during natural sleep in infants aged from 6 to 12 months. First, families will have to complete a security questionnaire to make sure that neither the children nor the accompanying parent have any known contraindication preventing the MRI session and that none of them is wearing any ferro-magnetic elements. Then, families will be welcomed in a calm and child-friendly environment where we will propose them some preparatory games known to facilitate sleep in children. MRI protocol will comprise structural and functional images and won't exceed 30 minutes.</description>

    <description>Individual cognitive and behavioral assessment will be scheduled once a year, around the child's birth date, and will comprise an extensive battery of standardized evaluation appropriate for the child's age. This individual evaluation will focus on several developmental aspects including language, psychomotor, behavioral and cognitive development, as well as executive and socio-emotional functioning, depending on the age of the children. Evaluations will be adapted to each child's specific profile, while respecting the following administration rules: (1) we will prioritize language development testing, (2) testing sessions will be adapted to each child's pace and possibilities, (3) if a child does not want to take part in the assessment, feels tired, or does not seem to be comfortable with the investigator, tests won't be administered.</description>

An automatic analysis of the recordings, performed by the LENA pro software algorithms, will provide amongst others, a direct and natural measure of the child's number of vocalizations, adult word counts, conversational turns, duration of exposure to electronic media versus to meaningful language. Data acquisition will take place once a year following our sample selection, with a required recording time per day ranging from 12 to 16 hours.</description>
