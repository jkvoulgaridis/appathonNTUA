  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low energy availability (LEA) is a major problem in sports as athletes ingest often a lower
      amount of energy compared to their actual needs. The availability of energy is calculated
      based on their daily energy intake and the energy cost of the daily training sessions in
      relation to their fat-free mass. Based on this calculation, it is known how much energy will
      available for the body (beside the fuel for training) to keep it in optimal physiological
      functioning. It has been shown, that LEA occurs very often in female athletes, in endurance
      athletes as well as athletes in weight-sensitive sports (i.e. jockeys, combat sports,
      gymnastics, ballet). The purpose of this study was to investigate, whether LEA is a problem
      in wheelchair athletes as well.

      Energy availability will be assessed over 7 consecutive training days using a dietary and
      training record as well as the Leisure Time PHysical Activity Questionnaire for spinal cord
      injury. Resting Energy expenditure will be measured as well as body composition (by a DXA)
      before the start of data collection.
