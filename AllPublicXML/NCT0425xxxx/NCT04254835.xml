  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Two different Fluoride varnish systems(Fluoride varnish containing Chlorhexidine and
      Cetylpyridinium Chloride (CPC) and conventional fluoride) will be applied to high caries risk
      patients to assess their clinical effects on plaque accumulation and plaque bacterial count .

    <textblock>
      Preoperative steps:

        -  The diagnostic chart will be filled including all data about the patient's medical
           history, dental history, plaque assessment and plaque bacterial count.

        -  Scaling and polishing will be carried out for subjects.

      clinical steps:

        -  Control Group: Conventional Fluoride varnish (Fluor Protector, Ivoclar Vivadent - Schaan
           Liechtenstein) will be applied on dry teeth in a thin layer, allowed to dry for 1
           minute, and participants will be instructed to avoid rinsing after application, only
           spitting. Eating, drinking and brushing should be avoided for 1 hour after varnish
           application.

        -  Intervention Group: Varnish containing Fluoride, Chlorhexidine and Cetylpyridinium
           Chloride (Cervitec F, Ivoclar Vivadent - Schaan Liechtenstein) will be applied on dry
           teeth in a thin layer, allowed to dry for 1 minute, and participants will be instructed
           to avoid rinsing after application, only spitting. Eating, drinking and brushing should
           be avoided for 1 hour after varnish application.

      Each participant will be assessed for plaque retention using plaque index and Standardized
      photography and image analysis to disclosed dental plaque, and plaque bacterial count using
      culture media sensitive for mutans streptococci (MS) in the following intervals:

        -  Enrolment Baseline assessment

        -  First visit (2nd week)

        -  Second visit (4th week)

        -  Third visit (12th week)

        -  Fourth visit (24th week)
