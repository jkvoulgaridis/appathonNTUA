  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer (PCa) is a high incidence tumor of elderly men. In recent years, its
      incidence has rapidly increased in China. Serological examination of prostate-specific
      antigen (PSA) is particularly important in the early diagnosis of PCa, but its specificity is
      lower in gray areas with PSA between 4-10 ng / ml. Proposition of prostate health index (PHI)
      strengthens the specificity of PSA gray area prostate cancer diagnosis, but the composition
      of the index only relies on serological examination, neglects imaging indicators, and cannot
      be comprehensively evaluated. Based on the preliminary basis of PHI research in the
      undergraduate department, combined with ultrasound imaging indicators of total prostate
      volume (TPV), this research group prospectively analyzed the efficacy of PHI combined with
      TPV to predict prostate cancer in patients with PSA gray areas, and established an improved
      version of PHI-TPV combination. The prediction model mPHI assesses the sensitivity of the new
      model to predict the risk of prostate cancer in the Chinese population, provides data support
      for puncture decisions of middle-aged and elderly male patients in the gray area of PSA in
      China, and provides reference and guidance for the individualized prevention and treatment of
      prostate cancer.

    <description>Perform a transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy (12 needles) according to a standardized protocol. If a suspicious low-density nodule is found during the ultrasound, biopsy to the nodule can be added. Place the prostate biopsy specimen in a 10% Formalin's specimen bag. The specimens were processed and evaluated by the pathology department of Xinhua Hospital.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient&gt; 45 years of age, with abnormal serum PSA, with or without digital rectal
             examination (DRE), with indications for prostate biopsy.

          2. Prostate biopsy indications:

        (1) DRE found prostate nodules; (2) MRI, TRUS and other examinations found abnormalities;

        cancer: The pathological results of transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy (12
        needles), Gleason score is based on the diagnosis of pathology.

        Incomplete medical history; poor quality of serum samples; bacterial acute prostatitis
        diagnosed within 3 months before biopsy; 5α reductase inhibitors, anabolic steroids, or
        antiandrogen drugs taken within 12 months before biopsy; patient with previous prostate
        biopsy history.
