  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study focuses on investigating exosuit technology by evaluating its ability to provide a
      gait-restorative effect delivered in both clinic and community settings. The exosuit provides
      dynamic dorsiflexion and plantarflexion assist during walking. We will determine the effect
      of Robotic Exosuit Augmented Locomotion (REAL) on intensity, repetition, and gait quality
      compared to training without an exosuit, which are all key parameters associated with
      experience-dependent neuroplasticity. The other objective is to determine the effect of REAL
      gait training on community walking activity, walking speed, walking distance, and locomotor
      mechanics and energetics.

    <intervention_model_description>Previous work has demonstrated that the tuning of the exosuit technology is important for each patient post stroke to be able to maximally utilize the technology. These modulations include when the plantarflexion force is delivered, and how to deliver the assistance within a training session however it is still unclear how to implement this into a training protocol. During a part of this study, we will explore which timing: early timing (10-20%), mid timing (50%) and late timing (90%) may be optimal for an individual and then carry out a training protocol</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Change in 10 Meter Walk Test from baseline gait speed</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline Day 1-3, Midpoint at week 6, Post-intervention at week 12</time_frame>
    <description>This test will examine the patient's gait speed. Patients will be directed to walk at their preferred and maximum but safe speed. Patients will be positioned 1 meter before the start line and instructed to walk the entire distance and past the end line approximately 1 meter. The distance before and after the course are meant to minimize the effect of acceleration and deceleration. Time will be recorded using a stopwatch and recorded to the one hundredth of a second (ex: 2.15 sec).</description>

    <measure>Change in 6 Minute Walk Test in distance from baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline Day 1-3, Midpoint at week 6, Post-intervention at week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The 6 Minute Walk Test (6MWT) measures the distance a subject can walk indoors on a flat, hard surface in a period of 6 minutes, using assistive devices, as necessary. The test is a reliable and valid evaluation of functional exercise capacity and is used as a sub-maximal test of aerobic capacity and endurance. The test will be used to determine participant's gait efficiency at baseline and at study completion. The walk test is patient self-paced and assesses the level of functional capacity. Patients are allowed to stop and rest during the test, however, the timer does not stop. If the patient is unable to complete the time, the time stopped is noted and reason for stopping prematurely is recorded.</description>

    <measure>Functional Gait Assessment (FGA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline Day 1-3, Midpoint at week 6, Post-intervention at week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Functional Gait Assessment is a 10 item test used to assess postural stability during walking tasks. It has a maximum score of 30 with each item being scored 0-3. It may be performed with or without an assistive device; however, individuals lose a point on all items requiring a device.</description>
