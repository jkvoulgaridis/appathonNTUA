  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase Ib/II, multicenter, single-arm, open-label study to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of JMT103 in patients with surgically unsalvageable or refractory giant cell tumor of
      bone (GCTB).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of JMT103 in patients with
      GCTB that is surgically unsalvageable or for which the planned surgery is associated with
      severe morbidity.

      This study consists of two parts (phase Ib and II). In the phase Ib part, 6 to 12 subjects
      will be enrolled, and the safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of JMT103 will be
      evaluated after treatment for more than 4 weeks. And then the phase II part will be
      conducted, in which, 125 subjects will be enrolled.

      Eligible subjects will receive JMT103 at a dose of 2mg/kg subcutaneously (SC) every 4 weeks
      (Q4W) with a loading dose of 2mg/kg SC on study days 8 and 15 until disease progression,
      tumor resection (the pathologic outcome after surgical resection is CR or PR), intolerable
      toxicity, decision by the participant to discontinue, or decision by the investigator that
      the subject could no longer benefit from the treatment (whichever occurs first).

    <description>A treatment response was defined for participants with tissue samples obtained and measured by histopathology as: at least 90% elimination of giant cells relative to Baseline. A response was defined for participants who have only radiographs (histopathology not available) as lack of progression of the target lesion (PR or CR) at week 12 by radiographic measurements compared with Baseline.</description>
