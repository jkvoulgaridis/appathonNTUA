  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Skeletal muscle mass is regulated by the balance of muscle protein synthesis (MPS) and muscle
      protein breakdown (MPB). MPS is sensitive to exogenous stimuli, particularly exercise and
      protein ingestion. Much of what the investigators currently know about the impact of exercise
      and protein feeding on MPS has been derived from acute stable isotopic tracers in a
      controlled laboratory setting. However, recently, the field of skeletal muscle protein
      metabolism has moved towards the use of deuterium oxide (deuterated water (D2O)) to measure
      MPS. The ease of administration and the scope to measure turnover in a range of substrates
      whilst negating the need for strictly controlled laboratory settings makes D2O the ideal
      candidate to provide a more holistic view of in vivo skeletal muscle metabolism.

      Currently, there is a lack of consensus amongst researchers regarding the dosing strategies
      of D2O provision for measuring fraction-specific (myofibrillar, mitochondrial and
      sarcoplasmic) protein synthetic rates. In addition, the analytical equipment (i.e., mass
      spectrometers) required to carry out the analysis of skeletal muscle-bound alanine are
      technically challenging, offer varying degrees of sensitivity that may drastically influence
      outcome measures and the expense of analysis differs greatly between the type of mass
      spectrometer required.Thus, this study will employ different D2O doses to assess basal and
      exercise plus protein feeding-induced rates of acute and integrated MPS in healthy young men
      and women. This will provide researchers with insight into the amount of D2O required to
      accurately assess MPS and the sensitivity of the analytical machine employed.
