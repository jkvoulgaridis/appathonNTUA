  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the investigational device in the proposed clinical investigation is to
      capture pressure data prior to and during voiding using a CE-marked commercially available
      catheter.

      This clinical investigation is based on an open explorative design evaluating the sensor
      ability to record readable data in healthy volunteers and the extent of artifacts influencing
      data quality and readability in healthy volunteers.

      Overall:

        -  Single arm. Open-labelled, not randomized

        -  Healthy volunteers

      Duration:

      Information visit:

      Oral and written information about the evaluation is given by the PI or his/her
      representative. Subjects can continue to visit 0, inclusion visit, the same day - if the
      subject has decided on participation and if practically possible.

      Visit 0 - Inclusion visit:

      Informed consent signed. Subjects can continue to visit 1 - test visit the same day - if
      practically possible.

      Visit 1 - test visit:

      1h test visit at Rigshospitalet. Fertile females will be asked to perform a pregnancy test.
      Subject is asked about symptoms for urinary tract infections (frequent urination, stinging or
      pain at urination). If negative for these symptoms, the subject will be catheterised with
      (SpeediCath® Standard, male/female, Nelaton tip depending of the gender) with fitted pressure
      sensor. The urine is led into a standard urine flowmeter.
