  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression and insomnia occur together in a substantial number of patients. Transcranial
      magnetic stimulation (TMS) is an effective treatment for depression, but does not help
      insomnia symptoms in depressed patients. A form of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has
      been developed that specifically helps with insomnia (CBT-I). The study team will give CBT-I
      to patients who are being treated with TMS for depression, who also have insomnia, to
      determine if it helps insomnia symptoms.

    <description>Assessing pre and post TMS treatment changes of ESS in TMS + CBT-I group vs no CBT-I group. The scale is scored 0-24 assessing degree of sleepiness. Cutoff scores are as follows: 0-7:It is unlikely that you are abnormally sleepy. 8-9:You have an average amount of daytime sleepiness; 10-15:You may be excessively sleepy depending on the situation. You may want to consider seeking medical attention;16-24:You are excessively sleepy and should consider seeking medical attention. This scale is often used clinically for obstructive sleep apnea, but can be useful to assess daytime impact of insomnia.</description>

    <description>Participants in this study will be undergoing repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for major depressive disorder as part of their clinical treatment. This involves magnetic stimulation with specific settings to a specific region of the brain to help treat depression. Treatment time ranges, but is around 30 minutes per session and occurs 5 days a week for 6 weeks.</description>
