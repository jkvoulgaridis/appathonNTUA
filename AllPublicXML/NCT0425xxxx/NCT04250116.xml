  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation patients with risk factors for stroke and systemic embolism require
      long-term anticoagulant therapy. Recently, non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (NOAC)
      has shown their excellent safety and efficacy, and thus are widely accepted in clinical
      practice. Meanwhile, after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) using the drug-eluting
      stents (DES) due to coronary artery disease, the administration of one or more antiplatelets
      is essential to prevent the recurrence of stent thrombosis and myocardial infarction.
      Combined administration of anticoagulants and antiplatelets significantly lowers the
      incidence of ischemic events such as stroke and myocardial infarction, however, it also
      significantly increases the likelihood of bleeding leading to hospitalization, and or even
      death, thereby significantly affecting the clinical course of the AF patients who underwent
      PCI. Nevertheless, due to the very high mortality rate of stent thrombosis, the current
      standard of care guidelines recommend triple therapy with anticoagulants and double
      antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) in patients with atrial fibrillation for 1 month after coronary
      intervention, followed by co-administration of NOAC with single antiplatelet agent for 1
      year. However, little is known after the optimal therapeutic strategy after 1 year. The
      purpose of this study is to compare the clinical results of single anticoagulant and
      clopidogrel combination therapy for maintenance therapy after 1 year in patients with atrial
      fibrillation.

      Atrial fibrillation(AF) patients who had undergone PCI with DES implantation at 12-18 months
      ago will be enrolled in this study. Decision for the antiplatelet agent discontinuation would
      be determined by randomization. Apixaban would be prescribed to reduced the risk stroke or
      systemic embolism evoked by AF, and the administration of Warfarin, a vitamin-K dependent
      anticoagulant, would also be allowed according to attending physician's decision. The
      following criteria should be followed for the reduction of dosages according to the patient's
      renal function and other systemic conditions. Warfarin is administered to patients with
      creatinine clearance of 15 ml / min or dialysis. The drugs used in this study correspond to
      the international treatment guidelines after coronary intervention in patients with atrial
      fibrillation. NOAC and antiplatelet agents would be prescribed upon an outpatient visit.
      Clinical outcome would be followed for 2 years after study enrollment and randomization.

      Screening

        -  Baseline Serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) / alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level

        -  Creatinine clearance (mL/min)

        -  Concurrent administration of CYP3A4 agents: Ketoconazole, Itraconazole,
           lopinavir/ritonavir, indinavir/ritonavir, conivaptan

      Dose reduction (patients meeting both criteria would be prescribed with Apixaban 2.5 mb bid)

        -  15 mL/min â‰¤ e Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) &lt; 30 mL/min

        -  end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients under 60 kg of bodyweight or age over 80 years
           old.
