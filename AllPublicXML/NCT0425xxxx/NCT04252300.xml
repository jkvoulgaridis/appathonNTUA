  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers in this study want to learn how the study drug BAY1817080 interacts with another
      drug called rosuvastatin (brand name: Crestor) and affects the way the body absorbs,
      distributes and excretes rosuvastatin in healthy adult male and female participants
      (drug-drug interaction study). The study drug BAY1817080 is a new drug under development with
      a goal to suppress pain and chronic cough. It works by binding to and blocking proteins
      related to pain in the body. Rosuvastatin is an approved and marketed drug to lower high
      levels of &quot;bad&quot; cholesterol (a waxy, fat-like substance found in blood). Both drugs interact
      with the same proteins (molecules) in the human body, and as a result, the study drug may
      affect the way rosuvastatin is taken up and used by the body when applied together.

      Participants in this study will be asked to visit the clinic 3 times over a period of 3 to 4
      weeks. Each participant will receive rosuvastatin tablets twice with at least 11 days in
      between and the study drug tablets twice daily for 14 days. Blood samples will be taken from
      the participants to measure the blood levels of rosuvastatin.

      The primary objective of the study is to investigate the influence of multiple doses of
      BAY1817080 on the pharmacokinetics of rosuvastatin given concomitantly. Secondary objective
      is to investigate the safety of BAY1817080.
