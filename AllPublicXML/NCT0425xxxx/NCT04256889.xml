  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to utilize the objective data provided by the nfant® suite of
      products, along with current NICU visual assessment and cue-based feeding practices, in order
      to determine if feeding performance outcomes and clinical decision making for individualized
      feeding plans for premature infants born less than 30 weeks PMA are impacted.

      Will obtain 5 official readings using the nfant(R) technology: baseline between 31 0/7 weeks
      and 32 0/7 weeks Post-Menstrual Age (PMA) with No Flow nipple, Cue-Based Feeding Readiness
      Reading with No Flow nipple no sooner than 33 0/7 weeks PMA, Post-Sequencing Reading with
      Extra Slow Flow nipple, Slow Flow nipple Reading, and Standard nipple Reading. The technology
      will also be utilized between readings 2 to 3 times a week. Phone Follow-up 2 question survey
      will be administered 21 days after discharge from Neonatal Intensive Care Unit.This survey
      entails routine questions regarding re-admission, to clarify if readmission was within 21
      days of discharge, and if the reason for re-admission was feeding related.
