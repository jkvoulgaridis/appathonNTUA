    <textblock>
      Objectives The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the SREIA
      parent training program for families of children with ASD aged three to six years in mainland
      China. The study will be conducted within the context of routine service provision and assess
      the effectiveness of SREIA in reducing child behavioral problems as measured by the
      Externalizing scale of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) for Ages 1.5-5, in comparison to a
      waitlist control group.

      Secondary objectives include examining the effectiveness of the SREIA program in reducing ASD
      symptoms and improving parental and familial outcomes including parental knowledge of ASD and
      ABA techniques, parenting styles, parental mental health (including stress, anxiety and
      depression), and family functioning.

      A process evaluation will be conducted alongside the quasi-experimental trial, the objectives
      of which are to 1) describe the implementation aspects of the programs with regard to
      participant involvement, program acceptability, delivery, and sustainability; 2) explore
      predictors of participant involvement; and 3) examine potential relations between
      implementation aspects and treatment effects.

      Background ASD is associated with elevated levels of child emotional and behavior
      disturbance, which impair child daily functioning and impose challenges to parenting. The
      SREIA programme is a group-based parent training in China, that has been delivered since 1993
      and reached over 10,000 families. However, there is an absence of scientific evaluations of
      programme effectiveness. This study aims to fill this evidence gap, and the findings will be
      used to inform future modification, replication, and dissemination of the programme in other
      parts of China. This study will also contribute to the literature on the effectiveness of
      parent training programmes for ASD and for families living in low- and middle-income
      countries.

      Methods A quasi-experimental design with a mixed-methods approach will be used, involving two
      consecutive waves of delivery of the SREIA programme. Parent participants will complete
      demographic and outcome questionnaires at baseline, immediate post-intervention, and 6-month
      post-intervention. The implementation components will be assessed by collecting attendance
      and engagement registry data, facilitators filling out fidelity checklists, research staff
      observing programme sessions, and parents answering a satisfaction questionnaire. After the
      programme, some parents, facilitators, and NGO (non-governmental organisation) managers will
      be invited to take part in qualitative interviews or focus group discussions so as to explore
      their views about the programme, and to better understand the quantitative data obtained.

    <intervention_model_description>A pragmatic multi-wave quasi-experimental study will be conducted to examine the effectiveness of the SREIA programme. The study will be conducted within the context of routine services and will involve two consecutive deliveries of the SREIA programme. One hundred families of children with ASD age three to six will be recruited and allocated to the two waves of delivery based on their availability and preference, with 50 families in each wave. Each wave will comprise two versions of the programme that are delivered concurrently, with 30 families in version A and 20 in version B. Participants will be self-selected into either version. The 50 families who choose to participate in the first wave will be the treatment group, and the 50 families in the second wave will service as the waitlist control group.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Single (Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>Due to the nature of parent training and the use of a waitlist control group, it will not be possible to blind participants or facilitators. However, research staff who collect the data will be blinded for the baseline and post-intervention assessment. Data collectors will not be involved in the delivery process and will be trained on the topic of risk of bias. Parents will also be asked not to reveal their allocation condition to outcome data collectors. Process evaluation data will be collected by a separate group of research staff. Given that all families will ultimately receive the training, blinding will not be possible at the follow-up time-points. Blinding will be protected and monitored, while the violation of blinding will be detected and incorporated into the interpretation of results.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in frequency of child ehavioral problems</measure>
    <time_frame>Differences between groups within 1 month after the end of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Child behavioral problems will be assessed using the Externalizing scale of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) for Ages 1.5-5. The Externalizing scale measures child attention problems and aggressive behaviors using 24 items rated by parents based on child performance during the previous two months with a 3-point -type scale. The study will use the CBCL 1.5-5 for all families whose children will be between three to six years old. Lower scores suggest fewer behavioral problems. Research has shown sufficient test-retest reliability, internal consistency, convergent validity, and cross-cultural validity of CBCL 2-3 and CBCL 4-18 in China, but the evidence regarding the validity and reliability of this new version of CBCL 1.5-5 is currently limited. However, the CBCL 1.5-5 has shown good factorial validity among Chinese girls adopted into North American families; it has also demonstrated good internal validity with children with ASD.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in frequency of ASD symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Differences between groups within 1 month after the end of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>ASD symptoms will be assessed using the Chinese version of the Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist (ATEC), which comprise four subscales to measure child speech/language/communication, sociability, sensory/cognitive awareness, and health/physical/behavior. The scale has 77 items that are scored by parents. The health/physical/behavior subscale is rated using a 0 (not a problem)-to-3 (serious problem) point scale, whereas the other three subscales are rated using a 0 (not true)-to-2 (very true) point scale. Higher scores represent more ASD symptoms.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Parent satisfaction: questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 1 month after the end of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Parent satisfaction will be assessed at post-intervention only using a questionnaire based on the Incredible Years® Autism Programme End-of-Course Satisfaction Questionnaire and tailored to the SREIA programme and Chinese context. The questionnaire covers a range of topics including overall impression; teaching format; information and techniques; facilitators; and parent groups. It consists of 30 items rated with a 3-point Likert-type scale. High scores represent higher levels of satisfaction.</description>

    <description>The SREIA programme is grounded in Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA). It aims to promote child development by improving parental attitudes and parenting styles. The programme targets parent-child dyads from families of children with ASD aged between three and six years. It is delivered five days a week, with three hours in the morning and two hours in the afternoon, for 11 weeks. Fourteen two-hour lectures on weekly themes (such as knowledge of ASD, parent-child interaction, and behavior management techniques) are offered throughout the 11 weeks and attended by all participating parents. For the remaining time, additional training in ABA principles and practice are tailored for the different functioning groups. The programme offers a combination of individual counselling and group sessions, as well as a mixture of didactic and interactive delivery modes. All sessions are delivered in person. Some sessions are only for parents and others are participated in by both parent and child.</description>
