  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Perioperative hypothermia is one of the most common anaesthetic complications, increasing the
      morbidity/mortality of our patients. Active prewarming with hot forced-air devices has
      demonstrated to be the most effective tool to prevent hypothermia, but its use is only
      recommended in long-term surgeries and the optimal prewarming duration has not been
      elucidated. Both spinal anaesthesia associated to the irrigation with liquids at low
      temperature instilled during transurethral resection (TUR) cause a decrease in the core
      temperature of the patient. This is a clinical trial comparing different time periods of
      prewarming in patients submitted to undergo elective transurethral resection. Our aim is to
      assess the effect of different time-periods of prewarming on preventing perioperative
      hypothermia during TUR with spinal anaesthesia. Investigators will compare different time
      periods: 0 minutes (control group), 15 minutes, 30 minutes and 45 minutes. 200 patients are
      going to be included in this study (50 patients in each group). Measurement of temperature
      will be performed using a tympanic thermometer and zero-heat-flux temperature sensor.
      Patients will be followed throughout their hospital admission. Data will be recorded using a
      validated instrument and will be analysed using the statistics program R Core Team.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inadvertent perioperative hypothermia is probably the most common anaesthetic complication.
      Its appearance increases the morbidity of the surgical patient, increasing the incidence of
      cardiac events or perioperative blood loss and causes a greater time of recovery from
      anaesthesia. Prewarming is the most effective measure to prevent hypothermia and maintain
      intraoperative normothermia. However, prewarming in patients submitted to spinal anesthesia
      is still a weak recommendation and the optimal prewarming time has not been elucidated. Due
      to the searching of optimal prewarming time and the lack of evidence about the efficiency of
      prewarming in patients submitted to transurethral resection under spinal anaesthesia, the
      conductance of this clinical trial is justified.

    <masking_description>Randomization will be carried out by a collaborator investigator using a computer program (Excel 2016) when a new patient is included into the clinical trial. This collaborator investigator will tell the nurse in charge of receiving the patient in the preanesthetic room how long prewarming has to be given to the patient: 0 minutes (no prewarming), 15 minutes, 30 minutes or 45 minutes, according to the group given by the computer program. This collaborator investigator will not provide clinical care to the patient. Attending anesthesiologist will be blind to the allocation of the participants. Principal investigator will not be able to know how long prewarming will be given.</masking_description>
