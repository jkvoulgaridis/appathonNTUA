  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the safety of acalabrutinib and axicabtagene ciloleucel in
      treating patients with B-cell lymphoma. Acalabrutinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by
      blocking key pathways needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy with axicabtagene ciloleucel is
      engineered to target a specific surface antigen on lymphoma cells. Acalabrutinib may enhance
      the efficacy of axicabtagene ciloleucel in treating patients with B-cell lymphoma.

      OUTLINE:

      Beginning up to 3 weeks and at least 24 hours prior to leukapheresis, patients receive
      acalabrutinib orally (PO) every 12 hours. Treatment continues in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive axicabtagene ciloleucel
      intravenously (IV) at 36-96 hours after completion of lymphodepleting chemotherapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 5
      years.
