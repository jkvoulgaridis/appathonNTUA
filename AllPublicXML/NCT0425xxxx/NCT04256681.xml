  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Self-Notion and Perception (SNAP) questionnaire developed at IRCCS E.Medea by Eleonora
      Diella and Roberta Morganti, arises from the need to quantify the subjective perception of
      the patient suffering from HSP of the typical symptoms of pathology, such as spasticity,
      weakness, changes in balance, resistance in walking, pain and fatigue. The purpose of this
      study is to validate this instrument and test its reliability, looking for correlations with
      the measurement scales used in the literature for the evaluation of the patient with HSP. The
      most used for this population are the Spastic Paraplegia Rating Scale (SPRS) and the
      Six-Minute Walk Test (6MWT) which assess the severity of the disease and the level of
      endurance (8-9) respectively.
