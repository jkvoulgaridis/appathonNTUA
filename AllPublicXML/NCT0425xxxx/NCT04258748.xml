      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of motivational interviewing as
      well as games in changing oral health behaviors among preschool children.

    <textblock>
      The participating children, in this randomized controlled clinical trial, were recruited from
      the governmental preschools available within Edko administration of Beheira governorate,
      Egypt. A cluster random sampling strategy was used so that the contributors, after fulfilling
      eligibility criteria, mother/child dyads (pairs) in each nursery were subsequently assigned
      to the first test group (motivational interviewing MI), the second test group (motivational
      interviewing MI+ gaming) or the control group (conventional dental health education CE). The
      children were randomly assigned to the three study groups in the allocation ratio 1:1:1 using
      random allocation software in blocks of five. The schools' randomization sequence were
      written on identical sheets of paper and folded inside opaque envelopes that were sealed to
      be open at the time of intervention implementation.

      The three interventions were the conventional dental health education (CE) which were
      delivered through a 15-minute oral health session given to mothers of preschoolers in the
      control group whereas in the test groups Motivational Interviewing (MI) for mothers and Games
      for children were carried out via specific phases.

    <description>It was assesed using modified OHI-S.The presence of plaque was verified on the buccal surface of 6 index teeth: the upper right second deciduous molar (tooth 55), the upper right central deciduous incisor (tooth 51), the upper left second deciduous molar (tooth 65), the lower right second deciduous molar (tooth 85), the lower left central deciduous incisor (tooth 71), and the lower left second deciduous molar (tooth 75). According to the OHI-S, dental plaque is defined as a soft organic material loosely adhering to the tooth surface. The tooth surface covered by plaque was estimated by visual examination according to the following criteria: 0 =no plaque present; 1 = plaque covering no more than 1/3 of the surface in question; 2 = plaque covering more than 1/3, but no more than 2/3 of the surface; 3= plaque covering more than 2/3 of the surface; 9 = tooth excluded, no information.</description>

    <description>In each of the four MI counseling sessions, the researcher approached mothers via three phases, in 15-30 minutes, to establish rapport/ alliance, to identify and finally reinforce dental needs in the same pattern as MI group. In addition, the children were engaged in 'Happy Teeth, Healthy Kids' which is an android tablet game that was included in the MI session scheduled for the mothers. Children were told to follow correct steps of brushing in order to obtain happy bright teeth. This helped the children realize that brushing teeth will give them a bright smile.</description>

    <description>It was delivered through a 15-minutes oral health session given to mothers of preschoolers. Mothers were given brief information about causes of dental caries and role of plaque, toothbrush size, diet / frequency of sweet snacks, brushing technique, toothpaste and fluoride use as well as regular dental visits. Participants were then shown a short educational video about prevention of dental caries among children coupled with oral hygiene instructions. At the end of the session, participants were given a leaflet reinforcing the information to take home.</description>
