  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma affects over 10 million children in the U.S., and poses a significant health and cost
      burden. Metered dose inhaler (MDI) is the most common method of treatment. Studies show that
      up to 80% of patients demonstrate incorrect use of MDIs, which results in suboptimal
      medication delivery to the lungs.

      Asthma control can be followed by symptoms, rescue medication usage and measures of airflow
      obstruction. Current options to monitor control include an asthma diary (relies on consistent
      use by the patient), pharmacy records of medication dispensing (dispensing does not equal
      usage), and peak expiratory flow (PEF) meters (significant variability in technique leading
      to inconsistent results).

      CapMedic is a smart inhaler and home spirometer device which aims to assist with correct MDI
      usage and to monitor asthma control. CapMedic fits on top of the MDI inhaler and provides
      live audio-visual-haptic cues to guide the patient for correctly using their inhaler.
      CapMedic includes a built-in forced expiratory flow in 1 second (FEV1, a measure of airflow)
      and PEF meter. It will utilize the same audio-visual-haptic hardware to implement live cues
      that encourage patient's effort in performing accurate at-home FEV1/PEF test. Cap will also
      be able to log medication usage and Medic application will allow patients to keep an asthma
      symptom diary.

    <intervention_model_description>Research will initially involve collection of data describing the participants' current use of their medication following standard education. Subsequent phases will add audio / haptic coaching to the process of administering medication by MDI, and follow the same participants to determine whether or not there is improvement in technique and adherence to therapy.
The device will be used with a placebo inhaler (given AFTER the participant's regular medication is taken by standard techniques), to determine how participants use the device, and to identify the most effective coaching interventions for this age group. This is to ensure that the device does not interfere with delivery of routine asthma controller medications. The data will be used to develop a subsequent, longer term study in which we will evaluate the effect of the coaching device on asthma control, when it is used with the subject's controller medication.</intervention_model_description>
