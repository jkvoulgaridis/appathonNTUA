  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers are trying to learn more about how pharmacists and pharmacogenomic testing can
      help care providers improve control of symptoms and quality of life in seriously ill
      patients.

      Participants in the study will be randomized to A) standard of care, B) standard of care with
      medication therapy management provided by a pharmacist, or C) standard of care with
      medication therapy management by a pharmacist who has access to the patient's
      pharmacogenomics profile accessible to guide them. We will be measuring level of symptom
      control in each group over the subsequent 6 months.

    <description>Participants will have their medical information, including patient demographics, problem list, medication list, allergies, and relevant lab work reviewed by a One Point pharmacist. The pharmacist will work with the Palliative Medicine team to make medication related recommendations to improve individual patient care. The pharmacist will call the patient roughly 48 hours following their outpatient consultation or hospital discharge to review the medication list and address any medication-related questions. The pharmacy will send refill reminders to the patients.</description>
