  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates whether L-Alanyl-L-Glutamine can reduce the incidence, extent and
      severity of adhesions after myomectomy. Half of the participants will receive
      L-Alanyl-L-Glutamine and the other half of participants will receive a saline placebo at the
      time of myomectomy.
