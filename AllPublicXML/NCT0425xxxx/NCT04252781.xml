  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), , secondary to smoking, is a major public
      health issue with very high direct and indirect costs. The impact on the health system of
      undiagnosed patients, up to 70% of patients, is increasingly documented. However, systematic
      spirometry screening remains controversial among smokers in the absence of data to link the
      detection of new patients with improved management and clinical events and health goals. More
      generally, there is little data on the evolution of patients in real life once they have
      entered the care system.

      The premise is that with systematic screening in general medicine, it is possible to identify
      the evolution of newly diagnosed COPD patients, to distinguish the different possible
      evolutions according to the initial phenotype and the management.

      A description of the population from which the groups or cohorts will be selected Smokers who
      have a screening spirometry for COPD, either in general medicine, at a pulmonologist or in
      the CHIC or Henri Mondor hospital respiratory function tests department.

      After screening, an equal number of men and women COPD will be included (150 men and 150
      women). 1500 smokers will be included to reach 300 smokers with COPD.
