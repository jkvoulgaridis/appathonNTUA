  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2b open label study of an orally administered LSD1 inhibitor, IMG-7289, in
      patients with essential thrombocythemia.

      This study investigates the following:

        -  The safety and tolerability of IMG-7289

        -  The pharmacodynamic effect of IMG-7289
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2 multi-center, open-label study evaluating the safety, efficacy and
      pharmacodynamics of IMG-7289 administered orally once daily in patients with essential
      thrombocythemia (ET). Patients will be dosed with IMG-7289 for 169 consecutive days in the
      Initial Treatment Period (ITP). Qualifying patients may continue to receive IMG-7289 in the
      Additional Treatment Period (ATP).

      Safety will be evaluated by clinical assessments of safety parameters i.e. safety laboratory
      testing, adverse event reporting, physical examination and vital sign assessments.
      Pharmacodynamics will be evaluated by hematology assessment, patient reported symptom burden,
      change in spleen size by palpation and other measures.

      To ensure safety, a Safety Advisory Board will perform periodic reviews of safety parameters
      and pharmacodynamic markers.
