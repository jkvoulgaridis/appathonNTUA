      Effects of switching from racemic methadone to R-methadone on serum methadone concentrations
      and QTc intervals
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Racemic methadone may prolong the QTc interval, which is associated with fatal arrhythmias.
      In vitro studies have shown that R-methadone has less inhibitory effect than S-methadone on
      the voltage-gated potassium channel current, and is thus thought to have less effect on the
      QTc interval.

      The investigators hypothesized that switching from racemic to R-methadone would reduce the
      methadone serum concentration and also its effect on the QTc interval.

    <intervention_model_description>Patients included were stabilized on per os methadone maintenance treatment and had automatically ECG recorded QTc interval greater or equal to 450 ms. The patients were switched to pure R-methadone per os (half dose of the racemic methadone used). Doses, serum drug concentrations, QTc-time were recorded before and after drug switch. Serum-electrolytes (Mg, K, Ca) and opioid withdrawal symptom scale (OWS) were also measured and scored before and after drug switch.</intervention_model_description>
