  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this prospective study is to investigate the feasibility of performing minimally
      invasive vitrectomy under sub-tenon anesthesia in terms of intraoperative patients' tolerance
      and the surgeon's confidence. In particular, the tolerance and pain sensation during the
      operation as well as the possible perception of light and colour sensations are to be
      recorded with the help of questionnaires. In addition, the surgeon's impressions regarding
      eye motility, chemosis and general feasibility will be evaluated.

      A prospective, one-center clinical trial to identify the safety and feasibility of sutureless
      pars-plana vitrectomy performed in sub-tenon anesthesia.

      Background:

      In Germany pars-plana vitrectomies are mostly performed in general anesthesia. This requires
      the immediate availability of a trained anesthesiology team, which is not always granted,
      especially in urgent eye disease (i.e. endophthalmitis, high risk retinal detachment).
      Furthermore, some patients are not suitable for general anesthesia due to systemic diseases
      (i.e. cardio-vascular diseases). There are several procedures of local ocular anesthesia
      (i.e. peribulbar, retrobulbar, sub-tenon anesthesia). The main advantage of sub-tenon
      anesthesia is the use of a blunt cannula limiting the risk of potential complications.

      Purpose:

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety of local sub-tenon anesthesia
      procedure for sutureless vitrectomy (anesthetic mixture: 2ml xylocaine and 2ml bupivacaine)
      in a prospective clinical study design.

      Objectives:

      Primary outcome: The evaluation of 1. sensation of pain, 2. patients' intraoperative
      discomfort and 3. visual sensations using the standardized questionnaires (WONG-BAKER Faces
      Scale, Visual Analog Scale and individual questions).

      Secondary Outcome: The evaluation of 1. chemosis, 2. eye movement, 3. surgeon's general
      feeling of comfort during surgery (rating scale).

        Study population is acquired from the patient collective of the eye clinic of the
        University Hospital Aachen and have a medical indication for vitrectomy, which is
        independent of study participation.

             gliosis, macular holes, subretinal bleeding, lens luxation).

                  forms) potential study subjects will be approached to participate in the clinical
                  trial.
