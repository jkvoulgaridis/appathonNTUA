  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomised, multicenter, no placebo-controlled, open label study for
      evaluating the efficacy and safety of pyrotinib in women with residual invasive HER2-positive
      breast cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus anti-HER2 target therapy. The main purpose
      is to investigate whether pyrotinib can further reduce the risk of recurrence from previously
      diagnosed HER-2 positive breast cancer based on the 1-year trastuzumab standard adjuvant
      treatment with or without pertuzumab.
