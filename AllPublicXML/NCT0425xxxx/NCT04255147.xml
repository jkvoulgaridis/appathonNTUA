  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common and chronic lung disease that occurs in preterm
      infants following ventilator and oxygen therapy and is associated with long-term health
      consequences. Preclinical research shows that mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) can modify a
      number of pathophysiological processes that are central to the progression of BPD and thus
      present as a promising new treatment option. The main purpose of this Phase I study is to
      evaluate the safety of human umbilical cord tissue-derived MSCs in extremely preterm infants
      at risk of developing BPD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Complications of extreme preterm birth are the primary cause of mortality in children under
      the age of five. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), the chronic lung disease that follows
      ventilator and oxygen therapy for acute respiratory failure, is the most common complication
      of extreme prematurity and contributes to life-long respiratory and neurological impairment.
      Currently, there is no effective treatment for BPD. The multi-factorial nature of BPD makes
      it challenging for traditional pharmacological therapies targeting a single pathway to have a
      major impact on outcome. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) may provide a promising new
      treatment avenue due to their pleiotropic effects that may prevent neonatal lung injury while
      promoting lung (and other organ) growth. A systematic review and meta-analysis of all
      preclinical studies testing MSCs in neonatal lung injury models provides strong evidence for
      the lung protective effect of MSCs. Additionally, studies in a large preclinical model of
      extreme prematurity and chronic lung injury suggest feasibility, safety and short-term
      hemodynamic benefit of intravenously delivered human umbilical cord tissue-derived MSCs
      (uc-MSC).

      The aim of this study is to establish the safety, maximum feasible dose and feasibility of
      intravenously delivered allogeneic uc-MSCs in preterm infants at risk of developing BPD. This
      will be a Phase 1, open-label, single center, dose-escalating trial using a 3+3+3 design.

Hypersensitivity / anaphylactic to uc-MSCs defined as any severe systemic inflammatory response syndrome with negative blood culture not consistent with the overall clinical course of the infant occurring within 72 hours of injection;
Any other serious adverse event not expected in this patient population for which there is no alternative explanation but the administration of uc-MSCs, occurring within 1 week of injection.</description>
