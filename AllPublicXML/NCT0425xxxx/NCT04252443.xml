  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Opioid analgesics used in moderate or severe pain have potential side effects and addiction.
      Therefore, nurses have hesitations about opioid administration.This descriptive study aimed
      to evaluate the attitude and knowledge of nurses working in a university hospital about
      opioids. One hundred twenty-seven nurses were interviewed in the research population. The
      research data were obtained from the questionnaire, prepared by the researchers, between
      01-05 June 2018. It consisted of three parts: descriptive characteristics, attitudes, and
      knowledge on opioid administration, and evaluation of basic nursing skills and pharmacology
      about opioids. Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) 24.0 package program was used
      for statistical analysis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Analgesics do not eliminate the cause of pain but reduce or eliminate that feeling.
      Non-steroid analgesics are preferred in mild and moderate, and opioids are used to moderate
      or severe pain that does not respond to anti-inflammatory agents. However, nurses avoid the
      administration of opioids because of side effects and addiction risk.The first step in the
      effectiveness of pain management in the emergency department is evaluation and control. Pain
      control should be included in the emergency management system from the stage of triage
      assessment of the patient and should be concluded with the correct analgesic use, if
      necessary. In emergency departments, waiting for analgesia can be prolonged unnecessarily,
      and mostly insufficient doses of analgesics administered.Mainly the use of opioids in the
      emergency department is not preferred much because it reduces the symptoms and masks the
      examination findings. However, against this conventional idea, recent studies have shown that
      opioids use reduces pain-related anxiety.Also, it increases the patients' participation in
      the examination, thus making it more effective. While patients feel better, symptoms such as
      tenderness and defense were generally not affected by analgesia.This descriptive study was
      conducted to evaluate the attitude and knowledge of nurses working in a university hospital
      about opioid analgesic administration, after the ethical committee approved.

    <intervention_model_description>The research population consisted of 190 nurses working in a university hospital. Because all of the nurses in the research population could not be reached, a sample was selected using a simple random sampling method. One hundred twenty-seven nurses were interviewed in the research population, with a 95% confidence interval and a 5% sampling error.</intervention_model_description>
