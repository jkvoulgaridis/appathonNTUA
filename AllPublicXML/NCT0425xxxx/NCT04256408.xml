  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: A big step forward and great opportunity to improve overall efficacy of
      bronchoscopic lung volume reductioen is to combine treatment modalities aiming to close the
      dependent collateral channels and then proceed with EBV therapy to induce lobar collapse, and
      thus maximal treatment effect.

      Objective:

      Primary objective:

        1. To investigate the feasibility of injecting AeriSeal into the interlobar collateral
           ventilation channels region to make the target lobe suitable for endobronchial valve
           treatment.

           Secondary objectives:

        2. To investigate the safety of injecting AeriSeal into the interlobar collateral
           ventilation channels region to make the target lobe suitable for endobronchial valve
           treatment.

        3. To investigate the effectiveness of injecting AeriSeal into the interlobar collateral
           ventilation channels region to make the target lobe suitable for endobronchial valve
           treatment.
