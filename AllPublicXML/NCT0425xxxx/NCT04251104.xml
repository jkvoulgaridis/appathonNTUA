  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: The ability to retrieve specific memories is a cognitive and emotional protective
      factor. Among the most effective techniques to generate autobiographical memories is the use
      of audio-visual stimuli, particularly images. Developing and improving techniques that
      facilitate the generation of such memories could be highly effective in the prevention of
      depressive symptoms, especially in the elderly population. The aim of the present study is to
      examine how the level of personal relevance of pictures as autobiographical memory cues to
      induce positive emotions may affect an individual's emotion regulation.

      Methods: The participants, 120 older adults aged 65 and over and 120 young adults aged
      between 18 and 35, of both sexes and without depressive symptoms, will be induced to a
      negative mood state by means of viewing a film clip. Following the negative mood induction,
      the participants will be shown positive images according to experimental group to which they
      were randomly assigned (high personal relevance: personal autobiographical photographs;
      medium personal relevance: pictures of favourite locations associated with specific positive
      autobiographical memories; and low personal relevance: positive images from the International
      Affective Picture System). The investigators will analyse the differences in subjective
      (responses to questionnaires) and objectives measures (EEG signal, heart rate variability and
      electrodermal activity) between the groups before and after the induction of negative affect
      and following the recall of positive memories.

      Discussion: The use of images associated with specific positive autobiographical memories may
      be an effective input for inducing positive mood states, which has potentially important
      implications for their use as a cognitive behavioural technique to treat emotional disorders,
      such as depression, which are highly prevalent among older adults.

    <intervention_model_description>This is an exploratory randomized controlled study to compare the effectiveness of three types of autobiographical stimuli, classified according to their level of personal relevance, in the induction of positive emotions resulting from the retrieval of specific positive autobiographical memories. The study sample will comprise a group of adults aged 65 years or over and a group of young adults aged between 18 and 35. Each participant will be assigned randomly to one of three parallel groups (high, medium and low personal relevance images). The allocation ratio will be 1:1:1.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Psychologists responsible for participant recruitment will be blinded to the information about the group allocation. Due to the nature of the intervention neither participants nor psychologists responsible for the experimental phase can be blinded for the allocation, but the psychologist will be trained to decrease as much as possible her influence on the participants. For this, the psychologist will be provided with clear steps and norms to follow during the experimental intervention.</masking_description>

    <time_frame>Positive and Negative Affect scales are administered before and after the negative mood induction and before the emotional recovery. The experimental task lasts 25 min. Each scale scores from 10 to 50. Higher scores mean higher affect.</time_frame>

    <description>SC morphology is the result of two independent components: a fast-changing skin conductance response (SCR), overlapped with a slowly changing skin conductance level component (SCL). The SCL component ranges from 0Hz to 0.05Hz, while SCR ranges from 0.05Hz to 1.5 Hz. Each SC signal will be filtered by applying a 1.5Hz cut-off low-pass FIR filter to decrease noise generated during the acquisition. The data series will first be divided into equal segments lasting five seconds and the mean of each segment will be recorded for subsequent analysis.</description>

    <time_frame>HRV is registered during all the experimental task (maximum duration: 25 minutes)..</time_frame>
    <description>Cardiovascular variables will be measured through blood volume pressure (BVP). Alternations of the BVP waveform are highly correlated with heart ventricular depolarization and repolarization, thus being suitable to measure heart rhythm. Once data are acquired, BVP signals will be processed to reduce noise. After that, interbeat intervals (IBIs) will be derived from the peak-data series. The IBI data series will be transformed to obtain the heart rate (HR) measured in beats per minute (BPM). Then, the HR metric will be partitioned into five-second equally-separated segments.</description>

    <description>This is an exploratory randomized controlled study to compare the effectiveness of three types of autobiographical stimuli, classified according to their level of personal relevance (high, medium and low), in the induction of positive emotions resulting from the retrieval of specific positive autobiographical memories. To this end, the investigators will use three types of images, classified according to their personal relevance: a) personal autobiographical photographs (high personal relevance); b) images of locations related to the participants' lives (medium personal relevance); and c) images from the Internation Affective Picture System (IAPS; low personal relevance).</description>

    <description>After completing the PANAS, the negative mood induction phase (viewing a film clip) phase will begin. Before this phase, the participants will be encouraged to experience the feelings generated by the clip as intensely as possible. After viewing the film clip, participants will be asked to complete the PANAS again in order to assess the effectiveness of the negative mood induction procedure.
Following the negative mood induction phase, the emotional recovery phase will be initiated, in which the participants will look at a total of six pictures previously selected according to their experimental condition in order to generate specific positive autobiographical memories. At the end of this phase, participants will once more complete the PANAS in order to assess the effectiveness of the emotional recovery.</description>
