    <textblock>
      A double-blind placebo controlled randomized Phase 2 study to determine if JKB-122 compared
      with placebo resolves NASH on liver biopsy and improves fibrosis
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2 study in which JKB-122 is given once daily for 52 weeks to subjects with
      Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) with Fibrosis who have biopsy reading more than NAS 4
      with a fibrosis reading more than 1 and no cirrhosis. Subjects will be at least 18 years of
      age, either male or female.
