  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infective endocarditis is a deadly disease with a mortality rate between 20 and 40%.
      Antibiotic therapy is of utmost importance. It is primarily guided by microbial results from
      positive blood culture. However, culture-based microbiological diagnostic can identify the
      species, but not the strain or the genotypic characteristics of a pathogen. Identifying the
      strain can be of utmost clinical significance. S. aureus is the most common causative
      organism of IE worldwide (16%-32%). This pathogen causes massive valve destruction and
      abscesses, which is strongly dependent on the expression of virulence factors that vary
      between different S. aureus strains.

      Functional characterization of S. aureus and determination of virulence factors can currently
      be achieved through cell culture-based assays (CCBA). However, these tests are very time
      consuming and cannot be performed as routine clinical diagnostics. Next Generation Sequencing
      (NSG) has the potential to identify the genotypic characteristics of the pathogen, which is
      important to determine its virulent potential.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the possible utilization of NGS in the prediction of
      virulence factors of S. aureus and to compare it to the virulence factors determined using
      CCBA.

      Hopefully, by comparing the NGS and CCBA, the investigators will get a faster way of
      determining the possible virulence factors. The NGS method can be further utilized to
      describe the prevalence of different strains of bacteria in infected valve tissue and blood
      culture samples. The collected data will serve as a basis for further evaluation of the
      potentials of NGS-based Diagnosis of IE, as well as a comparison between NGS-guided
      antibiotic treatment and the standard of care antibiotic treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The ability of the Staphylococcus aureus to produce massive valve destruction as well as
      abscesses and to switch from acute to chronic infection and vice versa is a significant issue
      in the modern treatment of infective endocarditis. Furthermore, the ability to produce
      different virulence factors to evade the immune defense mechanisms proves the treatment more
      difficult. Another conundrum is the proof of different S. aureus strains isolated from Blood
      culture samples and infected valve samples. This makes a possible treatment of S.
      aureus-based endocarditis more difficult than expected.

      Isolation of Bacteria in the Blood culture samples can take much time (3-14 days), and Cell
      Culture-based assays (CCBA) are not regularly implemented as a diagnostic procedure. CCBA is
      not regularly used in the clinical setting due to the time consumption and high cost. The
      significance of the CCBA method lies in the determination of the possible virulence factors.
      Utilizing the Next Generation Sequence (NGS) method, it might be possible to gain this
      information about the culprit microorganism faster and to identify the different strains and
      virulence factors.

      To date, such correlations between genetic information about virulence factors gained by NGS
      and phenotypic information obtained by cell culture-based assays have not yet been
      performed.If proven, the NGE based analysis of the pathogens and their phenotypical behavior
      could guide antimicrobial therapy and make it individualized. Blood culture and infected
      tissue valve samples will be examined using the NGS and CCBA. The investigators aim to
      compare the differences in virulence factor results in these two methods, to characterize the
      prevalence of different strains of S. aureus in the blood culture and valve samples and to
      evaluate the possible potentials of NGS-based diagnosis of IE and to compare the effects of
      the NGS-guided antimicrobial therapy to the standard of care therapy.
