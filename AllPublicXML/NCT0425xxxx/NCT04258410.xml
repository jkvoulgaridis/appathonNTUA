  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Double blind randomized controlled parallel pilot trial of Quercetin vs placebo oral
      administration in 24 postmenopausal women. The study team will conduct a feasibility pilot in
      preparation for a larger efficacy trial that will test the protective effects of quercetin
      against cardiac and skeletal muscle dysfunction and changes in structure induced by estrogen
      loss and potential mechanistic pathways in post-menopausal women at risk of heart failure
      with preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF).

      Participants receive either oral Quercetin 1000 g/day or placebo for 20 weeks. Quercetin
      levels, biomarkers, ultrasounds (heart and muscle), functional assessments will be measured
      on enrollment and after the intervention. The study coordinator will contact participants
      weekly to monitor safety and ensure compliance. All quercetin administration will be
      supervised by Claudia L Campos, MD, Associate Professor of Internal Medicine, Medical
      Director Internal Medicine clinic.

    <masking_description>Enrolled participants who complete the pre-treatment assessment will be randomly assigned to Quercetin or placebo. The trial manager who is not involved in any outcome assessments will carry out randomization following the protocol designed by the study biostatistician (Dr. Leng) prior to the study's start. The randomization sequence list will remain concealed from the investigators. Participants will be randomized using a computer-generated, password-protected randomization list, and simple randomization scheme. All staff involved in data collection and management will be kept unaware of the participants' group assignments and will explicitly inform participants that they (staff) are to remain blinded during the course of the study. The biostatistician will also be unaware of treatment assignment.</masking_description>
