      The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of mobility training using the Ekso
      robotic exoskeleton with functional electrical stimulation (FES) in persons affected by
      spinal cord injury; designated AIS classification A, B, C, or D. Traditionally, a person with
      an American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS) &quot;A&quot; injury, walking training is
      not performed. Even with AIS B, C and D injuries, although walking training may be
      appropriate, a person may not walk as much as needed to see an improvement due to
      environmental and staff limitations. The Ekso is a tool to give walking training to patients.
      The investigators aim to see if utilizing these technologies will affect recovery;
      specifically in sensation and muscle activity below the level of the injury as well as the
      ability to walk.

      The Ekso is a wearable, battery- operated exoskeleton that assists with walking. The Ekso has
      motors at the hip and knee joints to provide assistance that may be needed with walking. All
      motion is initiated either through body weight shifts or the use of an external controller.
      The Ekso robotic exoskeleton has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration as a
      powered exercise device for rehabilitative purposes such as this study. Currently, the Ekso
      is approved for people with spinal cord injuries from T4-L5 given bilateral arm strength of
      4/5. With injuries from C7-T3, individuals must have AIS classification of D with bilateral
      arm strength of 4/5. For this study, it is possible that Ekso GT will be used outside of the
      current FDA approval if the injury level is C7-T3 and the person is classified as an AIS A, B
      or C injury level. Functional electrical stimulation (FES) will be used in conjunction with
      the robotic exoskeleton. FES involves using surface electrodes placed on the skin like a
      sticker over key leg muscles that will be stimulated in the normal walking pattern as a
      person walks in the device.

      The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of mobility training using the Ekso
      robotic exoskeleton with functional electrical stimulation (FES) on neural recovery in
      individuals with acute spinal cord injury with American Spinal Injury Association Impairment
      Scale (AIS) neurologic classification A, B, C or D.

      Specifically, individuals with acute SCI in the inpatient rehabilitation setting improve
      their AIS score after mobility training with the Ekso-FES compared to a control intervention
      period?

      In addition, the investigators will analyze the influence of training performed early or
      later in acute rehabilitation phase on muscle properties, neural recovery and function.

      This is an investigational clinical study trialing the efficacy of the Ekso device with FES
      in the acute SCI population. Participants with a diagnosis of spinal cord injury classified
      as AIS A, B, C or D will be included. Up to ten participants will be recruited to participate
      in this study. This number was arbitrarily chosen as this is an investigational study and
      there is no previous data on the Ekso device to specifically select subject number based on a
      power analysis. Participants will be recruited from inpatient units at The Shirley Ryan
      AbilityLab. Following screening, all subjects will be required to receive medical clearance
      from their attending inpatient physician.

      Subjects will be randomized to which order they receive the Ekso intervention (A) and control
      (B) period (A then B or B then A). The device will be used in the lab and there will be no
      charge associated with use of the Ekso device.

      All participants involved in the investigational study/training will be screened according to
      general inclusion/exclusion criteria after obtaining informed consent and before using the
      Ekso device.

      Screening will include:

        -  Range of Motion (ROM): Range of motion of the joints of the upper and lower extremities
           will be measured using a goniometer

        -  Muscle strength testing: upper and lower extremity manual muscle testing to determine
           qualification for study inclusion.

        -  Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS): The Modified Ashworth Scale is a 6 point ordinal scale
           used to grade the amount of hypertonicity in individuals with neurological diagnoses. A
           score of 0 on the scale indicates no increase in tone while a score of 4 indicates
           rigidity. Tone is scored by passively moving the individual's limb and assessing the
           amount of resistance to movement felt by the examiner.

        -  Upper and lower leg length and hip measurements will be performed to determine safe fit
           in the exoskeleton device.

    <description>The goal is to cover as much ground as possible over 6 minutes, the distance is measured with a measuring wheel. The minimum score is zero feet walked, there is no maximum score and the participant will be scored by how far they can walk in 6 minutes. The farther they walk, the better the score. The instructions are &quot;Walk continuously if possible, but do not be concerned if you need to slow down or stop to rest.&quot; At the end of 6 minutes the participant is asked to rate their exertion level on a Borg Scale of 6 - 20 points.</description>
