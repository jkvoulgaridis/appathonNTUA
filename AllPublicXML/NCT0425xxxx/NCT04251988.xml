  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to test the effectiveness of virtual reality (VR) in reducing pain and
      anxiety in children undergoing voiding cystourethrograms (VCUG) at CHLA. A voiding
      cystourethrogram is a genitourinary diagnostic scan that provides important urological
      information, specifically the filling and releasing of the bladder. This information can help
      diagnose urological issues in children. However, this procedure requires catheterization,
      which is understood to be a painful and anxiety-provoking procedure. This study will test the
      effectiveness of VR as a non-pharmaceutical intervention to relieve pain and anxiety in
      pediatric patients undergoing VCUGs.

  <detailed_description>

      Background: VCUGs are genitourinary diagnostic scans that provide valuable medical
      information for pediatric patients with urological issues. However, these scans require
      catheterization, which can be anxiety-provoking, painful, and in some cases traumatic.
      Previous studies have assessed the use of pharmacological agents to address pain and anxiety
      during these procedures, but few studies exist examining non-pharmacological interventions in
      a methodologically rigorous way. As pharmacological interventions are associated with
      numerous side effects, and may not be appropriate for all pediatric patients, effective
      non-pharmacological interventions are needed for patients undergoing VCUGs.

      Aims: This study aims to determine the effectiveness of virtual reality (VR) in reducing pain
      and anxiety among children undergoing VCUGs at CHLA. This study will also assess patient,
      parent, and provider satisfaction with VR, and ease of completing VCUGs using VR vs. the
      standard of care.

      Study Population: CHLA patients aged 5-21 years receiving VCUGs at CHLA. Methods: A
      stratified randomization scheme will be used to assign patients aged 5-21 undergoing VCUG
      scans to receive the standard of care (i.e. caregiver presence in the room and Child Life
      Specialists in the room if desired), or the standard of care plus VR. Individuals assigned to
      the VR arm will be fitted with a Samsung head-tracking system, and will play an AppliedVR
      game prior to and during catheterization. Standardized questionnaires will be administered to
      patients and caregivers before and after the procedure to measure pain and anxiety.
      Satisfaction questionnaires will be administered post-procedure.

      Significance: VR is a non-invasive intervention that, if effective, could become part of a
      standard protocol to reduce pain and anxiety among children undergoing VCUGs. As there is a
      dearth of knowledge regarding non-pharmacologic interventions for children receiving VCUGs,
      this study will provide a foundation to inform future research on VR use among pediatric
      urology patients.

        Inclusion criteria for children:

          1. Children who are 5-21 years old

          2. Children who are English or Spanish speaking.

          3. Children undergoing a VCUG at CHLA.

          4. Only children who are in the normal range of development will be recruited for this
             study. This will be assessed by report from the parents. The rationale for excluding
             patients with developmental delay is that due to their cognitive impairments, such
             children react to the stressors of medical procedures differently than do children
             without such developmental delay. It is unclear how such children would use the
             interventions included in this study, and it is likely that their responses on
             baseline and outcome measures will differ from children of normal developmental
             parameters.

        Inclusion criteria for caregivers (no age limits):

          1. Have a child who is undergoing a VCUG at CHLA.

          2. Caregiver is present during the child's VCUG.

          3. Caregiver is English or Spanish speaking.

          4. Caregiver is 18 years old or older.

        Inclusion criteria for healthcare providers (no age limits):

          1. Provider is 18 years old or older

          2. Provider is a CHLA employee.

          3. Provider may participate if he/she witnessed and/or administered the medical
             procedure.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Child is currently taking pain medication or anxiolytic medication, including
             midazolam

          2. Child has a psychiatric disorder (i.e. anxiety, psychotic, thought disorder), organic
             brain syndrome, intellectual disability, Autism Spectrum Disorder, or other known
             cognitive/neurological disorder

          3. Child has visual, auditory, or tactile deficit that would interfere with the ability
             to complete the experimental tasks

          4. Child has a history of seizure disorder

          5. Child is currently sick with flu-like symptoms or experiencing a headache or earache

          6. Child has known or suspected motion sickness

          7. Child catheterizes regularly or has an insensate urethra

          8. Languages other than English and Spanish will be excluded given that the proposed
             measures have not been standardized for use in other languages.
