  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of pitolisant
      compared with placebo in treating excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) in patients with Prader
      Willi syndrome (PWS) ages 6 to 65 years.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist of a Screening Period, an 11-week Double-Blind Treatment Phase
      (including a 3-week Titration Period and an 8-week Stable Dose Period), and an optional Open
      Label Extension (OLE) Phase. The OLE Phase will be multi-year in duration and will continue
      until either pitolisant is approved for patients with PWS or the Sponsor elects to terminate
      the study.

      Approximately 60 patients ages 6 to 65 years who meet all eligibility criteria will be
      randomized at the Baseline Visit in a 1:1:1 ratio to low dose pitolisant, high dose
      pitolisant, or matching placebo. In the Double-Blind Treatment Phase, patients will be
      titrated to their randomized stable dose of study drug during the 3-week Titration Period.

      After completion of the 3-week Titration Period, patients will continue to take study drug at
      their randomized stable dose once daily in the morning upon wakening for an additional 8
      weeks of blinded treatment (Stable Dose Period). The duration of the Double-Blind Treatment
      Phase will be 11 weeks.

      Following the 11-week Double-Blind Treatment Phase, eligible patients will be given the
      opportunity to participate in an optional OLE Phase. During the OLE Phase, all eligible
      patients will receive treatment with open-label pitolisant and will undergo titration during
      a 3-week Titration Period to a maximum target dose based on their age. At the end of the
      3-week Titration Period, patients will continue to take their target dose of pitolisant once
      daily in the morning upon wakening until the end of the study.

             (QTcF) &gt;442 ms for patients ages 0 to &lt;10 years and &gt;439 ms for patients ages 10 to
             &lt;20 years, regardless of gender, and &gt;450 ms for male patients and &gt;470 ms for female

             strong CYP3A4 inducer, or a centrally acting H1 receptor antagonist; patients who

             strong CYP2D6 inhibitors and strong CYP3A4 inducers is allowed during the OLE Phase;
             however, adjustment of pitolisant dose is required (Section 5.7.3). Although not
             prohibited during the OLE Phase of the study, use of H1 receptor antagonists should be

         20. Has a history of seizures that have recently (within 6 months) been treated with
             antiepileptic medications that are strong CYP3A4 inducers. Patients with a history of
             seizures must have a stable seizure history (e.g., frequency and severity) for at
             least 3 months prior to enrollment.

         21. Based on the judgment of the Investigator, is unsuitable for the study for any reason,
             including but not limited to unstable medical conditions (including psychiatric and
             neurological conditions) or a medical condition that might interfere with the conduct
             of the study, confound interpretation of study results, pose a health risk to the
             patient, or compromise the integrity of the study.
