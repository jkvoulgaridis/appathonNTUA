    <textblock>
      This single-centre, single-blind, randomised controlled study with parallel-group design was
      conducted in Yun Ling, Taiwan between May 2019 and August 2019. Participants were randomly
      allocated to an intervention (mouth care using 0.12% CHX before intubation) or control
      (standard care) group on a 1:1 basis. This study was approved by the institutional review
      board of National Taiwan University Hospital, Taiwan (IRB No.201806086RINB). Each participant
      completed written informed consent after explanation of this study and advised that they
      could withdraw anytime.

      Participants were recruited at the operation room of a teaching hospital. Participants were
      included if they met the following criteria: 18-80 years of age, American Society of
      Anesthesiologists, ASA) class 1-3, scheduled for surgery under endotracheal tube intubation
      general anesthesia. Patients were excluded if they were diagnosed with upper or lower
      respiratory tract disease, including COPD, cold, had oral ulcer, scheduled to have a
      respiratory-related surgical procedure, had endotracheal tube intubated.
