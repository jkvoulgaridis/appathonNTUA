    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, first-in-human (FIH), phase 1 dose-escalation and cohort expansion
      study of BB-1701 in subjects with locally advanced/metastatic HER2 positive solid tumors. The
      study consists of 2 parts: dose-escalation (Part 1) and cohort expansion (Part 2). Part 1
      consists of dose escalation cohorts for determining the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and
      recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D). Part 2 consists of expansion cohorts, including but not
      limited to breast cancer, gastric/gastroesophageal junction cancer, bladder cancer and colon
      cancer, for exploring 1 or more RP2Ds or schedules for expanding/deepening the
      information/knowledge about clinical safety, clinical pharmacokinetics and anti-tumor
      activity.

    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, FIH, phase 1 dose-escalation and cohort expansion study of BB-1701 in
      subjects with locally advanced /metastatic HER2 positive solid tumors. The study consists of
      2 parts: dose-escalation (Part 1) and cohort expansion (Part 2).

      Part 1 of this study will follow accelerated titration and traditional &quot;3 + 3&quot; design. Part 2
      is a cohort expansion study with HER2 positive locally advanced/metastatic solid tumors. Part
      2 consists of 2 cohorts: Cohort 1 includes subjects with HER2 positive breast cancer, who
      must have received prior 3 lines of HER2 targeting therapies and Cohort 2 includes subjects
      with HER2 positive cancers including but not limited to gastric/gastroesophageal junction
      cancer (GC/GEJ), bladder cancer and colon cancer; prior HER2 therapy not required for cancer
      types other than GC/GEJ.

      Study duration consists of Screening (up to 28 days), Treatment cycles (up to 8 cycles), and
      Safety Follow-up (30 days).
