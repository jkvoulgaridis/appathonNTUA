    <textblock>
      Narrowing of the coronary arteries can cause chest pain and weaken the heart. In patients who
      have had heart attacks, blocked or severely narrowed arteries should be investigated (with
      coronary artery x-rays, or angiography) with efforts undertaken to improve the blood flow
      (angioplasty and stenting or heart bypass surgery). Sometimes these arteries are in fact
      supplying heart tissue which is already dead. Procedures to open up these vessels will
      therefore not influence how the patient feels or their future prognosis. On occasion, in
      order to determine whether heart tissue is alive (viable) and likely to benefit from of such
      efforts, a further investigation is required before another attempt is undertaken to open up
      these diseased arteries. This will require imaging of the heart to assess the state of the
      tissue (for example with magnetic resonance imaging, or cardiac MRI which is the gold
      standard). This means that patients may require two invasive procedures. One way around this
      would be to assess the electrical properties of the heart muscle in question during a single
      procedure. The principle is simply that dead muscle will have no electrical activity.
      Assessing the electrical properties of the heart through the coronary arteries using the same
      equipment used to treat the diseased artery during initial coronary angiography may provide
      viability information instantly, thus allowing treatment to proceed at the same procedure. In
      order to investigate whether this approach has promise, we will be performing a cardiac MRI
      around the time that patients have their coronary angioplasty. The electrical data will be
      compared to the cardiac MRI results to determine if this technique can be used in clinical
      practice. This innovative work has potential clinical and financial benefits.

      Furthermore, patients can be diagnosed and treated during one procedure
