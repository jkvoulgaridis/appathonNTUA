  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Eyes with diabetic macular edema requiring conbercept treatment will be followed up for one
      month. Before treatment, one week after treatment and one month after treatment, the eyes
      will be examined by optical coherence tomography (OCT) and optical coherence tomographic
      angiography (OCTA). The changes of macular edema will be observed and analyzed by OCT leakage
      mapping software, and the relationship between the changes of macular edema and visual acuity
      will be analyzed.

      1. Research purpose:

           After one month follow-up, we will observe whether OCTleakage mapping can be used as a
           biomarker to predict the prognosis of DME eyes, and will observe the effect of
           Conbercept on improving edema and visual acuity of DME eyes.

        2. Subjects Number of subjects planned to be recruited: 35

      Inclusion criteria:

        1. Age ≥ 18

        2. Diabetic macular edema eyes treated with conbercept for the first time in 1 week

        3. Informed consent of patients and signing of informed consent

      Exclusion criteria:

        1. High myopia

        2. Macular diseases affecting vision

        3. Vitreous hemorrhage requiring surgery

        4. Patients with anterior segment neovascularization

        5. Eye or periocular infection

        6. Optic neuropathy and glaucoma

        7. Periphlebitis, ophthalmic ischemic syndrome, uveitis, coat's disease, FEVR and other
           retinal diseases

        8. Ametropia and cataract surgery

        9. In 3 months, in addition to this treatment of conbercept, other anti VEGF treatment,
           laser treatment or vitreoretinal surgery were performed

       10. Other systemic diseases can not complete follow-up
