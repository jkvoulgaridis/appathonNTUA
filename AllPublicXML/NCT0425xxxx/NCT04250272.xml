  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective randomized controlled study was undertaken to compare the postoperative
      analgesic effect between ultrasound-guided serratus anterior plane block and intercostal
      nerve block after video-assisted thoracoscopic lobectomy.

    <textblock>
      Post-thoracotomy pain is one of the most notorious postsurgical pains that one can
      experience. The pain is known to last for an extensive period of time with significantly high
      intensity.

      In field of thoracic surgery, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery has been played an
      important role in alleviating the postoperative pain. In field of anesthesiology, various
      attempts to alleviate post-thoracotomy pain have been tried along advancement of thoracic
      surgical techniques. It began with postoperative medication of non-steroid anti-inflammatory
      drugs, opioids and progressed into implementations such as local analgesia, thoracic epidural
      block, paravertebral block, intercostal nerve block, interpleural block and serratus anterior
      plane block.

      Many analgesic methods have been applied to alleviate postoperative pain in patients who have
      undergone thoracoscopic surgeries. However, there are no prospective randomized controlled
      studies between intercostal nerve block and serratus anterior plane block in video-assisted
      thoracoscopic lobectomy. The main purpose of this study is to compare and analyze the effects
      between conventional intercostal nerve block and newly introduced serratus anterior plane
      block in lung cancer patients who have undergone video-assisted thoracoscopic lobectomy.

      This prospective study will discover the efficacy and differences between two methods.
