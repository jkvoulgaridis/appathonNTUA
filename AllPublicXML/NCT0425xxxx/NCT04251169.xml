    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single arm, multicenter phase II study evaluating treatment with
      pembrolizumab in combination with paclitaxel in patients with locally advanced or metastatic
      non-luminal Hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative (hereafter referred to as HR+/HER2-)
      breast cancer who had recurrence or progression while receiving previous therapy with a CDK
      inhibitor in the adjuvant setting or to treat advanced disease (or both).

      The study will utilize a 2-stage, single arm, Simon's 2-stage design1 with one (efficacy)
      interim and a final analysis. The interim analysis will be conducted when 15 patients are
      evaluable for Overall Response Rate (ORR) as determined locally by the investigator through
      the use of RECIST v.1.1. If 5 or fewer responses are observed in up to 15 patients of
      evaluable population (EP), the trial will be terminated in favor of the null for futility.
      Otherwise, up to a further 31 patients may be evaluated,for a maximum total of 46 evaluable
      patients. If a total of 19 or more responses are seen at the end of the second stage, then
      the null will have been rejected in favor of the alternative; and further investigation of
      the combination is warranted.

      Recruitment will be halted once 15 evaluable patients have been entered and whilst the Stage
      1 interim analysis is conducted. Recruitment will start again if the decision is made by
      Steering Committee (SC) to continue to the maximum of 46 evaluable patients.

      After confirmation of all eligibility criteria, eligible patients will receive pembrolizumab
      200 mg every 3 weeks (on D1 of each 21-day cycle, beginning in Cycle 1) in combination with
      paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 administered at days 1, 8, 15 of each 21-day cycle beginning at cycle 2.
      Treatment will continue until disease progression, the development of unacceptable toxicity,
      withdrawal of consent, 24 months from the date of the first dose of pembrolizumab or end of
      study, whichever occurs first.

      All patients will be followed for survival from screening until the last patient recruited
      has been followed for 12 months, has progressed or has died, whichever occurs first. The
      patient will be followed for survival approximately every 3 months (± 21 days) until death,
      withdrawal of consent, loss to follow-up, or study termination by the sponsor. In addition,
      information regarding use of subsequent anti-cancer agents for metastatic HR+/HER2- during
      the survival follow-up period will be collected.

      Tumor assessments per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v.1.1 and
      Immune-Related Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (iRECIST) will be performed every
      9 weeks (63 days ± 5 days) until disease progression, treatment discontinuation, the start of
      new anti-cancer treatment, withdrawal of consent, death, or the end of the study, whichever
      occurs first. Tumor assessments will be performed on the specified schedule regardless of
      treatment delays.

      Safety assessments will include the incidence, nature, and severity of adverse events (AEs)
      and laboratory abnormalities graded per the NCI CTCAE v.5.

      Laboratory safety assessments will include the regular monitoring of hematology, blood
      chemistry and pregnancy test

    <description>To identify new biomarkers of response to the combination treatment, we aim to further evaluate the expression of 752 genes that encompass important genomic signatures and individual genes. The Breast Cancer 360 Panel includes 752 genes that cover established breast cancer diagnostic and research signatures as well as key pathways at the interface of the tumor, tumor microenvironment and immune response. Special attention will be given to innate immune response genes as well as markers of antigen presentation, which are expected to be determinant for this combination treatment. The following genes/signatures will be evaluated among others: PAM50 genes and signatures, risk of recurrence (ROR) score, ER signaling biology, immune cell marker, chemo-endocrine score (CES), immune infiltration or proliferation</description>

             considered a major surgical procedure and is therefore permitted.

          5. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug.
             Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles,
             mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster (chicken pox), yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus
             Calmette-Guérin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection
             are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza
             vaccines (eg, FluMist®) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.

          6. Uncontrolled pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, or ascites (Note: patients with
             indwelling catheters, such as PleurX® are allowed).

          7. Uncontrolled hypercalcemia (&gt;1.5 mmol/L [&gt;6 mg/dL] ionized calcium or serum calcium
             [uncorrected for albumin] &gt;3 mmol/L [&gt;12 mg/dL] or corrected serum calcium &gt;ULN) or
             clinically significant (symptomatic) hypercalcemia

          8. Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving chronic systemic steroid therapy
             (in dosing exceeding 10 mg daily of prednisone equivalent) or any other form of
             immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug.

          9. Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or has required active treatment
             within the past 3 years. Note: Participants with basal cell carcinoma of the skin,
             squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or carcinoma in situ (e.g. breast carcinoma,
             cervical cancer in situ) that have undergone potentially curative therapy are not
             excluded.

         10. Has known active Central Nervous System metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis.
             Participants with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they
             are radiologically stable, i.e. without evidence of progression for at least 4 weeks
             by repeat imaging (note that the repeat imaging should be performed during study
             screening), clinically stable and without requirement of steroid treatment for at
             least 14 days prior to first dose of study treatment.

         11. Has severe hypersensitivity (≥Grade 3) to pembrolizumab and/or any of its excipients.

         12. Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years
             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive
             drugs). Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a
             form of systemic treatment.

         13. Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or has current
             pneumonitis.

         14. Prior allogeneic stem cell or solid organ transplantation

         15. Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.

         16. Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).

         17. Has a known history of Hepatitis B (defined as Hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg]
             reactive) or known active Hepatitis C virus (HCV) (defined as HCV RNA [qualitative] is
             detected) infection. Note: no testing for Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C is required
             unless mandated by local health authority.

         18. Has a known history of active Tuberculosis Bacillus.

         19. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality
             that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the subject's
             participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

         20. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

         21. Is pregnant or breastfeeding or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the study, starting with the screening visit through 120 days
             after the last dose of pembrolizumab or 180 days after the last dose of paclitaxel.
