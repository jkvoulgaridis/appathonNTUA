  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators developed EM/PROTECT, a behavioral intervention for depressed EM (elderly
      mistreatment) victims, to work in synergy with EM mistreatment resolution services that
      provide safety planning, support services, and links to legal services. PROTECT is built on a
      model which postulates that chronic stress promotes dysfunction of the cognitive control
      (CCN) and reward networks, impairing the victims' ability to flexibly respond to the
      environment and limits their reward activities. PROTECT therapists work with victims to
      develop action plans to reduce stress, and to increase rewarding experiences. EM/PROTECT has
      been designed in an iterative process with community EM providers of the New York City (NYC)
      Department for the Aging (DFTA) to use agencies' routine PHQ-9 depression screening and
      referral for service. In the current study, the investigators will compare the effectiveness
      of EM/PROTECT with EM enriched with staff training in linking EM victims to community mental
      health services (EM/MH). The investigators intend to enroll 100 subjects that will
      participate in the study for approximately 12 weeks.
