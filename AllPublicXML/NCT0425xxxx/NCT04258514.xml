      The primary purpose of the study is to determine if the use of Virtual Reality (VR) goggles
      reduces the degree of anxiety patients experience during vasectomy procedures. The
      eligibility criteria include a.) appropriate age (19-100 years); b.) undergoing elective
      vasectomy procedure for purpose of desired sterility; c.) acceptance of wearing goggles; d)
      able to provide informed consent.There will be two groups, Group A will wear VR goggles and
      Group B will not. Evaluations will be done by survey to include questions regarding the level
      of anxiety experienced during the procedure, along with satisfaction scores of the
      experience.

      1. The aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of virtual reality goggles (VRG) for
           improving the patient's experience during vasectomy procedure.

        2. The secondary aim is to determine if VRG reduces the level of anxiety experienced during
           vasectomy procedure.

      VR is an immersive, multisensory experience in a three-dimensional environment designed to
      replicate a real world. It has been shown in multiple studies to decrease acute and chronic
      pain in a variety of clinical settings. The mechanism is due to distraction by activating
      visual, auditory and proprioceptive senses. One example of this is a report by G Pooja et al
      where in VR goggles reduced pain and medication use during orthopedic procedures (1). Another
      study found decrease in pain in medically treated patients (n=50 patients in 2 groups) after
      a 15 minute VR viewing on pain reduction compared to 2 -D viewing (2).
