      This research study invites men with prostate cancer that has spread to other parts of the
      body (metastatic prostate cancer) identified through the Washington State Cancer Registry to
      complete genetic testing looking for inherited genetic mutations in about 30 cancer-risk
      genes. Participants also fill out a survey on their health history and family history of
      cancer. After receiving their test results, participants who are found to have genetic
      mutations predisposing to higher cancer risk receive genetic counseling, and their adult male
      relatives are invited to complete genetic testing as well. The researchers seek to learn
      about factors that might predict a higher likelihood of having a mutation, to learn how best
      to facilitate &quot;cascade&quot; genetic testing for at-risk male relatives of men with metastatic
      prostate cancer who are found to have concerning genetic mutations, and finally, to identify
      men without a prostate cancer diagnosis but with high risk genetic mutations who may benefit
      from a more focused screening protocol for prostate cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine clinical, pathologic, and molecular predictors of germline DNA repair gene
      (gDRG) mutation carriers in a population-based cohort of men diagnosed with metastatic
      prostate cancer (mPC).

      II. To characterize stepwise cascade genetic testing for at-risk male relatives of mPC cases
      with gDRG mutations.

      III. To identify a cohort of men with gDRG mutations without a prostate cancer diagnosis who
      may benefit from an early detection protocol for prostate cancer. (Note: An early detection
      study for men with gDRG mutations without a prostate cancer diagnosis will be conducted as a
      separate trial.)

      OUTLINE:

      Participants with mPC identified through the Washington State Cancer Registry receive mail
      and phone invitations to participate. Participants complete a web-based or hard copy
      questionnaire on their health history and family history of cancer and are mailed a saliva
      collection kit. Saliva samples are mailed back to Color Genomics for genetic testing, and
      results are provided both to participants and to study researchers. Participants who are
      identified to have an inherited mutation in a DNA repair gene receive phone-based genetic
      counseling, and are also asked for permission to contact their adult male relatives. If
      permission is granted, those relatives receive mail and phone invitations to complete genetic
      testing in a similar fashion.
