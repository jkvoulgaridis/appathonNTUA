  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial will compare active intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) rTMS in an
      accelerated treatment schedule (8 treatment sessions per day for 5 days) to a placebo
      control. Depression symptom severity will be measured before, during, at end of treatment,
      1-week post and 4-weeks post treatment.

    <textblock>
      Those participants who do not meet the response criterion (50% improvement from baseline on
      the HRDS-17) at the 4-week follow-up will be offered a second course of treatment, regardless
      of whether they were in the active or the sham treatment group. The blind will be maintained
      and no further assessment contributing to the primary or secondary outcomes will occur after
      the 4-week time point. A different operator will administer the open-label second course of
      treatment to ensure blinding of operators. The second course of treatment will apply active
      rTMS using low-frequency (1 Hz) stimulation to the right DLPFC for 600 pulses (10 minutes),
      8x daily at 50 minutes (between session and end and start) intervals for 5 days. All those
      completing the second course of treatment will undergo the same set of clinical assessments
      during and after the course of treatment on the same schedule as the first course of
      treatment. The final 4-week follow up assessment from the first course of treatment will
      serve as the baseline for those that go on to receive the second open label treatment course.
