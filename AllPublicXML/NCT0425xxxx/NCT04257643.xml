  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fifty eligible breast cancer survivors (median, 10 yrs after surgery) with arm lymph-edema
      (median, 21% inter limb difference) were included and randomized into the intervention(group
      A, n = 25) or control ( Group B, n = 25). Intervention group received 60 minutes
      aquatic-based exercise in the form of warm-up for 10 mins, then strengthening exercise for 40
      minutes, followed by 10 min cooling down in the form of stretching and mobility exercise,
      three times a week for 8 weeks, plus land-based exercise session for 60 minutes for 8 weeks
      in the form of warm-up, strengthening, and cooling down exercise. The control group received
      60 minutes of land base exercise, three times a week, for 8 weeks. Arm volume, shoulder
      flexion, abduction range of motion and pain using a visual analogue scale were assessed at
      baseline and after 8 weeks of treatment.

      Group A: 25 female Patients there aged ranged from 37 to 67 years old with BCRL, in Group-A
      had been dealt with water-based exercise was conducted at a hydrotherapy pool for the Eden
      Health care, cairo, The pool measures 8 × 15 m and ranges from 1 to 1.8 m in depth with
      access via steps. Interventions were conducted predominately in the deeper section of the
      pool so participants immerse their neck in water.

      Control group, Group B: 25 female Patients there aged ranged from 37 to 67 years old with
      BCRL, in control group had been dealt Land-based exercise program: Supervised program
      consisted of 60-min sessions, three times a week, over 8 weeks. The exercise program
      consisted of the first 10 minutes for warm-up exercise with a small softball, fit -ball,
      mobility and stretching exercise. Then 30-40 minutes for strength development with different
      materials and positions, that require more body control and increase joint motion. Then the
      last 10 minutes for cooling down for stretching exercise for the arm muscles .

Interventions were conducted predominately in the deeper section of the pool so participants immerse their neck in water. Thermo neutral water temperature, 30-32 °C at room temperature. Females were instructed to adjust water depth completely covering clavicles from standing position. Diaphragmatic breathing during exercise routine to assist with lymph fluid clearance. Exercise continuously for 40 to 45 min Full-body warm-up exercise for 10 min and cooling down for 10 minutes. Plus land-based exercise session for 60 minutes for 8 weeks in the form of warm-up, strengthening, and cooling down exercise.</description>
