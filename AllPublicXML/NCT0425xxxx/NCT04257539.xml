    <textblock>
      This study will test the effects of a sedentary behavior intervention on pain processing,
      blood bio-markers and pain symptoms in individuals with chronic low back pain. The behavioral
      intervention will include a wrist-worn activity monitor that will notify participants when
      they have been sedentary for too long, motivational interviewing, and habit development.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic low back pain (cLBP) is a prevalent and costly condition that is associated with
      substantial individual and societal burden. Exercise is a recommended behavioral treatment
      but adherence to regular exercise is frequently low in individuals with cLBP, so research of
      the utility of other behavioral treatments is needed. Previous research suggests that
      reducing sitting time (or sedentary time) may improve symptoms of back pain and be beneficial
      in treating chronic low back pain. Thus, the purpose of this study is to examine the utility
      of a theory-based intervention to reduce sedentary time (Sedentary-intervention Utilizing
      Motivational Interviewing and Technology, or 'SUMIT') in individuals with cLBP. Specifically,
      the primary aim of this study is to examine the utility of SUMIT on sedentary behaviors in
      individuals with cLBP and elevated symptoms of depression. Secondary aims are to determine
      how SUMIT influences mood, pain symptoms, and pain psychophysics, and to quantify cytokine
      and endocannabinoid responses to acute exercise across the intervention. To test this,
      individuals with cLBP will either be randomized into an intervention group (n=20) or a
      wait-list control group (n=20). Additionally, healthy adults (n=20) without cLBP will be
      enrolled to serve as a pain-free control group and will not receive the intervention. All
      participants will complete baseline assessments, enroll in an 8-week intervention period,
      return for final assessments and a 3-month follow up. Over the intervention period, those in
      the intervention group will be provided with a wrist-worn activity monitor that vibrates
      after prolonged sedentariness and a behavioral intervention utilizing motivational
      interviewing and education surrounding sitting habits and strategies for new habit
      development. Individuals in the cLBP wait-list control group and pain-free control group will
      be asked to maintain current physical activity levels, sedentary behaviors, and medication
      and/or treatment for low back pain during this period. The investigators hypothesize that 1)
      objectively-monitored prolonged sedentary behavior will decrease across SUMIT and be
      maintained at follow-up, 2) cLBP symptoms, mood-related symptoms, and pain psychophysics (e.g
      pain regulation and modulation) will improve across SUMIT with maintenance of changes at
      follow-up, and 3) in response to acute exercise, cytokine and endocannabinoid responses
      post-SUMIT will become more similar to those of controls. If effective, this scalable
      intervention could be implemented as a behavioral treatment for cLBP.

    <description>The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), consisting of 9 questions, will be used for participants to report the presence and severity of depressive symptoms over the past 2 weeks. PHQ-9 total score for the nine items ranges from 0 to 27. Scores of 5, 10, 15, and 20 represent cutpoints for mild, moderate, moderately severe and severe depression, respectively.</description>

    <description>The Minimal Dataset for Low Back Pain will be used for participants to report current symptoms of low back pain and impact on daily life. On this questionnaire, for each item a score of 1 is least severe and 5 most severe, with the exception of the single item on pain intensity, which ranges from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain). Total scores range from 8 (least impact) to 50 (most impact).</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36) scores at 8 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, immediately following intervention, and 3-months after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>SF-36 is a patient health and quality of life questionnaire consisting of 36 questions with the following sections: vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning, and mental health.The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability, so a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline Profile of Mood States Short Form scores at 8 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, immediately following intervention, and 3-months after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>This measure asks 36 questions and assesses different dimensions of mood, including: tension, anger, vigor, fatigue, depression, and confusion. Participants rate the extent to which adjectives describe them during the past week using a 1-5 Likert scale. Totals are created for each subscale (Tension, Depression, Anger, Fatigue, Confusion, and Vigor), with higher ratings indicating greater levels of that subscale. Total Mood Disturbance is calculated by adding the first 5 subscales and then subtracting Vigor, with higher scores indicating greater mood disturbance.</description>

    <description>The SIT Q 7d will be used for participants to recall their sedentary time over the past 7 days in different domains, including eating meals, transportation, occupation, screen-time, and other. Participants report levels of sitting in each domain, with higher amounts indicated great total sedentary time.</description>
