  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Employing imaginary pills could offer a new way of investigating underlying mechanisms of
      open label placebo (OLP) treatment by eliminating the physical treatment constituent (i.e.,
      the pill itself). This can reveal the power of the purely psychological component of a
      placebo and gives insights into underlying mechanisms of placebo effects. The aim of the
      project is to assess possible effects of an imaginary pill in comparison to no treatment, and
      open label placebo treatment in subjects with test anxiety.

      Interventions (seven to three weeks before the exam) will be held online using a video Chat
      application such as zoom (https://zoom.us/) or skype (https://www.skype.com/de/) or will take
      place at the division of Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy, University of Basel
      (Missionsstrasse 62, 4055 Basel).

    <description>The PAF questionnaire consisting of 20 items with four subscales (worry, emotionality, interference, lack of confidence) is a multi-faceted measure of test anxiety. Each subscale consists of five items with a total of 20 questions overall. Response on a 4-point Likert-scale ranging from 1 (almost never) to 4 (almost always).</description>

    <description>The PSQI is an 18 item self-rating questionnaire forming 7 subscales and includes frequency of sleep disturbing events, the assessment of sleep quality, the usual sleep times, sleep latency and sleep duration, the intake of sleep medications, as well as daytime fatigue.</description>

    <description>ASS-SYM symptom list It is composed of 48 items arranged in 6 subscales: physical and psychological exhaustion, nervousness and mental tension, psycho-physiological dysregulation, performance and behavioral problems, burden of pain as well as self-determination and self-control problems.</description>

    <description>qualitative interview to assess the subjective experiences, opinions and perceptions of (1) receiving the imaginary pill (N=10) and open label placebo (N=10) treatment, (2) their experiences during the three week intervention phase, (3) the exam situation (4) and thoughts about the use in the future. Participants of the no treatment group are not included. The data will be analyzed using a qualitative content analysis after Mayring (Mayring, 2014)</description>

    <description>Participants will have the information that they are receiving inert pills (i.e. &quot;P-Dragees&quot;, containing &quot;Placebo&quot;), combined with the following scientific rationale: (a) deceptive as well as open label placebos have been found to be effective in relieving symptoms in a variety of clinical conditions namely anxiety, depression, chronic pain (the placebo effect is powerful), (b) classical conditioning are one of the possible mechanism of this effect (the body automatically responds), (c) positive expectations may help but are not necessary, (suspend disbelief), (d) compliance with these instructions are important for outcome (taking the pills faithfully is important).
