      To investigate that VISTHESIA 1.5 is non-inferior to Provisc with regards to elevation in IOP
      greater than or equal to 30 mm Hg 6 Â± 2 hours post-operatively as per methodology set out in
      EN ISO 15798:2013 (Primary Endpoint) To compare the changes in endothelial cell count and
      incidences of intraocular inflammation between VISTHESIA and Provisc as per methodology set
      out in EN ISO 15798:2013

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients of any gender, 50 years of age or older at the time of study enrolment

          2. undergoing age-related cataract removal (phacoemulsification) and IOL implantation in
             one eye only

          3. Patient informed of the needs and visit schedule required of the Clinical
             Investigational Plan and who has given his/her written informed consent

          4. Planned implantation of the IOL in the capsular bag

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients not able to / willing to give informed consent

          2. Patients not able to comprehend and comply with study requirements

          3. Patients scheduled for surgery to the fellow eye within 48 hrs preceding any scheduled
             study follow up. (Surgery date could be changed)

          4. Patients not able to attend follow-up appointments for any reason

          5. Patients with known hypersensitivity to anaesthetics of the amide type or hyaluronan

          6. Patients with reduced corneal endothelium (e.g. Fuch's dystrophy)

          7. Patients with epilepsy, impaired cardiac conduction, bradycardia, or impaired
             respiratory function

          8. Patients being treated with tocainide for cardiac arrhythmia

          9. Patients with impaired hepatic function, if the anaesthetic dose or site of
             application is likely to result in high blood levels

         10. Mono-ophthalmic patients

         11. Patients who have previously undergone cataract surgery in the contralateral eye

         12. Patients with any psychosocial, or other chronic disease conditions that may affect
             the perception of bodily pain

         13. VISTHESIA (topical and intracameral components) or ProVisc is not a suitable device
             for the patient for any reason

         14. Patients with other pathology or condition presenting, according to the investigator
             opinion, a risk for the patient (to be documented in screen log)

         15. Female patients who are menstruating, pregnant, breastfeeding or amenorrheic for less
             than 2 years at the time of surgery

         16. Patients who may require the use of hyaluronidase as part of the study cataract
             procedure

         17. Patients who may be regarded as being vulnerable (e.g. prisoners, residents of care or
             mental health institutions, trauma, war or disaster victims, dependent on the
             investigator etc.)
