  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study examines the efficacy of Goal Management Therapy (GMT)--a well-established
      cognitive remediation strategy, aimed at improving goal-directed behaviors that are dependent
      on basic cognitive processes and on executive functioning, among public safety personnel with
      post-traumatic stress disorder.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Goal Management Therapy is a structured, short-term, present-oriented cognitive remediation
      program with an emphasis on mindfulness and practice in planning and completion of
      goal-oriented behaviors. The primary objective of GMT is to train participants to interrupt
      ongoing behavior through the resumption of executive control in order to define goal
      hierarchies and monitor performance in achieving goals. Sessions include instructional
      material, interactive tasks, discussion of patients' real-life deficits, and homework
      assignments. The matched psychosocial education control group will focus on educational
      materials (e.g. brain function, neuroplasticity), and lifestyle interventions (e.g. sleep
      hygiene, stress, exercise.) The study will take place in two phases: phase 1 will consist of
      6 sessions of Goal Management Therapy and 6 sessions of psychosocial education among public
      safety personnel and civilians who are inpatients at a mental health and addiction facility.
      Phase 2 will consist of 9 sessions of Goal Management Therapy and 9 sessions of psychosocial
      education, among public safety personal who are members of the local community.

    <time_frame>Phase 2 (outpatient): baseline, post- intervention at 9 weeks, 3 months post-intervention, 6 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>A neuropsychological assessment in which a series of 20 commands are presented to participants and they must identify the left or right hand, ear, eye, or shoulder on their own body or on the body of another person (e.g., show me your right hand). The test has four levels of difficulty and begins with the most difficult level, descending in difficulty each time the participant performs incorrectly. The test assesses individuals' right-left orientation to their own body, towards a confronting person, and combined orientation towards one's own body and a confronting person. The value of interest in this study is the raw score, which is computed by summing the responses to individual items (0 for an incorrect response and 1 for a correct response), with a possible score ranging from 0 to 20. A score less than 17 is considered a defective left-right orientation.</description>

    <description>A neuropsychological assessment that asks participants to identify which finger is being touched under three conditions: i) with their hand visible, ii) with their hand hidden (i.e., eyes closed), and iii) with their hand hidden and with two fingers touched simultaneously. This test provides a measure of finger dysgnosia. It contains 60 items (30 per hand) and a total score can be computed by summing the number of correct responses (score of 1 for correct, 0 for incorrect) for each hand or across all items. The values of interest are the total raw scores and the corresponding percentile rank, which is determined by consulting the appropriate reference manual.</description>

    <description>The TOPF is a word reading neuropsychological test that estimates an individual's level of cognitive and memory functioning before the onset of injury or illness. The test yields one raw score (total number of words correctly read before the discontinue criteria was met) that is converted to a T score. Higher T scores indicate better performance.</description>

    <measure>Change in Score on the Social Adjustment Scale- Self Report (SAS-SR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Phase 2 (outpatient): baseline, post- intervention at 9 weeks, 3 months post-intervention, 6 months post-intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>SAS-SR is a 53-item questionnaire that assesses an individuals' level of satisfaction with his or her social situation in both instrumental (e.g., work) and expressive (e.g., recreational) role areas. Items are summed within each domain and divided by the number of scale items to derive domain and total scores. Raw scores are converted to gender-based standard scores (e.g., T scores and percentiles) with higher scores indicating higher levels of impairment (i.e., lower levels of social adjustment).</description>

    <description>Goal Management Therapy is a structured, short-term, present-oriented cognitive remediation program with emphasis on mindfulness and practice in planning and completion of goal-oriented behaviors. The primary objective of GMT is to train patients to interrupt ongoing behavior through the resumption of executive control in order to define goal hierarchies and monitor performance in achieving goals. Sessions include instructional material, interactive tasks, discussion of patients' real-life deficits, and homework assignments. Phase 1: Inpatients will attend group sessions twice per week for 3 weeks, each session being 2 hours in length. Phase 2: Outpatients from the community will attend 1 session per week for 9 weeks, each session being 2 hours in length.</description>
