  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the influence of home air purification on the lung health of adults with
      eosinophilic COPD. Half of the participants will receive real air purifiers (HEPA filters)
      and half will receive sham air purifiers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the third most common cause of death in the
      United States, and is exacerbated by exposure to air pollution. Knowledge about whether air
      purification affects the health of those with eosinophilic COPD (approximately 40% of all
      COPD patients seeking care), who generally have more active airway inflammation. If found to
      be beneficial, home air purification may offer a non-pharmacologic intervention for a large
      proportion of people with this common and serious disease.

      This study will evaluate whether home air purification affects lung function, respiratory
      symptoms, nasal biomarkers (inflammatory proteins and metals) among people with eosinophilic
      COPD. Participants will be randomized to receive real or sham air purifier in the bedroom and
      living room for 12 months. The intervention group will receive two high efficiency
      particulate air (HEPA) air purifiers, while the control group will receive two sham air
      purifiers that look and sound the same as real HEPA air purifiers.

  <primary_outcome>

    <time_frame>Baseline [3 months before intervention and day of intervention] and post intervention [7 days, 6 months and 12 months]</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 is the volume of air exhaled in the first second of a forced exhalation maneuver. Lower volumes indicate worse lung function.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline [3 months before intervention and day of intervention] and post-intervention [6 months and 12 months]</time_frame>
    <description>The St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire is scored from 0 to 100. Higher scores indicate more health impairment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in respiratory symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Monthly for 3 months preintervention and 12 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Breathlessness, Cough and Sputum Scale measures the severity of respiratory symptoms in COPD. The total score ranges from 0 to 12, with higher scores indicating greater symptom severity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>Change in functional capacity by 6 minute walk test</measure>
    <time_frame>The 6 minute walk test measures distance (in meters) walked in a time of 6 minutes</time_frame>

    <description>Concentrations of inflammatory mediators relevant to allergic and non-allergic airway pathophysiology will be measured repeatedly at baseline and post-randomization in the nasal lining fluid by nasosorption. Mediators will include including Eotaxin, Eotaxin-3, GM-CSF, IFN-γ, IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-8 (HA), IL-10, IL-12/IL-23p40, IL-12p70, IL-13, IL-15, IL-16, IL-17A, IP-10, MCP-1, MCP-4, MDC, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, TARC, TNF-α, TNF-β, VEGF-A</description>
