  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dental caries is a multifactorial, progressive disease which is the major causes of dental
      pain, infection and tooth loss. Dental caries can substantially compromise the quality of
      life in older adults 1 2. As the number of older adults in the US increases, the dental
      professionals have become increasingly concerned with the dental need of elderly and
      preventive regimes to reduce the incidence of caries3 .

      Prevention becomes an area of paramount importance. Many studies have advocated nonsurgical
      intervention for shallow dentin caries lesion.The most effective method for prevention to
      date is considered to be fluoride. In the United states fluoride has been incorporated in
      many ways like water fluoridation, fluoride mouth wash, dentifrices and professionally
      applied fluoride varnishes . The American Dental Association (ADA) recommended the use of
      fluoride for patients of all ages who are at risk of developing dental caries7 . With the
      high success of fluoride, another treatment method using Silver Diamine Fluoride (SDF) is
      gaining popularity in the United States. SDF has been used in many countries like Japan,
      Australia, China, and Cuba for treatment of caries . Successful treatment data from other
      countries is promising, and promoting the use of SDF in the United States. SDF is available
      in the United States as 38% aqueous solution and approved as a desensitizing agent. American
      Dental Association published an evidence-based clinical practice guideline on nonrestorative
      treatments for caries teeth and recommended use of SDF on a carious cavitated lesion on
      permanent teeth9 . Clinical studies have shown the effectiveness of SDF in arresting root
      caries in older adults.

      Potential subjects will be identified through regular appointments. Screening will be
      performed on subjects to determine their eligibility based on inclusion and exclusion
      criteria. Subjects will sign an informed consent before enrollment in the study. Patient will
      be receiving one of the two fluoride treatments, Silver Diamine Fluoride or Sodium fluoride,
      to arrest caries around crown margins. Clinical and radiographic exam will be performed on
      all the participants.

      Clinical exam will include the following

        1. DIAGOdent:

        2. Tectile exam:

      The procedures of every clinical appointments will be as following:

      First appointment:

      Visit will include

        -  Health history

        -  Caries risk assessment

        -  Clinical exam (DIAGNOdent, tactile) (described above)

        -  Radiograph (described above)

        -  Subject will sigh consent form

        -  Treatment group will receive SDF

        -  Control group will receive Fluoride varnish

      Second visit (6 month from the first appointment ):

      Visit will include

        -  Health history retake

        -  Caries risk assessment retake

        -  New Clinical exam (DIAGNOdent, tactile)

        -  New Radiograph

        -  Subject will receive his or her treatment according to their allocation

      Third visit (12 month from the first appointment ):

      Visit will include

        -  Health history retake

        -  Caries risk assessment retake

        -  New Clinical exam (DIAGNOdent, tactile)

        -  New Radiograph

        -  Subject will receive his or her treatment according to their allocation

      Third visit (12 month from the first appointment ):

      Visit will include

        -  Health history retake

        -  Caries risk assessment retake

        -  New Clinical exam (DIAGNOdent, tactile)

        -  New Radiograph

        -  Subject will receive his or her treatment according to their allocation

    <measure>DIAGOdent: laser fluorescence to aid in the detection of caries</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 6 month for next 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>As the incident laser light is dispersed into the site, carious tooth structure will exhibit fluorescence, proportionate to the degree of caries, resulting in elevated scale readings on the display. Healthy tooth structure exhibits little or no fluorescence and will result in very low scale readings on the display. Over 90% accurate in detecting lesions not detectable with an explorer or bitewing X-rays. The remote display for DIAGNOdent pen uses infra-red signals, and the values are shown simultaneously on the DIAGNOdent pen and on the remote display</description>
