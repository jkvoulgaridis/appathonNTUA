    <textblock>
      Randomized, balanced incomplete block design dose response study of efficacy, with 4
      different dosages of mulberry fruit powdered extract added to cooked rice compared to a
      reference treatment (cooked rice only).

    <textblock>
      Dose response study with 4 dosages of mulberry fruit powdered extract (0.37, 0.75, 1.12 and
      1.5 g) added to cooked rice, compared to cooked rice only(reference) on post prandial blood
      glucose response in healthy Indian adults.

      In addition, 1.5 g of mulberry fruit powdered extract was added to instant rice porridge and
      compared to instant rice porridge only as positive control (replication of previous research.

      In total there were 7 test products in the study: 5 active treatments and 2 reference
      treatments.

      The study was a cross-over study (4 interventions per subject, 4 out of the 7 test products).
      The recovery period between treatments was at least seven days.
