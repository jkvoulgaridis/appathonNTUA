      Gliomas are the most common malignant tumors of the central nervous system and are highly
      invasive. Gliomas account for one-third of central nervous system tumors in adults and
      children. Interstitial astrocytomas and glioblastomas are also called high-grade gliomas,
      accounting for 77.5% of all gliomas.

      Temozolomide combined with concurrent radiotherapy, followed by 6 cycles of temozolomide
      adjuvant chemotherapy, can prolong the patient's survival, and the 2-year survival rate has
      increased from 10.4% to 26.5%. Great progress has been made, but the prognosis for glioma
      patients remains poor. For patients with poor-quality high-grade gliomas, more effective new
      treatments are urgently needed to achieve the purpose of survival benefit.

      Targeting VEGFs to inhibit tumor angiogenesis has shown good efficacy in a variety of tumors
      including colon cancer, gastric cancer, lung cancer, liver cancer and breast cancer. However,
      for gliomas, anti-tumor angiogenesis drugs can improve patient OS Evidence related to PFS is
      still scarce. Compared with other targeted drugs with multiple kinase targets, apatinib has
      not only an advantage in price but also less side effects. Therefore, based on relevant data
      from previous studies, a basic and clinical study of this apatinib combined with temozolomide
      for high-grade gliomas was performed.
