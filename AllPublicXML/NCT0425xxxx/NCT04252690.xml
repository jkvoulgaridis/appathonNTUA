  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MOBIDERM® demonstrated his interest through clinical studies on the treatment of lower or
      upper limb lymphedema (Mestre et al 2017; Quéré et al. 2014). This CE (Conformity
      European)-marking device is well established both in ambulatory and hospitalisation.
      Nevertheless, the mechanism of action of this device had never been confirmed and no
      experimental clinical studies had been performed. The hypothesis is that the MOBIDERM system
      creates a pressure differential between the contact zone underneath the foam cubes composing
      the system and their surrounding area, leading to a shear effect on the subcutaneous tissues
      treated.

      The aim of this study is thus to assess the mechanism of action of MOBIDERM on the lymphatic
      system by evaluating quantitative and qualitative effects of this medical device on lymphatic
      system, oedema volume and cutaneous parameters in 10 lymphoedema patients during their
      hospitalisation for reduction phase.
