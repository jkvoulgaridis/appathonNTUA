  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized, balanced, incomplete block design exploratory study of efficacy, with 8 active
      treatments (4 treatments per subject; 35 or 37 subjects per treatment) compared to a
      reference treatment (all 72 subjects).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Incomplete block design cross over study in which the subjects consumed commercial rice
      porridge (60 grams of extruded rice to which 300 ml of boiling water was added) in the
      morning in a fasted state. On each visit one of the seven different natural exacts was mixed
      into this porridge just before consumption. The reference was consumed by all subjects and
      consisted of plain porridge with no extract added.

    <masking_description>Randomization was generated by the bio-statistician CRO. Subjects and key study team personnel were blinded as much as possible with regard to the identification of specific treatments but their distinctive colors, flavors or tastes could not be masked.
To ensure the study team was not apparently aware of the treatments being administered to subjects, persons who were involved in the preparation of test products were not involved in rest of the study.
The sponsors team was blinded.</masking_description>

    <time_frame>Ten minutes before (baseline) and at 130, 250, 370 and 420 minutes after the ingestion of the test products.</time_frame>
    <description>An intestinal discomfort questionnaire was administered. The questionnaire asked whether subjects had experienced 1) flatulence, 2) nausea, 3) bloating or 4) pain in the bowels. Percentage of &quot;Yes&quot; scores was calculated per discomfort.</description>

    <measure>Stool consistency and number of stools</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours before study product intake, during 7 hour the test day and in the 17 hours after the test day (telephone interview).</time_frame>
    <description>Stool consistency was evaluated by semi-quantitative Bristol scale (score between 1 = constipation and 7 = watery diarrhea).</description>

    <measure>Glucose in urine</measure>
    <time_frame>Subjects were asked to empty their bladder before study product intake (-20 minutes) and again before leaving the site ( 450 minutes). In these two samples and in all additional urine samples voided while subjects were on site, glucose was analyzed</time_frame>
    <description>Glucose in urine was measured using dipsticks with a detection limit of 2.28 mmol/L</description>
