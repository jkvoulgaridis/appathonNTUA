  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is of this Phase 1 study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of
      daily, multiple, oral doses of CDX-6114 when administered to patients with PKU for 14 days.
      The aim is to check if administration of daily, multiple, oral doses of CDX-6114 to patients
      with PKU for 14 days shows a clinically acceptable safety and tolerability profile.
