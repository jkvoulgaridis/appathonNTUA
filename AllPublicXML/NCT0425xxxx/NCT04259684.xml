  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury following cardiac surgery for congenital heart defects in children is a
      major cause of both short- and long-term morbidity and mortality, affecting up to 60% of high
      risk patients. Despite effort, to date, no successful therapeutic agent has gained widespread
      success in preventing this postoperative decline in renal function. Based on preliminary data
      available in the literature, we hypothesize that nitric oxide (gNO), administered during
      cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), may reduce the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) via mechanisms
      of reduced inflammation and vasodilation. In this pilot study, 40 neonates undergoing cardiac
      surgery will be randomized to receive intraoperative administration of 20 ppm of nitric oxide
      to the oxygenator of the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit or standard CPB with no additional
      gas.
