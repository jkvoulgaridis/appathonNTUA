  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastrostomy is an intra-gastric nutritional enteral device that could be put in place by
      percutaneous technique under radiological guidance: allowing local anesthesia. However, there
      is no clear recommendation about local analgesia during this exam. Operator can chose
      Lidocaine with a short period of action, or Ropivacaine with a longer period of action. The
      association of these two drugs could enhance the analgesia post procedure. The main objective
      of this study is to decrease maximal pain felt during a twenty four hour stay, after a
      gastrostomy under percutaneous technique with radiological guidance.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gastrostomy is an intra-gastric nutritional enteral device, allowing the nutritional support
      for patients presenting oral feeding disorders. Gastrostomy could be put in place by
      different manners:

        -  Chirurgical technique or endoscopy: with general anesthesia;

        -  Percutaneous technique under radiological guidance: allowing local anesthesia. This last
           one is better tolerated by weak patients, and involves less complication.

      However, there is no clear recommendation about local analgesia during this exam. Operator
      can chose Lidocaine with a short period of action, or Ropivacaine with a longer period of
      action.

      The association of these two drugs could enhance the analgesia post procedure. Indeed, pain
      felt during the twenty four hours post procedure seems to be the most frequent adverse effect
      reported by patients.

      Pain could decrease significantly when Ropivacaine is added to the reference Xylocaine.
      Ropivacaine had already proved its efficacy in association with other antalgics.

      The main objective of this study is to decrease maximal pain felt during a twenty four hour
      stay, after a gastrostomy under percutaneous technique with radiological guidance.

    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Two points diminution for maximal pain felt during a twenty four hours after percutaneous gastrostomy under radiological guidance. It will be measured with a visual analogue scale starting at zero for no pain and ending at ten for maximal pain felt.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Level of Anxiety and Depression</measure>
    <time_frame>10 days</time_frame>
    <description>Hospital Anxiety and Depression scores will be reported and analysed for each patient. This scale is an instrument for detecting anxiety and depressive disorders. It has 14 listed items from 0 to 3. Seven questions relate to anxiety (total A) and seven others relate to the depressive dimension (total D), allowing thus obtaining two scores (maximum score of each score = 21). To detect anxious and depressive symptoms, the following interpretation can be offered for each of the scores (A and D):
7 or less: absence of symptoms;
8 to 10: doubtful symptomatology;
11 and more: certain symptomatology.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Level of quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>10 days</time_frame>
    <description>Brief Pain Inventory scores will be reported to evaluate the level of the patients' quality of life. For each question, score is comprised between 0 and 10, with 0 meaning no pain or no resounding on life activity, and 10 meaning the worst pain ever, and the worst resounding on life activity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Level of satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>10 days</time_frame>
    <description>Patients' satisfaction about their analgesic care will be reported with a visual analogue scale starting at zero meaning no satisfaction, and ending at ten meaning the highest satisfaction possible.</description>
