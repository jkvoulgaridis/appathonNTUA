  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of machine learning techniques using an artificial intelligence tool is proposed to
      analyze clinical data to predict best possible IVF/ART outcomes. This tool has been utilized
      to accurately predict embryo quality here at Cornell. Utilizing this tool to assess objective
      clinical findings and predict outcomes of assisted reproductive techniques is sought, with
      the ultimate goal of an automated tool to reduce implicit physician bias. Within this goal,
      using this tool to objectively and accurately assess baseline ovarian reserve at the start of
      an ART cycle is proposed, using 3D sonography to image the ovary and artificial intelligence
      tool to objectively identify baseline antral follicle counts.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will collect prospective data, specifically 3D transvaginal ultrasound of ovaries
      at time of baseline evaluation at beginning of an ART cycle. All participants will be asked
      to give written consent to be included in the study. At the time of initial ultrasound that
      is routinely done on the first day of the ART cycle, the physician performing the ultrasound
      will use a 3D ultrasound transvaginal probe to perform the ultrasound and capture both 2D and
      3D images. 3D ultrasound is performed routinely for patients undergoing ART and is not an
      investigative procedure, however is not uniformly performed at the time of the baseline
      ultrasound. As per standard practice, the baseline antral follicle count will be documented
      by the performing physician, as well as a 3D image saved to be analyzed later using AI.

      Information about the medical history, treatment and outcomes will be collected as part of
      the study. Data maintained in the medical record as a result of standard of care monitoring
      for IVF and IUI will also be used for this study. This will include semen analysis (male
      partners if applicable) and pregnancy outcomes. For male partners, the semen analysis record
      will be part of the fertility history and semen analysis will be performed as standard of
      care with semen processing for fertilization. Additional data related to the treatment and
      outcomes will be collected from the medical record from the time of consent through the end
      of the treatment (including pregnancy outcomes).

      The time commitment for subjects may take up to 1 month (time from consent signing to 3D
      ultrasound) and to the time of delivery if pregnant (up to 9 months). No further procedures
      will be performed in the study group.
