  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to examine the impact of a
      remotely-delivered antenatal milk expression (AME) intervention versus an attention control
      condition on breastfeeding outcomes among a sample of 280 nulliparous, non-diabetic women
      with pre-pregnancy body mass indices ≥ 25. AME involves milk expression and collection in the
      third pregnancy trimester and is theorized to address multiple barriers to breastfeeding
      among women with higher BMI, including impaired breastfeeding self-efficacy, insufficient
      milk supply (critical period endocrine modulation of milk volume), and early formula
      supplementation in the context of a medically complex birth (availability of banked antenatal
      milk).

      Participants will be enrolled in their third trimester of pregnancy and allocated into one of
      two study arms: 1) AME instruction delivered by remote, live International Board Certified
      Lactation Consultants via an innovative app-based telelactation platform; or 2) an attention
      control condition (video-based infant care education unrelated to infant feeding).
      Video-based education for both groups will occur in weekly study visits from 37 to 40 weeks
      gestation, with women in the intervention group continuing AME 1-2 times per day at home.

      Measured outcomes of interest will include short and long-term breastfeeding practices (e.g.,
      breastfeeding duration, exclusivity) and participants' experiences with and perceptions of
      AME.

      The purpose of the PREPARE Trial is to examine the impact of an antenatal milk expression
      (AME) intervention among women with pre-pregnancy BMI 25 or more on breastfeeding outcomes,
      including breastfeeding self-efficacy, breastfeeding duration and exclusivity, and perception
      of insufficient milk supply. Specifically, the investigators will:

        1. Determine the effect of the AME intervention on short-term breastfeeding outcomes,
           including breastfeeding self-efficacy and exclusivity, to two weeks postpartum.

        2. Explore the sustained effect of the AME intervention on longer-term breastfeeding
           duration and exclusivity over the first year postpartum.

        3. Examine participants' experiences with and perceptions of AME.
