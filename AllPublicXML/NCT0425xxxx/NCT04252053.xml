  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, autoimmune and neurodegenerative disease characterized
      by inflammation and progressive demyelination of the central nervous system. It is
      characterized by muscle weakness, balance and coordination disorder, which is more common in
      the lower extremities and trunk muscles. Over time, these symptoms decrease the individual's
      level of physical activity, mobility and quality of life, leading to further deterioration of
      the disorder. One of the most important problems that cause these problems in individuals
      with MS is reduced core stabilization. Decrease in core stabilization affects the quality of
      limb movements as well as trunk stability when considering the kinetic chain in the body.
      Pilates-based core stabilization training (PBCST) are a controlled exercise form used to
      improve the stabilization of trunk muscles. There are no studies on the effect of this
      training on lower extremity isokinetic muscle strength in individuals with MS. The aim of
      this study is to determine the effect of PBCST on lower extremity muscle strength, postural
      sway and kinetic chain in individuals with MS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was planned as randomized controlled. Individuals included in the study wiil
      randomly allocate to the group receiving the supervised PBCST and the home exercise group.
      While the supervised exercise group receives PBCST for 2 days and 8 weeks in the clinic, the
      home exercise group will perform the same exercises at home for the same time as the
      brochures prepared for them. The exercise program will show progression at 2-week intervals.
      A session will be held for both groups to teach the basic principles of pilates and will not
      be counted in the 8-week program. At the beginning and end of treatment, individuals will be
      evaluated for isokinetic muscle strength, balance and postural sway, fatigue level, quality
      of life and functional capacity parameters. PBCST is thought to reduce postural sways and
      increase lower extremity muscle strength by increasing core stability with the effect of
      kinetic chain and increased stabilization.

    <measure>Balance</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Berg Balance Scale (BBS) will be used to evaluate balance. BBS is a test developed for functional evaluation of balance in adults. BBS consists of 14 general equilibrium activities that change the orientation of the body center of gravity relative to the support surface and the ability to maintain the static position during the reduction of the support surface. The highest score is 56. The decrease in the score indicates poorer balance.</description>

    <measure>Fatigue</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) will be used to evaluate fatigue levels. This scale evaluates the severity of fatigue with 9 questions. Each question scores between 1 (I do not agree) and 7 (fully agree). The FSS score is the average value of nine sections. A high score indicates increased fatigue severity.</description>
