  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the impact of electronic educational materials on adolescent and
      young adult (&quot;AYA&quot;) survivors' knowledge about late effects, perceived benefits,
      self-efficacy, and intentions to engage in lifelong survivor care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite increased risk for morbidity and mortality related to cancer treatment, over half of
      young adult survivors of childhood cancer do not engage in the recommended healthcare
      designed to detect late effects and secondary cancers. There is a scarcity of data on
      adherence to survivor-focused healthcare, particularly at the critical transition from
      pediatrics to adult care. In order to improve transition outcomes, the investigators need to
      create media to educate survivors about need for adherence to adult survivor healthcare.

      This study aims to evaluate the impact of electronic educational materials on AYA survivors'
      knowledge about late effects, perceived benefits, self-efficacy, and intentions to engage in
      lifelong survivor care.

    <description>Knowledge will be assessed at baseline and 2 weeks post-intervention, with the Survivor Care Knowledge scale, that includes 15-item multiple-choice quiz to assess participants' knowledge of the content covered in the electronic educational materials previously provided. Total score ranges from 0-15. Higher score is associated with better outcome.</description>

    <description>Participants will complete an online pre-test survey via REDCap. One week after the pre-test survey is completed, AYAs will be sent electronic media via email to review on their own. Study staff will confirm receipt and review of material and schedule a post-test survey to be completed in REDCap two weeks after material is reviewed.</description>
