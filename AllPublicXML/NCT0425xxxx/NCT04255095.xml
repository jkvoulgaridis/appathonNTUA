  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesized that naso-pancreatic duct suction could benefit for patients
      with severe biliary pancreatitis undergoing ERCP. So, the investigators designed this
      experiment to verify it.

      This project intends to conduct treatment based on different interventions for enrolled
      subjects according to international and domestic standardized treatment procedures, including
      1.ERCP stone extraction, duodenal papillary pressure measurement, bile duct pressure
      measurement, and nasal bile duct placement; 2.ERCP+ duodenal papillary pressure measurement,
      biliopancreatic duct pressure measurement + nasopancreatic duct + determine whether
      nasopancreatic duct negative pressure attraction.Compare the advantages of two different
      treatment methods.This paper attempts to explore new treatment methods that are more
      conducive to the rehabilitation of patients and provides an important preliminary research
      basis for the future clinical application of standardized treatment.

      Patients from the people's hospital of Wuhan university were recruited and selected into
      groups. The incidence, recurrence rate, operation time and hospital stay of the two
      independent samples will be compared.
