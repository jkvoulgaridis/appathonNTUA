      A prospective comparative randomized single-centre non-inferiority trial. The purpose of this
      study is to compares of modified method of eversion carotid endarterectomy with standard
      eversion carotid endarterectomy for 3,6 and 12 months days after operation in patients with
      extensive atherosclerotic disease of carotid bifurcation

      Introduction. Performing eversion endarterectomy some difficulties arise. Firstly, it
      requires a great deal of coherence between the work of the surgeon and the first assistant,
      as well as a great experience of the latter. Secondly, in some cases, there are difficulties
      in visualizing the distal margin of the intima: in the absence of a rigid skeleton, the soft
      unchanged artery walls after removal of the plaque subside, making it difficult to visualize
      possible fragments of the intima. Thirdly, the cost of the error is high: with a random
      de-version, repeated eversion turns out to be impossible. It should be noted that the use of
      an eversion technique becomes difficult to implement, and sometimes impossible, with extended
      stenosis, since a very high allocation of the ICA is required, which increases the
      invasiveness of the operation and the difficulty of access. With prolonged stenosis, the
      carotid endarterectomy remains the option of choice. The modification used eversion carotid
      endarterectomy combines the advantages of both methods, and also eliminates the limitations
      of the carotid endarterectomy and eversion carotid endarterectomy.

      The aim of study. The purpose of this study is to compares of modified method of eversion
      carotid endarterectomy with standard eversion carotid endarterectomy for 3,6 and 12 months
      days after operation in patients with extensive atherosclerotic disease of carotid
      bifurcation
