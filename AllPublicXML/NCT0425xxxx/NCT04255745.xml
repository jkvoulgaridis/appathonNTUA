  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current prevention and treatment of high blood pressure (BP) in sarcopenia, by
      non-pharmacological approaches remain limited and are far from optimal. This randomized
      control intervention pilot study will provide new evidence of the unexplored relationship
      between muscle strength and high BP in sarcopenia, and experimentally test the effects of an
      evidence-based progressive resistance training intervention on BP, while also examining
      reversibility to identify muscle strength as a non-pharmacological target for BP control in
      older sarcopenic adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This premise of this K01 proposal is to address current gaps in the literature regarding the
      understanding of high blood pressure due to sarcopenia, and provide new evidence for the
      discernible relationship between low muscle strength and blood pressure in sarcopenia, and
      effective non-pharmaceutical treatment approaches. This study will evaluate the feasibility
      of recruitment, retention, implementation and adherence to an empirically-based progressive
      resistance training (PRT) intervention to test its effect on blood pressure in a targeted
      population of older adults with sarcopenia who are randomized (via block permuted scheme) to
      the PRT intervention. Built within this randomized control intervention design, the
      investigators will further explore reversibility to examine whether muscle strength serves as
      an intervention target for blood pressure control in sarcopenic adults, which will be more
      appropriately tested in subsequently well-powered R-level intervention studies.
      Physiologically plausible microvascular mechanisms by which the PRT impacts changes in blood
      pressure will also be explored.

    <description>muscle strength will be assessed using the 1 Repetition maximum test ( the maximum amount of weight a person can hold while performing an exercise safely and maintaining form. the 1RM will be tested on upper and lower body for a total of 6 exercises, as recommended by the American College of Sports Medicine. Changes in 1RM will be reevaluated to see if strength improves.

    <description>Microvessels in subcutaneous fat (SF) will be extracted from 10 intervention and 5 control subjects (total=15) and isolated for microvascular flow-induced vasodilation (FID).

The dose response curves to vasodialator will be measured (known as FID dose-response) will be the primary outcome.</description>

    <description>60 Intervention group will receive 12 weeks of supervised resistance training following the American Heart Association and American College of Sports Medicine guidelines for older adults. Exercises will include a mixture of upper-body and lower body strength exercises. Training load will be determined based on initial 1-repetition maximum tests (1-RM). Initial exercise load will start off at low resistance (40-50% 1RM) with more frequent repetitions per exercise, and will gradually increase weight load and intensity over the exercise training period.</description>
