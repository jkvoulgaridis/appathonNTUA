  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A total of 60 men (40 with a history of infertility and treatment with assisted reproduction
      and 20 infertile controls achieving conception naturally) will be asked to provide at least
      one semen sample each for conventional semen analysis including measurement of
      DNA-fragmentation and semen preparation with swim-up. The prepared semen sample will then
      analyzed by comprehensive microscopy analyses aiming at identifying distinct subpopulations
      of spermatozoa based on chromatin density and composition, mitochondrial and acrosome
      function and epigenetic markers. In addition, spermatozoa samples of selected individuals
      will be subjected to comprehensive analyses of the chromatin and RNA expression status using
      epigenomic approaches.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hitherto male infertility has been defined by conventional semen analysis only, which mainly
      consists of determining concentration, progressive mobility and morphology of spermatozoa.
      However, the diagnostic accuracy of conventional semen analysis is poor and has very limited
      relationship with the outcome of assisted reproductive medicine. Preliminary data suggest
      that differences in chromatin density and epigenetic status of sperm may be more relevant, in
      particular with respect to the growth and differentiation of early embryos.

      Chromatin density, morphology, mitochondrial status and epigenetic state in sperm of
      infertile men with disturbances of early embryo development in vitro will be compared with
      those of infertile men with normal embryo development and with fertile controls.

      Primary outcome:

      Features of chromatin density will be determined through staining of large numbers of
      spermatozoa. Differences in the staining results will be compared with known fertility
      outcome.

      Secondary outcome:

      Development of significant staining parameters towards the selection against sperm with
      reduced embryonic competence and/or in favor of sperm supporting embryonic development after
      assisted reproduction, thereby using flow cytometry and sorting (FACS) .
