  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effect of a supervised exercise program on paraspinal muscle
      morphology and function, as well as disability/function in patients with non-specific chronic
      low back pain. Half of the participants will do a targeted paraspinal muscle exercise
      program, while the other half will do a general exercise program.

    <measure>Change in12-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6-week, 12-week, 24-week</time_frame>
    <description>The 12-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) is the condensed form of the previous 36-item Short Form Health Survey and is used to assess health-related quality of life.The 12-item survey consists of 8 domains that assess both physical and mental health composite scores (PCS and MCS). While the SF-12 is weighted and summed to provide an interpretable scale for both the PCS and MCS. The score of the 12 questions can range from 0 (worst level of health) to 100 (highest level of health).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Index (ODI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6-week, 12-week, 24-week</time_frame>
    <description>The ODI is used to measure the patient's level of disability in relation to LBP. It is a 10-item scale in which each item is rated from 0-6. Higher scores are indicative of greater disability.</description>

    <measure>Change in The International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6-week, 12-week, 24-week</time_frame>
    <description>The IPAQ is a self-reported log of metabolic equivalent (MET)-minutes per week. The level of physical activity is rated either vigorous, moderate, walking and sitting and must be assigned to the right category. The number of minutes per category is then added up and assessed.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia (TSK)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6-week, 12-week, 24-week</time_frame>
    <description>The TSK measures pain-related fear in an individual through a 13-item scale. The scores range between 17 and 68 with increasing scores indicating a greater level of kinesiophobia.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Visual Numerical pain rating scale (NPR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6-week, 12-week, 24-week</time_frame>
    <description>The NRP for pain is a rating system from 0 to 10 with 0 being no pain and 10 worst pain imaginable.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in The Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6-week, 12-week, 24-week</time_frame>
    <description>The PCS is a 13-item questionnaire that assesses the participant's level of catastrophizing. Each item is rated from 0-4 for a possible total of 52. The higher the score, the greater the level of catastrophizing.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6-week, 12-week, 24-week</time_frame>
    <description>The HADS is a 14-item questionnaire used to assess a patient's level of depression and anxiety. Each item is rated from 0-3 with either depression or anxiety having scores between 0 and 21, with 21 being the highest level possible.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6-week, 12-week, 24-week</time_frame>
    <description>The ISI is a 7-item questionnaire used to assess sleep disturbances. Each item is rated from 0 to 4 and the total score is added. The higher the score, the greater the level of sleep disturbances.</description>
