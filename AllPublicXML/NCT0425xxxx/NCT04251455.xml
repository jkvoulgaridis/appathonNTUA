  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) diseases or dysfunctions affects many patients. Surgical
      treatment is planned when non-invasive interventions have failed. Still, much is not known
      regarding aetiology of TMJ diseases and how and why the disease develops over time. The study
      aims to investigate synovial tissue, synovial fluid and clinical characteristics for patients
      with TMJ diseases or dysfunctions designated for surgery. Patient samples and clinical
      variables will be analysed in relation to TMJ diagnosis and related to surgical outcome. The
      study is a cohort observational study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TMJ disc displacement is common, affecting 20-30% of the population. Some of these patients
      will eventually need health-care attention. Patients with TMJ osteoarthritis (OA) or chronic
      inflammatory arthritis (CIA) are not that common, prevalence numbers are lacking. These TMJ
      diseases or dysfunctions can severely affect the patients' well-being because of local pain,
      chewing problems, psychosocial impact, amongst others. Treatment is primarily non-invasive to
      its character where orthotic splint, physiotherapy, medication, or other treatments can be
      evaluated. Patients who do not respond to these efforts might have surgery. Arthroscopy is a
      minimal invasive intervention with a described success rate from 50-90%. From the patients',
      the society and the surgeons' point of view, better individual pre-operative prognostication
      is valuable. TMJ disc displacement, OA and CIA is not fully characterised in terms of
      aetiopathogenesis. There are studies investigating components of extra cellular matrix and
      cytokines TMJ. The multitude of proteins still not studied may contribute in an unknown
      fashion to new insights in aetiology and to new treatment opportunities. The aim of the study
      is to characterise synovial tissue, synovial fluid, and clinical parameters and relate them
      to the specific TMJ diagnosis but also to each others. A secondary aim is to relate the
      outcome of surgery to both clinical and tissue variables in order to determine if there are
      factors that might function as predictors of outcome. A tertiary aim is to investigate if
      patients who suddenly develops disc displacement without reduction (DDwoR) without any prior
      signs or symptoms from the TMJ differs in their tissue or clinical characteristics compared
      to patients who develops DDwoR after having prior signs or symptoms from the TMJ.

    <description>Patients with the diagnosis disc displacement without reduction (DDwoR), or disc displacement with reduction (DDwR), or osteoarthritis (OA), or chronic inflammatory arthritis (CIA) were designated to TMJ surgery. According to the Swedish national guidelines on TMJ surgery DDwoR, OA, and CIA patients had arthroscopy and DDwR had discectomy.</description>

    <description>Arthroscopic lysis and lavage: performed under general anaesthesia. Before initiation of arthroscopy synovial fluid was sampled with a push-and-pull method. The TMJ was investigated with an arthroscope during irrigation with sterile saline solution. Adhesions were addressed with a coblator. Synovial tissue biopsies were taken from the posterior attachment of the disc.
Discectomy without replacement: performed under general anaesthesia. Before initiation of surgery, synovial fluid was sampled as above described. During surgery synovial tissue biopsies were taken as described above.</description>

        Patients referred to the department of Craniofacial Diseases, Karolinska University
        Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden, because of disc displacement with reduction (DDwR), disc
        displacement without reduction (DDwoR), osteoarthritis, and chronic inflammatory arthritis
        (CIA) were eligible for inclusion. Written informed consent were mandatory. Diagnoses were

        a rheumatologist had to set the diagnosis. Apart from above mentioned diagnoses criteria
        for surgery were: visual analogue scale (VAS) value of ≥ 4 for TMJ pain or TMJ disability,
        and DDwoR patients had to have a maximal interincisal opening (MIO) of ≤ 35 mm.
