  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study was designed in a real-life setting to establish the feasibility, the safety
      and the activity of a supervised and combined Exercise Training (ET) program in adult and
      elderly lymphoma patients undergoing cancer-treatments.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible patients were assigned to the ET group. All the patients eligible for exercise but
      not partiticpating to the ET program because of logistical reasons, were considered as the
      control group. All clinical outcomes were assessed before exercise training (T0), 3 (T1) and
      6-months (T2) after the beginning of the exercise.
