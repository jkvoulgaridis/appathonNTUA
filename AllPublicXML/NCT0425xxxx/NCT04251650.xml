  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A new classification of periodontal diseases was created in 2018. the investigators want to
      know if this clinical classification is based, or not, on a biological reality. To do this,
      the investigators will collect data from the clinical examination (clinical assessment and
      radiological assessment) as well as non-invasive samples of subgingival plaque and crevicular
      gingival fluid (CGF). The subgingival plaque samples will be analyzed to define the
      microbiotic profiles of the patients and the CGF determined to define their inflammatory
      expression profiles. These results will then be linked to the diagnosis of severity of
      periodontitis.

      In the new classification of periodontal disease, the investigators will seek to know whether
      there is a specific bacterial signature associated with the severity of damage on the one
      hand, and the other hand, the investigators will search for cytokinic biomarkers which can be
      correlated with the severity of the damage.

      In this study, the investigators propose to include 25 patients with periodontitis stage I
      and II versus stage III and IV according to Chicago classification (2018)

    <description>for subgingival plaque sample, on three affected sites (PD&gt;3mm) and three healthy sites (PD≤3mm), after supra-gingival plaque removal, sterile endodontic paper points were inserted in selects pockets for 30s to collect the subgingival plaque. The material was transferred into eppendorf tube, one for affected samples and one for healthy samples.</description>
