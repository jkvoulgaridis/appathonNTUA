    <textblock>
      This trial collects information about factors that affect communication of genetic test
      results, decision-making, and access to genetic testing in women with hereditary
      gynecological cancers. Studying individuals who are positive for a genetic mutation and
      immediate biological family members (including a parent, full-sibling, or child) may help
      identify cancer genes and other persons at risk.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Identify and explore factors influencing the communication of genetic testing results from
      probands (patients with confirmed hereditary cancer predisposition syndrome) to their
      first-degree relatives. (Step 1) II. Identify and explore factors influencing decision making
      and pursuit of cascade testing among first-degree relatives of probands. (Step 1) III.
      Estimate the uptake of cascade testing by first-degree relatives of probands at a safety-net
      hospital and the uptake of cascade testing by first-degree relatives of probands at a
      comprehensive cancer center. (Step 2) IV. Estimate the frequency of reported factors that
      influence communication, decision-making, and pursuit of cascade testing among probands and
      their first-degree family members at a safety-net hospital and at a comprehensive cancer
      center. (Step 2) V. Explore similarities and differences in cascade genetic testing rates and
      reported barriers to cascade genetic testing of first-degree relatives at probands from a
      safety-net hospital and a comprehensive cancer center. (Step 2)

      OUTLINE:

      STEP I: Patients and first degree relatives participate in semi-structure, in-depth
      interviews about genetic testing over 45-60 minutes.

      STEP II: Patients and first degree relatives complete survey questionnaires over 20 minutes.

    <description>Will construct a model with no predictors and will calculate the probability of genetic testing using the model's intercept as well as calculate the 95% confidence interval of this probability. Will then test factors associated with testing rates (including site [Lyndon B. Johnson Hospital (LBJ) vs. MD Anderson (MDA)], socioeconomic, demographic, medical history, and determinants) by including these as independent variables in our GLMMs.</description>
