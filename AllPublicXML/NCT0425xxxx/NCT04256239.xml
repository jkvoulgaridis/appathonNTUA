  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We conducted a randomized, controlled trial of dignity therapy for terminally ill patients
      with the aim of reducing dignity-related distress and demoralization and improving spiritual
      well-being.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sample size assessment: A recent meta-analysis showed that dignity interventions reach on
      average effect sizes of -1.01 on emotional distress (Ho and Shin, 2014). Power analysis
      showed that with an alpha of 0.05 and a power of 0.80, we needed a sample of 26 participants
      to detect effect sizes of 1.01 and higher.

      Plan for missing data: Occasional missing values were imputed by calculating, for each
      participant, the average score for each subscale and then replaced.

      Statistical analysis plan: We conducted a 2 (group) X 3 (time [pre-treatment vs.
      post-treatment vs follow-up]) repeated measures multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA)
      for a set of variables

    <description>Dignity Therapy is a short-term psychotherapy aimed at improving patients' sense of personhood, purpose, meaning, and self-worth and reducing psychosocial and existential distress. Therapy sessions, lasting between 20 and 60 minutes, were offered at the patients' bedside and audiotaped, and were conducted by a trained psyco-oncologist. After each therapy session, the audiotaped interview data were transcribed verbatim by a different psycho-oncologist and edited and reshaped into a written narrative by an expert in DT over the course of the next two to three days. Once the editing process was completed, another session was held to allow the therapist to read the &quot;generativity document&quot; to the patient and to make any editorial changes the patient deemed necessary. The final version of the generativity document was given to the patient to bequeath it to individuals of their choosing</description>
