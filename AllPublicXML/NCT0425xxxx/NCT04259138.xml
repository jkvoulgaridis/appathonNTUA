  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Disease activity and response to therapy in ulcerative colitis (UC) can be assessed by a
      range of endpoints including symptoms, endoscopic mucosal activity, histological disease
      activity, and biomarkers. This study aims to determine the optimal treatment target, which is
      a research priority for the management of UC both to inform clinical practice and to help
      inform regulatory endpoints and targets for drug development.

      Participants with active UC will be randomized in a 2:3:5 ratio to 1 of 3 groups, each with a
      different treatment target. Treatment targets will be defined as:

        -  Group 1: corticosteroid-free symptomatic remission

        -  Group 2: corticosteroid-free endoscopic + symptomatic remission

        -  Group 3: corticosteroid-free histological + endoscopic + symptomatic remission

    <intervention_model_description>In this study, participants with active UC will be randomized in a 2:3:5 ratio to 1 of 3 treatment target groups. Participants will be assigned a treatment algorithm based on their existing UC treatment at time of entry. Treatment algorithms may include the use of vedolizumab. A key premise is that vedolizumab has a favorable safety profile and can be used to treat subjects who are in symptomatic remission but who have not attained endoscopic or histopathologic remission.
Participants will be assessed to determine it remission target is achieved at weeks 16, 32 and 48. If the participant has achieved their treatment target, they will continue that line of therapy. If the participant has not achieved their treatment target, treatment and/or dose escalation will be administered according to the algorithm.</intervention_model_description>
