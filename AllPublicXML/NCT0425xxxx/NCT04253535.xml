  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cervical artery dissection (CAD) accounts for about 2% of all strokes, and is a major cause
      of stroke in young people (about 15%). Many cases of CAD during pregnancy and puerperium have
      been described, suggesting that pregnancy and puerperium may be potential risk factors for
      CAD. The purpose of this study is to determine whether pregnancy and puerperium are also
      recurrence risk factors for CAD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, all women of childbearing age who had had a CAD between 2005 and 2017 are
      selected. Women are identified using the ICD10 diagnostic coding system. In addition, a text
      search with key words (&quot;cervical or carotid or vertebral dissection&quot;) has been created in a
      data warehouse of the University Hospital of Nantes.

      To determine the recurrence of CAD during pregnancy and puerperium, the participating women
      will be asked to answer to a questionnaire, by phone or mail. The questionnaire will be
      conducted by the same investigator, an experienced neurologist. Information about recurrence
      of CAD, number of pregnancies before and after the event will be recorded, as well as, the
      site of obstetrical monitoring, way of delivery, and management of antithrombotics, in case
      of further pregnancy. In case of no further pregnancy after the dissection, the reason will
      be explored.
