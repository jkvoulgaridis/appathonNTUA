  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective study will enroll and follow 60 loiasis patients with high worm burden to
      monitor the spontaneous release of filarial antigen in peripheral blood. This study will
      define the cross-reactive antigen profile of persons with spontaneous loiasis antigenemia,
      and determine whether it varies with time.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Global efforts to eradicate lymphatic filariasis (LF) depend on rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs)
      that detect Wuchereria bancrofti circulating filarial antigen but these tests are unreliable
      in African nations where Loa loa is co-endemic because they yield false-positive results in
      some individuals with loiasis. The goals of this project are to define the cross-reactive
      antigen profile of persons with spontaneous antigenemia, how it varies over time, and to
      determine which L. loa antigens in cross-reactive sera best distinguish loiasis
      cross-reactivity from LF.

      This prospective study will prospectively enroll 50 adults who presented with cross-reactive
      antigenemia at screening and 10 negative controls. Participants will followed for one year
      and tested every three months for persistence of antigenemia.

        The study will be conducted in the Okola health district (Lékié Division, Centre Region,
        Cameroon), situated about 40km northeast of Yaoundé, the political capital city of
        Cameroon. The Okola health district is highly endemic for loiasis. Participant will be
        recruited among those excluded from an Onchocerciasis study due to high Mf counts
        &gt;20,000/mL.
