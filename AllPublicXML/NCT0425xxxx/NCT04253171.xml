  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severely calcified coronary stenoses are difficult to treat with percutaneous coronary
      intervention (PCI) using current techniques and there is little specific evidence on how to
      best treat these cases. It is hypothesized that balloon lithoplasty is superior to
      conventional balloons for lesion preparation of severely calcified coronary lesions before
      stent implantation in terms of procedural failure and 1-year target vessel failure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Severely calcified coronary stenoses are difficult to treat with percutaneous coronary
      intervention (PCI) using current techniques. Severe calcifications make it difficult to
      sufficiently prepare lesions before stenting, to advance stents, and to achieve full stent
      expansion. There is increased risk of vessel dissection and perforation with angioplasty on
      severely calcified lesions, and long-term outcomes of PCI are adversely affected. Because
      severely calcified lesions are often excluded from interventional studies, there is little
      specific evidence on how to best treat these cases. Only a few randomized studies have
      specifically explored this question, focusing on the use of rotational atherectomy

      Recently, the technique of balloon-based lithoplasty was made commercially available. With
      this technique, calcifications are cracked with the creation of high-frequency pressure
      oscillations in a special angioplasty balloon. Standard techniques are used to deliver and
      dilate the balloon. The method was developed for treatment of otherwise non-dilatable
      lesions, and first reported results have been encouraging. The lithoplasty device used in the
      current study (Shockwave IVL, Shockwave Medical, CA, USA) has received CE-mark and
      post-approval safety has recently been confirmed for treatment of severely calcified coronary
      lesions in patients.

      Besides obvious benefits in non-dilatable lesions for which interventional cardiologists have
      few other options, it is possible this technique could change the way all severely calcified
      lesions are treated. Balloon lithoplasty could theoretically crack plates of calcium in the
      vessel wall in an orderly fashion, which could lead to safer and quicker preparation of
      severely calcified lesions. Furthermore, a better softening of vessel wall calcium could
      allow full and symmetric expansion of coronary stents, which could lead to better long-term
      stent patency.

    <description>The lithoplasty balloon should be utilized as early as possible. If it is necessary for passage of the lithoplasty balloon, the lesion may first be predilated with an undersized conventional balloon, non-compliant or semi-compliant. If passage of the lithoplasty balloon is still not possible, it is recommended to perform rotational atherectomy with a small burr size.
The lithoplasty balloon is sized 1:1 to reference diameter. Lithoplasty is performed with the balloon dilated at 4 atmospheres, and 10 shocks are delivered, after which the balloon is expanded to 6 atmospheres for 30 seconds, and then deflated. Up to 8 series of balloon expansion/deflation can be delivered in this manner if necessary, and several balloons may be used for long lesions.</description>

    <description>Lesion preparation is performed starting with conventional balloons, non-compliant or semi-compliant. Unless fully satisfactory dilatation is achieved with conventional balloons, it is recommended to also use modified balloons (scoring balloons, cutting balloons). If balloons cannot be passed or if dilatation is inadequate, the lesion may first be predilated with an undersized conventional, non-compliant, or semi-compliant balloon. If necessary, rotational atherectomy with a small burr size can be used to facilitate adequate balloon preparation.</description>
