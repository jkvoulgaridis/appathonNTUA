    <textblock>
      In patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery, the relationship between
      neurocognitive changes seen in the early period and brain-induced neurotrophic factor serum
      levels will be investigated.

      Although postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POKD) is the most common neurological
      complication in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery, its
      pathophysiology is still not fully understood. However, the quality of this dysfunction has
      not been properly measured. In addition to clinical tests, biomarkers are often used to
      detect the presence of POKD. In this study, it was aimed to evaluate the relationship between
      intraoperative and postoperative brain-derived neurotrophic factor serum levels and POKD in
      patients undergoing CABG surgery.

      This prospective observational study is planned to include 30 adult patients aged 40-90
      years. Patients with stroke history, neurodegenerative disease, seizure history, alcohol use,
      general anxiety, hearing deficit, unilateral carotid artery stenosis greater than 70%, and
      carotid artery bilateral stenosis greater than 50% will be excluded from the study.

      This study aimed to determine perioperative changes in serum brain-derived neurotrophic
      factor levels in patients undergoing CABG surgery.
