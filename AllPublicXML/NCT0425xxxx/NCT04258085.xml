    <textblock>
      This observational study evaluates scale-up of breast cancer early detection programs in
      Rwanda. Specifically investigators will examine patient volume, service delivery,
      loss-to-follow-up rates, and cancer detection rates noted following implementation of 2
      different early detection strategies. Investigators will also examine the impact of an
      electronic medical record for patient tracking on lost-to-follow-up rates.

    <textblock>
      Investigators previously conducted a cluster randomized controlled trial of a clinician
      training program to facilitate prompt evaluation of women with breast symptoms in one rural
      district of Rwanda. Subsequently, Rwanda Biomedical Centre (RBC) has scaled up the curriculum
      in 3 districts, adapting the program to integrate CBE screening into a cervical cancer
      screening initiative. Preliminary results from this scaleup have showed a lower cancer
      detection rate and relatively high rates of loss-to-follow-up among patients referred from
      health centers to the hospital. In this study, we will evaluate implementation of an
      electronic medical record (EMR) in health centers to facilitate patient tracking and
      communication, and assess trends in loss-to-follow-up following EMR implementation.
      Additionally, RBC will implement an early diagnosis approach (focused on symptomatic women,
      and utilizing the EMR) to 5 new districts. Investigators will assess patient volume,
      services, diagnoses, and loss to follow up in rollout of the early diagnosis approach outside
      of a trial setting and using the EMR.
