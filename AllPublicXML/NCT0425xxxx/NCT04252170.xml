  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research project is intended to provide information pertaining to the feasibility of the
      BrightArm Compact robotic rehabilitation system for patients early sub-acute post Cerebral
      Vascular Accident. The aims are to: a) determine clinical benefit to motor and cognitive
      function as well as mood; 2) to ascertain technology acceptance by patients and therapists.
      The experimental training consists of 12 integrative arm/hand and cognitive training by
      playing therapeutic games. Participants are evaluated pre-and post-intervention and provide
      subjective evaluation of the system.

      This study targets participants, who had suffered a first stroke recently, and who may or may
      not have been diagnosed with mild cognitive impairments or dementia (including Alzheimer's
      disease). It is important to find out if these improvements can be obtained with the computer
      game-based integrative (motor-cognitive) bilateral rehabilitation developed by Bright Cloud
      International Corp, and if these gains transfer to daily activities.

      Specific aims are:

        -  BAC technology acceptance;

        -  improvement in motor function for the upper extremity;

        -  strengthening of shoulder and fingers;

        -  increased active (self initiated) range of motion for shoulder, arms and fingers;

        -  improved independence in activities of daily living;

        -  improvement in cognitive areas of memory, attention and decision making;

        -  improved mood (as in reduced depression severity);
