  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/Ib trial studies the side effects and best dose of CB-839 HCl when given
      together with sapanisertib in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer that has
      spread to other places in the body (advanced). CB-839 HCl and sapanisertib may stop the
      growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of glutaminase inhibitor CB-839 hydrochloride
      (CB-839 HCl) (telaglenastat) in combination with MLN0128 (sapanisertib) and determine the
      recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of the combination.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. II. To examine preliminary efficacy of CB-839
      HCl (telaglenastat) and MLN0128 (sapanisertib) in squamous cell lung cancers (LSCC) and in
      select, molecularly-defined non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cohorts.

      IIa. To evaluate the objective response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), and
      disease control rate (DCR) of patients treated with CB-839 HCl (telaglenastat) and MLN0128
      (sapanisertib).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To correlate genomic and metabolomic signatures with response. II. To evaluate metabolic
      response (18Glutamine [GLN]-positron emission tomography [PET]/computed tomography [CT];
      18Fluorodeoxyglucose [FDG]-PET/CT) in NSCLC tumors treated with CB-839 HCl (telaglenastat)
      and MLN0128 (sapanisertib) in the dose expansion.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of glutaminase inhibitor CB-839 hydrochloride.

      Patients receive glutaminase inhibitor CB-839 hydrochloride orally (PO) twice daily (BID) and
      sapanisertib PO once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up quarterly.

                            contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence)
                            prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation.

                            her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her
                            treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this
                            protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the
                            study, for the duration of study participation, and 4 months after
                            completion of CB-839 HCl (telaglenastat) administration

             eligible

        Exclusion Criteria:

             receiving any medications or substances that are substrates of CYP2C9 are eligible,
             but should use caution with substrates that have a narrow therapeutic index. As part
             of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the
             risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be

             treatment of the mother with CB-839 HCl (telaglenastat), breastfeeding should be
             discontinued if the mother is treated with CB-839 HCl (telaglenastat). These potential
             risks may also apply to MLN0128 (sapanisertib)

                  replacement

               -  Medically significant (symptomatic) bradycardia

               -  History of arrhythmia requiring an implantable cardiac defibrillator

               -  Baseline prolongation of the rate-corrected QT interval (QTc) (e.g., repeated

             of study drug or who require treatment with PPIs throughout the trial or those who are
             taking H2 receptor antagonists within 24 hours of the first dose of study drug

          -  Previous treatment with PI3K, AKT, dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors, TORC1/2 inhibitors or
             TORC1 inhibitors

          -  Patients with known history or current symptoms of cardiac disease, or history of
             treatment with cardiotoxic agents, should have a clinical risk assessment of cardiac
             function using the New York Heart Association Functional Classification. To be
             eligible for this trial, patients should be class 2B or better
