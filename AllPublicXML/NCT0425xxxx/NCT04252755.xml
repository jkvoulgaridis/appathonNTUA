  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of neurofeedback training on measures
      of cognitive control and alcohol motivation among young adults who drink alcohol on a regular
      basis. Neurofeedback is a cognitive training technique that uses portable
      electroencephalography (EEG) technology to adjust brain activity through immediate sensory
      feedback. This study is using a type of EEG device called a MuseTM headset that monitors
      ongoing brain activity and synchronizes this information with a mindfulness training app on a
      mobile device. This study is a pilot study to examine the feasibility and effects of
      neurofeedback training in a sample of young adults. Future studies may use similar protocols
      with people who have substance use disorders or other mental health disorders.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The NFB studies conducted to date have utilized a wide range of methodologies and NFB
      training protocols. The outcome measures of NFB efficacy have also varied widely. As
      mentioned above, the studies also used expensive, non-portable equipment which may limit the
      application of NFB in treatment settings. This study seeks to address these limitations by
      using a commercially-available neurotechnology, the Museâ„¢ headband by InteraXon (Toronto, ON,
      Canada) and using their standard NFB protocol built into the device application. This will
      maximize the standardization and portability of the NFB as essentially an &quot;out of the box&quot;
      intervention. The outcome measures will also capture multiple relevant domains, including
      clinical outcomes (e.g., drinking motivation) and neurocognitive performance (e.g., cognitive
      control / response inhibition).

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of NFB training on measures of
      cognitive control and alcohol motivation among young adults who engage in heavy episodic
      drinking (defined as exceeding 4+/5+ drinks per occasion for men/women).

      The study will examine whether NFB reduces motivation/attention and craving for alcohol and
      attentional bias to alcohol-related cues. The primary outcome will be assessed by changes in
      the alcohol purchase task and approach/avoidance task, which participants will complete pre-
      and post-NFB training.

      A secondary outcome is to determine whether NFB results in transfer of heightened
      fronto-cortical activity to improvements on general executive functioning following 8
      sessions of NFB training. The secondary outcome will be assessed via changes in
      neurocognitive tasks assessing behavioural inhibition, risky decision making, and executive
      functioning, all of which will be administered pre- and post-NFB training.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Alcohol motivation</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days</time_frame>
    <description>Alcohol demand will be assessed via a hypothetical purchase task measuring self-reported consumption of alcohol across a range of prices. Primary dependent measure of this task is the amount of alcohol purchased and money spent.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Alcohol approach/avoidance bias</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days</time_frame>
    <description>Approach-avoidance bias will be assessed via an implicit approach/avoidance task involving pushing or pulling images closer/farther away using a joystick. Primary dependent measure from this task is latency of response to alcohol vs. neutral images for the approach and avoidance conditions.</description>

    <measure>Alcohol craving</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective alcohol craving will be assessed via a visual analog scale (0-100, with 100 equal to maximum craving)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Behavioural inhibition</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days</time_frame>
    <description>Behavioural inhibition will be assessed via computerized task of inhibitory control (go/no-go task) requiring suppression of inappropriate behavioural responses to &quot;no-go&quot; cues. Primary dependent measure is the percentage of correct trials and percentage of inhibitory failures</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Risky decision-making</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days</time_frame>
    <description>Risky decision making will be assessed via a Balloon Analogue Risk Task involving pumping a hypothetical balloon with an unknown air capacity. Each pump results in greater points earned, but a popped balloon results in loss of all accumulated points. Primary dependent variable from this task is the total number of pumps and number of exploded balloons. Higher values for each variable reflect greater risk taking</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Interference control</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days</time_frame>
    <description>Interference control will be assessed via the Erikson Flanker Task involving making a behavioural response to a central stimulus (left/right arrow) that is flanked by arrows that either point in same direction (congruent) or opposite direction (incongruent). Primary dependent variable is the percentage of correct trials in congruent vs incongruent conditions.</description>
