  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Achieving high accuracy and precision in ocular biometry has become primordial for cataract
      surgery, due to the shift of cataract surgery from a rehabilitation procedure to a refractive
      one.

      Aim of this study is to determine the repeatability of ocular biometric parameters obtained
      using three biometry devices, two ss-OCT biometers and an OLCR device.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Accurate and repeatable biometric measurements are essential in providing an optimal
      refractive outcome.

      ss-OCT biometry uses a tunable wavelength laser source to scan the eye, this technology
      showing its superiority through better signal-to-noise ratio, the wavelength light source
      being projected into the eye, one at a time; thus improving tissue penetration.

      This a prospective observational study that would include patients which attended
      pre-surgical examination. A written informed consent will be obtained from each patient.

      Only one eye from each patient will be included in the study. All patients included in the
      study will undergo biometric measurements in a random fashion with the three devices
      (IOLMaster 700, Lenstar LS 700 and Anterion Heildelberg). Each patient will be measured three
      times with each device and between the measurements they will be asked to blink or keep their
      eyes closed for tear film recovery and to avoid fatigue. Scans that pass the quality
      requirement of each device will be taken for analysis.
