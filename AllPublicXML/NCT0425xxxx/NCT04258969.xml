  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of completing a low-moderate
      intensity pedaling session concurrent to chemotherapy treatment for colorectal cancer.
      Secondary objectives for this study consist of evaluating the role of pedaling on sarcopenia
      rates, quality of life markers, chemotherapy side effects, rate of hospital admissions, and
      treatment delays.

    <time_frame>12-24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The number of completed pedaling sessions as well as the ability of patients to meet goal pedaling intensities will be evaluated.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>12-24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life markers will be assessed using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer [EORTC] QLQ - CR 29 at baseline and following their last chemotherapy treatment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sarcopenia Rates</measure>
    <time_frame>12-24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The presence of sarcopenia is best defined by evaluating muscle mass, muscle strength, and physical performance. CT scans will be obtained at time of diagnosis (pre-surgery), post-surgery (pre-chemotherapy), and following chemotherapy completion. Patient's CT scans will be uploaded to a medical image analysis software (SliceOmatic) which allows for the evaluation of body composition. Within 2-4 weeks of the post-surgery and chemotherapy completion CT scans, muscular strength and physical performance will be measured via grip strength tests and Timed- Get-Up and Go tests, respectively.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Symptom Severity</measure>
    <time_frame>12-24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A questionnaire on chemotherapy side effects (Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale) will be gathered at baseline, during chemotherapy cycles 3, 6, and/or 12, and following completion of chemotherapy treatment to measure severity of chemotherapy-related symptoms.</description>

    <description>During the first 2 hours of their chemotherapy infusions, participants will pedaling for 30 minutes using a stationary cycle ergometer. Participants will be allowed to determine their pedaling intensity and cadence, however, will be encouraged to reach the established goal intensity level. Additionally, subjects will complete both a physical activity questionnaire (International Physical Activity Questionnaire) and a quality of life questionnaire (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ - CR 29) at baseline and following their last chemotherapy treatment. A questionnaire on chemotherapy side effects (Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale) will be gathered at baseline, during chemotherapy cycles 3, 6, and/or 12, and following completion of chemotherapy treatment. Lastly, muscular strength and physical performance will be measured via grip strength tests and TGUG tests within 2-4 weeks of the post-surgery and chemotherapy completion CT scans.</description>
