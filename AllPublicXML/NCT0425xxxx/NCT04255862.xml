  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to compare the pharmacokinetics (PK) of bimekizumab when
      administered subcutaneously (sc) as 1x2 mL versus 2x1 mL, using a bimekizumab-safety syringe
      presentation or bimekizumab-auto-injector presentation, in healthy study participants.

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE could therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.</description>

    <description>A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:
Results in death
Is life-threatening
Requires in patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect
Is an infection that requires treatment parenteral antibiotics
Other important medical events which based on medical or scientific judgement may jeopardize the patients, or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the above</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Study participant must be ≥18 years and ≤65 years of age inclusive, at the time of
             signing the informed consent

          -  Study participants who are overtly healthy as determined by medical evaluation
             including medical history, physical examination, vital signs, 12-lead
             electrocardiogram (ECG), and laboratory tests, during the Screening Visit

          -  Body weight minimum of 50 kg for male and 45 kg for female study participants and a
             maximum of 100 kg for all study participants, and body mass index (BMI) within the
             range 18 to 32 kg/m^2 (inclusive) at the Screening Visit

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Study participant has any medical or psychiatric condition that, in the opinion of the

             vaccines are allowed but nasal influenza vaccination is not permitted). Live vaccines
             are not allowed during the study or for 20 weeks after the dose of the investigational
             medicinal product (IMP)

          -  Study participant has previously participated in this study or the study participant
