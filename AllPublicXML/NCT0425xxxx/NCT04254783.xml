  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a type of inflammatory bowel disease that causes inflammation and
      bleeding from the lining of the rectum and colon (large intestine).Crohn's disease (CD) is a
      long-lasting condition causing inflammation that can affect any part of the gut. CD may cause
      tiredness, loose stools with or without bleeding, abdominal pain, weight loss, and fever.
      This study will evaluate the effect of repeated infusions of risankizumab on the
      pharmacokinetics of sensitive probe substrates of Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes in
      participants with moderately to severely active UC or CD.

      Risankizumab is an investigational drug being developed to treat trial participants with
      inflammatory diseases such as UC and CD. The study is split into two periods. In Period 1,
      participants will receive single oral doses of CYP sensitive probes and in Period 2,
      participants will receive risankizumab followed by single oral doses of CYP sensitive probes.
      Around 20 adult participants with moderately to severely active CD or UC will be enrolled in
      the study across multiple sites worldwide.

      Participants will receive risankizumab by intravenous (IV) infusion every four weeks over 71
      days

      There will be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their
      standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the course of the study at a
      hospital or clinic. The effect of the treatment will be checked by medical assessments, blood
      tests and checking for side effects.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of any clinically significant sensitivity or allergy to any medication or
             food.

          -  History of or active medical condition(s) or surgical procedure(s) that might affect
             gastrointestinal motility, pH, or absorption (e.g., celiac disease, gastroparesis,
             cholecystectomy, vagotomy)
