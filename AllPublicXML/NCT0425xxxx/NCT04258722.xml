  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More infants die in Alabama every year than the majority of other states in the United
      States. Some of these deaths may occur at delivery due to providers with limited experience
      with neonatal resuscitation performing the resuscitation. Using low-cost telecommunications
      technology or telemedicine (similar to FaceTime), a highly trained neonatologist in one part
      of the state can assist the providers with resuscitating a baby in another part of the state.
      However, few studies have compared resuscitation in person to resuscitation through
      telemedicine. This randomized trial will evaluate teleneonatology in a simulated environment
      by comparing resuscitation performance of trainees with and without the aid of
      teleneonatology.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple studies have evaluated telemedicine using simulation1-3 but the level of evidence is
      low. In a previous simulation study wherein pediatric residents and respiratory therapists
      were assigned to either bedside resuscitation or video assisted resuscitation facilitated by
      a neonatologist, the time to effective ventilation was decreased in the video assisted
      resuscitation group. However, providers were not randomized and more providers in the bedside
      resuscitation group were at a lower level of training and had attended fewer neonatal
      resuscitations. Additionally, the facilitating neonatologists were aware of the clinical
      scenario limiting the study's generalizability to real time teleneonatology.1 In this
      proposal randomization of care providers will reduce selection bias between resuscitation
      arms, facilitators of teleneonatal resuscitation will be blinded to clinical scenarios, and
      bedside resuscitation by an experienced provider will be compared to teleneonatal
      resuscitation.

      Integration of telemedicine into clinical care is highly resource dependent. It requires real
      time, high fidelity communication with a low failure rate at multiple sites as well as rapid
      connectivity given the time sensitivity of neonatal resuscitation. Previous feasibility
      studies using teleneonatology reported audio and video quality unusable to nearly 20% of
      consultations.4 Another study comparing different telemedicine technologies found lower
      reliability and audio-video quality with wireless tablets compared to a wired cart.5 Given
      the multitude of logistical considerations, this proposal will further evaluate
      teleneonatology's efficacy in both a simulated and real world environment and compare the
      audio and visual fidelity of both low and higher cost technologies in the context of
      teleneonatal resuscitation.

      The objective of this aim is to utilize randomized trial design to compare teleneonatal to
      bedside resuscitation. We hypothesize that resuscitation facilitated with teleneonatology but
      not performed by an experienced care provider is noninferior to bedside resuscitation
      performed by an experienced care provider.
