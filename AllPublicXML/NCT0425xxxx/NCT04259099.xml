    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the adaptation and validity of the Quality of Life
      Questionnaire of the European Foundation for Osteoporosis-31 in patients with osteoporosis.
      Thus, to present a scale that will help us analyze the psychometric properties of patients
      with osteoporosis to the use of the Turkish people .

      Osteoporosis has become an important public health problem due to low bone mass, decreased
      bone strength and increased risk of fractures. Today, the measurement of quality of life
      plays an important role in the approach to diseases. Quality of Life Questionnaire of the
      European Foundation for Osteoporosis-41 (QUALEFFO-41) has been used for many years as a
      well-established and fully self-administered questionnaire. In the following years, a shorter
      and more practical version was needed because the QUALEFFO-41 contains many questions and
      takes a long time. For this reason, the questionnaire was updated in 2006 and the version of
      QUALEFFO-31 was made and the validity of the current questionnaire was shown. The aim of this
      study is to conduct the reliability and validity study of Turkish version of QUALEFFO-31 and
      to evaluate the power of the questionnaire to distinguish patients with osteoporosis.

    <description>SF-36 is a self-assessment instrument. It consists of eight domains: bodily pain, physical functioning, social functioning, general health, mental health, vitality, and role restrictions due to physical and emotional problems.SF-36 is scored from 0 to 100. 0 indicated poor health status and 100 indicated good health status.</description>

    <description>QUALEFFO-31 is a self-assessment instrument. It consists of three domains: pain,physical function and a mental function. QUALEFFO-31 is scored from 0 to 100. Domain scores were calculated by summing the scores of questions included in the domain and submitting the sum to a linear transformation to a scale of 100. Zero indicated good health status and 100 indicated poor health status.</description>
