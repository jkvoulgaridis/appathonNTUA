      This exploratory laboratory only study will assess alterations in immune cells in blood
      samples that may be responsive to an inflammatory mediator in asthma called IL-33 (Innate
      lymphoid type 2 cells, basophils and Th2 cells) in response to treatment with ANB020/placebo
      (a drug that targets IL-33, in the linked clinical trial ANB020-004). The study will involve
      additional 10ml blood draws on scheduled study visits in the ANB020-004 clinical trial at
      baseline, 1 week, 5 weeks, 18 weeks (4 visits total). Total number of subjects is 24 at the
      same 3 participating UK sites as the main linked clinical trial ANB020-004.

      Blood samples will be sent on the same day to a flow cytometry laboratory at the NIHR
      Leicester Biomedical Research Centre (BRC) - Respiratory. A dedicated post doctoral, trained
      laboratory scientist will analyse the blood samples for the required cell types using a
      technique called flow cytometry - this technique identifies cell surface and intercellular
      markers, that together provide a unique cell identity. The experiments will be supervised by
      a senior research scientist and flow cytometrist Professor Dave Cousins, at the University of
      Leicester and results of the experiments will be fed back to AnaptysBio (the linked clinical
      trial Sponsor). Professor Salman Siddiqui at the University of Leicester will oversee the
      clinical conduct of this laboratory study and act as the Chief Investigator. Professor
      Siddiqui is also the local site lead Principal Investigator at Leicester for the linked
      ANB020-004 clinical trial described below.

      The linked study (ANB020-004) is a Double-blind Placebo-Controlled Proof of Concept Study to
      Investigate ANB020 (a drug that targets an inflammatory mediator called IL-33) Activity in
      Adult Patients with Severe Eosinophilic Asthma. The expected duration of the study is up to
      141 days. Screening period of 7-14 days and treatment and follow-up period of 127 days.
