    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men and women, aged 21-50 years, medically healthy upon physical examination and
             laboratory testing

          -  Recent experience (last 90 days) consuming at least 4 (women) or 5 (men) standard
             drinks in a single occasion. This ensures that customary drinking levels are not
             exceeded during the study.

          -  Social drinkers will have no current or past diagnosis of alcohol use disorder (AUD)
             or other substance use disorder

          -  Subjects with AUD will have a current DSM-5 diagnosis of AUD, confirmed by structured
             clinical interview for DSM-5 (SCID-5) criteria in concurrence with the PI

          -  Subjects with AUD will also meet National Institute for Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism
             (NIAAA) guidelines for heavy episodic drinking: males will drink &gt;14 drinks per week;
             females will drink &gt;7 drinks per week.

          -  Able to read and write English; Willing and able to provide voluntary, written
             informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Current significant medical conditions, such as neurological, cardiovascular,
             endocrine, renal, liver, or thyroid pathology, including chronic obstructive pulmonary
             disease and anemia

          -  Past or current neurological disorder or disorders affecting the brain, including but
             not limited to multiple sclerosis, history of stroke, brain tumors, traumatic brain
             injury with loss of consciousness, seizures

          -  Past or current psychiatric disorder (DSM-5 diagnosis, assessed by SCID-5), including
             substance use disorder (other than alcohol or tobacco use disorders), and past or
             current psychotic symptoms

          -  Subjects whose previous alcohol experience does not exceed the targeted alcohol dose
             (4 standard drinks for women, 5 standard drinks for men, all during the same
             occasion).

          -  Social drinkers will not exceed NIAAA guidelines for heavy episodic drinking: males
             will drink ≤14 drinks per week; females will drink ≤7 drinks per week.

          -  Participants with any significant current medical conditions that would contraindicate
             the consumption of alcohol, such as history of neurological trauma or diseases,
             seizures, delirium or hallucinations, hepatic, or other unstable medical conditions.

          -  Current use or regular use in the past 6 months of any prescription, psychoactive, or
             herbal medications (e.g., antidepressants, antipsychotics, anxiolytics, ecstasy,
             marijuana, cocaine), with no current drug use confirmed by urine toxicology. No
             subject will be asked to stop taking medication to participate in the study

          -  Women who are pregnant or nursing, or fail to use one of the following methods of
             birth control unless she or her partner is surgically sterile: hormone contraceptives
             (oral, implant, injection, patch, or ring), contraceptive sponge, double barrier
             (diaphragm or condom plus spermicide), or intrauterine device

          -  Contraindications to MRI, such as claustrophobia or metal in their body

          -  Subjects whose participation would cause them to exceed yearly radiation limits for
             research subjects

          -  Subjects will be excluded for any infection or vaccination in the previous month or
             regular use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (to avoid these factors from
             influencing the 18-kDa Translocator protein (TSPO) signal)

          -  Individuals likely to exhibit significant alcohol withdrawal during the study.
             Specifically, we will exclude subjects who a) have a history of perceptual
             distortions, seizures, delirium, or hallucinations upon withdrawal or b) have a score
             of &gt; 8 on the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment scale at intake

          -  Individuals who are classified as &quot;low binders&quot; for the rs6971 polymorphism (&lt;10% of
             the population). This genetic polymorphism has a well-characterized effect on
             [11C]PBR28 affinity for TSPO. Homozygotes for the minor allele have negligible
             specific binding, and are therefore excluded.
