      cavity. The intervention is a moisturizing gel containing 10% aloe vera jelly, 10% coconut
      oil, 3% peppermint essential oil, 3% carboxy methyl cellulose, 10% propylene glycol, and 0.1%
      potassium sorbate and water up to 100%. The control is also a moisturizing gel contained
      3%carboxy methyl cellulose, 3% peppermint essential oil, 10% propylene glycol, 0.1% potassium
      sorbate, and water up to 100%.

      Both gels had similar appearance, color, smell, and weight. They will be produced by
      professional pharmacist in faculty of pharmacy, Al Azher university, Cairo, Egypt.it was
      taken from previous study with modification in percentage of aloe vera and adding coconut
      oil. Both gels will be applied topically in all surfaces of oral mucosa 4 times daily after
      eating and before sleep . The same individuals will deliver the trial interventions in all
      study groups, both gels will be used for 2 weeks then washout period for 7 days then cross
      over them. Modification of life style will be promoted as daily tooth brushing, hydration
      with sufficient amounts of water, eating fibrous food as fruits and vegetables, avoid any
