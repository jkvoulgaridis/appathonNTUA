    <textblock>
      The patients who consulted to the geriatric outpatient clinic between 2018 and 2019 were
      included in the study. The inclusion criterions were being at or over the age of 65 and
      diagnosed with osteoporosis according to WHO criteria. Exclusion criteria include vertebral
      fracture due to known accidental traumas, history of drug therapy in the past year
      (biphosphonate, estrogen replacement therapy, glucocorticoids ), history of co-morbidities as
      malignancy, radiotherapy or chemotherapy, renal failure, hyperthyroidism, primer
      hyperparathyroidism, rheumatic disease or adrenal diseases.

      Initially, a demographic form including age, sex, comorbidities, weight, height was filled by
      the participants. Body mass index (BMI, ratio of height and weight, expressed as kg/m2)
      calculated. Patients waist and hip circumference was measured (cm).

      Fat percentage and skeletal muscle mass (SMM) was calculated by using bioimpedance analysis
      (BIA) (Tanita TBF 300; Tanita Corp., Tokyo, Japan). Skeletal muscle index (SMI) was
      calculated from BIA-based skeletal muscle mass with a formula as SMM/height [m2] [8]. ABSI is
      measured as waist circumference (m) / (BMI(kg)2/3x Height(m)5/6) [4].

      Osteoporosis was evaluated by using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). According to the
      T-scores calculated from femur neck (FN) and lumbar spine (LS), subjects divided into 3
      groups as following: a) normal: T-score is greater than -1 SD, b) osteopenia: T-score is
      between -1 and -2.5 SD, c) osteoporosis: T-score is lower than -2.5 SD.

      Physical activity levels of patients were evaluated with The Rapid Assessment of Physical
      Activity (RAPA) aerobic assessment [9]. Patients divided into 5 groups as following: 1 =
      sedentary, 2 = underactive, 3 = regular underactive (light activities), 4 = regular
      underactive, and 5 = regular active).

      The study protocol was approved by the ethics committee (2018/0478) and all participants gave
      written informed consent.
