  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Forty-five participants with facial AV were assigned randomly to three groups of fifteen
      subjects each. Each group received various therapies. Group A (Study group A) had received
      both NBUB and akne-Mycin; Group B( study group B) had received Red LLLT and akne-Mycin and
      group C (Control group) received only akne-Mycin cream. All 45 participants are tested at the
      initial treatments, after 4 weeks and after 8 weeks by the acne count, the intensity scale
      and the photographic test.

    <textblock>
      Forty-five patient (18 male and 27 female) were recruited on a referral basis from the
      department of dermatology at Kasr Al- aini Teaching Hospital. Firstly, an interview was held
      with each participant to determine gender, age, skin type, acne severity and medical
      prescriptions,Randomization was performed by selecting numbers from opaque envelopes
      containing numbers that were chosen by a random number generator, selection was done by an
      independent person.

      Patients in group (A) received a program of NBUB, ( DIXWELL EMLY 98 -ABRP 64 ,made in France)
      wavelength 311 to 313nm , in addition to topical aknemycin medications. Each treatment lasts
      one to eight minutes. The treatments were given three times a week. for 8 weeks.Participants
      in-group (B) received a program of R-LLLT that was conducted through laser equipment InGaAs
      (630 nm, 10 mW, continuous) (RIKTA, Russia) with fluence 12 J/cm2, two sessions per week for
      8 weeks .Patients in the three groups were asked to apply topical erythromycin cream 2%
      (Akne-Mycin- Egypt) two times per day on the entire face from the beginning to the end of the
      treatment period .Evaluation was based on formal counts of active lesions (papule and
      pustule).facial photographs using a digital camera (PANASONIC, Tokyo, Japan). and Five-point
      scale of investigators assessment that reflect lesion count improved percentage.

The face is washed thoroughly with warm water and gentle soap, rinse well, and pat dry, patients were advised to wait 30 minutes before applying the aknemycin. To help keep new pimples from breaking out, the aknemycin was applied to the whole area usually affected by acne, not just to the pimples themselves</description>
