      This pilot study is configured as a non-inferiority comparison of Performance Status 2
      patients with Performance Status 0-1 patients, with the goal of demonstrating non-inferiority
      in terms of efficacy (progression-free survival, overall survival) and safety (rates of
      adverse events, quality of life) when treating Performance Status 2 patients with the same
      first-line immunotherapy-based regimen as Performance Status 0-1 patients.

      Primary Objective: To demonstrate that proportion of Performance Status 2 participants with
      progression-free survival at 12 weeks is not inferior to the corresponding proportion of
      Performance Status 0-1 patients.

      Secondary Objective(s)

        -  To demonstrate that incidence of treatment-related adverse events at 12 weeks in the
           Performance Status 2 group is not higher than that occurring in the Performance Status
           0-1 groups.

        -  To demonstrate that change in overall quality of life/global health status at 12 weeks
           is not inferior in the Performance Status 2 group compared to the change in the
           Performance Status 0-1 group.

        -  To demonstrate that proportion of participants with deterioration in lung-cancer
           specific symptoms at 12 weeks in the Performance Status 2 group is not higher than the
           corresponding proportion in the Performance Status 0-1 group.

    <description>Using the total score of the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30), a 30-item questionnaire for functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, social), symptom scales (fatigue, pain, and nausea and vomiting), global health status and quality of life scale, also several single-item symptom measures. Scoring scale : 1 (Not at all) to 4 (Very much), 1 (Very poor) to 7 (Excellent). Minimum score 0, maximum score 100. For functional and global quality of life scales, higher scores mean a better level of functioning. For symptom-oriented scales, a higher score means more severe symptoms.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically confirmed NSCLC that is metastatic or unresectable
             and for which standard curative or palliative measures do not exist or are no longer
             effective.

          -  No prior systemic treatment with either chemotherapy or immunotherapy for non-curative
             intent. Patients may have previously received cancer treatment with curative intent
             for prior early stage disease.

          -  At least 18 years old.

          -  ECOG performance status of 0-2, as determined by the treating physician in the consult
             note.

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 3 months.

          -  Patients must have radiographically measurable metastatic disease by RECIST criteria.

          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

          -  absolute neutrophil count ≥1,000/mcL

          -  platelets ≥100,000/mcL

          -  Chemotherapy agents are known to be teratogenic, therefore women of child-bearing
             potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method
             of birth control) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation.
             Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this
             study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign an IRB-approved informed consent
             document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Nonsmall cell lung cancer that is known at registration to be positive for a tumor
             activating alteration for which first line targeted therapy is indicated;
             specifically, a targetable mutation in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), gene
             rearrangement of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), gene rearrangement of c-ros
             oncogene 1 (ROS1), or mutation in B isoform of rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma
             (B-Raf).

          -  Known to have an active autoimmune disease that required systemic treatment in the
             past 2 years (i.e., with use of disease modifying agents, systemic corticosteroids, or
             immunosuppressive drugs).

          -  History of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required systemic corticosteroids.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because of the potential for teratogenic
             or abortifacient effects with chemotherapy. Because there is an unknown but potential
             risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with
             chemotherapy, breastfeeding should be discontinued.
