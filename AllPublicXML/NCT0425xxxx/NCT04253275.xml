  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to determine RNA blood biomarker based on 9 genes already
      identified in experimental studies, whose expression would be significantly increased in
      patient with ischemic stroke compared to controls.

      This is a monocentric study. It's a case-control study with case being first-ever ischemic
      stroke and controls being healthy (stroke free) subject patients paired for age, sex and
      cardiovascular risk or hemorrhagic stroke paired for age and sex.

      Patients are followed for one year. Blood samples will be taken at inclusion, 12h, 24h, 48h,
      7d, 3m and 1y. Microvesicles samples will be taken at inclusion, 7d and 3M.
