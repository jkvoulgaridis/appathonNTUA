    <textblock>
      Safety &amp; Health through Integrated, Facilitated Teams (SHIFT) is an intervention study to
      enhance employee health, safety, and well-being in public sector healthcare institutions in
      New England. The investigators will evaluate the effectiveness of an adapted form of the
      Center for the Promotion of Health in the New England Workplace (CPH-NEW) Healthy Workplace
      Participatory Program (HWPP) for strengthening cohesiveness, engagement, and impact of
      pre-existing joint labor-management health and safety committees.

      The sites are enrolled in three pairs, matched by agency and type of services. For each pair
      of sites, one will be randomly selected for immediate HWPP coaching. The paired organization
      will serve as a control until the study mid-point, at which time all sites will be coached.
      Process evaluations will examine barriers to and facilitators of program uptake, reach, and
      effectiveness. Survey data and injury records will be examined in intervention and control
      groups to describe the frequencies of workplace and non-occupational exposures of selected
      health outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Safety &amp; Health through Integrated, Facilitated Teams (SHIFT) is a five-year study with
      etiologic, intervention, and translational research components. Six public sector healthcare
      institutions are enrolled, in three pairs matched by agency and type of services. The sites
      are four Massachusetts state healthcare facilities, which have recently been mandated by law
      to achieve &quot;Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) equivalent compliance,&quot; and
      two Veterans Administration facilities each of which has multiple nationally mandated
      programs addressing employee health and safety. Using a &quot;stepped wedge&quot; design, one of each
      pair will be randomly selected as the immediate intervention site, while the other facility
      will be the concurrent control or &quot;lagged intervention&quot; site, having access only to technical
      reports and information until mid-project, when it will also receive the full intervention.

      The intervention is the CPH-NEW Healthy Workplace Participatory Program (HWPP), a process for
      increasing the effectiveness of occupational health and safety committees or peer-led
      employee teams, through root cause analysis, prioritizing health and safety needs for
      effective problem‚Äêsolving, identifying feasible interventions, and presenting these to
      leadership. Each facility has a pre-existing labor-management health and safety committee
      (HSC), which is the unit of intervention, so the HWPP will be adapted to joint
      management-labor teams. The committee is a partner in designing the program to fit the
      constraints and needs of the specific workplace and workforce. The research team provides
      training, coaching in the HWPP process, technical information, and practical assistance to
      committee members, facilitators, champions and leadership.

      Etiologic research will entail analysis of baseline data for cross-sectional associations of
      work organization with worker health indicators. Intervention research will entail
      effectiveness and cost-outcome analysis of the HWPP. Outcomes will be both generic indicators
      of employee well-being and specific outcomes appropriate to the topics that the HSC's select
      for intervention. Translational research (process evaluation) will evaluate the efficacy of
      the dissemination and training strategy, as well as obstacles to and facilitators of uptake
      and implementation.
