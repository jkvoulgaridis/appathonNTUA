      The aim of this study is to investigate transgender men and non-binary persons before and
      during testosterone treatment. The study will focus on:

        -  Cardiovascular status and lung function

        -  Body composition

        -  Mental health and quality of life

        -  Establishing a biobank for later use.

      The number of persons with gender incongruence seeking gender affirming hormonal treatment
      with sex hormones is increasing in Denmark. Gender affirming therapy of transgender men most
      often includes testosterone treatment (TT). Testosterone is an important anabolic and
      androgenic hormone. During treatment testosterone is increased around 20 fold. Testosterone
      is an important anabolic and androgenic hormone.

      Aim: To investigate how TT affects quality of life, cardiovascular health, respiratory
      function, body composition and muscle strength in transgender men in relation to age at
      transition, pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors and conditions and the dosage of
      hormones administered.

      Methods: A prospective 10 year cohort study of 200 transgender men (+18 years). Persons
      included undergo examinations before initiation of TT and after 1, 3, 5 and 10 years of TT.

      All examinations are performed with state of the art methods and the themes of the study
      program are:

        -  Quality of life

        -  Cardiovascular risk and function

        -  Respiratory function

        -  Body composition and muscle strength Ethics and dissemination: The study is approved by
           the regional ethics committee (S-20190108) and the Danish Data Protection Agency. The
           results of this study will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals.
