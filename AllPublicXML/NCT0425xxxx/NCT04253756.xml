  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized pilot study of therapeutic apheresis procedures (TAP) using the current
      standard of care catheter (SOC) vs the BD Nexiva Diffusics Catheter. It is a single blinded,
      randomized study. Data will be used to refine and power a full randomized control trial. For
      this study, a sample of 33 encounters in each group (total of 66 encounters). The specific
      aim is to test the hypothesis that the 20-gauge BD Nexiva Diffusics Catheter provides the
      same efficacy and lower pain level with no increase in adverse events for patients undergoing
      apheresis treatments.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TAP treats a wide range of disease processes and, in all cases, requires inlet and return
      venous access to perform the procedure. The goal of TAP is to return the patient to baseline
      and maintain independence and function. A larger needle (18 gauge) can cause more discomfort
      to the patient as well as additional scarring. A smaller needle may present less discomfort
      and scarring to the patient. The goal in the outpatient clinic is to minimize disruption to
      the patient's routine and help the patient maintain normal activities of daily living.

      To accomplish these goals, the outpatient clinic is open Monday thru Friday offering 4
      different appointment times. All patients that are referred to the clinic for TAP, first
      receive a vein evaluation to see if the patient is a candidate for peripheral IV therapy. At
      the clinic, approximately 68% of the patients TAP's are performed peripherally. This
      eliminates the risk of a central line infection and any alteration in activities of daily
      living, such as bathing(Kramer, 2016), (Shang, Ma, Poghosyan, Dowding, &amp; Stone, 2014),(Keller
      et al., 2018; McDiarmid, 2015).

      The hypothesis, is that the 20-gauge BD Nexiva Diffusics catheter provides the same efficacy
      as current practice with no increase in adverse events for patients undergoing therapeutic
      apheresis. The results from the study will be significant because if the 20 gauge needle is
      equally effective for TAP, it can increase the number of patients that would be candidates
      for peripheral therapy. Therefore, decreasing the need for central venous access, which place
      the patient at an increased risk of infection. The study is a comparison of 2 types of
      infusion catheters. The standard of care is an 18-gauge autogard catheter (control group)
      which will be compared to the 20-gauge BD Nexiva Diffusics (intervention).

      P - patients who require therapeutic apheresis procedures (TAP) I - use of 20 guage (20G) BD
      diffusics catheter during apheresis C - use of 18 G standard of care IV catheter during
      apheresis O - no difference in efficacy and no increase in safety events

    <description>Number of Participants With Treatment-Related Adverse Events using 20-gauge BD Nexiva Diffusics for TAP procedures, as assessed by standard care minimum threshold of ratio of return and inlet rates.
An adverse event will be determined if the high return pressure alarm is displayed by the exchange machine. When the alarm is triggered the operator will decrease the inlet speed to accommodate the return pressure. The minimum inlet threshold is determine by the procedure type. The minimum inlet threshold for plasma exchange 50ml/sec. If the minimum threshold has been reached, and the return pressure alarm is not resolved the catheter will be replaced with standard of care. The inlet rates average will be compared with historical inlet rate averages from the procedure.</description>
