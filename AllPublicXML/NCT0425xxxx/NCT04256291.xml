  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pain and severe wear of hip joints caused by osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis,
      avascular necrosis and trauma can be subjected to total hip replacement (THR). A hip implant
      consists of 4 components: acetabular cup, femoral stem, articular liner and femoral head. As
      an ideal material for THR, ceramic possesses excellent biocompatibility and stability in the
      human bodies. Moreover, ceramic-on-ceramic interface is highly wear-resistant, preventing
      generation of wear particles. With the development of latest fourth-generation ceramic Delta,
      larger femoral heads can be manufactured to conform to the size of native femoral heads. The
      rate of some of the complications after THR, such as dislocation, can be significantly
      reduced. The purpose of the present study is to carry out a clinical follow up for each
      patient who has received the ceramic-on-ceramic THR in order to understand the clinical
      outcome. Furthermore, the possible complications, such as dislocation and squeaking, can be
      determined.
