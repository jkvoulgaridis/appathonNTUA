  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test a new surgical imaging system called &quot;Structured Light
      Imaging (SLI).&quot; This system is designed to examine tissue removed during breast cancer
      surgery to see whether the tissue's edges contain cancer. The current standard of practice is
      to remove the breast tumor tissue and send the tissue to the lab for analysis following
      surgery. One in five women (in the US) must later return for a second surgery to remove
      cancer cells that the lab found remaining in the tissue.

      In this study, researchers hope that the new SLI system may detect the cancer cells in the
      tissue's edges by imaging at the time of surgery. If successful, in the future we may use
      this system to improve entire cancer removal at the time of surgery, and reduce the need to
      perform a second surgery to remove additional breast tissue.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      On the day of surgery, the surgeon will remove the patient's cancerous tissue, and then in a
      separate room near the operating room, imaging staff will test it with the Structured Light
      Imaging system. The testing may take several extra minutes to capture the images. After this
      imaging, the surgeon will complete the surgery. Following surgery, and per routine medical
      care, the patient's breast tumor tissue sample will be sent to DHMC's lab for testing. The
      patient will see her primary doctor for standard surgery follow-up.

      No additional imaging or testing will be required for this research study following the usual
      surgery.

    <measure>Sensitivity and Specificity of 3D tomography-SLI as measured by concurrence with standard of care 2-D mammography</measure>
    <time_frame>Day of surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Two surfaces (anterior and posterior) will be evaluated by SLI and 6 surfaces (anterior, posterior, medial, lateral, cranial, and caudal) will be evaluated by 3D tomography. Four surfaces are evaluated by standard-of-care 2-dimensional specimen mammography: medial, lateral, cranial and caudal to evaluate for the presence of cancer at the margin. Since anterior and posterior surfaces will be evaluated by both 3D tomography and SLI, an anterior or posterior margin will be considered positive only if it is positive by both 3D tomography and SLI. Otherwise the margin will be considered negative.
Sensitivity will be computed as True Positive (TP)/TP + False Negative (FN) results, compared to pathology. Specificity will be computed as True Negative (TN)/TN + False Positive (FP) results, compared to pathology.</description>

        The investigators estimate that 100 women will be required. Based on the studies presented
        in the Introduction, the investigators expect 20% of breast cancer patients to have a
        positive margin.

        Based on historical operative volumes, the investigators anticipate recruiting 2 breast
        cancer patients per week. Thus it will take one year to accrue 100 patients to the study.
