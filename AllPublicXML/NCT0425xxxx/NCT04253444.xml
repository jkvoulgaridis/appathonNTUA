  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Reflux hypersensitivity is the disease that causes chest pain, heartburn and regurgitation
      and can impair patients' quality of life. Pain modulators are often used for the treatment of
      reflux hypersensitivity, but the effect is not enough and more effective therapy is needed.

      Slow deep breathing is the validated method to modulate the autonomic nervous system. In our
      previous study, slow deep breathing could increase the threshold of oesophageal pain in
      healthy volunteers. Therefore, slow deep breathing has the potential to be an effective
      treatment for reflux hypersensitivity and further study is warranted in the patient group.

      The aims of this study are (1) to evaluate the feasibility of slow deep breathing and (2) to
      investigate the effect of autonomic nerve modulation by slow deep breathing on symptoms in
      patients with reflux hypersensitivity.

      This is a randomized single-blinded parallel study and the investigators aim to recruit 40
      participants.

      Patients will be enrolled for a period of 4 weeks and don't have to attend our institution. A
      video chat on day 1 will consist of confirming eligibility, after which the patient will be
      randomised to follow either the slow deep breathing protocol or the sham breathing protocol
      in a single blinded fashion. That is, the patient will be unaware of which the active
      breathing exercise is. Once randomised during a video chat, they will undergo baseline heart
      rate variability (HRV) measurements using a smartphone app, answer the questionnaires on
      Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap), and then practice the relevant breathing exercise
      with an instruction video. The patient will then be trained to self-administer the breathing
      exercise during a video chat, which will be used twice a day for 10 minutes over the next 4
      weeks with a standardized instruction video.

      This study finishes when participants answer the online questionnaire and record HRV on day
      29.

      The investigators will set up this questionnaire on our electronic data capture system
      (Research Electronic Data Capture: REDCap). Participants will answer questionnaires using
      this online system on day 1, day 8, day15, day 22, and day 29 (end of the study).

      Therefore, participants will also be trained on how to use REDCap and answer questionnaires
      under supervision on day 1 during a video chat. Questionnaires on day 8, 15, 22, and 29 will
      be answered at home. The investigators will send a reminder message to participants using a
      REDCap system the day before they answer the questionnaire.

      Participants will be asked to record their HRV using a smartphone app on day 1, 8, 15, 22,
      and 29.
