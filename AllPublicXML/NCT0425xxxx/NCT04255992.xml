      Aim: to determine and compare the short term effect of calcium and vitamin D supplementation
      on oxidative status and blood pressure profile of postmenopausal patients with high blood
      pressure in Yaoundé, Cameroon.

      Method: A double-arm, double-blind, randomized and parallel clinical trial conducted at the
      Yaoundé Central Hospital. Postmenopausal hypertensive blacks women who are taking taking
      antihypertensives drugs since 12 months,without diabetes mellitus or any inflammatory disease
      or hypercalcemia, are randomize into 2 groups. Depending on the group, the intervention
      consisted of the administration of Calcium 1000 mg daily or Vitamin D/Calcium 1000 mg/800 UI
      daily for 08 weeks. The endpoints were the nycthemeral blood pressure profile, pro oxidant
      marker (malondialdehyde) and anti-oxidant marker (Ferric reducing antioxidant).

      Progress: Recruitment for this study was completed in May 2019 with 22 patients.

    <masking_description>The double-blind model is applied to the study. Only the adjudicator, responsible for the distribution of medication knew the different regimes. Calcium and Vitamin D/Calcium were packaged in boxes of identical appearance and labeled for each participant by name and number of the randomization program. The randomization and packaging of the drugs was done by an investigator who had no clinical involvement.</masking_description>
