  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR-T) engineered T cells against the CD19 protein have been shown
      to be effective against acute lymphoma and lymphocytic leukemia and are approved by the US
      (FDA), European (EMA) and Health Basel.

      However, little information exists on using CD19CAR for treatment of recurrent or
      irresponsible to previous treatment acute myeloid leukemia.

      The proposed study will include patients with recurrent disease or those with disease
      irresponsible to common treatments and they will be treated with CAR-T CD19.

    <description>The appropriate participants will undergo lymhopheresis to collect lymphocytes from PBMC peripheral blood. CAR T CD19 cells will be produced. The participants will receive cyclophosphamide 300 mg / m² and flodarabine 30 mg / m² lymphodeplition intravenously daily for 3 days.
The CAR-T CD19 cells will be given on the 5 to 7 day post lymphodeplition .</description>
