         10. Willing to submit a tissue sample for personalized DNA vaccine manufacturing.

         11. Patients with chronic or acute HBV infection [as characterized by positive hepatitis B
             surface antigen (HBsAg) and/or hepatitis B core antibodies (anti-HBcAb) with
             detectable HBV DNA (≥10 IU/ml)] must be treated with effective antiviral therapy, as
             per institutional practices, prior to enrollment and for the duration of the study
             therapy. Patients who test positive for anti-hepatitis B core (HBc) with undetectable
             HBV DNA (&lt;10 IU/ml) do not require anti-viral therapy prior to enrollment however
             these subjects will be tested at every cycle to monitor HBV DNA levels and initiate
             antiviral therapy if HBV DNA is detected (≥10 IU/ml). Subjects with chronic infection
             by hepatitis C virus (HCV), who are untreated, are allowed on study. In addition,
             subjects with successful HCV treatment (defined as sustained virologic response [SVR]
             12 or SVR 24) are allowed, as long as 4 weeks have passed between completion of HCV
             therapy and start of study drug. Subjects receiving antiviral therapy during TKI may
             be enrolled.

         12. Have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to receiving the
             first dose of study drug (Cycle 1, Day 1) (female subjects of childbearing potential).

             test will be required.

         13. Be willing to use an adequate method of contraception for the course of the study
             through 150 days after the last dose of study drug (male and female subjects of
             childbearing potential) Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the usual lifestyle
             and preferred contraception for the subject.

         14. Demonstrate adequate organ function.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             treatment.

          4. Has clinically apparent ascites on physical examination. Note: only ascites detectable
             on imaging studies is allowed.

          5. Evidence of portal vein invasion based on imaging is allowed pending subjects meet
             laboratory criteria for enrollment.

          6. Has had encephalopathy in the last 6 months. Subjects on rifaximin or lactulose to
             control their encephalopathy are not allowed.

          7. Had a solid organ or hematologic transplant.

          8. Had prior systemic therapy for HCC other than sorafenib or lenvatinib.

             (i.e., with use of disease-modifying agents, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressive
             drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., T4, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a
             form of systemic treatment.

         10. Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any
             other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of study
             drug. The use of physiologic doses of corticosteroids may be approved after
             consultation with the Sponsor.

         11. Has received locoregional therapy to liver (transarterial chemoembolization [TACE],
             transarterial embolization [TAE], radiation, radioembolization, or ablation) or major
             surgery to liver or other site within 3 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug.
             Minor surgery (e.g., simple excision, tooth extraction) must have occurred at least 7
             days prior to the first dose of study drug (Cycle 1, Day 1). Subjects must have
             recovered adequately (i.e., Grade ≤1 or baseline) from the toxicity and/or
             complications from any intervention prior to starting therapy.

         12. Has a diagnosed additional malignancy within 5 years prior to first dose of study
             drug, with the exception of curatively treated basal cell carcinoma of the skin,
             squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, and/or curatively resected in situ cervical
             and/or breast cancers. Subjects with history of early-stage prostate cancer that has
             been curatively treated or appropriate for observation may be enrolled.

         13. Has radiographically detectable (even if asymptomatic and/or previously treated)
             central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis, as assessed
             by local site investigator.

             that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the subject's
             participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator, including
             dialysis.

         17. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the study.

         18. Is pregnant or breastfeeding or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the study, starting with the screening visit through 150 days
             after the last dose of study drug.

         19. Has received prior immunotherapy including anti-programmed death (PD) 1,
             anti-programmed death ligand (PD-L)-1, or anti-PD-L2 agents, or personalized therapies
             such as adoptive cell therapy or neoantigen-based vaccine.

         20. Has a known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (HIV I/II antibodies).

         21. Has untreated active hepatitis B virus (HBV), unless planned antiviral therapy during

             detectable HBV DNA (≥10 IU/ml or above the limit of detection per local lab standard),
             must be treated with antiviral therapy as per institutional practice to ensure
             adequate viral suppression (HBV DNA ≤2000 IU/mL) prior to treatment with the study
             drug. Patients who test positive for HBcAg with undetectable HBV DNA (&lt;10 IU/ml or
             under the limit of detection per local lab standard) do not require anti-viral therapy
             prior to enrollment.

         22. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study treatment (Cycle
             1, Day 1).

             Note: The killed virus vaccines used for seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are
             allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., FluMist®) are live attenuated
             vaccines and are not allowed.

                  that EP treatment could negatively impact the illness

               -  Presence of unstable or life-threatening cardiac disease (e.g., unstable angina,
                  Class 3 or higher congestive heart failure).

               -  A cardioverter-defibrillator or pacemaker (to prevent a life-threatening
                  arrhythmia) that is located ipsilateral to the intended deltoid injection site
                  (unless deemed acceptable by a cardiologist).

               -  Any metal implants or implantable medical device within the electroporation area.

         24. Has no mutations detected after sequencing of the tumor
