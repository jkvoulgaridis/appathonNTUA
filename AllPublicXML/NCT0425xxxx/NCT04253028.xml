  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      NERv's phase I clinical trial is a first-in-human, multi-center, pre-market, non-randomized,
      prospective clinical trial intended to evaluate the safety and collect preliminary data
      necessary for the detection of clinical post-operative anastomotic/intraperitoneal leakages.

      NERv's Inline Device attaches to existing catheters or peritoneal drains that are currently
      being used in the medical industry. This allows the device to measure the pH and conductance
      of intraperitoneal fluids that typically get drained through peritoneal drains.

      The purpose of NERv's feasibility clinical trial is to collect pH and conductance readings by
      analyzing peritoneal drainage fluid. Upon analyzing data collected from NERv's Inline Device
      a clinical model of pH and conductance will be created. The clinical model can then be used
      to determine if a complication is developing. For instance, boundaries (reading thresholds)
      can be established where if the signal goes outside the boundaries a complication could be
      identified. Specifically the ability to detect a post-operative complication known as
      anastomotic leakage; which is a dreaded complication associated with abdominal surgeries;
      will be the main focus of the study.
