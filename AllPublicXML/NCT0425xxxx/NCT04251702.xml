    <textblock>
      This observational study characterizes the relationship between amniotic fluid lactate and
      uterine electromyography during labor in healthy, nulliparous women in spontaneous, term
      labor. Additional comparison measures and outcomes measures will be collected and analyzed as
      exploratory measures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Elevated amniotic fluid lactate (AFL) and uterine electromyography (EMG) mathematically
      transformed to calculated the power density spectrum median frequency have been found
      separately to be associated with labor dystocia and cesarean birth. Both are hypothesized to
      reflect that uterine fatigue plays a role in the pathophysiology of labor dystocia for some
      women.

      This study aims to characterize the relationship between the two measures to better
      understand the role of uterine fatigue in labor dystocia and triangulate biomarkers of
      fatigue that may lead to a better understanding of labor dystocia phenotypes.

      In addition to the primary measures, comparison measures will be collected. For AFL
      comparison, venous whole blood lactate and capillary lactate will be collected and measured
      using both a point-of-care lactate meter (Stat Strip Lactate Meter, Nova Biomedical) and a
      table-top blood gas analyzer (Nova Prime). For EMG comparison, routine contraction monitoring
      data will be collected and compared to the EMG signal. Three visual analog scales on women's
      experiences of fatigue, anxiety, and pain will also be administered.

      Additional data will be collected from the medical record to perform exploratory and
      hypothesis generating analysis.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Nulliparous: Woman with first pregnancy progressing beyond 20 weeks estimated
             gestational age

          -  Maternal age: 18-34 years at the due date

          -  Term gestation: 37-41 weeks estimated gestational age (EGA)

          -  Single fetus in a vertex presentation: Pregnancy with only one fetus that is in a head
             down position with the occiput leading into the pelvis upon admission to the hospital.

          -  Spontaneous onset of labor: No documented induction of labor including use of cervical
             ripening agents (e.g. misoprostol, cervidil), mechanical devices (e.g. cook or Foley
             catheter), or oxytocin including for the management of premature rupture of membranes.

          -  Pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) &lt; 30 kg/m2: Pre-pregnancy weight and height
             documented in the health record on the initial prenatal visit is used to calculate BMI
             by dividing the pre-pregnancy weight in kilograms by the square of the pre-pregnancy
             height in meters. Of note, weight measured at the final prenatal visit before labor
             (rather than the pre-pregnancy BMI) will be used to calculate BMI at time of delivery
             for use as a variable in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Induction of labor: Documented induction of labor including use of cervical ripening
             agents (e.g. misoprostol, cervidil), mechanical devices (e.g. cook or Foley catheter),
             or oxytocin. This does not include nipple stimulation, castor oil, herbs, or other
             methods of labor induction attempted by participants outside of medical care.

          -  Premature rupture of membranes (PROM): Rupture of membranes at term but prior to the
             onset of labor. Women with PROM who otherwise meet the inclusion criteria will be
             included, however if induction or augmentation of labor is medically required prior to
             the onset of active labor and collection of amniotic fluid, these women will be
             excluded.

          -  Pre-existing or gestational diabetes requiring medical management: The diagnosis of
             diabetes of any kind requiring management with medications including but not limited
             to insulin, glyburide, and metformin as indicated in the health record.

          -  Pre-existing or gestational hypertension or pre-eclampsia requiring medical
             management: The diagnosis of hypertension of any kind requiring management with
             medications including but not limited to long-term hypertension management such as
             methyldopa and short-term or emergency hypertension management such as labetalol or
             magnesium sulfate as indicated in the health record.

          -  Suspected fetal anomaly or intrauterine growth restriction: Any diagnosed fetal
             anomalies or intrauterine growth restriction as indicated in the health record.

          -  Use of exogenous oxytocin prior to sample collection: Any use of exogenous oxytocin
             for inducing or augmenting labor prior to the collection of amniotic fluid samples
             will exclude the participant from the study. Use of exogenous oxytocin following data
             collection will not exclude participants and data about dose and timing of medication
             will be collected.

          -  Use of amnioinfusion prior to sample collection: Amnioinfusion, the infusion of fluids
             into the uterus using an intrauterine catheter may affect AFL concentrations. Any
             amnioinfusion prior to sample collection will exclude participants from continued
             participation.

          -  Fetal distress prior to or during sample collection: Category 3 fetal heart tracing as
             defined by the National Institute of Child Health and Development22, absent fetal
             heart rate variability with recurrent late deceleration, recurrent variable
             decelerations, bradycardia, or sinusoidal rhythm.
