    <textblock>
      The proposed ONE TEAM Study is an 18-month, cluster randomized controlled trial. This study
      will use a sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) design with a second
      randomization for the intervention group using a dynamic treatment regimen approach. The
      investigators propose to randomize 800 adults with newly-diagnosed selected cancers treated
      with curative intent (breast, prostate, colorectal, endometrial, non-small cell lung, and
      endometrial) and with &gt;1 selected cardiovascular disease (CVD) comorbidity (hypertension,
      type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia). Participants will be enrolled through Duke
      Cancer Institute and two community-based oncology practices, both settings serving
      socio-demographically diverse populations. The unit of randomization will be the PCP clinic;
      there will be ~80 PCP clinics across North Carolina involved in the study. The overarching
      goals of this study are to improve chronic disease management and communication among cancer
      survivors by engaging PCPs as active members of the cancer care team and reframing the
      message to cancer survivors and providers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an 18-month cluster randomized controlled trial using a SMART design with two
      randomizations (the second using an embedded dynamic treatment regimen), with a target
      enrollment of 800 patients with one of six solid tumors (stage I-III breast, prostate,
      colorectal, endometrial, and head/neck cancer; stage I-II non-small cell lung cancer) who are
      being treated with curative intent. To engage the PCP early in the process, the investigators
      will enroll patients at the time of their first or second visit with a cancer specialist
      (e.g., surgeon, radiation or medical oncologist). The investigators estimate that 80 unique
      community-based PCP clinics across North Carolina will be involved in the study. The
      investigators will determine the effectiveness of the multi-level intervention compared with
      usual care on (1) Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) quality measures
      of management of the three CVD comorbidities using laboratory testing (glycated hemoglobin
      [A1c], lipid profile) and blood pressure measurements; (2) medication adherence assessed
      pharmacy refill data using Proportion of Days Covered (PDC); and (3) patient-provider
      communication (Patient-Centered Communication in Cancer Care, PCC-Ca-36).

      Key aspects of the intervention are to: reframe the message to patients, PCPs, oncologists,
      and the respective health care teams in these two settings to emphasize the importance of
      optimizing the management of comorbidities during and after cancer therapy; promote a change
      in the workflow in both PCP and oncology practices; enhance PCP-oncologist relationships, and
      utilize EHR technology. There are two phases of the intervention, both having patient- and
      PCP-level components. During the first phase of the intervention, occurring with the first
      randomization, the investigators will test the effectiveness of a self-guided, informational
      strategy (iGuide). For PCP clinics that do not achieve the HEDIS targets, a booster phase
      with tailored (patient-level) and targeted (PCP-level) strategies will be tested with a
      second randomization (iGuide2).

      The intervention has been designed to utilize the electronic health record (EHR). At the
      cancer centers, the research team will use the Epic patient portal, MyChart. For PCPs who do
      not use Epic, the research team will use an Epic tool, MedLink, which allows them to view a
      patient's medical records in our system including visit summaries, progress notes and
      results. They can use the Epic inbasket and receive/send messages related to their patient's
      care at the Duke Cancer Institute (DCI), receive alerts, make referrals, and track the
      progress of requests. The PCPs participation is voluntary and their completion of study
      activities will serve as their implied consent to participate.

      All participants in the study will be given a survivorship care plan based on the American
      Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) template. Because the investigators will be recruiting
      participants at our cancer centers and community practices, there will be an inevitable
      contamination across cancer specialists. Thus, the investigators did not include an
      oncology-level intervention. However, cancer specialists are integral to the patient- and
      PCP-level interventions. At the end of the study, patients and PCPs will be mailed a
      newsletter with a summary of the study findings. Lastly, it is inevitable that some patients
      will change their PCP during the study. When notified of the change, the research team will
      send the new PCP the intervention materials.

    <intervention_model_description>Investigators will use a SMART design with 2 randomizations - at the time of enrollment and after the 12-month measurement. At enrollment, participants will be cluster randomized to the self-guided multi-level iGuide intervention or control arm. An adaptive intervention will be used for the second randomization. PCP clinics in the intervention arm in which 90% or more of their participating patients do not meet the modified HEDIS quality metrics at the 12-month measurement will be considered 'non-responders' and randomized to a tailored/targeted intervention (iGuide2) or a control (iGuide).</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Medication adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Medication adherence will be measured as proportion of days covered, and the research team will obtain pharmacy refill data from the EHR. For participants followed by a Duke PCP, all refills (including refill date, amount, number of refills) are captured in Epic. For PCPs outside of Duke, the research team will use the Epic link with Surescripts which captures e-prescribed medications. Using this data, the investigators will calculate the PDC for an index medication from each medication class for the three CVD comorbidities, depending upon the number of CVD comorbidities a participant has. PDC is a measure of how many days a patient is in possession of their medication, calculated as the total number of days in a followup period divided by the total number of days that a medication was available (ratio of the number of days the patient is covered by a medication during a refill period).</description>

    <description>The investigators will use a self-report adherence measure created and validated by Voils et al which assesses extent of non-adherence as well as reasons for non-adherence. Participants will first respond to adherence items for each CVD comorbidity (n = 3 items each). Participants who are identified as non-adherent will be asked a series of medication-specific reasons for nonadherence (up to 18 items).</description>

    <description>Patient activation will be assessed using the Patient Activation Measure (PAM), which is a 13-item measure that assesses a patient's knowledge, skills, and confidence that are central to managing health and health care. The PAM categorizes patients into four levels of activation: disengaged and overwhelmed (level 1), becoming aware but still struggling level 2), taking action (level 3), and maintaining behaviors and pushing further (level 4).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Financial burden</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patients' experience with cost of care (financial burden and objective cost) will be assessed through two self-reported measures of financial burden and actual expenditures. To assess financial burden, or financial toxicity, the research team will collect the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy COmprehensive Score for financial Toxicity (COST). The FACIT-COST is an 11-item measure. The research team will also objectively ask patients about the amount of out-of-pocket expenditures for care over the last month via survey questions (e.g., insurance premiums, copayments, prescription medications, etc).</description>

    <measure>Patient-reported care coordination</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patient-reported care coordination will be collected using a 36-item measure developed by Haggerty et al. The measure contains 9 subscales that address team relational continuity, problems with coordination, gaps in information transfer, and patient's partnership in care.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Provider-reported care coordination</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Provider-reported care coordination will be measured using companion clinician-reported measures, the Coordination of Specialty Care - Specialist Survey (n=13 items) and the Coordination of Specialty Care - Primary Care Survey (n=24 items). Both measures were developed by Vimalananda and colleagues, and include companion domains that facilitate descriptive comparisons across measures.The specialist version includes four domains (i.e., Relationships, Roles and Responsibilities,Communication, Data Transfer). The Roles and Responsibilities domain is broken into three domains in the primary care version (i.e., Role Clarity, Communication, Role Agreement, Making Referrals), resulting in a total of 6 factors.</description>

    <description>The iGuide2 patient-level intervention will use a stage-based, tailored approach to four monthly 5-minute video vignettes that incorporates a pre-video worksheet. The investigators will send the worksheets and video vignettes in the method preferred by the patient.
The targeted iGuide 2 PCP-level intervention will include a cancer specialist-facing dashboard that includes the specialists's patients who are enrolled in the study and are in the intervention arm. The HEDIS quality measures for our three CVD comorbidities will be used. The dashboard will be populated with data available in Epic for the specific patient. If some information is missing (i.e., there is no lipid profile in the laboratory tab), the dashboard will query the PCP via an e-consult, asking to supply the information. Bimonthly, starting with the second randomization, an asynchronous specialist-to-PCP e-consult will be sent to PCPs whose patient(s) do not meet all three of the HEDIS quality metrics.</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to the control group (n=400) will receive current guideline-concordant cancer care. The investigators will also provide information for healthy living during and after cancer and for preparing for transition from cancer therapy to follow-up care. Monthly, patient education material on healthy living will be sent to the participants via the patient portal or by mail, based on participant preference. At the completion of therapy, they will be provided the NCI Facing Forward:Life After Cancer booklet. Note, this approach is not fully equivalent to an attention control as there will be touch points in the iGuide and iGuide2 interventions that the investigators cannot match for the control group. Also, the research team will not engage the PCPs in clinics randomized to the control group.</description>
