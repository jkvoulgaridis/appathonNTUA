    <textblock>
      This project will investigate exploratory outcomes related to the effect of intranasal
      insulin on cognition, mood, apathy and motor performance of subjects with Parkinson's disease
      over a 3 week period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease after
      Alzheimer's dementia and was originally described as a motor disease. The diagnosis of PD is
      still based on the core motor features of bradykinesia, resting tremor, and rigidity,
      primarily as a result of degeneration of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons. In addition to
      the classic motor symptoms, however, PD is increasingly recognized as a multisystem disorder.
      A variety of non-motor symptoms, including cognitive deficits and dementia, are commonly
      observed in patients with PD.

      In this study, we aim to investigate which intranasal insulin dose out of three doses and
      placebo, administered at three different doses or placebo over a 21-day period, is the
      optimum dosage based on safety and tolerability in Parkinson's disease. A similar design was
      used in a trial investigating intranasal oxytocin in frontotemporal dementia. Dosing for the
      first two groups of this study is based on previously conducted intranasal insulin studies in
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), using daily doses on 20 and 40
      IU of intranasal insulin. Higher dose have been found to be safe in healthy adults. Prior
      studies performed have demonstrated favorable effects of this regimen in the MCI/AD
      population without peripheral hypoglycemia.

             poorly controlled congestive heart failure, significant cardiovascular and/or
             cerebrovascular events within previous 6 months, condition known to affect absorption,
             distribution, metabolism, or excretion of drugs such as any hepatic, renal or
             gastrointestinal disease or any other clinically relevant abnormality that inclusion
             would pose a safety risk to the subject as determined by investigator.

          -  Subject has had previous nasal and/or oto-pharyngeal surgery and severe deviated
             septum and/or other anomalies.

          -  Subject has history of any psychiatric illness that would pose a safety risk to the
             subject as determined by investigator.

          -  Subject is currently taking sedative medications that are clinically contraindicated
             as determined by investigator.

          -  Subject has undergone a recent change (&lt;1 month) in their anti-parkinsonian
             medication, cholinesterase inhibitor or anti-depressant medication.

          -  Subject has current or recent drug or alcohol abuse or dependence as defined by
             Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition, text revision
             (DSM-IV TR).

          -  Screening laboratory results that are medically relevant, in which inclusion would
             pose a safety risk to the subject as determined by investigator.

          -  Subject has participated in a clinical trial investigation within 3 months of this
             study.

          -  Subject has an insulin allergy.

          -  Subject has Insulin-dependent diabetes
