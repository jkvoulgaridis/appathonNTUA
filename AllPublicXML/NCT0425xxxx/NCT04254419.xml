      Patient enrollment will follow a 3+3 design. Patients will receive 3 cycles of NK cell
      infusions over 12 weeks. Each cycle will consist of 1 infusion per week for 3 weeks, followed
      by a rest week (week 4). Dose will be escalated in an inter-patient stepwise fashion
      consisting of 4 dose levels until dose limiting toxicities are observed or the recommended
      phase II dose is determined.

    <description>For source PBMCs from the patient, up to 3ml/kg (maximum 150ml) of heparinized peripheral blood will be drawn. NK cell product will be manufactured by a GMP facility. Once the NK cell goes through the appropriate procedures, it will undergo a lot release testing and cryopreservation by day 14 for infusion.
If NK cells fail to meet release criteria or are insufficient in number for the dose level assigned, collection of PBMCs may be repeated up to 2 additional times.
Duration of study therapy is up to 12 weeks and nine doses of NK cells.</description>

    <description>Natural killer cells will be taken from the patients peripheral blood cell collection. The administration of the cells will be done via an Ommaya intra-cavitary/intra-tumoral device.
Once the infusion is ready for administration patients will be admitted to the infusion unit for monitoring. NK cells will be administered through the Ommaya in approximately 2 milliliters over approximately 2 minutes; followed by 1 milliliter preservative-free normal saline flush over approximately 1 minute.</description>
