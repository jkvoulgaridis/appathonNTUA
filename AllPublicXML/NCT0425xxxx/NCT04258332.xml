    <textblock>
      Salt sensitivity of blood pressure (SSBP) is defined as the change in blood pressure (BP) in
      relation to change in salt intake. An increase in BP from low- to high-salt diet is common
      and associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, even among
      normotensive individuals. Yet, the pathophysiology of SSBP is not well understood. The
      prevailing paradigm is that abnormalities of neurohormones that regulate sodium (Na+)
      retention and excretion and/or Na+ transporting pathways create Na+ imbalances that underlie
      susceptibility to SSBP. As a homeostatic mechanism, BP fluctuates to maintain Na+ balance,
      i.e. higher BP is needed for pressure natriuresis to excrete excess Na+. An alternate
      framework emphasizes vascular dysregulation as the inciting mechanism. In both constructs,
      how Na+ itself influences BP remains incompletely understood. Our preliminary work suggests
      that excess Na+ induces a pro-inflammatory state that sustains higher BP. Interleukin-6
      (IL-6) drives the induction of interleukin-17 (IL-17) secreting T helper 17 cells that were
      recently demonstrated to be pathogenic in response to Na+ exposure. IL-6, IL-17 and related
      cytokines regulate renal Na+ transporters and raise BP through vascular inflammation,
      fibrosis, and impaired vasodilation. The immune response to high- and low-salt diet in
      humans, however, is not completely understood, emphasizing the need for more detailed human
      studies, with deeper immune profiling under controlled salt conditions and with neurohormonal
      assessment. Our overarching postulate is that the inflammatory response to excess dietary
      salt intake is associated with SSBP. The Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults
      (CARDIA) study is the ideal cohort in which to translate our preliminary findings.
      Investigators propose to investigate SSBP in CARDIA using standardized low- and high-salt
      diets and 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring. Investigators will quantify SSBP in a total of
      500 participants from the Chicago and Birmingham field centers during the upcoming year 35
      exam (beginning in 2020). Our specific aims are: 1) to define the distribution of SSBP and
      its clinical correlates in a contemporary community-based US cohort of middle-aged
      individuals; 2) to investigate the immune response to dietary salt loading, and 3) to
      investigate the association between the immune and BP responses to dietary salt loading. The
      proposed study represents a unique opportunity to leverage a large, well-phenotyped cohort to
      test novel hypotheses regarding SSBP. Phenotyping SSBP using standardized high- and low-salt
      diets in CARDIA will be novel as this has never been performed in any of the existing US
      based NHLBI sponsored cardiovascular epidemiologic cohorts. The proposed work has the
      potential to yield a more readily available approach for differentiating an individual as
      salt-sensitive or resistant. New insights into the pathophysiology of SSBP should also
      provide a foundation for investigating high-impact clinical applications, by informing future
      studies of therapies directed at SSBP. The scientific rigor is further enhanced by the rich
      clinical, genetic, and biochemical data available in CARDIA.

    <description>The high-salt diet will be achieved through the supplementation of each participant's usual diet with Na+ bullion packets (2 packets per day). This will increase Na+ intake by approximately 2,200 mg (≈100 mEq Na+) to a total greater than 5,000 mg Na+ per day based on prior estimates of Na+ intake (see section C1.2). In addition, 1,000 mg of calcium carbonate (provided via Tums tablets) will be taken daily on the high Na+ diet to reduce the potential impact of changes in calcium intake on blood pressure.
The low-salt diet is comprised of 7 days of freshly prepared frozen meals, snacks, and Na+ free water. All low-salt meals will be prepared in each site's Metabolic Kitchen, with standardization of diets across sites. The low-salt diet includes: 20 mEq Na+ (±2 mEq) (460 mg/day), 100 mEq potassium (±2 mEq), and 1,000 mg calcium (±50 mg).</description>
