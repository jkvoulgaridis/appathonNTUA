  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      North America is facing an opioid epidemic fueled by surgeons, who are the second largest
      subgroup of physicians involved in opioid prescribing. Surgery often serves as the initial
      event for opioid-na√Øve patients to obtain a prescription for opioids and spiral into misuse
      and addiction. From the perspective of perioperative care clinicians, the answer to the
      opioid crisis may be using opioid-free analgesia. However, the number of comparative studies
      in this field is limited and existing small trials do not reflect current standards of care
      in North America. Lack of evidence means that the decision to prescribe opioids after
      outpatient surgery largely depends on surgeon preference and healthcare culture. Hence, there
      is an urgent need for a robust randomized controlled trial (RCT) to guide clinical
      decision-making. The feasibility and optimal design of this RCT should be informed by a pilot
      trial. The overarching goal of this pilot RCT is to investigate the feasibility of conducting
      a full-scale RCT to assess the comparative-effectiveness of opioid versus opioid-free
      analgesia after outpatient general surgery.

      This study will be a pragmatic, parallel, two-group, assessor-blind, pilot RCT. The
      investigators aim to recruit 80 adult patients at two tertiary hospitals in Montreal.
      Eligibility criteria will span outpatient procedures in abdominal and breast surgery.
      Patients are randomized on a 1:1 ratio to treatment with either opioid (standard care) or
      without opioid (only non-opioid analgesics). Patients will be followed up for 3 months after
      surgery; postoperative day (POD) 1 to POD 7 and at 2, 3 and 4 weeks after surgery, and at 3
      months. Assessments will include postoperative pain, physical and mental function, adverse
      drug events, prolonged opioid use and opioid misuse. Feasibility outcomes will include the
      number of patients screened, consented and randomized, adherence with treatment and
      completion of follow-up. Data from this pilot study will inform the calculation of sample
      size requirements for the full-scale RCT. An embedded qualitative study will be conducted to
      help optimize trial design based on clinicians' and patients' perspective.

    <masking_description>Patient-reported outcomes and treatment adherence data will be collected via self-administered electronic questionnaires distributed using REDCap (http://project-redcap.org/) and completed by patients via smartphone, tablet or personal computer. Electronic outcome data will be transmitted directly to the REDCap database and verified by a blinded assessor. Adherence data will be verified by unblinded study staff. Patients who are not computer savvy, have limited access or prefer non-electronic assessment will complete the questionnaires via telephone interviews with a blinded assessor; in this case, data will be recorded in paper forms and subsequently transferred to the REDCap database. Outcome data that are not patient-reported (e.g. postoperative complications, unplanned healthcare utilization, chronic opioid use), will be obtained from medical records by a blinded assessor.</masking_description>
