    <textblock>
      Abuse of opioids is a significant and growing problem in the United States. In the past two
      decades, opioid prescriptions have quadrupled while the age of heroin initiation has
      decreased, suggesting that more individuals are using opioids and transitioning to heroin and
      potent synthetic opioids than in the past. Further, fatal opioid overdose is now the leading
      cause of accidental death and is the 5th highest overall cause of mortality in the US.
      Engaging opioid users in opioid agonist treatments has been shown to lower rates of criminal
      behavior, lower rates of non-opioid drug use, and increase retention in drug treatment
      programs, while decreasing mortality and new HIV and hepatitis infections. However, a recent
      study noted that 68% of patients prescribed buprenorphine had poor medication adherence,
      which was associated with illicit opioid use. A Cochrane review concluded that buprenorphine
      was less effective at retaining patients in treatment relative to methadone. One reason for
      lower treatment retention may be the high comorbidity of opioid use disorder and chronic pain
      and/or opioid-induced hyperalgesia. Buprenorphine, as a partial mu agonist, provides lower
      analgesia but an improved safety profile relative to full agonists like methadone. Thus,
      enhancing the analgesic properties of buprenorphine will provide a safer alternative for
      opioid use disorder patients with chronic pain/hyperalgesia.

    <measure>Pain Threshold</measure>

    <description>Pain threshold refers to the intensity at which a stimulus is first perceived as painful. Heat stimuli will be delivered using a computer-controlled thermal stimulation system with a 30 millimeter X 30 millimeter probe. From a baseline of 32 degrees Celsius, the probe temperature will increase at a rate of .5 degrees Celsius/second until the participant responds by pressing a button on a handheld device. For heat pain threshold, participants will be instructed to press the button when the sensation &quot;first becomes painful&quot; Pain rating scores will be reflected in scores of 0-100, 0 being the least amount of pain and 100 being the most amount of pain.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Pain tolerance refers to the maximum amount of pain produced by a stimulus that a person is able/willing to tolerate. Heat stimuli will again be delivered using the computer-controlled thermal stimulation system. From a baseline of 32 degrees Celsius, the probe temperature will increase at a rate of .5 degrees Celsius/second until the participant responds by pressing a button on a handheld device. For heat pain tolerance, participants will be instructed to press the button when they are &quot;no longer willing to tolerate&quot; the painful sensation. Pain rating scores will be reflected in scores of 0-100, 0 being the least amount of pain and 100 being the most amount of pain.</description>

    <measure>Temporal summation of pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Temporal summation of pain refers to a form of endogenous pain facilitation characterized by the perception of increased pain despite constant or even reduced peripheral afferent input. Temporal summation is presumed to be the psychophysical manifestation of wind-up. Wind-up is a phenomenon where repetitive stimulation of C primary afferents at rates greater than 0.3 Hertz produces a slowly increasing response of second-order neurons in the spinal cord. Pain rating scores will be reflected in scores of 0-100, 0 being the least amount of pain and 100 being the most amount of pain.</description>

    <measure>Conditioned pain modulation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>A routinely used quantitative sensory testing protocol for the measurement of endogenous pain inhibition is conditioned pain modulation, which refers to the reduction in pain from one stimulus (the test stimulus) produced by the application of a second pain stimulus at a remote body site (the conditioning stimulus). Conditioned pain modulation is believed to reflect the perceptual manifestation of diffuse noxious inhibitory controls, whereby ascending projections from one noxious stimulus activate supraspinal structures that trigger descending inhibitory projections to the dorsal horn. Pain rating scores will be reflected in scores of 0-100, 0 being the least amount of pain and 100 being the most amount of pain.</description>
