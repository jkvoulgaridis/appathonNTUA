      The present study is to compare the onset and duration of rocuronium in late second trimester
      women and non-pregnant women undergoing general anesthesia.

      Pregnancy induces physiological changes. Plasma volume, cardiac output, hepatic blood flow
      and protein binding are changed from the first trimester of pregnancy. These physiological
      changes give effect to the onset and duration of neuromuscular blocking drugs.

      Rocuronium is a commonly used neuromuscular blocking drug categorized as FDA category B.
      Rocuronium is widely used for pregnant women. Previous studies have evaluated the onset and
      duration of rocuronium in postpartum women. Lately, the investigators have evaluated the
      onset and duration of rocuronium in early second trimester pregnant women and the duration
      was significantly longer in early second trimester women compared to non-pregnant women.

      Since there is little research on the onset and duration of rocuronium in the late second
      trimester pregnant women, the investigators planned the present research.
