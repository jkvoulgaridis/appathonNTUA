  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 40 million people in the US are served by private wells, many of which are
      untreated. The investigators estimate that 1.29 million cases of gastrointestinal illness
      (GI) per year are attributed to consuming water from untreated private wells in the US. These
      cases of GI can cause a significant burden in terms of health care costs and lost work/school
      days, as well as increased risk to developing longer term health complications. This impact
      is magnified when accounting for vulnerable populations such as children under the age of 5,
      the elderly and the immunocompromised. The investigators are preparing to conduct the first
      household randomized controlled trial (RCT) to investigate whether consuming well water
      treated by ultraviolet light (UV) compared to consuming untreated private well water
      decreases the incidence of self-reported gastrointestinal illness and respiratory infections
      in children under 5. The investigators will collect illness symptom data using a combination
      of weekly text messages and online illness questionnaires.

    <description>The investigators will collect data on the presence of gastrointestinal illness symptoms through weekly text messages. Households that report symptoms through text messages will be directed to an online illness questionnaire to characterize the symptoms (incidence, severity, duration, diarrhea, vomiting, coughing, etc.), febrile episodes, as well as relevant exposure information such as recent travel, exposure to ill persons, etc. Incident gastrointestinal illness (GI) is defined by the reporting of a minimum of three episodes of diarrhea or vomiting in a 24 hour period. Each illness will be considered distinct when separated by â‰¥ 6 symptom-free days.</description>
