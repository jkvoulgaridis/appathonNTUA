    <textblock>
      This study investigates physical changes in children with Dyslexia and Intellectual
      Disability. Participants divided into three groups and Body Posture, Postural Control and
      Hand Grip Strengths was evaluated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children with Intellectual Disability and Dyslexia have academic and behavioral problems but
      also they might have physical changes related to poor motor development.

      Three evaluation method was used in study. Postural Deformities were evaluated by
      PostureScreen Mobile App which is a mobile app allows to assess photographic body posture in
      four aspects (anterior, posterior, lateral) Postural Control was tested by Wii Balance Board.
      Wii balance board is a force plate that can measure person's center of gravity displacements
      Hand grip strength tested by Jamar Hand Dynamometer. It was completed according to American
      Hand Therapist's Association guidelines.

      All data collected from participants have analysed within the control group (typical
      developed children)
