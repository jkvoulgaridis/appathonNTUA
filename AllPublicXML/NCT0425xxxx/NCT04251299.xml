  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      &quot;Harvest for Health&quot; is a home-based vegetable gardening intervention that pairs cancer
      survivors with certified master gardeners (MGs) from the Cooperative Extension System, the
      education and outreach arm of land-grant universities nationwide.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Few lifestyle behavior change interventions have been successfully translated into practice.
      Addressing this research-to-practice gap is a significant research and public health
      priority. &quot;Harvest for Health&quot; is a home-based vegetable gardening intervention that pairs
      cancer survivors with certified Master Gardeners from the Cooperative Extension System. The
      parent study was started at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and is currently being
      conducted throughout the entire state of Alabama. Preliminary findings suggest that this
      intervention increases vegetable consumption and physical activity, and improves physical
      functioning and health-related quality of life. We propose a feasibility study to adapt this
      promising program to the multi-cultural population of cancer survivors and for the local
      context (physical, social, and cultural environment) of New Mexico. We will then implement
      the adapted program, &quot;Southwest Harvest for Health&quot; and evaluate feasibility, acceptability,
      and fidelity. The adaptation phase is a critical first step towards widespread dissemination,
      implementation, and scale-up of an evidence-based intervention.

    <description>Adaptation is &quot;the degree to which an intervention is modified in the process of its adoption and implementation.&quot; Adaptation requires a careful balance between achieving fit, i.e., modifying a program to meet the needs of a new target population or local context, and maintaining fidelity, i.e., minimizing changes that could negatively affect the program's effectiveness.
