  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label extension study trial of tDCS with a standardized guided imagery
      intervention. Up to 20 women with chronic pelvic pain, who completed participation in the
      initial randomized trial (IRB 2019-362) will be enrolled. Subjects will complete 5 tDCS
      treatments with guided imagery and a 1-week follow-up visit.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) is a common and often debilitating in women. It occurs below the
      umbilicus and is severe enough to cause functional impairment or require treatment.
      Transcranial Direct Stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique. As tDCS
      modulates nerve activity and connectivity, it is also expected to cause measurable changes in
      brain activity. Guided imagery is a form of hypnosis using words to direct one's thoughts and
      attention to imagined sensations. Guided imagery has demonstrated efficacy in reducing pain
      related to many conditions including cancer pain, chronic lower back pain, and post-operative
      pain. More information is needed to evaluate the effects of tDCS and guided imagery in the
      treatment of chronic pelvic pain.

      This study consists of one screening visit, 5 study intervention visits, and a 1-week
      follow-up visit. After obtaining informed consent, study staff will assess for changes in
      medical history an pelvic pain treatments since the end of participation in Part 1 (IRB
      2019-362). Urine will be collected for urinalysis and a urine pregnancy test will be
      collected for women of childbearing potential. If urinalysis and pregnancy test are negative,
      subjects will complete questionnaires, vitals, and a baseline EEG will be conducted.

      At the 5 interventional visits, transcranial direct stimulation (tDCS) with guided imagery
      will be delivered. A EEG will be completed after the 1st and 5th treatment visits. At each
      visit questionnaires will be administered and urine pregnancy test, if the woman is of
      childbearing potential. At the 1-week follow- up visit, an EEG will be performed,
      questionnaires administered.

    <description>Changes in subject-reported bother related to overactive bladder symptoms as measured by the Overactive Bladder Questionnaire short form (OAB-q SF). The OAB-q SF consists of two scales assessing symptom bother and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in patients with OAB.
