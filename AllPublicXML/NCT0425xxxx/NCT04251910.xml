  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an adaptive Phase 1b trial design. It is randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, multiple ascending dose study assessing efficacy, pharmacokinetics,
      safety and tolerability of BXCL-501 dosing in adult (65 years and older) males and females
      with acute agitation associated with dementia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, ascending dose finding study
      assessing efficacy, pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of BXCL501 with 3 dosing groups
      in adult (65 years and older) males and females with acute agitation associated with all
      forms of dementia. Evaluation of three (3) doses of sublingual BXCL 501 are planned. Cohort
      1, Cohort 2 and Cohort 3 will be given 30µg, 60µg and 90µg dose respectively of BXCL501 or
      placebo. This is an adaptive design as doses selected for testing may be different from
      these, based upon safety reviews. Doses lower or higher may be chosen to test, up to 180µg.
      BXCL501 films may be divided in half if needed to deliver half-dose strengths. At least 30
      subjects (10 per cohort) will be enrolled at up to 3 study sites in the United States. The
      effects of BXCL 501 on acute agitation will be assessed by the following scales: Pittsburgh
      Agitation Scale (PAS), the PANSS-EC (PEC), Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI),
      CGI-Severity for Agitation and CGI Improvement for Agitation. Adverse Events (AEs), clinical
      laboratory tests, ECG, and vital signs will be monitored, and all observed.
