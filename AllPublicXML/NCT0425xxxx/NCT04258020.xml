  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At the time of weaning from mechanical ventilation, patients with heart and/or lung
      conditions will be given oxygen support with alternating bilevel positive airway pressure
      (BiPAP; oxygen via face mask) and heated high flow nasal cannula oxygen (HFNC; oxygen via
      nasal cannula) to see if this method reduces the likelihood of re-intubation.

    <textblock>
      It is clinically challenging to predict when patients can be successfully removed from
      mechanical ventilation (MV). Liberating high-risk patients such as the elderly and those with
      complex, chronic cardiac or pulmonary diseases from MV is particularly challenging.

      Evidence from randomized trials and meta-analyses suggests that the type of postextubation
      supportive care provided, such as oxygen delivery via nose or mouth, may affect the risk of
      reintubation. However, it is unclear which of many possible postextubation management
      protocols results in the best patient outcomes, particularly for this subset of high-risk
      patients.

      The purpose of this study is therefore to assess a standardized combined protocol of
      postextubation oxygen delivery consisting of early, alternating BiPAP with HFNC over 24 hours
      following extubation. BiPAP and HFNC are both currently provided to patients as standard of
      care, based on clinician judgement; however, the timing and nature of the methods are
      variable.
