  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Venous thromboembolism (VTE), comprising deep venous thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism
      (PE), or both, is a life-threatening complication in postoperative patients. VTE has been
      estimated an incidence ranged from 79 per 100000 to 269 per 100000 population1. The incidence
      of VTE rises up to 3.0% in average among all postoperative neurosurgical patients in recent
      studies, but the number varies in a large range according to primary diseases. This
      cross-sectional study was aimed to investigate the incidence, associated risk factors,
      prophylaxis, treatment, and outcomes of VTE in a large clinical neurosurgery center in China.

      Venous thromboembolism (VTE), comprising deep venous thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism
      (PE), or both, is a life-threatening complication in postoperative patients. This
      cross-sectional study was aimed to investigate the incidence, associated risk factors,
      prophylaxis, treatment, and outcomes of VTE in a large clinical neurosurgery center in China.
      9010 patients underwent neurosurgery procedure were included. Distribution of age, sex,
      whether received PICC during perioperative period, and some special primary diseases are
      significantly different between VTE and non-VTE patients. Student's test and chi-square test
      were performed for analyses. We investigated VTE incidence, risk factors, prophylaxes,
      treatment and outcomes in postoperative neurosurgical patients, and summarized the VTE
      susceptible population of the patients, providing a VTE patient profile for neurosurgeons to
      concern.

        9010 patients underwent neurosurgery procedure were included from Jun 1, 2018 to Dec 31,
        2019 in Huashan Hospital. Clinical data about demographic information, VTE incidence,
        primary diseases, laboratory indexes, treatment, and outcomes were collected.
