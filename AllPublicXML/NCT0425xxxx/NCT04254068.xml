  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parents with eating disorders exhibit greater concerns and dilemmas about developing healthy
      habits in their children. Studies indicate that the offspring of parents with eating
      disorders have more developmental and interpersonal difficulties. Consequently, these parents
      should receive personalized care to enhance their parental capacity and support them in their
      decision making process. The Parent-Based Prevention of Eating Disorders (PBP) is a promising
      intervention that may help improve feeding and eating practices and children outcomes, by
      engaging both parents in a short-term program. This study aims to empirically evaluate the
      feasibility and acceptability of PBP over a wait-list control group (i.e.,
      treatment-as-usual) in a Randomized Case Series Trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A parental history of an eating disorder is linked with greater risk of eating and
      socio-emotional problems in the offspring, and more stressful parent-child interactions.
      Further, parenting concerns often exacerbate existing eating disorder symptoms in parents.
      Parent-Based Prevention (PBP-B) is a focused intervention aimed to support parents with
      eating disorders and their partners in developing healthy eating and lifestyle behaviors in
      their children. The program also focuses on reducing mealtime conflict and improving couple
      communication. This study tests the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary outcomes of
      the Parent-Based Prevention (PBP) program for these parents and their partners. Parents with
      any lifetime eating disorder diagnosis who have at least one child 1-5 years old will be
      randomized to receive PBP immediately or following a 16-week waitlist period. This study will
      investigate whether PBP is feasible, acceptable, and associated with improvement in
      short-term outcomes that predict long term risks of eating and weight disorders (e.g.,
      parental cognition associated with feeding practices and child eating behaviors and
      socio-emotional symptoms). The study will collect important case series data that will inform
      the design of larger, adequately powered studies to test ways to reduce the likelihood of
      eating and weight difficulties in the offspring of parents with eating disorders.

    <description>Parent-Based Prevention (PBP; Sadeh-Sharvit &amp; Lock, 2018) is a manualized preventive intervention, focused on increasing parental awareness and competence to facilitate healthy eating habits, body image, and self-regulation in children whose parent has an eating disorder history. PBP is comprised of three phases that focus on unique goals. The strategies in each session include psycho-education, behavioral experiment planning, and skill practicing to augment parents' insight into how the context of the parental cognitions and behaviors may impact child outcomes, with the goal of creating a longstanding effect.</description>
