  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For locally advanced gastric cancer (cT3-4aN+M0), neoadjuvant chemotherapy can downstage T
      and N stage, increase the resectability of tumor, and finally improve the long-term survival.
      Combination of perioperative PD-1 antibody and chemotherapy for locally advanced gastric
      cancer could be a novel therapy to increase response rate and resectability and reduce
      recurrence rate. JS001 in this study is a Chinese anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody for injection
      which has been approved for melanoma. This study is a multi-center, open-label, randomized
      phase II clinical trial to evaluate tolerability, safety and efficacy of JS001 in combination
      with perioperative chemotherapy in locally advanced gastric cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gastric cancer is one of the most common malignancies in China with incidence and mortality
      both ranking the 2nd among malignancies in China. Surgery is the only possible way to cure
      gastric cancer, however, over 80-90% of gastric cancer patients in China are in advanced
      stage. Locally advanced gastric cancer (cT3-4aN+M0) could be cured by multi-disciplinary
      therapies including surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy can
      downstage T and N stage, increase the resectability of tumor, and finally improve the
      long-term survival. However, the therapeutic effects remain unsatisfactory. PD-1 antibody has
      demonstrated its efficacy in metastatic gastric cancer and has been proved to be effective in
      neoadjuvant setting in lung cancer and melanoma. Combination of perioperative PD-1 antibody
      and chemotherapy for locally advanced gastric cancer could be a novel therapy to increase
      response rate and resectability and reduce recurrence rate. JS001 in this study is a Chinese
      anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody for injection which has been approved for melanoma. This study
      is a multi-center, open-label, randomized phase II clinical trial to evaluate tolerability,
      safety and efficacy of JS001 in combination with perioperative chemotherapy in locally
      advanced gastric cancer.
