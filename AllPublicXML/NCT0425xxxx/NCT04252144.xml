  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to assess food diversity and dietary patterns in Russian GERD
      patients
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study of dietary patterns may provide complex vision of an association between
      consumption of specific foods, or groups of food products and manifestations of
      gastroesophageal reflux disease (symptoms: heartburn and acid regurgitation; endoscopic
      findings - oesophagitis). Only limited data on this matter are published to the moment and
      they predominantly concerns outcomes of gastroesophageal reflux disease (oesophageal
      adenocarcinoma or Barrett's oesophagus). Taking into the consideration that earlier studies
      found significant differences in consumption of nutrients in different world regions, new
      data on food patterns of dietary patterns in Russian GERD patients could partly fill in the
      gap of knowledge on this particular matter.
