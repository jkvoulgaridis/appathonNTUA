  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 4-week pilot, multicenter, randomized, double-blinded placebo controlled trial of
      hydroxocobalamin and butyrate in ulcerative colitis (UC) that will occur in two phases. The
      main objectives of this study are to determine the capacity of hydroxocobalamin and butyrate
      to reduce calprotectin in those with inflammatory disease in UC to determine the safety and
      preferential dose of hydroxocobalamin with butyrate in UC.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine the preferable dose of hydroxocobalamin in a 4-week
      pilot study in patients with UC and determine if this approach can reduce stool calprotectin.
      Before going forward with a larger efficacy trial, the investigators are first aiming to
      determine if the supplements/medications we are proposing to use are sufficient to reduce a
      biomarker. Consequently, this study will look at a more easily measurable biomarker to
      provide evidence that the dosing is sufficient.

      This pilot study will be conducted to assess preferable dose of hydroxocobalamin based on
      reduction of calprotectin. The investigators aim to determine if this reduction is sustained
      over time and is correlated to changes in clinical disease activity.

    <description>In phase 1, patients will take hydroxocobalamin at 1g daily for four weeks. This will be in the form of 1 500mg capsule twice a day. Butyrate will be 240 mg daily in a divided dose (120 mg twice daily) which is 5 pills twice a day.
In phase 2, the dose of hydroxocobalamin will be increased to 2g daily (1g twice a day) for four weeks pending FDA approval. Butyrate will remain at 240 mg daily in a divided dose (120 mg twice daily) which is 5 pills twice a day. Patients will undergo flexible sigmoidoscopy at baseline and at week four in phase 2.</description>
