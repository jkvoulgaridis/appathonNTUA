      The aim of this 12-month clinical study is to treat patients affected by gum disease
      (periodontitis) by a minor gum surgery that aims to reduce the depth of the gum pockets. In
      particular, the study will compare two types of gum surgery, one based on the use of a
      product derived from the patients' own blood (PRGF, platelet autologous concentrate), and the
      other based on the use of an animal-derived bone graft and membrane that have been in the
      market for the past 30 years. Both procedures aim to regenerate bone and gum tissue that is
      damaged by the disease. 74, ≥ 25-year-old, otherwise healthy, patients affected by gum
      disease will be recruited at the Barts and The London Dental Hospital. Participants will be
      randomly (by chance) assigned to receive one of the two treatments. Throughout the study, we
      will assess gum's health by taking some measurements around teeth and gums. In addition, we
      will use non-invasive technologies to assess changes in temperature, blood flow and face's
      swelling at different time-points. Patients will be given specific questionnaires to evaluate
      their preferences and the impact that each surgical treatment had in their everyday life. One
      intra-oral x-ray will be performed before the surgery and after 12 months to assess if new
      bone has formed around the teeth involved in the surgery, as per standard procedure.

      This is a randomized, single-blind, parallel-group controlled trial comparing the efficacy of
      GTR and PRGF ENDORET in the treatment of periodontal intrabony defects. The trial will follow
      the recommendations of the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement.

      No negative control (SPPF alone) has been considered for this project since several studies
      have demonstrated that guided tissue regeneration (GTR) associated or not with bone grafts
      results in better clinical outcomes than access flap alone in the treatment of periodontal
      intrabony defects.

      The study consists of 9 visits over a minimum period of 13 months and will take place at the
      Centre for Oral Clinical Research (COCR), at the Institute of Dentistry, Barts and The London
      School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London.

    <description>The OIDP is a well validated and frequently used PROM in studies of oral health. It is a composite measure of the impacts of oral health on the quality of life of people. The OIDP focuses on the impact that the conditions of the teeth and mouth have on the physical (functional), psychological and social wellbeing of the person. More specifically, it assesses the impact of oral conditions on basic daily life activities and behaviours (eating, speaking, cleaning teeth, going out, relaxing, smiling, major work or role, emotional stability, social contact). For each performance, both the frequency and severity of oral impacts are assessed. The overall OIDP score ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating worse quality of life.</description>

    <description>Global ratings on health and quality of life will be provided through two methods:
a) the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) included in the EQ5D questionnaire. b) through the following question: 'How would you rate the quality of your life'?
The responses will be scored on a six-point scale as:
Excellent

    <description>The extent of discomfort and/or pain experienced will be evaluated using a 100-mm horizontal visual analog scale (VAS). The anchors for each end of the scales will be designated as none and extreme. Patients will be also instructed to quantify the analgesic medication taken. In addition, the extent of discomfort, root hypersensitivity, oedema, hematoma, high fever, and interference in daily activities during the first post-therapy week will be evaluated in the same way.</description>

    <description>The vascularization pattern of the peri-implant soft tissues will be evaluated with Laser Speckle Contrast Imaging (LSCI), according to the methodology described by previous studies. LSCI is a radiation-free, non-invasive procedure to assess blood flow. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure as well as pulse rate will be measured with an automatic blood pressure monitor before and after the LSCI measurements. These measures will be combined to give a measure of blood flow to assess patients' vascularization pattern of the peri-implant soft tissues. Each patient will seat comfortably in supine position in a dental chair, and a vacuum pillow will be used for fixing their head. The patient will be left undisturbed for 15 minutes before any measurements will be taken. All measurements will be carried out at a constant room temperature.</description>

    <description>A simplified papilla preservation flap (SPPF) will be performed. The clot phase of PRGF ENDORET (F2) will be placed in the defect, while the fibrin membrane phase (F1) will cover it.
Blood will be extracted and collected in dedicated tubes and then centrifuged. Up to 8 tubes of 9ml will be extracted. The time from the start of the extraction to the start of the centrifugation of the tubes must not exceed 4mins.
After centrifugation, the blood is separated into three components: Plasma rich in growth factors, White cells or leukocytes, red blood cells: this is the red column occupying the bottom of the tube.
Following BTI's instructions, fractioning of the centrifuged blood will be performed in order to separate Fraction 2 (F2), which contains a greater number of platelets and growth factors and will be used as a clot inside the periodontal defect from Fraction 1 (F1), which will be used as a fibrin member to cover the clot. The flaps will be repositioned and sutured.</description>
