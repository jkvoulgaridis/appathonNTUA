      Aging decreases the physical fitness levels in living beings. The environmental factors also
      have a major effect on the physical fitness levels. The objective of this study was to
      compare the physical fitness levels of nursing home residents and community-dwelling elderly
      people. This study employed 118 participants, who consisted of nursing home residents and
      community-dwelling elderly people. The physical fitness levels of the elderly people were
      measured by Senior Fitness Test. The physical fitness levels of the elderly people were
      measured by Senior Fitness Test. Chair stand test, arm curl test, 2-minute step test, chair
      sit and reach test, back-scratch test, 8-foot up and go test and body mass index were
      measured.

    <description>The distance from the iliac crest to the midpoint of the patella was measured by a tape to determine the knee-stepping height. The midpoint of the distance between these two anatomical structures was determined. The height of the determined point from the ground was measured and marked on the wall. The participant was asked to begin stepping as quickly as possible to reach the marked height for two minutes. The total number of correct dominant side steps was recorded. If any of the participant's steps (right or left) did not reach the target height, those steps were considered invalid.</description>

    <description>Chair stand test:The number of full stands performed on a seated position that can be completed within 30 seconds was recorded.
Arm curl test: The participants were asked to lift weights starting with a full elbow extension and then full flexion.
2-minute step test: The participant was asked to begin stepping as quickly as possible to reach the marked height for two minutes.
Chair sit-and-reach test:The participant could extend right or left knee to a full extension, heel on the floor and ankle in a neutral position of 90 degrees. Then, the participant was asked to reach to the toes.
Back-scratch test:The participant was asked to stand up and place his/her preferred hand over the same shoulder, palm down and fingers extended, and reach down the middle of the back as far as possible.
8-foot up and go test:The participant was asked to get up from a chair without any arm support and walk a distance of 2.44 meters; then turn around a cone and come back to sit down on the chair.</description>
