    <description>Subjects diagnosed with breast cancer undergoing 3 months of taxane based chemotherapy will be provided Elasto Gel® Therapy Mittens and Foot Wraps to be worn on both hands and feet at each chemotherapy infusion during their three months of treatment. Subjects will start wearing the mittens and foot wraps 15 minutes prior to each infusion, during the entire infusion, and for 15 minutes after the completion of each infusion. We will assess for peripheral neuropathy, physical functioning, and quality of life prior to initiation of taxane based therapy, immediately after completion of taxane based chemotherapy, and again at 3 months following completion of therapy.</description>
