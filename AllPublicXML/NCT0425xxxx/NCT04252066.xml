      This is a global prospective observational study of women with Fabry disease and their
      infants during pregnancy and/or breastfeeding. The study will evaluate outcomes of pregnancy
      and/or breastfeeding in women and infants exposed to migalastat. All pregnant women with
      Fabry disease are eligible to enroll, an unexposed cohort potentially can be used for
      comparisons.

      Cases will be reported voluntarily to the Pregnancy Coordinating Center (PCC) from any
      country by Healthcare Providers (HCPs), by patients and secondary contacts. The PCC will
      follow patients throughout their pregnancies and/or breastfeeding and infant through 1 year
      of age.

      There will be 2 cohorts enrolled in the study. Cohort 1 will be pregnant and/or breastfeeding
      patients who have Fabry Disease, and have been exposed to at least 1 dose of migalastat
      during pregnancy and/or breastfeeding. Cohort 2 will be pregnant and/or breastfeeding
      patients who have Fabry Disease, who were not exposed to migalastat during pregnancy and/or
      breastfeeding.

      This is an observational study, it will enroll patients and collect data as described in this
      protocol for a minimum of 10 years.
