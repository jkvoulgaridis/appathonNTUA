  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human (FIH), Phase 1, single-center, randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, single dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK,
      PD, and immunogenicity of AK120 following SC administration in healthy subjects. The study
      will consist of 5 cohorts of healthy subjects. Eight subjects will be enrolled per cohort,
      randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive a single dose of either the active drug AK120 (N=6) or
      matching placebo (N=2). Approximately 40 subjects (30 receiving active drug and 10 receiving
      placebo) will participate in this study.

             screening, and a total body weight ≥50 kg for men or ≥45 kg for women at screening and
             Day -1 before randomization.

          4. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening
             and on Day -1 before randomization, or either be of non-childbearing potential.

             coccidioidomycosis prior to screening, or a history of any other infectious disease
             within 4 weeks prior to screening that, in the opinion of the Investigator, affects

             mmHg (diastolic), the BP measurements should be repeated 2 more times and the average
             of the 3 BP values should be used to determine the subject's eligibility.

         23. Have had a live vaccination within 12 weeks prior to the study dosing or intend to
