    <textblock>
      The goal of this research study is to compare the effects of pelvic alignment versus
      diaphragmatic breathing on range of motion in the shoulder joint in both athletic and
      nonathletic population. The investigators plan to have approximately 45 participants to take
      part in this study. Subjects will be assigned into three groups. Group 1 will perform both
      pelvic alignment and diaphragmatic breathing exercises. This group will be used as the
      standard or control group. Group 2 will perform pelvic alignment exercise only; and Group 3
      will perform diaphragmatic exercises only. The shoulder internal rotation range will be
      assessed in all three groups. Maximal expiratory rate will be measured in group 3 to assure
      improved diaphragmatic breathing in subjects. The shoulder internal rotation range in group 2
      &amp; 3 will be compared to the shoulder range of motion in the standard group.

      Study design This study is a randomized, blinded, pretest-posttest control group experimental
      design comparing the effects of pelvic alignment vs. diaphragmatic breathing on Glenohumeral
      Internal Rotation Deficit (GIRD). Protection of the subjects' rights will be secured through
      a signed informed consent form approved by the university Institutional Review Board.

      Subject selection, randomization, and blinding process: Using statistical power analysis 45
      healthy, college aged participants are needed for this study. These subjects will be
      volunteers and recruited by word of mouth by campus professors, coaches and physical therapy
      students and faculty.

      Intervention timeline: Baseline assessment (pretest), five treatment sessions and a posttest.
      The time required by subjects will be between five and seven days total with each immediately
      succeeding the next. Treatment sessions will be approximately 10 minutes each. If any portion
      of this timeline happens to fall outside of the university operational hours, then the
      intervention will resume the following day. Subjects will be informed of their rights to
      receive the results of their assessments following the conclusion of the study. Two of the
      investigators will perform the initial screenings, groups assignments and treatments for all
      subjects. The other two investigators, who are blinded on participant's group assignment will
      perform all pretest and posttest measurements. Intraclass Correlation Coefficient model (3,3)
      will be used, in a pilot study, to assess inter-rater and intra-rater reliability for all
      testing procedures.

      Testing Procedures:

      The primary measurements include Ober's test, assessment of shoulder internal rotation range
      of motion, and spirometry measurements of maximal expiratory rate.

      Range of motion assessment: A Cybex isokinetic table will be used to measure passive shoulder
      internal rotation range of motion. The Cybex will provide standardized arm position and
      accurate digital measurement of the shoulder internal rotation bilaterally. All pretest and
      posttest ROM measurements will be performed by the same examiners.

      Pelvic alignment assessment: Ober's test will be used to assess pelvic alignment. Although
      this test is widely known as an assessment of iliotibial band/fascia lata length, it was
      originally used to assess pelvic alignment. It has been suggested that a unilateral positive
      Ober's test is indicative of hemipelvic anterior tilt and forward rotation, which leads to a
      bony block of the rim of the acetabulum on the femoral neck. This bony block would decrease
      the amount of adduction, leading to a positive Ober's test.

      Craig's test will be used during the screening process to assess presence of excessive
      femoral anteversion angle.

      Spirometry: A digital spirometer is used for measuring maximal expiratory rate.

      Treatment Procedures:

      Neuromuscular Exercise for combined Pelvic Alignment and Diaphragmatic Breathing:

      Pelvic alignment and diaphragmatic breathing exercise included simultaneous activation of the
      hamstring, hip adductor and transverse abdominal muscles with forceful exhalation.

      Pelvic Alignment Exercises: Pelvic alignment involves simultaneous activation of the
      hamstring muscles and hip adductors to reset pelvic symmetry.

      Diaphragmatic Breathing exercise: Diaphragmatic breathing involves subject education for
      simultaneous rise of chest and abdominal wall with inhalation.

    <description>A Cybex isokinetic table will be used for standard positioning of the participants's arm. the participant will be positioned in supine, with his/her arm supported on the dynamometer's arm for shoulder assessment. Shoulder internal rotation range of motion will be assessed using the digital goniometer incorporated into the cybex dynamometer.</description>

    <description>A digital spirometer (EasyOne Plus Diagnostic Spirometry System) will be use for assessing maximal expiratory rate. A maximal expiratory test will be performed with the subject in sitting. A nose clip will be used to ensure all air is going into the manometer. Our measurements will be taken from total lung capacity, so the subject will first fully inhale, then fully exhale, pausing for 1-2 seconds at the end.</description>

    <description>The participant will be in supine with feet flat on a wall and the knees and hips flexed to 90 degrees. A standard 5&quot; ball will be placed between the knees. The participant will hold a standard 9-inch balloon in the mouth with one hand. The subject will be instructed to isometrically contract the hamstrings to lift the ischium off the table while maintaining a posterior pelvic tilt. In this position, subject will be instructed to perform isometric hip adduction by squeezing the ball placed between the knees. The subject will then be instructed to breathe in through the nose and blow the air out into the balloon with full exhalation to activate the transverse and oblique abdominals. The participant will hold the breath for 3 seconds while maintaining hamstring contraction, adductor contraction, and transverse and oblique abdominal contraction. This process will be repeated four times. This exercise will be performed once daily under the supervision of the therapist for 5 days.</description>

    <description>The participant will be positioned supine with their feet flat on a wall and the knees and hips flexed to 90 degrees. The subject will be instructed to isometrically contract the hamstrings to allow the ischial tuberosities to lift off the table while also maintaining a posterior pelvic tilt. The tailbone should be slightly lifted off the table, the abdominal muscles should be relaxed, and the low back should be flat on the table. While maintaining the posterior pelvic tilt, the subject will be instructed to perform isometric hip adduction by squeezing the ball that is placed between the knees. The subject will hold for 3 seconds and then relax. This process will be repeated four times. This exercise will be performed daily under the supervision of the therapist for 5 days.</description>

    <description>For diaphragmatic breathing exercise, the subject will be in supine position. The investigator places both hands around the participant's lower ribs and abdominal area. The investigator applies slight manual resistance to the chest and abdominal wall during inhalation phase of breathing.The participant is instructed to apply outward pressure against the investigator resistance and to raise the chest and abdominal wall simultaneously with inhalation. Then participants performs a full exhalation and hold his/her breath for 3 seconds before breathing in again. This process is repeated for 4 breathing cycles. Participants will perform this exercise once a day under investigator supervision.</description>
