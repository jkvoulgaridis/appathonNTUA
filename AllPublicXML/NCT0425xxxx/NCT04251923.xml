  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prevalence of pelvic organ prolapsed is high in Nepal. After prolapse surgery many patients
      are affected with incontinence. Incontinence has physical, social and mental effect to the
      individual. This study is designed to know the role for mid urethral sling during vaginal
      prolapse surgery to decrease the rate of incontinence after the surgery.

      Aim: To de termine the effect of mid urethral sling in reducing postoperative incontinence
      after vaginal prolapse surgery.

      General Objectives: To compare the risk of de novo postoperative incontinence between
      prolapsed surgery with mid urethral sling versus no sling.

      Specific Objectives: to compare the change in score of BFLUTS-SF (Bristol Female lower
      urinary tract symptoms- sexual function) and UDI-6 (Urinary distress inventory-6) pre and
      post surgery between the two groups.

      Research Hypothesis: The use of mid urethral sling after vaginal prolapse surgery has role in
      reduction of postoperative incontinence.

      Materials &amp; Methods:

        1. Whether study involves humans/animals or both : Humans

        2. Population/ participants: Patients with pelvic organ prolapse who are planned for
           vaginal prolapse surgery in BPKIHS (BP Koirala Institute of Health and Sciences).

        3. Type of study design: a randomized controlled trial

      (e) Expected sample size: 54 Sample size calculation: Previous study done by Control groups:
      Patient undergoing vaginal prolapse surgery only without mid urethral sling. There will be
      small incision in the suprapubic region that mimics the TVT incision.

      (f) Probable duration of study: one and half year (g) Setting: BPKIHS, Department of
      Obstetrics and Gynecology (h) Parameter/Variables to be applied/ measured: Age, BMI, POPQ
      (Pelvic organ prolapse quantification) stage, menopause, ESST (Empty supine stress test).

      (i) Outcome measures: LUTS score, UDI-6 score, SUI (stress urinary incontinence), Voiding
      dysfunction, dyspareunia, satisfaction, Complications like bladder injury, hemorrhage.

      (j) Rationale for statistical methods to be employed: attached (k) Ethical clearance: Study
      will be started after getting clearance from the IRC (Institutional review committee) of
      BPKIHS .

      (l) Permission to use copyright questionnaire/Proforma: Pre designed Proforma and
      questionnaire will be used to collect the data. The internationally valid questionnaire in
      English will be validated in Nepali language first and then it will be used.

      (m) Maintain the confidentiality of subject: The confidentiality of the patients will be
      maintained throughout the research.

    <intervention_model_description>If patient gives consent and falls on selection criteria (inclusion and exclusion), she will be enrolled for randomization. Written informed consent will be taken. Computer generated simple randomization will be done.filled. POP-Q, Occult SUI and ESST will be checked and noted. This will be done by one of the researcher. Surgery will be performed by one of the researcher. Both Group I and Group II patients will undergo vaginal hysterectomy with McCall's culdoplasty and anterior repair with or without posterior repair according to the need. Patient who falls in Group I will undergo midurethral sling with tension free vaginal tape (TVT).
Patient will be followed up at 3 and 6 months. The primary outcome of the study will be the difference in SUI. Secondary outcomes will be BFLUTS AND udi-6 SCORE, voiding dysfunction, dyspareunia, patient satisfaction and complications during surgery.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The primary outcome of the study will be the presence of stress urinary incontinence in post operative at 3 months follow up. During follow up patient will be asked about the urinary incontinence on coughing, sneezing, heavy work and will examined in comfortably full bladder and cough stress test will be done to confirm the diagnosis of stress urinary incontinence.</description>

    <measure>1) BFLUTS-FS (frequency symptoms), VS(voiding symptoms), IS (Irritable symptoms), Sex symptoms , QoL (Quality of life) score 2) UDI-6 (Urinary distress inventory-6) score 3) Complications during surgery 4) Dyspareunia 5) Pelvic pain</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The main two questionnaires used in this study are BFLUTS-SF and UDI-6. BFLUTS-SF has five different section
BFLUTS- FS: frequency symptoms and score ranges from 0-15, VS: voiding symptoms and score is from 0-12 IS: irritable bladder symptoms and score is from 0-20. . sex: sexual symptoms and score is from 0-6. QoL: quality of life due to bladder symptoms and score is from 0-18.
UDI-6 score: quality of life due to bladder symptoms. Score range from 0-18. Severity increases as score increases in each section. High score denotes patient are highly affected due to bladder problems.
Complications are noted hemorrhage, bladder injury, prolonged catheterization, urinary retention, need of mesh removal Remote complications: mesh erosion, Dyspareunia, pelvic pain, these complications will be noted. For pelvic pain visual analogue scale will be used, score having 1-10; 0, being least to 10 being the maximum.</description>
