  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nowadays, the incidence of stroke in China has reached 1.6‰, and this disease has become a
      primary cause of death in China. One of its major risk factors is hypertension. As shown in
      the researches, the risk of stroke grows remarkably when the blood pressure increases and
      there exists a log-linear relationship between them. Systolic pressure and diastolic pressure
      relate to the risk of stroke independently. Systolic pressure decreasing 10mmHg will reduce
      the stroke risk by 31% and a decrease of 1~3mmHg will reduce the stroke risk by20~30%. As to
      diastolic pressure, a 5mmHg decrease will reduce the stroke risk by 34% and a 10mmHg decrease
      will reduce the stroke risk by 56%.In addition, patients with isolated systolic hypertension
      (SPB≥160mmHg, DPB≤90mmHg) or critical isolated systolic hypertension (SPB=140~159mmHg, DPB&lt;
      90mmHg) will suffer a higher risk of stroke than people with normal blood pressure. The ACC
      has already revised its Hypertension ManagementGuidelines of the standard of diagnosis for
      hypertension and the timing of starting medical treatment in hypertensive patients. Because
      more and more researches shown that people with blood pressure between 120-139/80-89mmHg have
      higher risk of ASCVSD compared to those with blood pressure lower than120/80mmHg; However, in
      China, the diagnostic criteria for hypertension has not been revised yet. Therefore, we still
      have a blind spot in treating such patients who suffer from borderline systolic hypertension
      at 130~140 mmHg of blood-pressure with or without ASCVD or those with the first stage
      hypertension but refusing to take anti-hypertension drugs. What is more, most of them are
      middle-aged adults, once they have a stroke, it would lead to terrible and costly
      consequences to both their family and society. Thus, it is necessary to explore new
      non-pharmacological methods to control blood pressure for reducing the risk of stroke

    <description>Device: remote ischemic conditioningRIC is a physical strategy performed by an electric auto-control device with cuffs placed on unilateral arms and inflated to 200 mmHg for 5-min followed by deflation for 5-min, the procedures are performed repeatedly for 5 times# two times per day. The duration of the treatment is 30+/-2days. Other Names:• RICDevice: ambulatory blood pressure monitoring diagnostic technique for measuring blood pressure in daily life by means of automatic intermittent timing. Because ABPM has overcome the limitations of clinic blood pressure measurement, observation error and white coat effect, it can objectively reflect the actual level and fluctuation of blood pressure. Each patient of the two arms will use ABPM measure blood pressure before and after RIC or sham RIC treatment</description>
