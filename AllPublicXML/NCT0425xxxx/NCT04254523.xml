  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epidural analgesia is an efficient way to relieve pain after major abdominal surgery. Two
      different protocols are used to provide analgesia: continuous epidural infusion (CEI) and
      programmed intermittent boluses (PIEB). CEI consists in the delivery of a continuous
      administration of the intended hourly dose. PIEB consists in the administration of sequential
      high pressure boluses of the intended dose. Although some studies in the postoperative
      setting have observed that PIEB reduces the total dose needed to ensure adequate pain
      control, the clinical value of this finding is still uncertain. Moreover, nursing and medical
      interventions to the epidural infusion rates are frequently needed in the first 48
      postoperative hours to optimize the provision of analgesia. These interventions add to the
      already important nursing workload associated with major abdominal surgery, and are
      correlated with suboptimal analgesia for the patient.

      This randomized controlled trial aims to compare the effect of epidural PIEB on the workload
      as a reflection of adequate analgesia compared to the standard CEI protocol in use. The
      investigators hypothesize that the use of PIEB decreases the number of interventions needed
      to obtain adequate analgesia.
