  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Emotional problems such as symptoms of depression, anxiety and psychosocial
      distress are the leading contributors to health burden among adolescents worldwide. There is
      an urgent need for evidence-based psychological interventions for young people, especially
      those living in adversity. WHO has developed Early Adolescent Skills for Emotions (EASE), a
      brief group psychological intervention delivered by non-specialist providers for young
      adolescents impaired by distress and exposed to adversity. We aim to evaluate the feasibility
      of delivering EASE for young adolescents living in public schools of rural Rawalpindi,
      Pakistan.

      Objectives: To evaluate the feasibility of delivering Early Adolescent Skills for Emotions
      (EASE) program to young adolescents and their caregivers in Rawalpindi, Pakistan to inform
      the design, including sample size estimation, for a full-scale adequately powered definitive
      cluster randomised controlled trial.

      Methods: A two arm, single blind, pilot cluster randomized controlled trial will be conducted
      with adolescents of both gender (aged 13-15 years) with high psychological distress, studying
      in grade 8 and 9th of middle and high public school in rural Rawalpindi.

      Schools will be the units of randomization. 8 public schools, stratified by gender, will be
      randomized into EASE plus Treatment as Usual (TAU) (n=4) and TAU alone (n=6). 60 young
      adolescents at-risk of psychosocial distress as assessed by Self-Reported-Pediatric Symptom
      Checklist (PSC), cut-off ≥28 will be included in the study. No power calculations have been
      calculated for the present pilot trial; however, the sample will be adequate to inform the
      parameters of planned definitive cRCT. In the intervention arm, adolescents will receive
      7-weekly group sessions and their caregivers will receive 3-weekly group sessions in public
      schools. Data on the number of outcomes will be collected at baseline, immediately and
      3-months' post-intervention follow-up. The findings will inform the sample size required for
      a definitive trial. A detailed mixed-methods process evaluation will be conducted to identify
      areas of improvements prior to proceeding to a definitive cRCT.

      Discussion: The results of pilot trial will be used to inform the design of definitive
      cluster randomized controlled trial in government led scaled-up implementation of healthy
      school initiative in Rawalpindi district of Pakistan.

    <time_frame>At baseline, immediate and 3- months' post-intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>It assesses perceived emotional support. Respondents are instructed to list the gender and first initial of three important people in each of three relationship categories: family members, non-family adults, and friends. Using a four-point scale (hardly at all to very much), respondents answer the following questions about each person listed: &quot;How much do you talk to them about personal concerns?&quot; &quot;How close do you feel to them?&quot; and &quot;How satisfied are you with the help and support they give you?&quot; How much do they talk to you about their concerns? Three support variables are created by averaging all ratings for all persons listed within each relationship category: perceived support from family, non-family adults, and peers. Scores range from 1 to 4.</description>

    <description>Pediatric Quality of Life (PedsQL) (Varni, Seid &amp; Rode, 1999) will be used to measure child's health related quality of life during the past month. The scale measures child´s quality of health on four subscales namely, physical functioning, emotional functioning, social functioning and school functioning. The items are rated on 4 points Likert scale ranging from (1) 'no problem' to (4) 'almost always a problem'. Items are then reverse-scored and linearly transformed to a 0-100, so that higher scores indicate better quality of life. This tool yields a total score (all 23 items), physical health summary score (8 items), psycho-social health summary score (10 items) and school functioning score (5 items).</description>

    <description>EASE has been developed to manage and reduce symptoms of depression, anxiety and distress in adolescents. EASE is designed to be delivered by non-specialists in low resource settings such as a trained school-health counsellor. The intervention comprises of 7 young adolescent group sessions, each lasting 90 minutes and involves the empirically supported components of psycho education, problem solving, stress management (slow breathing), behavioural activation, and relapse prevention and 3 caregiver group sessions, each lasting 120 minutes and involve psycho education, active listening, quality time, praise, caregiver self-care and relapse prevention.</description>

        The study participants will be 60 adolescents (aged 13-15), at-risk of psycho-social
        distress as assessed by self-reported Pediatric Symptoms Check list (score ≥ 28); studying
        in public schools of rural Rawalpindi, Pakistan and their primary caregivers. To estimate
        the magnitude of treatment effect and its variation for a sample size calculation in the
        definitive trial, a pilot study sample size of 24 - 50 has been recommended (Browne, 1995;
        Julious 2005). With a sample size of 60 (30 per arm), we aim to generate some reliable
        estimate of treatment effect as well as recruitment and attrition rates.

        Adolescents in need of acute protection (at high risk of abuse or harm to self or others)
        and who require immediate or ongoing medical or psychiatric care reported by parents will
        be excluded from the study.
