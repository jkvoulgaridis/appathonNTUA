  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative Delirium (POD) is one of the most common complications occurring after surgery
      with an incidence ranging from 4 to 53%. It may lead to increased postoperative morbidity and
      mortality, with loss of independence and cognitive dysfunction in certain groups of patients.
      Aiming to reduce the incidence of POD and improve the outcome of patients diagnosed with POD,
      it is necessary to raise awareness regarding POD. The most important issue are:
      identification of risk factors, improved monitoring, necessary prevention and adequate
      treatment. The Polish Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Therapy (PTAiIT) has made an
      attempt to improve the situation in Poland by testing the implementation of official POD
      guidelines published by the European Society of Anesthesiology in year 2017. While the
      guidelines provide recommendations for daily practice it is necessary to identify the degree
      of their implementation in each country. Therefore survey has been prepared regarding
      postoperative delirium in Poland. This Survey has been submitted to the Bioethical Committee
      of the Pomeranian Medical University in Szczecin (Poland) and received a waiver due to the
      non-interventional, observational character of the study (decision no. KB-0012/06/01/2020/Z).
