      This study will be conducted at Research Institute of Traumatology and Orthopedics (NRITO)
      n.a. Ya.L.Tsivyan, Novosibirsk, Russia.

      The current study is prospective observational study to evaluate the efficacy of preoperative
      estimation of disc herniation recurrence among patients with lumbar disc herniation using
      predictive mathematical model at terms 3 years postoperatively .

      It is expected to enroll 350 patients aged 18-70 with lumbar disc herniation. Risk estimation
      of disc herniation recurrence will be evaluated preoperatively, then patient will undergo
      conventional microdiscectomy. Postoperative eximanation will include Visits every 6-months
      during 3 years to evaluate clinical outcomes.
