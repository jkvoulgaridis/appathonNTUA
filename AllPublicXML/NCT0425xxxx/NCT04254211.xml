  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigated the association of chronic inflammatory markers with the clinical
      outcome after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) for abdominal aortic aneurysm.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study included 230 consecutive AAA patients, treated electively by EVAR from March 2016
      to February 2019. The values of simple inflammatory markers,neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR)
      and platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), were measured pre- and postoperatively.Adverse events
      included any major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), acute kidney injury and death from
      any cause.
