      Prospective, open-label, uncontrolled and multicenter phase I-II study in SCLC patients with
      ECOG PS 0-1 who have failed one prior platinum-containing line but no more than one
      chemotherapy-containing line. The study will be divided into two parts: a dose-ranging phase
      I with escalating doses of PM01183 in combination with a fixed dose of atezolizumab, followed
      by a single-arm phase II part with expansion at the RD determined during the phase I.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phase I Patients will receive atezolizumab at a fixed dose of 1200 mg intravenously (i.v.)
      followed by PM01183 at a starting dose of 2.5 mg/m2 i.v. as a 1-hour infusion on Day 1 every
      three weeks (q3wk). PM01183 doses will be escalated in successive cohorts of patients
      following a modified Fibonacci scheme and a classical 3+3 design, and according to observed
      tolerance and safety.

      To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended dose for phase II studies
      (RD) of PM01183 in combination with atezolizumab in advanced SCLC patients progressing after
      platinum doublet chemotherapy.
