  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Propionibacterium acnes is a pathogen commonly identified in postoperative shoulder
      infections. A recent study has shown that P. acnes is likely to be disseminated in the
      operating field from the subcutaneous layer by the manipulation of soft tissues by the
      surgeon and the instruments. Disinfection of the subcutaneous tissue seems to significantly
      reduce contamination of the operating field during primary shoulder surgery. This study seeks
      to assess the efficacy of disinfection of the subcutaneous tissue compared to dissection with
      an electrosurgical unit on P. acnes contamination during primary shoulder surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are going to study the efficacy of disinfecting the subcutaneous tissue
      with Betadine standard solution during primary shoulder surgery compared to electrosurgical
      dissection. They will randomize 105 patients on two arms. The control group receiving no
      disinfection of the subcutaneous tissue but a dissection with an electric cautery(A) and
      intervention group receiving a disinfection of the subcutaneous tissue (B). They believe that
      the duration of 4 years is sufficient to recruit the number of patients necessary for this
      study.

      All patients 18 years of age or older admitted to Valais Hospital for primary shoulder
      surgery and having signed the consent of the study will be eligible.

      The use of disinfection of the subcutaneous tissue during primary shoulder surgery could
      reduce contamination of the operating field and theoretically the post-operative infection
      rate after primary shoulder surgery.

      The study focuses on disinfection with Betadine solution of the subcutaneous tissue during
      primary shoulder surgery. This action could decrease contamination of the operating field and
      the infection rate after primary shoulder surgery.

      This solution is already widely used for disinfecting the skin and traumatic or surgical
      wounds.

      The investigators will use it according to the recommendations made in the Swiss Compendium
      of Medicines.

      No evidence has been brought to a decrease in this contamination if the dissection is carried
      out with an electric cautery. Scalpel dissection is used as standard in orthopedic surgery as
      well as in other surgical disciplines.

    <description>Skin and subcutaneous incision (up to the muscular fascia) with &quot;superficial blade&quot; scalpel, disinfection of the subcutaneous tissue with 3cc of Betadine solution, placement of the retractors, dissection and development of the delto-pectoral interval with &quot;deep blade&quot; scalpel.
When the joint is opened, bacteriological smears are taken from 5 sites in the two groups. 1) exposed subcutaneous tissue, 2) surgeon's gloves (distal end of fingers), 3) &quot;superficial blade&quot;, 4) &quot;deep blade&quot;, 5) retractors.
The rest of the shoulder surgery procedure does not differ from what is commonly performed.
The samples are sent to bacteriology for bacterial culture. Anaerobic research is done specifically for P. acnes. The results are considered negative after 10 days.</description>
