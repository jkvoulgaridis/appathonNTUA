  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is designed to assess the efficacy of a novel carbon-fibre adjustable reusable
      accessory (CARA) for breast support to reduce skin toxicity and unwanted normal tissue dose
      in comparison to the current clinical standard for supine breast support during whole breast
      RT.

      This study is designed to assess the effectiveness of utilizing the CARA positioning device
      for reducing the incidence and severity of acute skin reactions in the infra-mammary fold in
      patients undergoing WBRT. Secondary outcomes include patient reported outcomes and dose to
      normal body tissue and organs at risk. This is a randomized controlled trial. Participants
      will be randomly assigned to the following two arms:

      Arm 1 patients will receive CARA breast support. The known benefits to using CARA for breast
      positioning are reduction in IMF skin folds during treatment, reduction in breast separation,
      and reduction in V50% body, V105% body and lung V20 Gy in treatment planning. No known risks
      to using CARA have been identified.

      Arm 2 patients will not receive CARA breast support. Patients in arm 2 may be treated with no
      breast support, a small foam wedge, a thermoplastic shell or alternate supine breast support
      method according to the current standard of care at the treating centre. These methods have
      entered RT clinical practice over decades of practice without published evidence of impact on
      rates of MD. Published rates of MD for the control arm thus pertain to a cross section of
      these methods. The control arm of this study will look at all of these methods combined.
      There may be centre specific preference for the control method and stratification by centre
      will be done.
