  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial will look at a drug called SGN-TGT (also known as SEA-TGT) to find out whether it
      is safe for patients with solid tumors and lymphomas. It will study SGN-TGT to find out what
      its side effects are. A side effect is anything the drug does besides treating cancer. It
      will also study whether SGN-TGT works to treat solid tumors and lymphomas.

      The study will have three groups or &quot;parts.&quot; Part A of the study will find out how much
      SGN-TGT should be given to patients. Part B will use the dose found in Part A to find out how
      safe SGN-TGT is and if it works to treat solid tumors and lymphomas. Part C will study how
      well SGN-TGT with the PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab works to treat solid tumors and lymphomas.
      PD-1 inhibitors are drugs that can be used to treat these types of cancer.
