    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, phase 1 study to determine the safety, PK, and antitumor
      activity of BZ019 in adult subjects with R/R large CD19+B cell lymphoma. The safety and
      efficacy of a single dose of different target doses of BZ019 will be evaluated in the
      dose-escalation phase and dose-expansion phase.

      Primary objectives:

      - To evaluate the safety and tolerance of single infusion of BZ019 in adult patients with
      relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma, and to determine the maximum tolerable dose
      (MTD) and phase II recommended dose.

      Secondary objectives：

        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetics and survival of BZ019 in the peripheral blood of adult
           patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma;

        -  To evaluate the Pharmacodynamic characteristics of BZ019 in adult patients with relapsed
           or refractory large B-cell lymphoma;

        -  Objective response rate (ORR), Overall survival, progression free survival, event free
           survival, and tumor progression time were used to evaluate the antitumor efficacy of
           BZ019 in the treatment of relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma.
