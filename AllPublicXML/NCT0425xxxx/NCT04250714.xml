  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Post Market Clinical Follow-up (PMCF) study designed to establish the continued
      safety and effectiveness profile of the Boston Scientific Cardiac Cryoablation System after
      receiving CE mark.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will provide information on real-world usage of the Boston Scientific Cardiac
      Cryoablation System when used to perform pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) for the ablation
      treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF), according to the current and future guidelines and
      product indications for use. This may include but not limited to: repeated ablations to treat
      AF, concomitant or delayed adjunctive ablation strategies with other products and use of
      different diagnostic products to validate the results such as 3D mapping systems.

          2. Subjects who are willing and capable of providing informed consent;

          3. Subjects who are willing and capable of participating in all testing associated with
             this clinical study at an approved clinical investigational center;

          4. Subjects whose age is 18 years or above, or who are of legal age to give informed
             consent specific to state and national law.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any known contraindication to an AF ablation or anticoagulation, including those
             listed in the instructions for use;

          2. Subjects with indication for treatment of AF that is not according to current and
             future Guidelines and system indications for use;

          3. Atrial fibrillation secondary to electrolyte imbalance, thyroid disease, or any other
             reversible or non-cardiac cause;

          4. Known or pre-existing severe Pulmonary Vein Stenosis;

          5. Evidence of myxoma, LA thrombus or intracardiac mural thrombus;

          6. Previous cardiac surgery (e.g. ventriculotomy or atriotomy, CABG, PTCA, stent
             procedure) within 90 days prior to enrollment;

          7. Implantable cardiac device procedures (e.g. PM, ICD, CRT) within 30 days prior to
             enrollment;

          8. Implanted Left Atrial Appendage Closure device prior to the index procedure;

          9. Interatrial baffle, closure device, patch, or patent foramen ovale (PFO) occluder;

         10. Subjects with severe valvular disease OR with a prosthetic - mechanical or biological
             - heart valve (not including valve repair and annular rings);

         11. Presence of any pulmonary vein stents;

         12. Active systemic infection;

         13. Vena cava embolic protection filter devices and/ or known femoral thrombus;
