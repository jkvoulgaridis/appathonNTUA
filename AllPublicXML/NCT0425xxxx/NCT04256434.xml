    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, sequential 2 cohort, intramuscular injection study in healthy
      volunteers. The study will enroll approximately 24 healthy volunteers to examine the safety,
      pharmacokinetics, and bioavailability after intramuscular injection of NALDEBAIN ER Injection
      and nalbuphine injection.

      Each subject in a cohort will be evaluated for study eligibility during the screening period,
      which is within 28 days prior to receiving the study drug (Day 1). Eligible subjects will be
      admitted into the study site on Day -1 and will be required to stay in clinical site for 5
      (Cohort 1) or 2 nights (Cohort 2) for study procedures in each cohort. Eligible subjects will
      undergo additional eligibility assessments on Day -1 and those reconfirmed eligible will
      intramuscularly receive NALDEBAIN ER Injection (Cohort 1) or nalbuphine (Cohort 2) on Day 1.

      The blood sampling timepoints for Cohort 1 will be at predose, 6, 12, 24, 48, 56, 64, 72, 80,
      88, and 96 hours after dosing. Subjects will be discharged after the 96-hour blood sample and
      return to the clinical site for the sample collection at 120, 168, 216, 288 and 360 hours
      post dosing. The blood sampling timepoints for Cohort 2 will be predose, 5, 15, and 30
      minutes postdose, and 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours postdose.

      Subjects will return for a follow-up visit to complete safety evaluations for approximately
      15 days after study drug administration in cohort 1; and 1 days after study drug
      administration in Cohort 2.
