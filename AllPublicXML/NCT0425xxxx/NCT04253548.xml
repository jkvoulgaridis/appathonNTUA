  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the on-going presence of a chronic illness, daily immunosuppressive medications, and the
      need for continuous medical supervision, pediatric transplant recipients face considerable
      psychosocial stresses. Treatment nonadherence is a major issue in pediatric transplantation
      and can lead to increased rates of hospitalization, rejection episodes, graft loss and death.
      An online peer support mentorship program (iPeer2Peer) is proposed as one intervention that
      could enhance patient care management, increase treatment adherence, reduce social isolation
      and improve health outcomes for this highly vulnerable population. The proposed trial will
      determine 1) implementation outcomes of the iPeer2Peer intervention in terms of: (a)
      feasibility and adoption, (b) acceptability and appropriateness and (c) level of engagement
      with the program, and 2) effectiveness of the iPeer2Peer intervention on improving health
      outcomes including disease self-management skills, treatment adherence, quality of life,
      perceived social support, stress and coping.
