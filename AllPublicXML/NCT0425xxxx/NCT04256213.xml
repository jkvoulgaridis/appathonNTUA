  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, single arm pilot study evaluating the biological impact of &quot;Nivolumab
      + Ipilimumab&quot; in patients with cervical squamous cell carcinoma requiring RT-CT as initial
      therapy
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of COLIBRI is to evaluate the evolution of the CD8+/FOXP3+ ratio of lymphocytes in
      pre- versus post-treatment biopsies in patients treated with a combination of Nivolumab and
      Ipilimumab in a pilot study, just before starting standard RT-CT.

      The study will also assess tolerability, Objective Response Rate, clinical activity and
      biological (dynamic) changes of the immune micro environment

        can be performed if clinically indicated.

        Note: Inhaled or topical steroids, and adrenal replacement doses are permitted in the
