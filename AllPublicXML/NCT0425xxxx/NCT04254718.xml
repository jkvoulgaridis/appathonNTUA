  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our long-term goal is to reduce suffering and long-term negative consequences for families in
      the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). The overall purpose of this study is to test
      feasibility of a legacy intervention for NICU parents.

      Specific aims are:

      (1) To determine the feasibility of a legacy intervention for NICU parents; and (2) to
      determine the feasibility of psychosocial instruments for NICU parents. We will recruit
      parents (N = 12) of 6 infants in the NICU who have received a palliative care consultation
      and expected to die by 1 year of age based on provider report. We will use a one-group pre-
      and post-test design. The intervention will be delivered by the PI or trained study staff
      conducting video-taped interviews with parents in private NICU rooms to create a digital
      story about their infant. The videographer will use the video and music selected by parents
      to create a digital story about the infant. The final digital story is provided to parents on
      a DVD or unlisted (private) YouTube link to keep. Parents will complete electronic
      psychosocial measures at enrollment (baseline/pre-intervention) and post-intervention.
