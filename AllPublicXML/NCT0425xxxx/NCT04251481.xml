  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is to investigate the feasibility of using quantitative diffusion MRI
      (dMRI) methods for accurate and comprehensive assessment of treatment response. dMRI is a
      powerful tool to probe treatment-induced change in tumors. It is a unique in vivo imaging
      technique sensitive to cellular microstructures at the scale of water diffusion length on the
      order of a few microns. Previous studies have shown that both diffusion coefficient D and
      diffusional kurtosis coefficient K are promising imaging markers of (i) cell viability which
      can be used for evaluation of early treatment response. However, it is often underappreciated
      that these dMRI metrics are not fixed constants, but rather functions of the diffusion time
      t, D(t) and K(t); their t-dependency is determined by tissue properties, such as cell size
      and membrane permeability of tissue. D(t) and K(t) of tumors can vary substantially depending
      on t in the range of diffusion times (30-100 ms) typically used in clinical scan.

    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the t-dependency of dMRI over a range of diffusion times (30-500
      ms) to determine an optimal diffusion time for treatment response assessment when only one
      diffusion time needs to be used, particularly in routine clinical studies. Furthermore, the
      data with multiple diffusion times will also be used to measure the water exchange time of
      cancer cells. Exchange time has been studied using Dynamic Contrast Enhanced (DCE) MRI by
      multiple groups including ours, and has been suggested as a marker of (ii) cellular
      metabolism that regulates the ATP-dependent ion channels co-transporting water molecules. The
      study will measure with dMRI, without using a contrast agent. The investigators also
      demonstrated that Intra-Voxel Incoherent Motion (IVIM) MRI metrics (pseudo diffusivity, Dp;
      perfusion fraction, fp), from multiple b-values at a fixed diffusion time, can be used to
      assess the perfusion status of tumor and they are also associated with tumor interstitial
      fluid pressure. The IVIM effect has been observed in various cancer types (33-39) and animal
      tumor models. The product fp*Dp - a quantity including both blood volume and velocity
      information - is considered as a parameter analogous to (iii) perfusion flow .

    <description>To optimize the diffusion MRI methods for assessment of cell viability, metabolism and perfusion in head and neck cancer. There will be 24 subjects enrolled for 2 year duration. Treatment-naïve patients with cervical metastatic lymph nodes (diameter &gt; 10 mm) of HNSCC will be recruited to have one research PET/MR scan (including dMRI) and one dMRI-only scan within three days prior to treatment. These data will be used to optimize the dMRI method and assess the repeatability.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>To assess the feasibility of using diffusion MRI metrics at early stages of treatment for prediction of treatment response in head and neck cancer patients undergoing standard-of-care chemoradiation therapy. There will be 36 subjects enrolled for 3 year duration. The study will do bi-weekly measurement to monitor tumor response longitudinally. This study will be restricted to treatment-naïve patients who present pathologically confirmed HNSCC with metastatic lymph nodes and who are scheduled to receive standard care of radiation therapy with concurrent chemotherapy. The patients enrolled in this arm of the study will have 4 dMRI scans. The imaging data for each patient will be the proposed dMRI measures at the baseline and their changes at each follow-up time period. DCE-MRI will be included in the baseline scan for tumor delination as in standard-of-care cancer imaging and to compare with the proposed dMRI method.</description>

    <intervention_name>PET/MRI with FDG</intervention_name>
    <description>For the PET/MRI scans, an intravenous (IV) catheter (thin tube) will be used to administer dyes (contrast) for both the MRI and PET portions of the examination. The dye for the PET portion will be 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). FDG is an FDA-approved radioactive substance (isotope) that contains chemicals that can be traced by PET/MRI. The dye for the MRI portion will be a gadolinium based contrast medium which is also an FDA-approved substance that makes certain tissues, abnormalities or disease processes more clearly visible on MRI scans. MRI uses a strong magnetic field to create images of the body. Subjects will be asked to lie on a table that will slide into the scanner; Wear earplugs to reduce the noise made by the MRI scanner and lie still throughout the time in the scanner.</description>
