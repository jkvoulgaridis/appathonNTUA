  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, randomized, double-blind for cenerimod, open-label for moxifloxacin,
      placebo- and moxifloxacin-controlled, parallel-group study to investigate the effect of
      cenerimod on the duration of the QT interval in healthy male and female participants.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the 4 treatments: placebo, cenerimod 0.5 mg,
      cenerimod 4 mg or moxifloxacin.

      Female participants randomized in one of the cenerimod or placebo groups will receive
      combined oral contraceptives on Day 1 (i.e., prior to cenerimod or placebo administration,
      Period 1) and on Day 42 (i.e., 36 days after the stat of cenerimod or placebo, Period 2).

      Half of the participants randomized in one of the cenerimod or placebo groups will be
      enrolled in an accelerated elimination procedure part (Period 3).

          -  Systolic blood pressure 90 to 145 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure 45 to 90 mmHg, and
             pulse rate 50 to 100 bpm (inclusive), measured on the same arm, after 5 min in the
             supine position at screening and on Day -1.

          -  12-lead ECG without clinically relevant abnormalities, measured after 5 min in the
             supine position at screening and on admission.

          -  No clinically relevant findings in clinical laboratory tests (hematology, clinical
             chemistry, and urinalysis) at screening and on admission.

             admission.

          -  Women of non-childbearing potential (i.e., postmenopausal [defined as 12 consecutive
             months with no menses without an alternative medical cause, confirmed by a
             follicle-stimulating hormone test], with previous bilateral salpingectomy, bilateral
             salpingo-oophorectomy or hysterectomy, or with premature ovarian failure [confirmed by
             a specialist]).

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at Screening
             and a negative urine pregnancy test on Day -1. They must consistently and correctly
