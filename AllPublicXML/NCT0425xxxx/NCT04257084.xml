  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) is increased in patients having ulcerative colitis (UC).
      Patients with long-standing extensive colitis, concomitant primary sclerosing cholangitis, or
      previous history of dysplasia carry an exceptionally high risk of CRC and require regular and
      short-interval surveillance colonoscopy. Recent guidelines recommend surveillance colonoscopy
      based on target biopsy rather than random biopsy applying chromoendoscopy (CE) or narrow band
      image (NBI) technique in UC at risk for CRC. However, the diagnostic yield of NBI-based
      surveillance and CE-based surveillance is not extensively investigated in the high-risk UC
      population. The investigators aimed to compare the dysplasia detection rate of NBI with that
      of CE in UC patients with a high risk of CRC by performing a multicenter, randomized
      controlled trial.
