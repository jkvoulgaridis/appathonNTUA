  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators are testing improvement in survival outcomes in DIPG
      patients when stratified with MR perfusion score and treated with the said protocol. Newly
      diagnosed DIPG patients will undergo MRI perfusion study in addition to the usual MRI at
      diagnosis and will be stratified into hyperperfused or hypoperfused tumours.

      The hyperperfused patients will receive additional low dose Bevacizumab weekly with
      conventional standard radiotherapy.

      The hypo-perfused patients will receive ultra-low-dose radiotherapy fractionation equivalent
      to conventional RT biological dose.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In tumours like Diffuse pontine glioma (DIPG), the diagnosis itself spells a death sentence
      for the child affected. The current standard treatment is conventionally fractionated daily
      radiation treatment for 6 weeks which benefits 80-90% patients with temporary improvement in
      neurological function which gives survival up to 8-10 months. With research over several
      decades, none of the altered fractionation radiotherapy or additional chemotherapy or
      targeted agents has shown a significant difference in outcomes.

      The investigators propose to do an MRI perfusion study in addition to usual MRI at diagnosis
      and stratify them into hyperperfused or hypoperfused based on the criteria from the
      investigator's previously published institutional experience in DIPG. The hyperperfused
      patients will receive additional low dose a drug called Bevacizumab weekly with conventional
      standard radiotherapy. It is hypothesized that low dose Bevacizumab will decrease hypoxia and
      improve the efficacy of conventional radiotherapy and in turn improve outcomes.

      The hypo-perfused patients will receive ultra-low-dose radiotherapy fractionation equivalent
      to conventional RT biological dose. As it is assumed that hypoperfused tumours are
      radioresistant, the investigator hypothesis that the ultra-low dose radiotherapy may overcome
      that radioresistance as seen in GBM adult patients and may improve outcomes.
