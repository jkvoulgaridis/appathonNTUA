      To investigate the potential efficacy of dupilumab in the treatment of moderate to severe
      chronic hepatic pruritus.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 22-week (2 week screening, 18-week treatment period followed by a 2 week followup),
      phase II, open label, exploratory study to investigate the potential efficacy of FDA approved
      dupilumab in the treatment of adults with moderate to severe chronic hepatic pruritus.
      Subjects will be screened at outpatient clinic visit appointments and interested qualified
      subjects will be consented and offered participation in this trial. Once consent has been
      obtained, baseline values will be established and subjects will begin treatment and follow-up
      for the next 20 weeks. A final visit will be needed for evaluation and questionnaire
      completion.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and/or female subjects 18 years or older with chronic pruritus of moderate to
             severe severity in the setting of intrahepatic or extrahepatic cholestatic liver
             disease. Chronic is defined as greater than 6 weeks of symptom duration. Pruritus
             severity is based on the peak pruritus numerical rating score of ≥ 4 (moderate
             severity).

          -  Documentation of a personally signed and dated informed consent indicating that the
             subject has been informed of all pertinent aspects of the trial.

          -  Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled clinic visits, physical exams,
             laboratory tests, questionnaires, and other trial procedures.

          -  Male and/or female subjects under 18 years of age.

          -  Pruritus due to a primary inflammatory skin dermatosis or other forms of psychogenic
             pruritus utilizing skin biopsies as needed.

          -  Pregnant females

          -  History of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy

          -  Any form of chronic hepatic pruritus associated with underlying malignancy

          -  Allergy to dupilumab or its ingredients

          -  Inability to provide informed consent

          -  Concomitant use of selective opioid antagonists
