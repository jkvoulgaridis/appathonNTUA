      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of dual add-on therapy
      with Gemigliptin 50 mg and Dapagliflozin 10 mg added to Metformin compared to add-on therapy
      with Gemigliptin 50 mg in combination with Metformin or Dapagliflozin 10 mg in combination
      with Metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who have inadequate glycemic control
      on metformin alone
