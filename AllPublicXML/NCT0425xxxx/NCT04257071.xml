  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective randomized controlled trial of a cohort of adult multiple sclerosis
      (MS) patients visiting an outpatient neurology clinic. Sixty participants will be randomly
      assigned to the intervention arm or a control arm and will be followed for three months.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) spend a substantial amount on healthcare services
      (total lifetime cost of $4.1 million), and rank second behind congestive heart failure in
      direct all-cause medical costs for chronic conditions. Among medically bankrupt families, MS
      is reported to be associated with the highest out-of-pocket expenditure (mean $34,167)
      followed by diabetes, injuries, stroke, mental illness, and heart disease. With increased
      costs of MS disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) over the last 20 years, relatively higher
      out-of-pocket (OOP) costs for advanced imaging tests compared to other common essential
      health benefits, and increased cost sharing, the financial burden on MS patients continues to
      escalate. More than half of MS patients lose their ability to generate incomes within a
      decade after diagnosis due to disability. Accordingly, these patients are at high risk for
      health-related financial toxicity (a term used interchangeably with financial distress or
      financial burden, first introduced in the oncology literature to report potential economic
      impact of modern oncology medications). Financial toxicity is defined as a combination of
      subjective financial concerns (e.g., anxiety), objective financial consequences of health
      issues and treatments (e.g., decreased income, medical debt, bankruptcy), and patients'
      coping behaviors. Financial toxicity, as measured by the Comprehensive Score for Financial
      Toxicity Patient-Reported Outcome (COST), can harm patients' health-related quality of life
      (HRQOL). Further, the financial burden from high cost-sharing medical services can be a risk
      factor for treatment non-adherence. To date, there are no published studies measuring
      financial toxicity in MS patients, and work in other disease states cannot necessarily be
      generalized to MS patients. First, the economic burden of MS is different from cancer due to
      early age of disease onset and its progressive disabling course. Additionally, since MS
      affects people in the most productive stages of their lives, the disease additionally carries
      important social burdens.

      Providing patients with resources to proactively manage the costs of their care may help to
      reduce financial toxicity. However, financial navigation, must be provided in a manner that
      is acceptable, accessible, less cumbersome, thereby not affecting the flow of clinical care.
      In order to better understand how to equip patients with tools that have the potential to
      reduce financial toxicity, there is an urgent need to study interventions at the patient,
      clinic, payer, and policy level.

      This is a two-arm, randomized trial with 60 adult MS patients who are receiving disease
      modifying therapy to test the feasibility of OOP cost communication and optimization through
      centralized financial navigation and explore its efficacy to reduce financial toxicity and
      care non-adherence compared to usual care.

    <measure>Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 3</time_frame>
    <description>Patient satisfaction with their experience with the OOP cost discussion and financial counselors is assessed with a 14-item Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire. Participants report how much they agree with each statement on a scale of 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Total scores range from 14 to 70 where higher scores indicate greater satisfaction with the financial counselor experiences.</description>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Minutes of Patient Engagement in Cost Conversations</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 3</time_frame>
    <description>Patient engagement in cost conversations is defined as time (in minutes) that participants in the intervention arm spent discussing OOP cost with the financial counselor.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Adherence to Cost Optimization Program</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 3</time_frame>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Utilization of Financial Supportive Services</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 3</time_frame>
    <description>Use of financial supportive services will be assessed by asking participants if they received any assistance with paying for medication, imaging, or transportation to health provider visits in the past three months. For any financial support received, participants will be asked how they were linked to assistance. This is a qualitative assessment which does not provide a summary score.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Accuracy of OOP Cost Estimates</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 3</time_frame>
    <description>Accuracy of OOP cost estimates provided to patients in the intervention arm will be assessed by comparing the estimates to the amount stated in received medical bills (if they received their bills).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Comprehensive Score for Financial Toxicity (COST) Questionnaire Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 3</time_frame>
    <description>Financial toxicity is assessed using the COST questionnaire. The COST questionnaire includes 12 items asking how important specific financial scenarios are to participants on a scale of 0 to 4 where 0 = not at all and 4 = very much. Total scores will be calculated using responses from the first 11 items and range from 0 to 44. Certain items are reverse scored so that lower scores indicate greater financial toxicity.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Cost-related Care Non-adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 3</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked if they have forgone or delayed treatment or monitoring visits (e.g., medication, treatment other than prescribed medication, office visits, lab and imaging) related to MS in the last 3 months due to cost. Participants respond with &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; and there is not a summary score for this assessment.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Financial Hardship</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 3</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked about any financial hardship they are experiencing due to bills and income related to MS treatment. Participants will report if they had to change living situations, withdraw money from retirement or savings accounts, or if they had changes in income since their diagnosis, or had to obtain loans to pay medical bills. This is a qualitative assessment without a summary score.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Global Health Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 3</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported changes in physical, mental and social health will be assessed with the PROMIS Global Health instrument. This instrument includes 9 items scored from 1 to 5, where 1 is equivalent to poor health and 5 is equivalent to excellent health, plus a tenth item asking respondents to rate their average pain on a scale from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain). Total score for the first 9 items range from 9 to 45 where higher scores indicate greater self-reported health. PROMIS t-scores will be calculated.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Coping Behaviors</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 3</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked about any coping behaviors that were needed, such as decreased basic spending on food/clothing, decreased spending on leisure activities, or missed physician visits, due to bills related to MS treatment. This is a qualitative assessment without a summary score.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Financial Self-Efficacy Scale (FSES) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 3</time_frame>
    <description>The FSES is a 6-item instrument assessing how confidently respondents can manage financial concerns. Responses to items are on a 4 point scale where 1 = exactly true and 4 = not at all true. Total scores range from 6 to 24 where higher scores indicate greater financial self-efficacy.</description>
