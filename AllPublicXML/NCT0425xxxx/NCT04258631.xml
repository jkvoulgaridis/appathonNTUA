  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase IV trial studies how well liposomal bupivacaine with or without hydromorphone
      works in improving pain control during the first 24 hours after surgery in patients with
      gynecological malignancies undergoing laparotomy. Liposomal bupivacaine is routinely
      infiltrated into the skin surrounding the abdominal incision, and is effective in providing
      good relief of incisional pain. Hydromorphone is also a type of pain medication that may
      provide better management of deep abdominal pain. It is not yet known if giving liposomal
      bupivacaine with or without hydromorphone will work better in improving pain in patients with
      gynecological malignancies during the first 24 hours after surgery.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate if no additional intervention is noninferior to intrathecal analgesia (ITA) for
      postoperative pain experience 24 hours after surgery after laparotomy for gynecological
      malignancy within an established enhanced recovery pathway which includes incisional
      liposomal bupivacaine (ILB).

      II. Evaluate the effect of intrathecal analgesia on patient satisfaction with postoperative
      analgesia after laparotomy for gynecological malignancy.

      III. Report the impact of ITA use on cost. IV. Validate the Quality of Recovery (QOR)-15 in
      our population.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo standard of care laparotomy and then receive liposomal bupivacaine.

      ARM II: Patients undergo standard of care laparotomy and then receive liposomal bupivacaine
      and hydromorphone intrathecally (IT).

    <measure>Overall Benefit of Analgesia Score (OBAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 hours after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The OBAS includes 7 questions with responses ranging from 0 - 4. A lower overall score is preferred and shows a better outcome. The mean OBAS score between the two groups will be presented along with the upper limit of the 95% confidence bound for the mean difference. Will conclude non-inferiority if this upper limit is less than the predefined limit for noninferiority. Multivariable regression models will be fit to assess for differences in outcomes if there are unbalanced baseline covariates in the two treatment arms.</description>
