  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The association between serum progesterone (P) levels, measured on the day of ovulation
      trigger, and the outcome of in vitro fertilization cycles, has been one of the major
      controversies in the field of ovarian stimulation endocrinology.

      This is a single-center retrospective cohort study. Study duration period is from January
      2012 to December 2016.

      All fresh embryo transfer (ET) both at cleavage stage and blastocyst stage, performed in
      Humanitas Fertility Center during the study period, were included.

        (Day 5), and all thawed embryo transfer, except from the ones deriving from PGTA, performed
        from January 2012 to December 2016 in Humanitas Fertility Center were included.
