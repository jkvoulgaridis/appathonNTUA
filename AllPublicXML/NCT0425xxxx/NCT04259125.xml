    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study evaluate the relationship between inflammation and epilepsy in
      neonates with seizures after birth.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Seizures are a common symptom of neurologic dysfunction in the neonatal period, affecting
      more than 16,000 newborns in the United States per year. Over 25% of neonates with acute
      symptomatic seizures develop post- neonatal epilepsy (PNE), which is often resistant to
      medical therapies. There is a critical need to identify those patients most at risk for PNE
      and understand the mechanisms by which early seizures increase the propensity for recurrent
      seizures, in hopes of identifying novel therapeutic targets in this population. There is
      increasing evidence for the role of neuro-inflammation in the development of epilepsy. Levels
      of cytokines and micro-RNA (miRNA) may serve as markers of disease severity and have been
      implicated in epileptogenesis in animal models. The purpose of this study is to evaluate
      plasma cytokine and miRNA levels after neonatal-onset acute symptomatic seizures and
      determine their association with acute seizure severity and PNE.
