  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 12-week, Phase 2a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group
      study evaluating the safety and efficacy of tolfenamic acid (50 mg, 300 mg, and 600 mg daily)
      compared with placebo administered to subjects with PSP. The study will include 8 visits and
      a final telephone contact: screening (Week -6: Visit 1), randomization (7 to 10 days prior to
      Week 0: visit 2), treatment (Week 0 through Week 12: Visits 2 - 6), end of study Week 12:
      Visit 7), and telephone contact (Visit 8). Lumbar puncture will be obtained from consenting
      subjects at screening (Week -6: visit 10 and End of Study (Week 12: Visit 7) to primary
      exploratory biomarkers.

                  with PSP if the dose has been stable for 90 days prior to screening and is not
                  expected to change during the course of the study.

               -  Treatment with lithium, methylene blue, tramiprosate, ketone bodies,

               -  History of a clinically significant medical condition that would interfere with
                  the subject's ability to comply with study instructions, would place the subject

                  screening (Visit 1), in the opinion of the investigator substantial worsening of
                  motor signs or symptoms compared with normal functioning following overnight
