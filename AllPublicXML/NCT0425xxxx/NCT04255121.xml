  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During labor, pain is systematic. In France, epidural analgesia is the gold standard to fight
      pain.

      Sometimes, emergency situations involve the maternal or fetal prognosis and require an
      emergency fetal extraction by caesarean. When an effective epidural analgesia is in place, an
      injection of adrenaline lidocaine converts this epidural analgesia into an epidural
      anesthesia allowing a surgical procedure. Sometimes, the time required to set up the
      anesthesia cannot be expected and a general anesthesia is performed.

      Local anesthetics used during epidural analgesia have Pka between 7.8 and 8.1. In solution,
      local anesthetics exist in two forms: an un-ionized form and an ionized form. The non-ionized
      form is liposoluble and crosses the lipid membranes to reach the site of intracellular
      action. The non-ionized form conditions the time taken to install anesthesia.

      When the pH of the solution is equal to Pka, un-ionized and ionized form are present in equal
      quantity. Commercial local anesthetic solutions have acidic pH and so contained a majority of
      ionized form. Alkalinization of local anesthetics solution should bring the pH closer to pKa
      and therefore to favor a greater proportion of non-ionized form.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate impact of an alkalinization of adrenaline lidocaine
      solution for conversion of epidural analgesia into epidural anesthesia during an emergency
      caesarean.
