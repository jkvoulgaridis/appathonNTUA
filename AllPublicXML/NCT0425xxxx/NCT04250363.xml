  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to assess the chemoprophylactic activity and
      dose-exposure-response relationship of single oral dose of M5717 administered after direct
      intravenous inoculation (DVI) of Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite (PfSPZ) challenge in
      healthy participants.

  <overall_status>Suspended</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    This is due to the safety risk of the COVID 19 virus to the healthy volunteers and the fact
    that there is not data on coinfections of malaria and COVID 19.

             evaluation and no active clinically significant disorder, condition, infection or

             clinically relevant by the Investigator

          -  Supine systolic blood pressure &gt; 140 or &lt; 90 millimeter of mercury (mmHg), diastolic
             blood pressure &gt; 90 or &lt; 50 mmHg, and pulse rate &gt; 90 or &lt; 50 beats per minute (min)
             at screening and at admission on Day -1 (any abnormal blood pressure or pulse rate
             results may be repeated once and if the repeat result is within the normal range, it
             is not considered to have met the exclusion criterion)

          -  Seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) I and II antibody or antigen),
             hepatitis B virus (HBV; hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg]), or hepatitis C virus
             (HCV; antibody) tests

          -  Liver function tests above the upper limit of normal (ULN) (&gt; 3 x ULN) the day before
             DVI / study intervention administration (Day -1)

          -  History or presence of diagnosed food or known drug allergies (including but not
             limited to allergy to any of the antimalarial rescue medications to be used in the
             study), or history of anaphylaxis or other severe allergic reactions

          -  Participant with a whole blood donation or loss of &gt; 450 mL within 60 days before
             administration of study drug or unwilling to defer blood donations for 6 months
