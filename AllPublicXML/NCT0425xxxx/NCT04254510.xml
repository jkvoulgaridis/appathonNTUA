  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dysmenorrhea is a series of pathological symptoms associated with menstruation that interfere
      with daily activities such as abdominal cramps and pain in the menstrual period. General
      symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, lumbago, diarrhea and headache are also common. Primary
      dysmenorrhea refers to menstrual pain that does not depend on the underlying pathology. The
      kidneys act on the fascia of the psoas muscle. If the psoas muscle does not shorten and grow
      sufficiently, the kidneys may not move for a certain period of time and may experience
      ptosis. This causes venous ponding and may cause varicocele in men and primary dysmenorrhea
      in women. Techniques to be applied directly to the fascia of the psoas muscle can reduce
      symptoms of dysmenorrhea in women. In the literature review, no studies investigating the
      effectiveness of a treatment applied directly and only on the psoas muscle on primary
      dysmenorrhea were not found. This study can set an example for future studies. In our study,
      myofascial relaxation technique will be applied in women with primary dysmenorrhoea and its
      effect on pain will be examined.

To avoid clustering of scores around a preferred numeric value, numbers or verbal descriptors at intermediate points are not recommended</description>

    <description>Before the intervention, the number of days of the last menstrual cycle of all participants, the number of painful days throughout the cycle, pain intensity values according to the Visual Analogue Scale will be recorded, and the scores will be recorded in the participants.
Technique of direct relaxation of fascia of both psoas muscles to the participants in the myofascial relaxation group since the end of the last cycle, 90-120 sec. It will be applied by the physiotherapist twice a week.</description>
