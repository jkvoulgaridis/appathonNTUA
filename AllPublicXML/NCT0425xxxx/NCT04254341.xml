  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The role of control of peri-pharyngeal muscle tone in the pathogenesis of obstructive sleep
      apnea (OSA) is obvious: pharyngeal obstruction occurs only during sleep; and pharyngeal
      collapse occurs in almost all healthy subjects during anesthesia. Better understanding of
      these control mechanisms may help identifying the central components of the pathogenesis of
      OSA.

      Study plan: Subjects will be studied first during wakefulness, while breathing against
      external resistors, to evaluate how are the peri-pharyngeal muscles recruited and activated
      to prevent pharyngeal collapse in the presence of negative intra-pharyngeal pressures.
      Thereafter, the same parameters will be evaluated during sleep, to assess muscle recruitment
      during intra-pharyngeal obstruction. The investigaors will record the electromyogram (EMG) of
      several dilator muscles, as well as the pressures above and below the area of pharyngeal
      collapse, and airflow.
