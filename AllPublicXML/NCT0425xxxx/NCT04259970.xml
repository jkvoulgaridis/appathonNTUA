  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The introduction of triple combination CFTR modulator therapy for patients with Cystic
      Fibrosis (CF) with at least one copy of the deltaF508 mutation is expected to provide major
      health benefits, but will also require novel outcome measures that can detect CF lung disease
      at an early stage, capture the efficacy of new therapies when disease manifestations are
      limited, as well as determine whether stopping existing chronic maintenance therapies does
      not have negative effects.

      In the past decade, research has focused on the multiple breath washout (MBW) test, as a
      sensitive outcome measure, especially if highly-effective modulator therapies are initiated
      in early childhood. Even LCI, however, may not adequately capture early lung function
      changes, thus warranting investigation of even more sensitive outcome measures.

      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has the advantage of being a radiation-free modality, making
      it more suitable for assessing response to therapy in a shorter time frame with repeated
      imaging. Inhalation of a hyperpolarized gas enables the visualization and quantification of
      regional ventilation in the lung and can be combined with structural MRI to assess both
      structure and function in parallel.

      The main Investigator and others have recently formed an international consortium (the 129Xe
      MRI Clinical Trial Consortium), comprised of both imaging experts and pulmonary clinicians to
      standardize imaging procedures, thus facilitating multi-site implementations. Data from this
      proposed study (HyPOINT; Hyperpolarized Imaging for New Treatments) will inform the future
      utility of MRI for both longitudinal studies to track disease progression over time as well
      as for future interventional trials. Further, the current study could inform the design of
      future trials of interventions of patients for whom currently no effective CFTR modulator
      therapy is available and for patients with rare genotypes thus laying the groundwork for a
      more personalized medicine approach in the near-term future.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The HyPOINT (HyperPOlarized Imaging for New Therapies) trial is a multicenter prospective,
      two phase study involving four sites with proven expertise 129Xe MRI and CF clinical care.
      The study sites are: University of Virginia, University of Wisconsin, and SickKids in
      Toronto, Canada. University of Virginia and University of Wisconsin sites will be reliant on
      CCHMC's IRB. SickKids in Toronto, Canada, will submit their review through their
      institution's Research Ethics Board (REB).

      Phase 1 will include implementation of a centralized analysis program of repeated 129Xe MRI
      scanning in CF patients with mild lung disease to define the intra-subject variability of the
      primary outcome ventilation defect percentage (VDP). Patients will undergo baseline 129Xe MRI
      scanning and repeated measurements the same day, as well as at 28 days (± 7 days). Phase 1
      will establish the intra-subject reproducibility to facilitate future use of 129Xe MRI in
      multi-site studies. Furthermore, the reproducibility limits defined will inform the overall
      design of future studies and will compare to established pulmonary function and
      multiple-breath washout testing (via measurement of the lung clearance index, LCI).

      Safety of 129Xe MRI will be assessed by recording adverse events during the study visit (see
      8.3 Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events), which will be followed until resolved. Vital
      signs (heart rate, SPO2) will be recorded before, immediately following inhalation, and 2
      minutes after each 129Xe inhalation; O2 saturation will be monitored continuously throughout
      the 129Xe portion of the MRI, and the time and duration of nadir will be recorded.

      Phase 2 will be an observational study of patients assessed before and after the clinical
      initiation of triple-combination modulator therapy (after presumed FDA and Health Canada
      approval). The primary endpoint for Phase 2 is the change of VDP after 28 days of
      triple-combination modulator therapy. Within Phase 2, this study will also address how
      highly-effective modulator therapies affect lung function trajectories by measuring 129Xe MRI
      at 28 days (± 7 days), 6 months (± 28 days), and 12 months (± 28 days) after start of therapy
      (paralleling time points of the PROMISE study). Finally, to understand how 129Xe MRI can be
      used in combination with existing measures of lung function (e.g. spirometry, multiple breath
      washout), Investigators will directly compare the repeated data collected in both Phase 1 and
      Phase 2 to these established measures of lung function that are currently used in
      observational and interventional studies.

      The overarching goal of this study is to define the role of structural and functional MRI
      imaging to facilitate future CF research studies.

    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>A Spearman correlation will be used to determine the correlation between VDP and LCI at each study time points. A similar correlation analysis will be repeated for the change in LCI from baseline and change in VDP from baseline at each of the study time-points. With the treatment data, we will determine the concordance between the two outcomes at detecting an improvement in lung function and investigate where the two tests are discordant. A receiver operator characteristic curve will compare the diagnostic accuracy of the 129Xe MRI, and LCI. Similar analysis will be performed comparing VDP to the FEV1 and comparing the UTE MRI reader score to both LCI and FEV1. Secondary analysis will compare these changes in PFTs and LCI to changes in UTE MRI reader score and to sub-categories of regional ventilation using 129Xe MRI.</description>
