      This study evaluates the efficacy of dexamethasone as a intracanal irrigant along with sodium
      hypochlorite 1% and 5.25% concentrations in post treatment pain for molar root canal
      retreatment.

    <textblock>
      Main objective of root canal retreatment is to alleviate pain and disinfect the rootcanal
      .However some patients may experience mild to severe pain following treatment , which leads
      to intake of painkillers orally for post operative pain management.

      So , this study evaluates the efficiency of dexamethasone used as intracanal irrigant in post
      treatment pain for molar root canal retreatment sodium hypochlorite (1% &amp;5.25%) is used for
      disinfecting the canals patients will be grouped into Symptomatic and Asymptomatic patients
      requiring root canal retreatment and irrigants will be used in various combinations as
      mentioned below

        1. 1% sodium hypochlorite alone 2.5ml in each canal along with ultrasonic activation

        2. 1% sodium hypochlorite and dexamethasone 4mg,2.5ml in each canal along with ultrasonic
           activation

        3. 5.25% sodium hypochlorite alone 2.5ml in each canal along with ultrasonic activation

        4. 5.25% sodium hypochlorite and dexamethasone 4mg, 2.5ml in each canal along with
           ultrasonic activation calcium hydroxide is commonly used as intracanal medicament in all
           the patients post operative symptoms is evaluated at 12 hrs , 24 hrs,48 hrs, 72 hrs and
           1 week followed by obturation is completed
