  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic vomiting and feeding difficulties are common in young children and have a negative
      physical and psychosocial impact for patients and families. Currently there is no
      straightforward treatment algorithm for these issues, and management often involves multiple
      medication trials and procedures. Intrapyloric botulinum toxin injection has been proposed as
      a treatment for nausea and vomiting in adults, but there is minimal prior research on use in
      children and no prior research on use in children with feeding disorders. The aims of this
      study are: (1) to determine the efficacy of intrapyloric botulinum toxin injection for
      reducing gastrointestinal symptoms in children, (2) to determine the efficacy of intrapyloric
      botulinum injections for improving feeding outcomes in children, and (3) to define predictors
      of response to intrapyloric botulinum toxin injection.

    <description>Quality of life will be measured with the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL). This is composed of 23 items comprising 4 dimensions: Physical Functioning, Emotional Functioning, Social Functioning, and School Functioning. Each item is answered using a 3-point scale: 0 (Not at all), 2 (Sometimes), 4 (A lot). Scores range 0 to 100, with lower scores indicating worse quality of life. The outcome will be assessed by calculating the change in score from baseline to 4 weeks.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Degree of symptomatic improvement</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Symptoms will be measured with the Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index (GCSI). The GCSI is based on three subscales: post-prandial fullness/early satiety (4 items); nausea/vomiting (3 items), and bloating (2 items). A six-point Likert response scale, ranging from 0 (none) to 5 (very severe) is used to rate severity of each symptom. Scores range from 0 to 45, with higher scores indicating worse symptoms. This outcome will be assess by calculating the change in score from baseline to 4 weeks.</description>

    <description>We will follow for symptom improvement over time patients with nausea, vomiting, feeding intolerance, or other signs of gastric dysfunction who were determined by their gastroenterologist to require upper endoscopy with intrapyloric botulinum injections and if clinically applicable endoscopic functional luminal imaging probe (EndoFLIP). The dosage will be determined by the patient's physician.</description>
