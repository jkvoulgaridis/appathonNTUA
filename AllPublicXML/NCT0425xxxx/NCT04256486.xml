  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study's objective is to conduct a cluster randomized control study that evaluates the
      effectiveness of F-DSME (Family Model Diabetes Self-Management Education) when delivered in a
      group setting in Faith Based Organizations (FOB). The F-DSME has shown to be effective when
      delivered in patients' homes, and the proposed research will allow us to determine the
      F-DSME's effectiveness in a FBO setting.
