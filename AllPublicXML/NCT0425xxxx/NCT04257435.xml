  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Service members and veterans (SMVs) report more persisting symptoms following traumatic brain
      injury (TBI) compared to civilian populations (Ommaya, Ommaya, Dannenber, &amp; Salazar, 1996).
      Therefore, it is important to utilize interventions that reduce psychological impairments and
      increase resiliency during military TBI rehabilitation. Unlike traditional behavioral health
      treatments that focus on reducing maladaptive behaviors and negative thoughts, positive
      psychological treatments focus on increasing positive emotions to increase well-being. There
      is substantial growing evidence demonstrating that cultivating positive emotions is
      preventative and improves resiliency and psychological (Bolier et al., 2013; Sin &amp;
      Lyumbomirsky, 2009), cognitive (Estrada, Isen, &amp; Young, 1997; Ashby &amp; Isen, 1999; Isen &amp;
      Daubman, 1984; Isen, Daubman, &amp; Nowicki, 1987; Fredrickson &amp; Branigan, 2001), and health
      outcomes (Pressman &amp; Cohen, 2005). This study will examine the effectiveness of traditional
      behavioral health treatment versus behavioral health treatment with an added positive
      psychological group treatment in terms of psychological, cognitive, and health outcomes
      during TBI rehabilitation. The hypothesis is that SMV's with TBI will experience improved
      outcomes with added positive psychological treatment compared to traditional behavioral
      health treatment alone.

      There will be about 100 people taking part in the study, randomly assigned to either a
      traditional behavioral health treatment group or an alternative behavioral health treatment
      group (therefore, up to 50 people will be enrolled in each) at the Fort Belvoir Intrepid
      Spirit Center over a period of 30 months. Study participants will be randomly assigned to
      groups, and over 3 months the study procedures include participating in group behavioral
      health treatment and/or individual behavioral health treatment and completing
      pre/post-treatment questionnaires focusing on psychological, cognitive, and health outcomes.
      The behavioral health intervention has not been well-studied; thus, the behavioral health
      intervention is considered experimental for the treatment of psychological symptoms.
      Additionally, the impact on other areas of functioning (i.e., cognitive functioning and
      overall health) is currently unknown.

    <measure>Change in Positive Affect</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment and at 3 month follow-up following study completion</time_frame>
    <description>The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) is a self-report questionnaire on which participants rate adjectives of positive and negative feelings on a scale from 1 (very slightly/not at all) to 5 (extremely) according to how much they are currently experiencing that feeling. The sum of the positive items provides a measure of positive affect at each time point.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Hope</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment and at 3 month follow-up following study completion</time_frame>
    <description>The Hope Scale is a 12-item self-report questionnaire examining a patient's willful sense of determination to meet goals and a patient's perceived availability of ways to attain a goal. Higher ratings indicate greater hope at time of measurement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Life Satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment and at 3 month follow-up following study completion</time_frame>
    <description>The General Life Satisfaction scale from NIH Toolbox is a 5-item scale designed to measure global cognitive judgments of one's life satisfaction. Participants indicate how much they agree or disagree with each of the 5 items using a 7-point scale that ranges from 7 strongly agree to 1 strongly disagree. The total summed score will indicate satisfaction with life.</description>

    <measure>Change in Depression</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment and at 3 month follow-up following study completion</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 is a 9-item measure given to screen for the presence and severity of depression. The total summed score indicates level of depression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Perceived Stress</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment and at 3 month follow-up following study completion</time_frame>
    <description>The Perceived Stress scale from NIH Toolbox is a 10-item measure given to assess perceptions about the nature of events and their relationship to the values and coping resources of an individual. Participants indicate how often behaviors and/or thoughts related to stress have occurred on a 5-point scale (Never to Very Often). The total summed score indicates overall perceived stress.</description>

    <measure>Change in Cognitive Functioning</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment and at 3 month follow-up following study completion</time_frame>

Items are answered as 1=Not at all, 2=A little bit, 3=Somewhat, 4=Quite a bit, 5=Very much. The total summed score indicates perceived cognitive functioning.</description>
