      To report 10-years follow up of patients following the surgical treatment of peri-implantitis
      and to identify possible risk indicators for the progression of disease during supportive
      peri-implant therapy.

      The data for this retrospective clinical evaluation were collected from the files and
      radiographs of consecutive patients who had received surgical treatment of peri-implantitis
      between 2007 and 2009 and thereafter enrolled in supportive peri-implant treatment (SPT) .

      Between 2007 and 2009, 41 patients with at least 1 implant with peri-implantitis that
      underwent peri-implant surgery were enrolled in a supportive peri-implant therapy.

      At the 2-years follow up, two groups could be identified, one &quot;responding group&quot; (17
      patients) who did not present any implants with peri-implantitis and a &quot;no-responding Group&quot;
      (22 patients), presenting still peri-implantitis.

      Following the 2-years control visit, 17 patients of the responding group exited the
      supporting peri-implant therapy at the specialist clinic. They continued the routine controls
      at their referral clinics while the 22 patients of the no-responding group, continued the
      scheduled supportive peri-implant therapy (SPT) given at the specialist clinic.

    <description>The total number of patients with persisting peri-implantitis will be calculated. Any subject presenting at least one implants with a pathological pocket will be regarded as positive for the disease .
The presence or absence of peri-implantitis will be assessed by using a periodontal probe around the mucosa of the implants.
The definition of a pathological pocket around an implant is a pocket of 5 millimeters or more deep with concomitants bleeding after the use of the probe.</description>

    <description>A univariate logistic regression to assess the correlations between each independent variable and the binary outcome presence or absence of peri-implantitis at treated implants will be used. Then, a multivariable regression analysis will be use including the independent variables from the univariate analysis that reach a statistical significance after adjusting for gender and age.</description>
