  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep quality affect working and learning performance; poor quality of sleep is one of the
      common problems of modern people. Traditionally, polysomnography is a recognized standard for
      sleep quality assessment. Subjects are put adhesive electrodes, chest and abdomen band,
      oximetery, and oronasal cannula and stay in certified sleep laboratory for monitoring. These
      sensors setup are cumbersome and be likely to induce discomfort. An alternative to assess the
      quality of sleep is actigraphy, which allows users to wear for more than two weeks. In recent
      years, many of the smart watches, which often measure wrist photoplethysmography (PPG) signal
      and body movement, are prevailing to make long-term sleep monitoring feasible, but its
      accuracy and effectiveness still need to be verified.

      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common disorder characterized by intermittent hypoxia and
      sleep fragmentation. OSA is associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, metabolic
      dysregulation, and neurocognitive dysfunction, which results in the negative impact on
      prognosis. PSG is the gold standard for OSA diagnosis which is expensive and less accessible.
      Therefore, modality other than PSG is necessary to speed up diagnosis and treatment. Center
      of Sleep Disorder in National Taiwan University Hospital has been operated since June 2006.
      Up to Dec.2015, totally 8,819 patients have been referred for sleep studies (NTUH cohort)
      where 1,435 patients are under long-term CPAP and 396 patients are under MAD. Using data from
      4,618 patients in NTUH cohort, we have already established an OSA prediction mode
      (apnea-hypopnea index, AHI≥5/hr) with accuracy 82.37% (sensitivity 87.03%, positive
      predictive value 91%). Regarding the molecular mechanism, our previous study showed that by
      plasma metabolomics profiling, we could identify candidate metabolites associated with OSA
      severity. The 11 candidate metabolites were identified by comparing profiling in 100 patients
      with AHI &lt;15/hr and with AHI&gt;=15/hr, respectively. Six identified metabolites were selected
      to establish an AHI prediction model which gave sensitivity 66%, specificity 72%, and AUROC
      0.736. Furthermore, 15 plasma metabolites associated with excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS)
      or polysomnographic parameters were identified. Among those metabolites, L-Kynurenine and
      g-Glutamylleucine were metabolites associated with EDS which generated the AUROC to EDS
      prediction as 63% in study group and 76.7% in validation group. The online system (Good
      Sleep) for diagnosis of sleep disorder has been set up under the collaboration between, NTU,
      NTUH, and MediaTek. It aims on population with low probability of sleep disorder which
      compliments the NTUH cohort, high probability of sleep disorder. The online system provides
      the diagnosis and solution of sleep disorder, sleep tracking, and education via both website
      and App. The system is almost set and needs the input from general population to validate the
      accuracy.

      The sleep healthcare system, which includes questionnaires, smart watches,24-hr BP and
      ＂LARGAN＂ECG Holter for long-term home sleep monitoring, is proposed to allow users to detect
      potential subjects who have sleep disorders by filling out the questionnaire. The aims of the
      present project include: (1) All 300 voluntary.Stage1, Recruit 140 voluntary participants
      from MediaTek to validate agreement of sleep efficiency via online system, actigraph devices,
      smart watches and daily blood pressure for one week.Stage2, Recruit 160 voluntary
      participants from patients with moderate-severe OSA (AHI≥15/hr) to validate agreement of
      sleep efficiency via online system, actigraph devices, smart watches, ECG Holter and 24 hour
      blood pressure for one day. (2) All participants will take an overnight PSG test, blood
      sampling, basal metabolism measurement, ECG Holter, body composition and E-Prime at the sleep
      center to validate the performance of online system on diagnosis of OSA in low risk
      population. (3) Analyze the of PSG parameters in both low and high risk population (to build
      up the out of center devices for OSA home testing). (4) Integrate the clinical parameters and
      plasma metabolic profile, before and after treatment, to identify factors associated with OSA
      related sequels and long-term prognosis.
