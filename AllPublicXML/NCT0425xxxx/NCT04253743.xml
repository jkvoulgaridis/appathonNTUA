  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The 2010 Child Nutrition Reauthorization provided funding to test innovative strategies to
      end childhood hunger and food insecurity. Demonstration projects were funded in Chickasaw
      Nation, Kentucky, Navajo Nation, Nevada, and Virginia. This study focuses on Nevada.

      SNAP households were randomly assigned to receive either: (1) $40 extra in SNAP benefits per
      eligible child (&lt;5 years) per month; (2) $40 extra in SNAP benefits per eligible child per
      month plus case management and nutrition education; or (3) only regular monthly SNAP benefit.
      The first two groups were the treatment arms and the third was the control group.

      Objectives: To (1) reduce food insecurity among children; (2) increase enrollment in the
      Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) and other
      nutrition assistance programs; and (3) improve nutrition and healthy shopping habits through
      nutrition education.

      Target Population: Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) households with children
      under age 5 and incomes below 75 percent of the Federal Poverty Level living in Clark County,
      Las Vegas, Nevada.

      Intervention: SNAP households were randomly assigned to receive either: (1) $40 extra in SNAP
      benefits per eligible child (&lt;5 years) per month; (2) $40 extra in SNAP benefits per eligible
      child per month plus case management and nutrition education; or (3) only regular monthly
      SNAP benefit. The first two groups were the treatment arms and the third was the control
      group.

      The two treatment groups were ultimately combined because of the low uptake of case
      management and nutrition education.
