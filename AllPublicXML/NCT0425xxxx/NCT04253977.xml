  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project evaluates the effectiveness of an evidence-based intervention (HEALTH-P2) to
      prevent excessive weight gain from pregnancy through 12 months postpartum when disseminated
      and implemented in real-world settings, through Parents as Teachers. To enhance the impact of
      HEALTH-P2, the study also evaluates implementation outcomes from the training curriculum
      (implementation strategy) and external validity when HEALTH-P2 is implemented within this
      national home visiting organization. This partnership has potential for significant impact on
      obesity and chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women are exceptionally vulnerable during childbearing years to gain disproportionally large
      amounts of weight when compared to men or other life periods. Weight gained during pregnancy
      and retained after the postpartum period contributes to obesity development and progression.
      Evidence based lifestyle interventions addressing the trajectory of weight gain across the
      childbearing continuum can reverse these alarming trends of excessive weight among young
      women, but have had limited uptake due to time, expense, and parenting priorities. To address
      this gap, our research team developed the lifestyle intervention Healthy Eating, Activity
      Living, Taught at Home during Pregnancy and Postpartum (HEALTH-P2) in partnership with
      Parents as Teachers (PAT). This study will provide evidence for the dissemination and
      implementation (D&amp;I) of HEALTH-P2 across PAT's network of sites, promoting healthy weight on
      a national scale. The study builds on our previous work with a pragmatic cluster randomized
      controlled trial to evaluate D&amp;I of HEALTH-P2 across multiple levels to achieve widespread
      impact. First, we will determine weight outcomes (12-month postpartum weight; gestational
      weigh gain) among 468 overweight/obese women (N=234 HEALTH-P2; N=234 usual care) when parent
      educators (~8/site) from 36 PAT sites nationwide (18 HEALTH-P2, 18 usual care) receive the
      HEALTH-P2 training through PAT National Center's existing training infrastructure and conduct
      HEALTH-P2 as part of routine practice. From a D&amp;I perspective, an evaluation guided by RE-AIM
      will measure implementation outcomes (acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility, fidelity,
      adaptation). Further, the Conceptual Framework for Implementation Research will guide an
      assessment of contextual factors that influence external validity at multiple levels (mother,
      parent educator, PAT site).
