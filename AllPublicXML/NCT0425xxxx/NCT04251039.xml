      Evaluation of Efficacy/Safety in Cangrelor use in patients with SCAD undergoing complex PCI.

      Prospective, observational, multicenter registry.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SCAD patients routinely in the Italian centers undergo complex PCIs with pre-treatment with
      P2Y12 inhibitors or with P2Y12 inhibitors administration after procedure. This implies that
      participants receive interventions as part of routine medical care, and that researchers
      actually observe the effect of the intervention.
