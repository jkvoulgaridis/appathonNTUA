    <textblock>
      This phase II trial compares high-dose rate brachytherapy and stereotactic ablative
      radiotherapy as monotherapy in treating patients with prostate cancer that has not spread to
      other parts of the body (localized). High-dose rate brachytherapy delivers radiation directly
      into the prostate within a few minutes by a single radioactive seed through temporarily
      placed plastic catheters inside the prostate gland. Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy is an
      external beam radiation method that delivers large doses of radiation to the cancer in a
      short period of time, usually 5 treatments. This trial aims to find which of these two
      approaches is better in terms of patient-reported quality of life.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess feasibility of a pilot randomized trial evaluating stereotactic ablative
      radiotherapy (SABR) and high-dose rate brachytherapy for localized prostate cancer.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo high-dose rate brachytherapy (HDR).

      ARM II: Patients undergo SABR every other day for 5 treatments.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.

    <measure>Feasibility of comparing stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) and high-dose rate brachytherapy (HDRB)</measure>
    <time_frame>36 months</time_frame>
    <description>Feasibility is defined as success in enrolling patients, performing the procedures, reporting adverse effects, collecting and managing data across several institutions and patient compliance in completing health-related quality of life questionnaires.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in patient reported Health-Related Quality of life (HRQoL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>Will be assessed by the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC)-26 short form at baseline, 1,3,6,9,12,18,24 and 36 months.
The response to each EPIC item is standardized to a 0 to 100 scale, with higher scores representing better quality of life. Each domain is then scored by adding the score of each item within the group divided by the total number of items. Since androgen-deprivation therapy is not permitted in our study, the hormonal score will not be reported. HRQoL scores in the bowel, sexual, urinary incontinence and irritative domains will be evaluated.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in patient-reported urinary toxicity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>Will be assessed by American Urology Association Symptom Score questionnaires (AUA) at baseline, 1,3,6,9,12,18,24 and 36 months.
The AUA evaluates urinary function, 7 questions, total score is 35. The higher the score, the higher rate of urinary toxicity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in patient-reported sexual toxicity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>Will be assessed by Sexual Health Inventory for Men (SHIM) questionnaires at baseline, 1,3,6,9,12,18,24 and 36 months.
The SHIM, score 1-25 lower score reflecting severe erectile dysfunction.</description>

    <measure>Incidence of adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>Physician-reported adverse events using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 will be reported at baseline, 1,3,6,9,12,18,24 and 36 months at each patient visit.</description>
