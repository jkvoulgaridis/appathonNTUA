  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prototype support surface has been designed which aims to successfully redistributes the
      pressures exerted and provides sufficient support to human soft tissue

      We want to prove the effectiveness of the prototype support surface by enlisting patients in
      a clinical trial, where we will assess the presence of pressure ulcers, and the ability of
      the patients to tolerate the support surface, and also measure the pressure over time and
      compare them to when the patients are using standard mattresses.
