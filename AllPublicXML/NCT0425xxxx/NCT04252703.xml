  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Older patients with co-morbidity are increasingly represented in interventional cardiology
      practice. They have been historically excluded from studies regarding the optimal management
      of NSTEACS. Though there are associated risks with invasive treatment, such patients likely
      derive the greatest absolute benefit from PCI. Small, though highly selective, studies
      suggest a routine invasive strategy may reduce the risk of recurrent myocardial infarction.

      The study aims to include, as far as possible, an 'all-comers' population of patients aged 80
      and above to define the optimum amount of revascularization required to achieve good outcomes
      and satisfactory symptom relief for this challenging cohort of patients.

    <description>The 'Minimalist' strategy is PCI treatment of the culprit lesion only. Other coronary stenoses are to be managed medically. It is recognized that there may be multiple culprit lesions in such patients, though there are no data on how frequently this might be expected. Operators may elect to treat multiple putative culprit lesions in this case.</description>

    <description>The 'More complete' strategy is PCI of the culprit lesion and fractional flow reserve (FFR)- or instantaneous wave-free ratio (iFR)-guided treatment of other angiographically significant (&gt; 50% diameter) stenoses amenable to coronary stenting in vessels with reference diameters ≥2.5mm. Physiological assessment is strongly encouraged but not mandatory for lesions of ≥90% angiographic stenosis. PCI of chronic total occlusions will not be attempted as part of the study.</description>
