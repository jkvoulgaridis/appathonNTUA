      This is a phase 2A multi-centre, open label, pilot study of pembrolizumab added to the
      standard first-line therapy of cyclophosphamide, bortezomib and dexamethasone (CyBorD) in
      newly diagnosed patients with multiple myeloma that are not eligible for autologous stem cell
      transplantation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2A, pilot study of pembrolizumab administered in combination with CyBorD in
      newly diagnosed, transplant ineligible multiple myeloma patients who achieve less than VGPR
      (according to IMWG criteria) after two cycles of treatment.

      Newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients will start their standard CyBorD treatment with the
      combination of cyclophosphamide administered at 300 mg/m2 orally, bortezomib administered at
      1.5 mg/m2 subcutaneously, and dexamethasone administered orally at 40 mg, all given on days
      1, 8, 15 and 22 of each 28-day cycle. Patients not progressing after 2 cycles of CyBorD
      treatment and achieving less than VGPR by IMWG criteria will be screened for this study.
      Subjects meeting the eligibility criteria will add pembrolizumab to their standard CyBorD
      treatment starting with cycle 4 day 1, which will be cycle one of this study treatment.
      Pembrolizumab in combination with CyBorD will be administered intravenously at 200 mg at day
      1 of every 3-week cycle for 8 cycles (24 weeks). CyBorD will be discontinued after 24 weeks
      and Pembrolizumab will be administered as a single agent at the same dose for an additional
      24 cycles.

             or uncontrolled infection, acute diffuse pulmonary disease, pericardial disease,
             uncontrolled thyroid dysfunction), therapy or laboratory abnormality that might
             confound the results of the study, interfere with the subject's participation for the
