  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effect of use of powered toothbrushing in patients exhibiting periodontal inflammation
      has been observed repeatedly in clinical studies conducted over a 20+ year period. Whether
      these subjects also had periodontitis, or not, was not a collected data metric as it was
      outside the scope of the Investigation. This study, therefore, will specifically include and
      document that a subject exhibits periodontitis upon study entry, and measure the ensuing
      response following professional treatment of scaling and root planning, followed by home use
      of the assigned study products (powered or manual toothbrushing).
