    <textblock>
      The study explores the efficacy of lopinavir plus ritonavir and arbidol in treating with
      novel coronavirus infection. As a result this study would provide evidence for the clinical
      usage of these drugs in the future .

    <textblock>
      This is a phase IV, open-labelled, randomized controlled clinical trial. A total of 125 cases
      who are novel coronavirus positive are planned to be recruited. These cases are randomized
      into 3 groups: in group A（Standard treatment+lopinavir/ritonavir）, 50 cases are given
      ordinary treatment plus a regimen of lopinavir (200mg) and ritonavir (50mg) (oral, q12h,
      every time 2 tablets of each, taking for 7-14 days). In group B（Standard treatment+arbidol） ,
      50 cases are given ordinary treatment plus a regimen of arbidol (100mg) (oral, tid, 200mg
      each time, taking for 7-14 days). In group C（Standard treatment）, 25 cases are only given
      ordinary treatment. The observation duration is 21 days. Patients will be followed up at
      baseline (day 0) and day 2, 4, 7, 10,14, 21 after receiving indicated treatment. The primary
      observed indicators include viral nucleic in acid nose / throat swab, body temperature,
      respiratory rate, oxygen saturation of blood, chest imaging. The secondary observed
      indicators include but not limited to blood pressure, heart rate, blood routine test, liver
      and kidney function, myocardial enzyme, flow cytometry classification and counting,
      cytokines, other infection indicators, conditions and parameters of auxiliary respiration,
      the total days in hospital, exacerbation and mortality.
