    <textblock>
      This feasibility study will evaluate how well hyperpolarized 13C pyruvate magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) scan works in predicting tumor aggressiveness in patients with localized renal
      tumor. Hyperpolarized 13C pyruvate is a non-radioactive substance with potential usage in the
      diagnostic imaging of tumors. Hyperpolarized 13C pyruvate MRI may help doctors determine
      non-invasively whether a kidney tumor is a benign tumor or cancer, and if cancer, how
      aggressive it is. This may help doctors and patients with renal tumors in the future to make
      better treatment decisions.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

        1. To investigate the correlation between hyperpolarized (HP) 13C pyruvate-to-lactate
           conversion, as measured by lactate/pyruvate ratio, and renal tumor histology (benign
           renal tumors versus renal cell carcinomas (RCCs)) and grade (low versus high grade in
           cases of RCCs).

        2. To investigate the correlation between HP 13C pyruvate-to-lactate conversion, as
           measured by the apparent rate constant kPL, and renal tumor histology (benign renal
           tumors versus renal cell carcinomas (RCCs)) and grade (low versus high grade in cases of
           RCCs).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        1. To investigate the correlation between HP markers, as measured by lactate/pyruvate
           ratio, and tissue-based markers including Lactate dehydrogenase-A (LDHA) expression on
           tumor tissues from surgical specimen.

        2. To investigate the correlation between HP markers, as measured by apparent rate constant
           kPL, and tissue-based markers including Lactate dehydrogenase-A (LDHA) expression on
           tumor tissues from surgical specimen.

        3. To determine the safety of HP 13C pyruvate in renal tumor patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive HP 13C pyruvate intravenously (IV) and then undergo 13C MRI scan 1-2 minutes
      post HP 13C pyruvate injection. Patients may receive an optional second HP 13C pyruvate
      injection and undergo 13C pyruvate MRI scan 15 to 60 minutes following completion of the
      first scan.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up 30 minutes.
