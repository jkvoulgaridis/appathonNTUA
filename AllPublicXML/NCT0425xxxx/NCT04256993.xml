  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this observational study researchers want to gather more information about bone fractures
      and survival in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) patients treated with radium-223
      in routine clinical practice in Sweden. The goal is to estimate the proportion of new cases
      (incidence) of symptomatic bone fractures and to estimate the proportion of death occurred in
      years of observation time per person (person years). Radium-223 (Ra-223) is an alpha
      particle-emitting radioactive agent approved for the treatment of men with metastatic
      castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).

        The study population comprises men with mCRPC in the PPC (Patient-overview Prostate Cancer)
        PCBaSe data set during the study time frame, with the potential addition of men with mCRPC
        in the Karolinska Institutet data sets.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate, i.e., the patient is
             registered in the NPCR (histology other than adenocarcinomas are not registered in the
             NPCR).

          -  Start of Ra-223 treatment for mCRPC as an n-th line of treatment, where &quot;n&quot; goes from
             1 to 4.

          -  ECOG performance status of 0-2 at treatment initiation. We will assume that patients
             starting any of the systemic therapies under study have a performance status of 0-2.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior use of Ra-223

          -  Patients that have participated in a Ra-223 RCT

    <ipd_description>Availability of this study's data will be determined according to Bayer's commitment to the EFPIA/PhRMA &quot;Principles for responsible clinical trial data sharing&quot;. This pertains to scope, timepoint and process of data access. As such, Bayer commits to sharing upon request from qualified researchers patient-level clinical trial data, study-level clinical trial data, and protocols from clinical trials in patients for medicines and indications approved in the US and EU as necessary for conducting legitimate research. This applies to data on new medicines and indications that have been approved by the EU and US regulatory agencies on or after January 01, 2014. Interested researchers can use www.clinicalstudydatarequest.com to request access to anonymized patient-level data and supporting documents from clinical studies to conduct research.
