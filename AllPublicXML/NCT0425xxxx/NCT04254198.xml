  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will use a multi-level, community-engaged approach to implement &quot;TERTULIAS&quot;
      (&quot;conversational gatherings&quot; in Spanish). The intervention uses an innovative, culturally and
      contextually situated peer support group design that was developed by the investigators to
      improve health outcomes and reduce health disparities for FMI participants in Albuquerque,
      New Mexico. The study will use a rigorous, transdisciplinary, QUAL⇒QUANT, mixed-method
      research design. The investigators will document results of the intervention on the primary
      hypotheses of a decrease in depression, and increases in resilience and social support, as
      well as on the secondary hypotheses of decreased stress (including the use of innovative
      testing of hair cortisol as a biomarker for chronic stress), and an increase in social
      connectedness and positive assessment of knowledge and empowerment gained through the
      TERTULIAS intervention.

      Specific Aims. The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial with 240 FMIs.
      Intervention participants will attend a weekly peer group session over 12 months. Control
      group participants will receive a bimonthly check-in call. All will be surveyed using
      validated instruments and give hair samples gathered at baseline and 12 months. A subset will
      be interviewed, and group sessions will be documented. Data will be triangulated using
      different methods with a QUAL⇒QUAN simultaneous data collection and analysis approach to
      integrate, converge, and elaborate findings in a way that would not be feasible using only
      one method.

      Aim 1. To measure whether a culturally situated peer group intervention will reduce
      depression and stress associated with the experience of immigration. Question: Does an
      intervention design that reproduces culturally important interactions, activities, and
      constructs lost through immigration result in decreased participant depression and stress?
      Hypothesis: Incorporating peer-to-peer social interaction, food sharing, and storytelling
      into the design of a nonclinical peer support group intervention will leverage positive
      aspects of participant culture and create an experiential context that will (a) decrease
      participant depression scores by at least 6.5 points more on the Center for Epidemiologic
      Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) as compared to controls (effect size Cohen's d = 0.43), and
      (b) lower stress scores in participants more than in controls with d ≥ 0.5 as measured by the
      Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). The investigators will also assess stress using a cutting-edge
      biological assessment of hair cortisol as a biomarker for chronic stress.

      Aim 2. To test whether an intervention using a &quot;women's funds of knowledge&quot; approach results
      in improved resilience, knowledge and empowerment. Question: Does an intervention design that
      encourages participants to share knowledge they developed through life experience and that
      values this knowledge as a form of expertise nurture protective factors (resilience and
      knowledge/empowerment) to help FMIs adapt to the immigration context and disrupt the
      mechanisms that produce health disparities? Hypothesis: Incorporating, valuing and validating
      women's knowledge and experience in the design of a peer support group intervention will
      improve participant capacity to adapt to the immigrant context and provide participants with
      empowering knowledge to deal with new situations. Intervention participants will have higher
      scores at 12 months and have a larger increase over time as compared to controls (d = 0.5) on
      the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale-25 (CD-RISC 25). Knowledge and empowerment will be
      assessed at 12 months and expect to find high scores with the Trauma-Informed Practice (TIP)
      Scale (which is designed for post-use).

      Aim 3. To investigate whether a culturally situated peer group intervention using a women's
      funds of knowledge approach can give participants' a sense and experience of social and
      physical connection (&quot;emplacement&quot;) that is lost in the process of immigration. Question: Can
      the proposed peer support group intervention recreate social and physical connections lost
      through immigration and strengthen participant social networks? Hypothesis: The peer group
      will create a culturally appropriate context for establishing interpersonal connections
      between group members and will give participants a sense of belonging within a social and
      contextual milieu. At study end, (a) experimental participants will have a marked increase in
      social support scores v.s. the control group using the Medical Outcomes Study Social Support
      Survey (MOS SSS) (d ≥ 0.5), and (b) stronger, more dense social connections as described by a
      social network analysis.

      Project Outcomes. This intervention with FMIs will test an innovative intervention to reduce
      social isolation as a mechanism for reducing depression by leveraging positive cultural
      dynamics and women's funds of knowledge to nurture social connectedness, knowledge, and
      resiliency factors in the lives of participants in a transformative way. Generalizability.
      This trial of TERTULIAS will create a replicable, scalable model for culturally appropriate
      health promotion with FMIs that has implications for health promotion work with other women
      from recent and first generation immigrant populations.

    <description>Knowledge and empowerment will be assessed at 12 months in the intervention arm only using the six subscales of the 33-item Trauma-Informed Practice (TIP) Scale as well as a total score across the subscales. The subscales are Agency (9 items), Information (5 items), Connection (3 items), Strengths (3 items), Inclusivity (8 items), and Parenting (5 items) with each item ranging from 0 (not at all true) to 3 (very true). Descriptive statistics will be reported (means and 95% CIs). Higher scores indicate higher levels of knowledge and empowerment associated with the intervention.</description>

    <description>Results from the following social network analyses (SNA) of the Intervention arm will be &quot;mapped&quot; using UCINET SNA software: 1.) Construct participants' social networks using answers to questions modeled after the General Social Survey. Baseline and 12-month networks will be compared and changes in network density and characteristics will be described. 2.) The level of inclusion of other study participants in individual social networks from baseline to 12 months will be assessed. 3.) Using questions about local resources (e.g., the health insurance exchange, health navigation programs, public food/benefit/clothing programs and charities, free legal assistance programs, low-cost ESL/GED programs, domestic violence programs, transportation/utilities assistance programs, etc.), changes in each study participant's awareness of, knowledge about, and likelihood of accessing resources will be assessed.</description>

    <description>TERTULIAS will involve structured dialogue groups using the model developed and tested by the investigators through their preliminary research. Each group will have 10 women and will meet weekly for two hours over a 12-month period. Group meetings will be conducted in Spanish, led by a team of two FMI facilitators. Facilitation will use the structured dialogue approach. In the last two months of each cohort, participants will be invited to write their own stories or recipes, or produce poetry or art representing their experience to share with the group. These contributions will be gathered and reproduced in &quot;booklet&quot; form and each participant will receive a copy.</description>
