      The broad aim of the proposed study is to use the innovative Multiphase Optimization Strategy
      to develop a highly effective Internet-delivered intervention, myPlaybook, for the prevention
      of substance use among college student-athletes. myPlaybook will undergo two rounds of
      randomized experimentation and targeted revision. At the conclusion of the second round, the
      optimized version of myPlaybook will be evaluated in large-scale Randomized Controlled Trial
      (RCT).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      College student-athletes are at increased risk of heavy alcohol use, smokeless tobacco use,
      and the use of performance enhancing substances as compared to non-athlete college students.
      Despite recent research underscoring the need for athlete-tailored interventions, there are
      no evidence-based options for the prevention of substance use among college student-athletes
      that take into account their unique patterns and motivations for use. This void leaves
      colleges with few easy-to-use, effective, and economical options for meeting the needs of
      their student-athletes and the minimum drug education requirements set by their governing
      organizations. The broad aim of the proposed study is to use the innovative Multiphase
      Optimization Strategy to develop a highly effective Internet-delivered program (myPlaybook)
      for the prevention of substance use among college student-athletes. The MOST approach is a
      systematic method for making decisions about program development and adaptation that are
      based on the performance of individual program components. The five core lessons of
      myPlaybook will undergo two rounds of randomized experimentation and targeted revision. At
      the conclusion of the second round, the newly optimized version of myPlaybook will be
      assembled and evaluated in large-scale Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT). This &quot;beta&quot; version
      of myPlaybook will be compared to an Internet-based college alcohol intervention with proven
      effectiveness with general college students. This approach will allow us to 1) develop an
      intervention that is optimized for considerable impact on substance use outcomes and 2)
      demonstrate the need for interventions specifically adapted for college student-athletes. The
      proposed research will be among the first demonstrations of the MOST approach for building
      and evaluating behavioral interventions with greatly enhanced public health impact. PUBLIC
      HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project has the potential to contribute to the health and safety of
      the more than 460,000 college student-athletes in the US. A contribution to the science of
      prevention will be made by demonstrating an innovative approach for the development and
      revision of behavioral interventions that focuses on achieving both statistical significance
      and optimizing public health impact.

    <time_frame>past 30-day</time_frame>
    <description>This scale (0-100%) measured the perceptions about the frequency of others' alcohol use. Perceived weekly drinking was computed by summing the reported estimates of drinking for each day of the week for the typical student. The lower the score the better.</description>

    <measure>Injunctive norms:DRINKING NORMS RATING FORM (adapted DNRF)</measure>
    <time_frame>past 30-day</time_frame>
    <description>This scale (0-100%) measured the perceptions about the frequency of others' approval of alcohol use. Perceived approval of alcohol use of others was computed by summing the reported estimates of approval compared to the actual approval as reported by the typical student. A lower score on this scale results in more positive effects.</description>

    <measure>Negative expectancies: COMPREHENSIVE EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL Scale (adapted CEOA)</measure>
    <time_frame>past 30-day</time_frame>
    <description>This agreement scale (1-4) measured negative expectancies (e.g., consequences of risks and/or aggression) of alcohol related effects. Sub-scale scores are calculated as the sum of respective items. A lower score on this scale results in more positive effects.</description>

    <description>This agreement scale (1-4) measured positive expectancies (e.g., socialability) of alcohol related effects. Sub-scale scores are calculated as the sum of respective items. A higher score on this scale results in more positive effects.</description>

    <description>Intentions to use protective behavioral strategies (e.g., alternating alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks). This intentions scale (1-7) measured future intent to use alcohol-related harm prevention strategies (e.g., alternating alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks). A higher score on this scale results in more positive effects.</description>
