  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite access to experimental Ebola Virus Disease (EVD)-specific treatments, about 30% of
      patients still die in the Ebola Treatment Centers (ETC) in DRC. There is limited study done
      about the potential contribution of bacterial co-infections (in particular bloodstream
      infections) to this adverse outcome, as blood cultures were so far rarely available in
      epidemic areas. Findings from patients treated in Europe and the USA, and case discussions in
      the field call for further investigation.

      Building further on an ongoing microbiological surveillance project of ITM and INRB in DRC,
      we are able to set up a research project which will pilot in a standardized manner clinical
      bacteriology tools (bacterial blood cultures, biomarkers as CRP, procalcitonin and white
      blood cell differential count, and clinical early warning scores) to study bacterial
      bloodstream infection in EVD patients in the N-Kivu/Ituri outbreak.

      This project will add evidence on 1) frequency, causative pathogen and antibiotic resistance
      profiles of bacterial bloodstream infections, as well as 2) the predictive value of
      biomarkers and early warning scores, in EVD patients at different timepoints during
      hospitalization in an ETC in DRC. The results will inform appropriate antibiotic treatment in
      an EVD setting and improve patient outcomes.

        The study population consists of laboratory confirmed EVD patients admitted to the Ebola
        Treatment Centers (ETCs) in N-Kivu &amp; Ituri province and participating in the study. As
        broad-spectrum antibiotics are often started as soon as patients arrive in the suspect area
        of the ETC or transit center, and as this might interfere with bacterial bloodstream
        infection detection in blood cultures, patients can be included from the stage of being 'a
        probable suspect' onwards in some instances (i.e. prior to start-up of broad-spectrum
        antibiotics, clinical suspicion of bacterial bloodstream infection at admission in suspect
        area, etc).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient admitted in an Ebola Treatment Center (ETC) or Ebola Transit Center (TC)

          -  Laboratory-confirmed (Ebola RT-PCR positive result) EVD diagnosis, or, EVD suspect
             patient requiring instant intravenous antibiotic treatment

          -  Willing and able to provide written informed consent personally or by a legally
             acceptable representative if the patient is unable to do so

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  We do not exclude certain patient groups, but whenever harm is expected from the
             additional blood sampling needed for this study, the clinician can opt not to enroll
             the patient
