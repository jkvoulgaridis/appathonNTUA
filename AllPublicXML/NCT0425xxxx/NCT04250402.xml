  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Through previous clinical observations and literature, we found that the incidence of
      gallstones in patients after gastric cancer radical resection was significantly higher than
      that in the normal population (4%). However, its pathogenesis has not been clarified. We
      compare the risk of gallbladder stones after four different radical gastric cancer surgical
      methods, in order to provide prevention and treatment strategies for people with gallstones
      after gastric cancer.

    <textblock>
      A large number of clinical studies have found that the incidence of gallstones in patients
      with radical gastric cancer is higher than that in the normal population. However, its
      pathogenesis has not been clarified, and there is still controversy about the prophylactic
      removal of gallbladder in patients with gastric cancer. The investigator's previous study
      found that there was no statistical difference in the incidence of gallstones after
      laparoscopic distal gastrectomy (LDG), laparoscopic total gastrectomy (LTG) and laparoscopic
      proximal gastrectomy (LPG). A common feature of the three surgical methods is that the vagus
      nerve were more or less cut during the operation. Therefore, we plan to further collect
      gastric cancer patients undergoing endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) surgery in order to
      answer whether the vagus nerve cut during surgery will increase the incidence of gallstones.

    <description>Endoscopic submucosal dissection. Endoscopic submucosal dissection is an endoscopic procedure which can achieve en bloc resection of GI tumor. ESD is characterized by three steps: injecting fluid into the submucosa to elevate the lesion from the muscle layer, circumferential cutting of the surrounding mucosa of the lesion, and subsequent dissection of the connective tissue of the submucosa beneath the lesion. The ESD procedure will be carried out by experienced endoscopists.
