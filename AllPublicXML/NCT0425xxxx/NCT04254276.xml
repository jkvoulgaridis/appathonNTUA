    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine the differences between neck and shoulder region
      skeletal muscle tone, stifness, pain-pressure threshold, self-reported pain intensity and
      physical activity in female office workers. 50-100 participants aged 20-60 are anticipated.

      The objective of this study is to determine the differences between neck and shoulder region
      skeletal muscle tone, stifness, pain-pressure threshold, self-reported pain intensity and
      physical activity.

      Participants: 50-100 subjects, all female, aged 20-60 are anticipated.

      Methods: Skeletal muscle tone and stiffness are measured using myotonometry. Pain-pressure
      threshold is measured using algometry. Prevalence of neck and shoulder area musculoskeletal
      pain is recorded using Nordic questionnaire. Self-reported pain intensity is measured using
      VAS scale. Self-reported physical activity is recorded using Baecke physical activity
      questionnaire.
