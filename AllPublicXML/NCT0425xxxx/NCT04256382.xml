      The researcher recruited 285 nurses from three hospitals, and divided them into the
      experimental group and the comparison group. The experimental group took two-hour online
      course about dementia pain care in two weeks. The comparison group took two-hour online
      course about dementia care in two weeks. The nurses performed a post-test after the two-week
      course immediately; two weeks later, the second post-test was performed again.
