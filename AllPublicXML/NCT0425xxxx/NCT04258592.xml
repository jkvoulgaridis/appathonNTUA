  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the potential and feasibility of
      18F-metafluorobenzylguanidine (18F-MFBG) positron emission tomography (PET) in patients with
      neural crest and neuroendocrine tumors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ten neural crest tumor or neuroendocrine tumor (NET) patients, with a routine clinical
      123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (123I-MIBG imaging) (planar + single photon emission tomography
      (SPECT)) performed in the previous six months or scheduled within three months, will undergo
      a dynamic PET scan for the first 30 minutes, followed by 3 static whole-body PET/CTs up to
      three hours post injection for a pharmacokinetics study and efficacy assessment of 18F-MFBG
      in humans. Furthermore, a comparison with 123I-MIBG imaging will be performed.

    <measure>Confirmation of 18F-MFBG as a hNET imaging agent in patients with neural crest and neuroendocrine tumors.</measure>
    <time_frame>20 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint will be met if in 8 out of 10 patients, at least 80% of the known positive lesions on 123I-MIBG imaging is visualized.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Normal-organ and tumor uptake of 18F-MFBG as a function of time</measure>
    <time_frame>20 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will undergo dynamic PET scanning followed by three static whole-body PET/CT scans at different time points post injection. Uptake as a function of time (pharmacokinetics) will be studied using the software package PMOD (PMOD technologies LLC, Zürich, Switzerland). Volumes of interest (VOIs) will be delineated in relevant normal organs and tumor lesions on all PET images and standardized uptake values (SUV) in all these VOIs will be measured to compute normal-organ and tumor uptake as a function of time.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Identify the ideal time point for imaging after 18F-MFBG injection.</measure>
    <time_frame>20 months</time_frame>
    <description>Tumor-to-background ratios as a function of time will be measured. The time point resulting in optimal tumor-to-background ratios, taking into account a realistic implementation in clinical practice, will be defined as the ideal time point for imaging.</description>

    <measure>Safety analysis of 18F-MFBG administration: Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03</measure>
    <time_frame>20 months</time_frame>
    <description>The impact of 18F-MFBG administration on clinical symptoms and signs and biochemistry values will be evaluated. Baseline values will be recorded and subjects will be assessed clinically and with serial biochemical analysis. Adverse events will be scored according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03.</description>

    <measure>Assessment of lesion targeting by 18F-MFBG as compared to 123I-MIBG</measure>
    <time_frame>20 months</time_frame>
    <description>A lesion-by-lesion analysis (visual and semi-quantitative) will be performed to compare the number of detected lesions using both tracers.</description>
