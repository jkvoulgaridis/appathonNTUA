  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is one of the greatest causes of preventable morbidity and mortality worldwide with
      the main treatments requiring significant changes to lifestyle, particularly dieting and
      physical exercise. Glucomannan is a dietary fibre that expands in the stomach, creating the
      feeling of fulness, while chromium can regulate insulin response.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this pilot study was to investigate the effect of agglomerated glucomannan,
      oligofructose and chromium, as part of a calorie restricted diet plan, on weight loss,
      satiety, satiation, mood and gut microbiome composition in a human intervention study.

    <time_frame>To test, in humans, changes in blood pressure (calculated in mm/Hg) from the baseline to 4 weeks intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Blood pressure was measured using a digital blood pressure monitor (Nissei, model DS-1902, Japan Precision Instruments, Inc., Gunma, Japan).</description>

    <measure>Body composition changes from baseline to 4 weeks intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>To test, in humans, changes in body fat percentage (calculated in %) from the baseline to 4 weeks intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Body fat percentage was assessed after a 12-hour water-only fast by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) method, using a Tanita BC-418 MA Segmental Body Composition Analyser, which incorporates eight tactile electrodes (Tanita Corporation, Tokyo, Japan).</description>

    <measure>Waist circumference changes from baseline to 4 weeks intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>To test, in humans, changes in waist circumference (calculated in cm) from the baseline to 4 weeks intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Waist was assessed using anthropometric tape (Seca 201, Hamburg, Germany) over light clothing to the nearest 0.1 centimetre while the subjects were in the standing position at the end of gentle expiration. The waist circumference was measured at the mid-point between the lowest rib margin and anterior superior iliac crest and hip circumference was measured at the maximum protuberance of the buttocks, and the waist-to-hip ratio was calculated by dividing waist circumference by hip circumference.</description>

    <measure>Resting metabolic rate changes from baseline to 4 weeks intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>To test, in humans, changes in resting metabolic rate (calculated Kcal) from the baseline to 4 weeks intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Resting metabolic rate (RMR) before and at the end of the 4-week intervention was determined by indirect calorimetry using the breath-by-breath system of recording (Cortex MetaLyzer 3B device).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>DNA Gut microbiome diversity changes from baseline to 4 weeks intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>To test, in humans, changes in the faecal microbiota composition and microbial activity of the volunteers using DNA profiling in faeces from the baseline to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Sequencing was performed on an Illumina MiSeq desktop sequencer using the MiSeq Reagent Kit V2 (Illumina, San Diego). The significance in the abundance of the relevant taxa were validated by Wilcoxon signed-rank tests (16s rRNA sequencing using Illumina MiSeq Platform and QIIME data analysis software).</description>

    <measure>Hunger, mood and cravings changes from baseline to 4 weeks intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>To test, in humans, changes in hunger, mood and cravings (questionnaire based analysis) from the baseline to 4 weeks intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in hunger, mood and craving was determined via Control of Eating Questionnaire (CoEQ) comprised of twenty items to assess the intensity and type of food cravings each participant experienced over the previous 7 days, as well as subjective sensations of appetite and mood. Responses were recorded using the visual analogue scale.</description>

    <description>Participants visited the University of Roehampton on three separate occasions: visit 1 (screening), visit 2 (baseline), and visit 3 (end of the trial) in total over a period of 4-weeks. During the 4-week study period, participants were instructed to replace breakfast and lunch with a shake (206 kcal/shake) each delivering 3g of the active ingredient (Mix: agglomerated glucomannan, oligofructose and chromium picolinate), and one snack bar each delivering 1.5g of the active ingredient (112 kcal/bar) in between breakfast and lunch, and lunch and dinner following by a selection of healthy dinner according to standard nutritional guidance not exceeding 1500 kcal/day. All subjects were instructed to prepare shakes by using a shaker or blender by mixing all ingredients with 200 ml of water. Participants were also instructed to consume all shakes and bars with an extra 200 ml glass of water throughout the study period.</description>
