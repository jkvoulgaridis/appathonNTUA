  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Maximum Observed Plasma Analyte Concentration (Cmax) of JNJ-64417184</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 6</time_frame>
    <description>Cmax is the maximum observed plasma analyte concentration.</description>

    <measure>Area Under the Concentration-time Curve from Time Zero to the Last Measurable Concentration (AUC [0-last]) of JNJ-64417184</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 6</time_frame>
    <description>AUC (0-last) is area under the plasma analyte concentration-time curve (AUC) from time 0 to time of the last quantifiable (non-below quantification limit [non-BQL]) concentration, calculated by linear-linear trapezoidal summation.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Area Under the Concentration-time Curve from Time Zero to Infinity (AUC [0-infinity]) of JNJ-64417184</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 6</time_frame>
    <description>AUC (0-infinity) is the area under the plasma analyte concentration-time curve (AUC) from time zero to infinite time, calculated as the sum of AUC (0-last) and C(last)/lambda(z); wherein AUC (0-last) is area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to last measurable concentration, C(last) is the last observed measurable (non-BQL) analyte concentration; and lambda(z) is apparent terminal elimination rate constant.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs) as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 28 days</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant administered a medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Acceptability of the JNJ-64417184 Formulation as Assessed by Participant</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 28 days</time_frame>
    <description>The acceptability of the JNJ-64417184 formulations will be assessed by the participants using a questionnaire designed to rate the taste and smell as well as the overall acceptability of the formulations. The questionnaire will consist of a visual analogue scale to rate 5 items (sweetness, bitterness, aroma type, aroma strength, and smell) as well as overall acceptability.</description>

             gonadotropin (beta- hCG) pregnancy test at screening and a negative urine pregnancy
             test on Day -1

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of liver or renal dysfunction significant cardiac, vascular, pulmonary,
             gastrointestinal (such as significant diarrhea, gastric stasis, or constipation that
             in the investigator's opinion could influence drug absorption or bioavailability),
             endocrine, neurologic, hematologic, rheumatologic, psychiatric, neoplastic, or
             metabolic disturbances

          -  Past history of cardiac arrhythmias (example, extrasystoli, tachycardia at rest),
             history of risk factors for Torsade de Pointes syndrome (example, hypokalemia, family
             history of long QT Syndrome)

          -  Any evidence of heart block or bundle branch block at screening

          -  Current human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) or HIV-2 infection (confirmed by
             antibodies) at screening

          -  A history of clinically significant drug allergy such as, but not limited to,
             sulfonamides and penicillins, or drug allergy witnessed in previous studies with
