      Retrospective monocentric study evaluating different immunohistochemical phenotypes related

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      About 80% of newly diagnosed patients have non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC),
      including papillary lesions confined to the urothelium (stage Ta) or invading the lamina
      propria (stage T1), and carcinoma in situ (CIS). These tumors show low progression rates, but
      high recurrence. In particular, patients with multifocal high-grade urothelial carcinoma have
      a high risk of both recurrence (∼70% after 1 yr) and progression (5% after 1 yr). Initial
      NMIBC management is a transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT), followed by adjuvant
      intravesical treatment with the chemotherapeutic agent Mitomycin C (MMC) or the immunotherapy
      Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG). However, these therapies lead to variable clinical responses
      and patients recur shortly after surgery. Despite both therapies have been used for decades
      in the treatment of NMIBC, at the moment it is not possible to predict after initial staging
      which patients will benefit from them since neither resistance mechanisms nor genetic markers
      associated to relapse have been identified yet.

      In a preliminary analysis, the invesitigators found that low expression of several proteins
      involved in mitochondrial functions correlate with a worst prognosis in bladder cancer
      patients. The aim of this study is to detect markers of mitochondrial dysfunction by
      immunohistochemistry in recurrent tumors (&quot;non-responders&quot;) and non-recurrent tumors
      (&quot;responders&quot;) after intravesical treatment with chemotherapy or immunotherapy, and determine
      the prognostic relevance of these different markers.
