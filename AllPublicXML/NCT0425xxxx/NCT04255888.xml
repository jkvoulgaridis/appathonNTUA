    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to estimate the effect of periodontal phenotype on the outcome of
      isolated gingival recession by laterally positioned flap.The primary objective of study is to
      assess the changes in gingival margin in the donor tooth after laterally positioned flap over
      a period of 6 months and to assess the influence of periodontal phenotype on the stability of
      results of root coverage achieved through laterally positioned flap. The secondary objective
      of this study is to evaluate root coverage by laterally positioned flap in thick periodontal
      phenotype and to evaluate root coverage by laterally positioned flap in thin periodontal
      phenotype.

      A variety of surgical techniques have been proposed to achieve successful and predictable
      root coverage. These include coronally advanced flap, lateral positioned flap (LPF) free
      gingival graft, free connective tissue graft, and guided tissue regeneration. LPF, originally
      described by Grupe and Warren in 1964 is one of the most commonly performed root coverage
      technique.The procedure has undergone various modification over the years .Staffileno and
      pfeifer and Heller advocated the use of split-thickness flap to minimize the potential risk
      for the development of recession in the donor tooth.Wood et al used re-entry procedures to
      compare crestal radicular bone responses to full and partial thickness flaps. They concluded
      that regardless of the flap procedure, loss of crestal bone depended on the periodontal
      phenotype.The term periodontal phenotype refers to phenotypic characteristic of bone and soft
      tissue that make up the periodontium. Periodontal phenotype is typically used to describe the
      buccolingual tissue thickness and gingival morphology. It is divided into thick flat and thin
      scalloped type. However there is a paucity of studies in the literature studying the effect
      periodontal phenotype on the root coverage obtained and its stability over time after LPF.
      Furthermore the impact of periodontal phenotype on the donor area in this procedure has not
      been explored. Therefore the present study is designed with the aim to evaluate the influence
      of periodontal phenotype on the outcome of root coverage by LPF.
