  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is associated with high risk for suicide attempts (22-28%) and
      substance use disorders (49%), underscoring the importance of accurate, real-time risk
      detection in BDD. This study aims to use smartphone-based digital phenotyping to develop and
      validate unobtrusive, time-sensitive, and ecologically valid measures of key risk factors for
      suicide and substance misuse in BDD: negative affect states. As next steps, this research can
      be extended to detect risk transdiagnostically, with the goal of enabling just-in-time
      interventions to target suicide and substance misuse across psychiatric illnesses.
