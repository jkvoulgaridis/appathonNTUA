  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We will tailor a telehealth obesity intervention for obese patients with MS (figure 2). Half
      of the patients will be randomly assigned to 24 weekly hour-long group weight loss sessions
      and 6 monthly individual sessions; half will be assigned to a brief education/Treatment as
      Usual (TAU) control condition. Participants assigned to the control condition will also
      receive the active treatment 6 months following their enrollment. As such, we will have
      feasibility, acceptability, and outcome data for all patients who enroll and complete the
      intervention. During outpatient recruitment, clinicians will ask obese patients (WHtR &gt;.57,
      BMI &gt;29) if they would be willing to be contacted about a study investigating a weight loss
      intervention for patients with MS. Patients who express interest and respond to
      advertisements will be screened by telephone and via review of medical records. Patients who
      meet initial eligibility criteria will be invited for a baseline evaluation where they will
      be formally consented, complete questionnaires and behavioral tasks, and undergo a
      standardized physical exam. They will be monitored using actigraphy for 10 days. They will
      then be randomized to the group telehealth obesity intervention or TAU. At 6 months, all
      participants will undergo a second in-person follow-up assessment and TAU participants will
      begin the telehealth intervention. At 12 months, participants will undergo a third in-person
      assessment, providing treatment outcome data for all study participants and long-term weight
      maintenance data for patients initially assigned to the telehealth obesity intervention. At
      18 months, participants initially assigned to the TAU control condition will undergo a 4th
      assessment, providing weight maintenance data for all enrolled participants.

    <description>Following baseline assessment, patients randomized to the TAU arm will receive monthly dietary pamphlets and web-based obesity prevention educational materials from the U.S. Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (https://healthfinder.gov/HealthTopics/). After the 6-month assessment, TAU patients will begin the weight loss intervention arm.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive 24 weekly group phone counseling sessions and monthly individual sessions that encourage healthy eating and exercise. The planned intervention is guided by a social-cognitive framework and includes self-monitoring, goal setting, stimulus control, social support, cognitive reframing of unrealistic and negative thoughts, and developing positive expectancies for long-term weight control. The primary objective is to decrease caloric intake and increase physical activity to produce weight loss of approximately .4 to.9 kg per week, with the study goal of 10% reduction from baseline.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive 24 weekly group phone counseling sessions. Each session will last approximately 60 minutes and begin with an open-ended check-in question, followed by review of weekly self-monitoring data, question and answer time, and end with a new didactic topic of the week addressing diet, physical activity, or behavior change topics. Participants will be instructed to follow a diet that is reduced to 1200-1500 kcal/day and includes â‰¥ 5 fruit and vegetable (FV) servings per day, &lt;25% kcal from fat, and 20-30 g of fiber. Physical activity will be gradually increased through a guided home-based program. Throughout the intervention, self-monitoring will be emphasized as a key behavioral weight loss strategy.</description>

        medical conditions where weight loss is contraindicated, as indicated by the participant's
        primary care physician (q) no contraindications to exercise (answer &quot;no&quot; to all 7 questions
        on Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire; PAR-Q114) or physician approval to exercise
        if answer &quot;yes&quot; to 1 or more questions on PAR-Q. -
