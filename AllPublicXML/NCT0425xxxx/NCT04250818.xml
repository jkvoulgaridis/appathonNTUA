  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent progress in immunotherapy (IT) has shifted treatment paradigms for multiple
      malignancies including breast cancer. It has been shown that levels of certain cytokines were
      correlated with increased response to immunotherapy in patients with metastatic breast
      cancer. In this study investigators will perform cytokine profiling among patients diagnosed
      with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer at different time points during the treatment.

      This is a prospective study that has two groups of patients as determined by their prescribed
      treatment plan. Group A (control group) are patients with metastatic triple-negative breast
      cancer (TNBC) who receive chemotherapy only (current standard of care). Group B (experimental
      group) are patients with mTNBC who receive a combination of chemotherapy and IT immunotherapy
      (Atezolizumab) which is a standard of care for patients whose tumor express &gt;1% of PD-L1
      molecules. T-cell cytokines will be measures prior to treatment and at multiple time points
      during the treatment.
