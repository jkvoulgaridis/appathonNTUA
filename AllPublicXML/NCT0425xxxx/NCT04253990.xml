      This study was attempted to determine the efficacy and complication of precut EMR comparing
      with convetional EMR for resecting of 10 ~ 20 mm colon polyp through prospective, randomized
      controlled trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In general, a potential risk of advanced colorectal neoplasia is proportional with size.
      However, recent study report that occurence rate of advanced neoplasia in small polyp is 9 ~
      10 %. And, incidence of interval cancer after screening colonoscopy was reported as 10 ~ 27%.
      So We can suspect that complete resection of small polyp is important. Previous study
      recommended that endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is a safe and effective procedure for
      treating colon polyp larger than 20 mm because of high complete resection rate and low
      recurrence rate. In contrast, endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) is more recommended for
      resecting colon polyp smaller than 20 mm because of technical ease and low rate of
      complication.

      However, Complete resection rate of conventional EMR is 60 ~ 70%. In case of incomplete
      resection, local recurrence rate is higher than complete resection. And In case of
      adenocarcinoma, specimen of piecemeal resection cannot be evaluated a depth of invasion and
      resection margin, and physician cannot decide a therapeutic plan.

      In precut-EMR, mucosal resection is performed after pre-incision around a polyp. When precut
      EMR of polyp &gt; 20 mm was performed in previous study, complete resection rate and en-bloc
      resection rate were higher and local recurrence rate was lower than conventional EMR. But,
      there is no study of comparsion precut EMR and conventional EMR for resecting colon polyp &lt;
      20 mm. This study was attempted to determine the efficacy and complication of precut EMR
      comparing with convetional EMR through prospective, randomized controlled trial.

    <description>For treating of 10~20mm colon polyp, patient will be randomly divided into two groups, a Precut-EMR group and a EMR group.
In Precut-EMR, endoscopist submucosally inject with saline around a polyp. Subsequently, circumferential incision/precutting was made with the tip of the snare around 2 mm outside the tumor. After that, the snare was positioned in the cut groove and tightend, and the tumor was resected using electrical current.</description>
