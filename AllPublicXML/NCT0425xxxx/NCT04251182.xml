      A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Multi-Center Study to Evaluate the Safety and
      Efficacy of Three Dose Strengths of T3D-959 in Subjects with Mild-to-Moderate Alzheimer's
      Disease.

      Study Design &amp; Methods: Phase 2 multi-center, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled
      study of T3D959 15 mg, 30 mg, 45 mg, or matching placebo administered orally once daily for
      24 weeks. There will be equal allocation of subject numbers across the four groups.
      Stratified randomization will be conducted on the basis of ApoE4 genotype so that subjects
      are randomized into one of the four dose groups within each stratum of ApoE4 status:
      ApoE4-positive (at least one E4 allele) vs ApoE4-negative (no E4 alleles).

      Following informed consent, subjects will enter the screening phase of the study.

      Once eligibility is confirmed and before the start of the first dose of study drug, subjects
      will be randomized on a 1:1:1:1 basis to placebo or T3D959 treatment (15mg, 30mg, 45mg) for
      the 24-week treatment period. Investigators, subjects, and caregivers will be blinded to the
      treatment assignment.

      Study schedule visits: screening, baseline, weeks 4, 8, 16, 24 and 28 (F/U visit)

    <intervention_model_description>A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design evaluating three dose levels (15 mg, 30 mg, 45 mg) of T3D-959 in subjects with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's Disease.

    <masking_description>Study drug packaging and labeling will maintain the double-blind design of the study. T3D-959 and placebo capsules will be identical in appearance. Therefore, the subject's treatment assignment will not be known to the subject or the study site personnel. None of the persons directly involved in the conduct of the study will have access to the treatment code. The DSMB and persons involved with reporting to the DSMB (as outlined within the DSMB Charter) will have access to the treatment code. The treatment code will be released to the study team after the study database has been locked.</masking_description>

    <description>T3D-959 15 mg dose: T3D-959 is a small molecule dual nuclear receptor agonist that regulates transcription of genes, in particular those involved in glucose energy and lipid metabolism. T3D-959 is 15-times more potent for PPAR delta than for the secondary target of the drug, PPAR gamma. The 15 mg strength contains 15mg T3D-959, pregelatinized starch NF, magnesium stearate NF, and size 0, hard gelatin, white/white, opaque, unmarked capsules. Subjects will ingest one size 0, 15mg capsule and two placebo capsules once per day in the morning.</description>
