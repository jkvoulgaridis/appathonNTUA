  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational, controlled, single-centre study to validate the Thora3Di™ against
      standard practice in patients who are undergoing investigation for disproportionate
      breathlessness. The core methodology involves capturing of data during a short period of
      measurement of breathing using SLP.

    <textblock>
      Cohort A: This study is a pilot study with four study visits (Screening, Baseline, week 13
      and week 26) to generate data to characterise the tidal breathing patterns and parameters
      with Thora3Di™. Subjects will have a screening visit within 0 to 14 days prior to the first
      study visit. For each study visit, subjects will be seen in the clinical research facility
      and have two 5-minute SLP measurements (at rest and on exertion). The SLP measurement should
      be performed prior to standard lung function tests with minimal impact on clinical time and
      not change to hospital attendance. Also, each visit subjects will be asked to report
      concomitant medications and adverse events, and fill several questionnaires forms as outlined
      in the SOAs.

      Cohort B: Healthy subjects will have only one visit for this study. After signing the
      informed consent form, subjects will undergo two 5-minutes SLP measurements (at rest and on
      exertion).

        Cohort A: Any adult who is presenting with controlled disproportionate breathlessness will
        be considered for inclusion as a diseased subject (with excluded comorbidities as cause of
        breathlessness e.g. uncontrolled asthma (GINA 2019 guidelines), uncontrolled cardiac
        disease, ILO).

        • Cohort B: Any adult who is in good respiratory health will be considered for inclusion as
        a normal in the study.
