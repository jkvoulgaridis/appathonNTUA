  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preoperative anxiety affects 40 to 60% of children. A literature review concluded that
      effective preparation strategies must involve parents, must be appropriate to their age and
      proposed upstream of the intervention.

      A double-readinganimated film aimed at informative was created for the children and their
      parents/legal guardians in order to solve the problem of anxiety found at the arrival of
      children in the operating room.

    <measure>the child's anxiety score obtained from the M-Ypass scale at the time of induction in the operating room.</measure>
    <time_frame>The duration of this visit will be about 3 hours, between the reception at the outpatient and the time of induction in intervention room, end of the study</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation of this outcome measure will be made between 0 and 6 months after the inclusion. m-Ypass scale (Modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale), a hetero-evaluation scale, is designed to assess preoperative anxiety in children aged 3 to 7 years.
It has 18 items divided into 4 groups (activity, vocalizations, emotional expression, apparent state of awakening). Each group having a different number of items (4 or 6), quotients are calculated and then added together to obtain a total score ranging from 0 to 100 (Appendix 2: Anxiety score of Yale Mulhouse and Colmar).
The children will be filmed at 3 times of their care on the day of the intervention.
The reading of these videos will be done afterwards by two nurses from the Department of Pain Support Unit (CHU Bordeaux, neuroscience center), independent of the services concerned by the study, trained on a scale by the investigator, in order to establish anxiety scores.</description>

    <description>The EVA-A (Numerical Scale for Anxiety) is a self-assessment scale that assesses situational anxiety.
The question formulated by the professional who makes the welcome interview to the SAS transfer from the operating room to the accompanying person will be the following:
&quot;Can you on a scale of 0 to 10, evaluate your apprehension? &quot; This will allow an estimate of anxiety between 0 and 10. 0 = no anxiety, 10 = maximum anxiety.</description>
