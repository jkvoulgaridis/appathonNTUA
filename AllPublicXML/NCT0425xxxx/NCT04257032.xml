        Exclusion Criteria:

             range of 45 to 90 bpm

          3. Any laboratory value outside the reference range that the investigator considers to be

             immunological, or hormonal disorders

         11. Use of drugs within 30 days of planned administration of trial medication that might
             reasonably influence the results of the trial or compromise the subject's safety by
             participation in the trial (e. g. use of any drug that could reasonably inhibit
             platelet aggregation or coagulation, concomitant treatment with systemic cyclosporine,
             ketoconazole, itraconazole and dronedarone, use of fibrates or drugs that cause QT/QTc
             interval prolongation (QTc: QT interval corrected for heart rate using the method of

         24. Active clinically relevant bleeding or subjects who in the investigator's judgement
             are perceived as having an increased risk of bleeding, for example because of blood
             coagulation disorders, current or recent gastrointestinal ulceration, presence of
             malignant neoplasms, recent brain or spinal injury, recent brain/spinal/ophthalmic
             surgery, recent intracranial hemorrhage, known or suspected oesophageal varices,
             arteriovenous malformations, vascular aneurysms, major intraspinal or intracerebral
             vascular abnormalities

         25. For Part 1 only: known myopathy, personal or family history of hereditary muscular

         26. Subjects with any other condition that would preclude administration of rosuvastatin
             or dabigatran (i.e. contraindicated as per SmPC), such as active liver disease
             including elevations of serum transaminases exceeding 2 times the upper limit of
             normal, moderate or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance &lt; 60 ml/min based on
             estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) according to Chronic Kidney Disease
             Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) formula), prosthetic heart valves requiring
