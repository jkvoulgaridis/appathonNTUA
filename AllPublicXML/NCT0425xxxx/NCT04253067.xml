  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective randomized sham-controlled study of patients undergoing vaginal
      treatment with a fractional carbon dioxide (fCO2) laser for stress urinary incontinence (SUI)
      symptoms. Eligible participants will be randomized (like a flip of a coin) to receive active
      or sham fCO2 laser treatments. Three treatments with the fCO2 laser or sham to the vagina
      will be performed, approximately four weeks apart.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) is a common problem that affects 35-40% of women worldwide.
      SUI occurs when a woman experiences involuntary leakage of urine with physical activities
      such as exercise, coughing and sneezing that increases intra-abdominal pressure. Vaginal
      laser therapy offers a potential novel treatment for SUI, however there is limited scientific
      evidence to show benefits to treatment. A sham controlled study will further add to the
      literature and evidence to support or oppose the use of the fCO2 laser for SUI.

      The purpose of this study is to compare active therapy to sham treatment to determine if a
      true benefit to treatment exists. Eligible participants will be randomized 1:1, to receive
      active or sham fCO2 laser treatments. Three treatments, active or sham, to the vagina will be
      performed approximately four weeks apart. The primary efficacy endpoint is four weeks after
      completing all treatments. Treatment durability and safety will be assessed eight weeks after
      the primary endpoint.

    <time_frame>8 weeks after the primary endpoint</time_frame>
    <description>Change in urogenital distress as measured by the Urinary Distress Inventory questionnaire (UDI-6). The UDI-6 is a six point questionnaire, each question is scored as follows: 0 = no, 1 = not at all, 2 = somewhat, 3 = moderately, 4 = quite a bit. Scores are totaled and divided by 6, then multiplied by 25 to calculate the raw score. Higher scores = higher disability.</description>

    <description>Impact of urinary incontinence on daily life as measured by the Incontinence Impact Questionnaire (IIQ-7). The IIQ-7 assesses how a subject's problem effects activities, relationships, and feelings. It is a 7 point questionnaire. Each answer is scored as: 0=not at all, 1=slightly, 2=moderately, 3=greatly. The higher the score the more effected they are by their condition.</description>

The survey consists of 22 incontinent-specific quality of life items, all having the following five-point ordinal response; 1=extremely, 2=quite a lot, 3=moderately, 4=a little, 5=not at all. The summed total score is transformed to a 0-100 scale ranging from 0 (poor quality of life) to 100 (maximum quality of life).</description>
