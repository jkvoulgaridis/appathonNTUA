  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is an established therapy for patients with
      severe aortic valve stenosis. Pain and anxiety are major contributors to procedural
      complications. Virtual Reality (VR) glasses have already been used successfully in different
      clinical settings to treat anxiety and delirium. The aim of this prospective, randomized
      investigation is to prove the feasibility and safety of VR interventions in patients
      undergoing conscious sedation during TAVI with local anesthesia only.

    <description>A visual analog scale will be used to determine the level of anxiety before and after the procedure. The visual analogue scale or visual analog scale (VAS) is a psychometric response scale which can be used in questionnaires. It is a measurement instrument for subjective characteristics or attitudes that cannot be directly measured. When responding to a VAS item, respondents specify their level of agreement to a statement by indicating a position along a continuous line between two end-points (0=no anxiety, 10=maximum anxiety/extremly anxious)</description>
