  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in Phenylketonuria (PKU)
      patients on a low-phenylalanine diet (LPD).

      Ultrasound tests, diet information and routine blood samples will be collected once per
      patient at their next outpatient appointment.

      32 adults with PKU will be studied and compared to reference data for healthy people. The
      results will show if the PKU CVD risk differs from healthy people, and if CVD risk varies
      within people with PKU.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the largest cause of deaths worldwide each year. Many factors
      affect CVD including diet, genetics, exercise and smoking. It is unclear if Phenylketonuria
      (PKU) and the low-phenylalanine diet (LPD) affect CVD risk.

      CVD risk can be predicted by measuring the thickness of the artery wall in the neck which
      supplies blood to the head. Thickness is measured using a non-invasive, safe ultrasound test
      (similar to pregnancy jelly scans). A wall thicker than normal indicates an increased CVD
      risk. A wall thinner than normal indicates a lower CVD risk.

    <description>During their outpatient clinic appointment, participants will:
Undergo routine height and weight measurements and blood tests. A full patient history will be taken, including a record of cardiovascular disease within the family. Blood samples will be collected, including phenylalanine, lipids, vitamin B12 and related biomarkers.
Complete a 14-item diet history questionnaire, and fill in a 3 day diet diary before they arrive at their outpatient clinic appointment, which will be collected after the participant signs the informed written consent form.
Undergo assessment of carotid Intima-media thickness (CIMT), pulse wave velocity (PWV), ankle brachial pressure index (ABPI) and systolic and diastolic blood pressure.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Age and gender matched reference controls</arm_group_label>
    <description>Only Phenylketonuria (PKU) patients will be studied. Controls are generated from the literature. Reference CIMT values exist for a healthy population based on age and gender (Engelen et al., 2013), eliminating the need to assess age- and gender-matched controls. The study would otherwise require performing blood tests and vascular assessments on healthy individuals, generating a risk of harm and a possible incidental finding. It would be inconvenient for controls because they would need to travel to hospital and undergo invasive venepuncture.</description>

    <intervention_name>Carotid intima media thickness measurement (CIMT)</intervention_name>
    <description>CIMT is a measurement of the thickness of the two inner layers of the common carotid artery wall. Using ultrasound, a linear array transducer is placed on the surface of the skin at the neck. Electrocardiogram(ECG) electrodes are placed on each wrist and one on the ankle. An image of the common carotid artery (CCA) is then produced in anterior, posterior and lateral views, and saved along with the ECG recording. The wall thickness can then be measured at the same point in the cardiac cycle using semi-automated detection software (Philips QLAB), which can reduce observer variability. The CIMT will be averaged across left and right CIMTs, as the control reference values use an average of both sides.</description>

    <intervention_name>Pulse Wave Velocity measurement</intervention_name>
    <description>The PWV measures the speed of a pulse wave travelling between two points in the vascular systems of known distance between them. PWV will be measured by the gold standard carotid-femoral PWV method which is a direct measurement of aortic stiffness. A 3-Lead ECG is connected alongside measurements of the blood velocity trace for the left CCA 2cm proximal to the bifurcation, and for the left common femoral artery origin.</description>

    <intervention_name>Ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI)</intervention_name>
    <description>A blood pressure cuff is placed around the ankle and upper arm of the participant. A continuous wave Doppler probe is used over the surface of the skin to locate the artery distal to the cuff (such as the brachial artery in the arm, or the anterior tibial and posterior tibial arteries in the ankle). The cuff is then inflated, and the systolic pressure identified by listening cessation of the sounds produced by the probe corresponding to blood flow in the artery. The ABPI is then the ratio of the highest systolic ankle pressure divided by the highest systolic brachial pressure for the left and right sides of the body.</description>

    <intervention_name>Diet questionnaire and diet diary</intervention_name>
    <description>Dietary information will be collected in two formats. One will be a 14-item questionnaire (Martínez-González et al., 2012), which is a simplified version of a comprehensive food frequency questionnaire. This provides a quick measure of compliance to a Mediterranean dietary pattern and a rough measure of protective and adverse dietary factors that could affect individual CVD risk. The second will be a 3-day diet diary (3DDD). This will consist of participants recording the foods that they consume and the quantities, which will then be analysed for macro- and micronutrient composition once completed.</description>

    <description>Blood samples will be taken from participants during their outpatient appointment. Patients routinely have blood samples taken during this clinic. The study will use the results from the routine blood tests, and also extra blood samples to collect data on other biomarkers. The laboratory facilities at Guy's and St Thomas Hospitals will be used to conduct analysis, no other laboratories will be used. Data will be collected on Phenylalanine levels, lipids, vitamin B12 and related biomarkers.</description>
