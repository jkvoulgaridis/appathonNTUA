          -  Healthy male and female subjects aged 18 to 55 years (inclusive) at Screening.

          -  12-lead safety ECG: QTcF &lt; 450 ms for male subjects and &lt; 470 ms for female subjects,
             QRS &lt; 110 ms, and PR &lt; 220 ms, and resting HR &gt; 50 bpm and &lt; 90 bpm with no clinically
             relevant abnormalities on 12-lead ECG after 5 min in the supine position at Screening
             and on Day 1 pre-dose of Period 1.

          -  Healthy on the basis of medical history, physical examination, cardiovascular
             assessments, and clinical laboratory tests.

          -  Women of childbearing potential are eligible only if the following applies:

               1. Negative serum pregnancy test at Screening.

               2. Negative serum pregnancy test on Day 1 of the first period.

               3. Agreement to consistently and correctly use a highly effective method of
                  contraception with a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year, be sexually inactive, or have
                  a vasectomized partner from Screening up to at least 30 days after last study
                  treatment administration in the last period with wash-out periods included. If a
                  hormonal contraceptive is used, it must be initiated at least 1 month before
                  first treatment administration.

          -  Women of non-childbearing potential must meet at least one of the following criteria:

               2. Premature ovarian failure confirmed by a specialist gynecologist.

               3. Post-menopausal, defined as 12 consecutive months with amenorrhea prior to
                  Screening without alternative medical cause and confirmed with
                  follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) test.

               4. XY genotype.

               5. Turner syndrome.

          -  Previous exposure to daridorexant.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to moxifloxacin or any of the drug product excipients or to
             other fluoroquinolone antibiotics.

          -  Any contraindication to moxifloxacin treatment.

          -  History of major medical or surgical disorders which, in the opinion of the
             investigator, are likely to interfere with the absorption, distribution, metabolism,
             or excretion of the study treatments (appendectomy and herniotomy allowed,
             cholecystectomy not allowed).

          -  Any circumstances or conditions, which, in the opinion of the investigator, may affect
             full participation in the study or compliance with the protocol.

          -  History or presence of rhythm disorders (e.g., sinoatrial heart block, sick-sinus
             syndrome, second- or third-degree atrioventricular block, long QT syndrome,
             symptomatic bradycardia, atrial flutter, or atrial fibrillation) or electrolyte
             disturbances, particularly hypokalemia.

          -  Any sleep-disorder including self-reported insomnia disorder, breathing-related sleep
             disorders, restless legs syndrome, nightmare disorder, non-rapid eye movement sleep
