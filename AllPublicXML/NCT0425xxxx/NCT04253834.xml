  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, prospective, randomized controlled study, with the purpose of
      comparing a novel breathing device, called the GO2 device, which uses the concept of Positive
      End Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) to the standard breathing tool called the Incentive Spirometer
      (IS), thus improving respiratory dynamics of the postoperative patient.

      The purpose of this study is to compare a novel breathing device, called the GO2 device,
      which uses the concept of Positive End Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) to the standard breathing
      tool called the Incentive Spirometer (IS), thus improving respiratory dynamics of the
      postoperative patient. The standard of care is for patients to receive the incentive
      spirometer (IS).

      Patients will be randomized to use either the novel GO2 breathing device or the IS. Patients
      will also have the following tests:

      Baseline (within 30 days of surgery)

        -  Undergo a pulmonary function test (PFT). This test measures how well the lungs work.
           This includes how well patients are able to breathe and how effective their lungs are
           able to bring oxygen to the rest of the body.

        -  Will have a chest x-ray.

      Post-Open Heart Surgery

        -  Will use the novel GO2 breathing device or the IS for 5 minutes every hour awake after
           surgery.

        -  Will have blood drawn at 1, 6, 12 and 24 hours after the breathing tube is removed.

        -  Will have a chest x-ray immediately after surgery and Days 1-4 after surgery.

        -  Will have a pulmonary function test on Day 3 after surgery.

        -  Patient's respiratory rate will be recorded 1, 6, 12 and 24 hours after breathing tube
           is removed, then daily each morning.

        -  Patient's peak body temperature will be recorded every 24 hours.

      This study will utilize a single center, prospective, randomized controlled pilot study
      design. There will be a total of 20 patients enrolled in this study at Emory Saint Joseph's
      Hospital.

    <measure>Change in partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2 level)</measure>
    <time_frame>1, 6, 12 and 24 hours post-extubation</time_frame>
    <description>Partial pressure of oxygen is a measurement of oxygen pressure in arterial blood. It reflects how well oxygen is able to move from the lungs to the blood. Normal values are 80 to 100 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Atelectasis score</measure>
    <time_frame>immediately post-operative, postoperative day 1, postoperative day 2, postoperative day 3, postoperative day 4</time_frame>
    <description>Atelectasis is a lung condition that happens when the airways at the end don't expand normally. Atelectasis will be measured with the modified radiological atelectasis score (m-RAS): each pulmonary lobe, including the lingula, is scored 0-3 (0=normal, 1=plate or minor infiltrate, 2= moderate atelectasis, 3= total atelectasis). The scores of the six lobes are then summed to give a 19-point score. Higher score is associated with worse outcome.</description>

    <measure>Change in CO2 level</measure>
    <time_frame>1, 6, 12 and 24 hours post-extubation, and up to postoperative day 4 (POD 4)</time_frame>
    <description>CO2 level measures the amount of carbon dioxide in your blood. Lower levels are associated with better outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in FEV1 and FVC measurements</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-operative and postoperative day 3</time_frame>
    <description>Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and Forced vital capacity (FVC) are measured during a spirometry test, also known as a pulmonary function test, which involves forcefully breathing out into a mouthpiece connected to a spirometer machine.
FEV1 is the amount of air you can force from your lungs in one second, values of between 80% and 120% are considered normal. FVC is the total amount of air exhaled during the FEV test.</description>

    <measure>Change in respiratory rate</measure>
    <time_frame>1, 6, 12 and 24 hours post-extubation, and up to postoperative day 4 (POD 4)</time_frame>
    <description>Respiratory rate is the number of breaths you take per minute. The normal respiration rate for an adult at rest is 16 to 20 breaths per minute.</description>

    <description>is a device that measures how deeply a person can inhale (breathe in). It helps taking slow, deep breaths to expand and fill the lungs with air. This helps prevent lung problems, such as pneumonia. The incentive spirometer is made up of a breathing tube, an air chamber, and an indicator</description>
