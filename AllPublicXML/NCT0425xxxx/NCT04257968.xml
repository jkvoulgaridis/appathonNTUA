      Problem:

      With increasing numbers of cancer survivors, strategies to prevent long-term complications in
      cancer patients become more important. Adolescent and Young Adult (AYA) Head and Neck Cancer
      survivors treated with radiotheray (RT) are prone to long-term complications, especially
      vascular and psychosocial complications. Although several studies point to the importance of
      these long-term complications, structured survivorship care for AYA HNC survivors is still
      lacking.

      Primary objective:

      To investigate in AYA HNC survivors treated with unilateral RT at least 5 years before, the
      long-term vascular complications in terms of carotid wall changes (ultrasonography, MRI),
      cerebral vascular complications ((silent)brain infarctions, white matter lesions) and
      Cardiovascular Risk Management profile.

      Secondary objective:

      To investigate in AYA HNC survivors treated with unilateral RT at least 5 years before, the
      long-term psychosocial complications (subjective memory complaints, Depression, Anxiety,
      Fatigue, Speach handicap, Anxiety for recurrence, Quality of Life, objective cognitive
      failure)

      Study design Prospective cohort study.

      Patient population AYA HNC survivors ≥ 5 years after unilateral RT, either alone or in
      combination with surgery and/or chemotherapy.

      Controls The ultrasonography (Intima Media Thickness, elastography) and MRI measurements of
      the irradiated carotid wall will be compared to the non-irradiated carotid wall. Cognitive
      performance will be compared to normative data. The cognitive performances of the right
      hemisphere tests will be compared to the cognitive performances of the left hemisphere tests.
      The frequency of silent brain infarcts and vascular white matter lesions of the irradiated
      vascular territory will be compared with the non-irradiated territory.

      Intervention Structured survivorship care ≥ 5 years after RT conform the Personalized Cancer
      Survivorship Care Model of the Radboudumc Expertisecenter of late effects after cancer,
      complemented with carotid ultrasonography (IMT and elastography), MRI of the carotid arteries
      and brain), neuropsychological assessment battery and self-reported questionnaires concerning
      depression, fatigue, QoL, positive health and employment status.

    <measure>Fatigue severity</measure>
    <time_frame>5-10 years after radiotherapy</time_frame>
    <description>Fatigue severity was assessed using the Checklist Individual Strength (CIS20R), a 20-item questionnaire that takes around five to ten minutes to fill out. Each question has a statement to be scored on a 7-point Likert scale ranging between 'yes, this is true' to 'no, this is not true'. The total score is calculated as the sum of the responses to the different statements. The maximum CIS20R score is 140, with a score of 76/140 or higher indicating that the patient is at risk for prolonged absence at work. The scale is subdivided in four dimensions of fatigue being fatigue severity (8 items, max. score 56), concentration problems (5 items, max. score 35), reduced motivation (4 items, max. score 28) and activity (3 items, max. score 21).

    <measure>Fear of recurrence</measure>
    <time_frame>5-10 years after radiotherapy</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed by the Cancer Worry Scale (CWS):
self reported 8-item scale, measuring worry about the risk of cancer recurrence and its impact on daily functioning. Total score ranges from 8 to 32. Higher scores indicate higher FCR. A cutoff score of 13 vs 14 (low FCR 13 or lower; high FCR 14 or more) has been established to differentiate between those with normal FCR from those with bothersome levels of FCR. This cutoff had been validated relative to the Fear of Cancer Recurrence Inventory cutoff score, which is a validated maesure.</description>
