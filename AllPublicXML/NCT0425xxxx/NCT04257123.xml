  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A recent clinical trial demonstrated the efficacy of Gelesis100 use for weight loss (Obes
      2019;27:205-216). The present trial is designed to explore the mechanisms by which it may
      work, i.e. by suppressing hunger, altering food intake and/or altering the efficiency of
      energy extraction from food.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Overweight/obesity is prevalent and associated with multiple adverse health outcomes.
      Moderating energy intake is one approach to lose or maintain body weight. To improve the
      probability of long-term adherence to an energy restricted diet, it is important to address
      the issue of appetite control. Numerous food components and properties have been explored for
      their satiation/satiety value. Two physical properties known to impact appetite are viscosity
      and elasticity (properties common to many dietary fibers). These properties may work by
      multiple mechanisms including prolonged gastric distention after a meal and slowed gastric
      emptying resulting in moderated swings in blood glucose and insulin concentrations. These
      properties may also alter the efficiency of energy absorption.

      The present trial will test the effects of Gelesis100, a FDA cleared superabsorbent hydrogel,
      on the mechanisms just noted. Gelesis100 is nonsystemic and works directly in the
      gastrointestinal tract. Gelesis100 is made from two natural ingredients, cellulose and citric
      acid, that form a three-dimensional matrix designed to occupy volume in the stomach and small
      intestine, to create a sensation of fullness. The capsules disintegrate in the stomach and
      release the Gelesis100 particles, which can hydrate up to 100 times their original weight.
      When fully hydrated, the Gelesis100 particles occupy about a quarter of average stomach
      volume (although this may vary based on body size and various other factors). Without
      increasing the caloric value of a meal, Gelesis100 particles mix with ingested foods and
      create thousands of small, nonclustering individual gel pieces. The gel particles mix with
      ingested foods, creating a larger volume with higher elasticity and viscosity in the stomach
      and small intestine, promoting satiety and fullness. Gelesis100 has been cleared by FDA
      through the 510k de novo process and is marketed as a prescription medical device for weight
      management under the trade name Plenityâ„¢. A recent clinical trial demonstrated the efficacy
      of its use for weight loss (Obes 2019;27:205-216). The present trial is designed to explore
      the mechanisms by which it may work, i.e. by suppressing hunger, altering food intake and/or
      altering the efficiency of energy extraction from food.

    <intervention_model_description>Following an initial 3-day run-in period (feeding only), participants will be randomly assigned to two 1-week controlled feeding periods with and without Gelesis100. After a one week washout, participants will complete the other pattern. Following another 1-week washout, participants will be randomly assigned again to two 1-week free-feeding periods with and without Gelesis100. After a one week washout, participants will complete the other pattern.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Hunger, fullness, desire to eat and thirst will be measured on visual analogue scales with end anchors of &quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;extremely.&quot; Ratings will be captured via Qualtrics software. Also, subjects will be asked to indicate when, during the meals, they feel full on the first and last days of the Controlled-Feeding periods.</description>

These include Power of Food Scale, Emotional Eating Scale, Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire-Revised, Food Craving Inventory-II, Barratt Impulsiveness Scale, Adult Eating Behavior Scale, Self-Regulation of Eating Behavior Questionnaire for Adults, Meal Pattern Questionnaire, Study-Specific Appetite and Eating Behavior Questionnaire.</description>

    <time_frame>With initiation of each Controlled-Feeding period, participants will swallow a capsule containing a red dye. They will monitor bowel movements until the red dye is passed. All stool will be collected from this point forward.</time_frame>
    <description>A quantitative stool collection method will be used. Collections will be homogenized and aliquots will be freeze-dried. Energy and macronutrient composition analysis of feces will be conducted in triplicate.</description>

    <description>Eighty milligrams of PABA will be taken in capsule form with the pre-lunch and pre-dinner beverage to serve as a compliance biomarker during the Free-Feeding periods. 24-hour urine samples will be collected in 3 L opaque collection bottles. Urinary PABA recovery will be analyzed using spectrophometric methods. Completeness of PABA collection will calculated as the measure of compliance ( ). Compliance will also be assessed by counting capsules returned by the subjects.</description>
