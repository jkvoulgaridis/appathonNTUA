  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to establish the Piperacillin-Tazobactam and Meropenem Plasmatic
      Levels to know if it´s necessary to make some adjustment in the recommended dose regimen.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluate if with the currently recommended dose regimen for Piperacillin-Tazobactam and Meropenem are achieved the seric concentrations asociated with the maximum therapeutic efficacy .</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months after the antibiotic administration</time_frame>
    <description>The chosen efficiency parameter is that 100 % of the time the concentration remains 4 times above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), the exact minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the used antibiotic will be determined by E-test by the Microbiology Service which means that the seric concentrations asociated with the maximum therapeutic efficacy are:
For Meropenem 2mg/dl, which means reaching a concentration in T0 &gt;8 mg/dL.
For Piperacillin-Tazobactam 16 mg/dL, which means reaching a concentration in T0 &gt;64 mg/dL.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluate if with the currently recommended dose regimen for Piperacillin-Tazobactam and Meropenem are achieved the seric concentrations asociated with the maximum therapeutic efficacy in patients with renal hyper clearance.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months after the antibiotic administration</time_frame>
    <description>The seric concentrations asociated with the maximum therapeutic efficacy are the same as the described for the description of the Primary Outcome Measure and it´s considered that a patient has renal hyper clearance when they have a creatinine clearance above 130 ml/min.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluate if with the currently recommended dose regimen for Piperacillin-Tazobactam and Meropenem are achieved the seric concentrations asociated with the maximum therapeutic efficacy in patients with Gram-negative bacillary bacteremia.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months after the antibiotic administration</time_frame>
    <description>The seric concentrations asociated with the maximum therapeutic efficacy are the same as the described for the description of the Primary Outcome Measure and it´s considered that a patient has Gram-negative bacillary bacteremia when the bloodstream is invaded by Gram-negative bacillary which is diagnosed by blood culture.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>Evaluate if with the currently recommended dose regimen for Piperacillin-Tazobactam and Meropenem are achieved the seric concentrations asociated with the maximum therapeutic efficacy in patients with continuous renal replacement technique.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months after the antibiotic administration</time_frame>
    <description>The seric concentrations asociated with the maximum therapeutic efficacy are the same as the described for the description of the Primary Outcome Measure and a patient with continuous renal replacement technique, has its blood purified extracorporeally, replacing the renal function continuously 24 hours of the day.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>Evaluate if with the currently recommended dose regimen for Piperacillin-Tazobactam and Meropenem are achieved the seric concentrations asociated with the maximum therapeutic efficacy in patients with ExtraCorporeal Membrane Oxygenation.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months after the antibiotic administration</time_frame>
    <description>The seric concentrations asociated with the maximum therapeutic efficacy are the same as the described for the description of the Primary Outcome Measure and a patient with ExtraCorporeal Membrane Oxygenation has a short-term extracorporeal circulatory and respiratory mechanical assistance system.</description>

    <measure>Evaluate if with the currently recommended dose regimen for Piperacillin-Tazobactam and Meropenem are achieved the seric concentrations asociated with the maximum therapeutic efficacy in patients with morbid obesity.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months after the antibiotic administration</time_frame>
    <description>The seric concentrations asociated with the maximum therapeutic efficacy are the same as the described for the description of the Primary Outcome Measure and it´s considered that a patient has morbid obesity when it´s BMI (body mass index) is above 40.</description>

    <description>The plasmatic levels determinations will always be made in state of equilibrium (after the fourth dose) and two samples will be collected:
Just before the antibiotic infusion (T0)
In the midpoint of time (T50). If the antibiotic is administered every 8 hours this determination will be made at 4 hours. If the antibiotic is administered every 6 hours, the determination will be made at 3 hours.
A second complete determination will be made (before the infusion, in the midpoint of time and before the next dose) after the administration of 4 doses as long as a posology modification is made as a consequence of the information received from the plasmatic levels.</description>
