  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The United States is in the midst of an opioid crisis. Over-prescription of opioid analgesic
      pain relievers contributed to a rapid escalation of use and misuse of these substances across
      the country. In 2016, more than 2.6 million Americans were diagnosed with opioid use disorder
      (OUD) and more than 42,000 have died of overdose involving opioids. This death rate is more
      than any year on record and has quadrupled since 1999 (1,2). Leveraging the potential of
      available data bases and health IT technologies may help to combat opioid crisis by targeting
      various aspects of the problem ranging from the prevention of opioid misuse to OUD treatment.
      NIH through NIDA solicits the research and development of data-driven solutions and services
      that focus on issues related to opioid use prevention, opioid use, opioid overdose prevention
      or OUD treatment.

      In this project, We The Village, Inc. will address a need to prepare Concerned Significant
      Others (CSOs) to best use their influence over the trajectory of a loved one's OUD. CSOs are
      motivated to help, make majority of treatment decisions and payments and have influence over
      treatment entry and thus, impact the trajectory of an OUD. The project goal is to develop
      digital delivery of Community Reinforcement And Family Training (CRAFT) methodology, an
      empirical family behavioral intervention to improve outcomes around treatment entry, family
      functioning and substance use.

      The primary objective of the proposed Phase I work is to determine the feasibility of
      delivering Community Reinforcement And Family Training (CRAFT) principles via scalable
      digital coaching methods and determine its efficacy based on measured outcomes.

      Technical Objectives 1. Modify the WTV platform to produce a CRAFT-informed automated
      prototype and protocol for live coaching.

      Technical Objectives 2. Test prototype usability and reliability to deliver the protocol, and
      make any refinements needed.

      Technical Objectives 3. Demonstrate prototype efficacy. Testing three digital scenarios: A.
      Automated CRAFT, B. CRAFT Coach, C. Peer support, the current WTV platform interaction.

      As a result, when tested at baseline versus post-intervention, CRAFT conditions (Coach and
      Automated) are expected to achieve better outcomes than the peer condition in a) treatment
      entry, b) Concerned Significant Others (CSO) health and wellbeing, c) CSO and identified
      patient relationship, d) CRAFT adeptness.

      Results will substantiate the case for Phase II roll out of the platform at scale, plus
      commercialization and dissemination through an existing and growing network of partners.

    <intervention_model_description>Phase One of this project will develop and refine digital delivery of two modified CRAFT (Community Reinforcement and Family Training) interventions: automated and Group CRAFT protocol (CRAFT-A) and automated CRAFT protocol with live coaching (CRAFT-C) and assess the effectiveness of the adapted CRAFT protocols with WTV's business as usual model of Peer Support Forum (PEER). The goal of the project is to deliver an innovative and effective evidence-based behavioral intervention with consumer technology to an existing and growing online audience.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Participants assigned to the PEER group will participate in an online peer support forum with other CSOs.
Members of the forum post questions or comments to weekly peer-led discussions and receive responses and feedback from other CSO forum members. Members typically express concerns regarding their IP's wellbeing and ask other members to share any strategies they have employed when dealing with their IPs. Interactions typically, are based either in 12-Step strategies members have learned (usually through Al-Anon or Nar-Anon Family Groups or Family Training Workshops provided by treatment programs) or in CRAFT skills learned (usually from treatment programs or other We The Village members). A staff member from We The Village monitors forum interactions to ensure members are interacting respectfully. This individual also will report any adverse or severe adverse events that members mention online.</description>

    <intervention_name>Community Reinforcement And Family Training (CRAFT)</intervention_name>
    <description>Community Reinforcement Approach and Family Training (CRAFT) is a scientifically based intervention designed to help concerned significant others (CSOs) to engage treatment-refusing substance abusers into treatment. This new intervention method was developed with the belief that the CSO can play a powerful role in helping to engage the substance user in treatment. It is often the substance user who reports that family pressure or influence is the reason sought treatment. CSOs benefit by becoming more independent and reducing their depression, anxiety and anger symptoms even if their loved one does not enter treatment.
CRAFT uses a positive approach versus confrontation, emphasizing learning new skills to cope with old problems. Some components include: how to stay safe, outlining the context in which substance abusing behavior occurs, teaching CSOs how to use positive reinforcers (rewards) and how to let the substance user suffer the natural consequences for their using behavior.</description>
