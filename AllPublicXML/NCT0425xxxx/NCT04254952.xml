    <textblock>
      The study aims to provide Turkish version of Nijmegen Questionnaire for the evaluation of
      respiratory dysfunction in asthmatic subjects. The incidence of hyperventilation syndrome in
      asthmatic patients can be determined with the results of the study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nijmegen Questionnaire allows to assess and identify respiratory symptoms and dysfunction,
      and to assess unexplained respiratory symptoms and symptoms of hyperventilation syndrome.
      Determining whether Turkish version of Nijmegen Questionnaire is a valid and reliable tool in
      asthmatic individuals will guide researchers for further studies on identifying appropriate
      treatment approaches for the patient and developing different treatment strategies.
      Hyperventilation syndrome is a recognized form of respiratory dysfunction associated with
      biochemical factors. Hyperventilation syndrome is defined as breathing above the body's
      metabolic requirements. This results in decreased carbon dioxide pressure in the arterial
      blood, respiratory alkalosis, and increased symptoms. Complex symptoms such as shortness of
      breath, chest tightness, paresthesia, anxiety, and dizziness may occur. There is no
      laboratory test which is the gold standard in the diagnosis of hyperventilation syndrome. If
      it is concluded that the Turkish version of the Nijmegen Questionnaire is a valid and
      reliable test in individuals with asthma, a new tool will be introduced to the literature for
      the evaluation of pulmonary dysfunction in asthmatic individuals.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Dyspnea perception</measure>
    <time_frame>1st day</time_frame>
    <description>Dyspnea will be evaluated with a modified Borg scale. The modified Borg scale is a category scale that evaluates dyspnea between the scores of 0-10. Patients will be asked to mark the appropriate value on the scale.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Breathe-holding time</measure>
    <time_frame>1st day</time_frame>
    <description>Individuals are asked to hold their breaths in the sitting position by closing their nostrils and in functional residual volume (after a normal exhalation). In order to eliminate the learning effect, the measurement is repeated three times and the averages of the times are recorded in seconds.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>End-tidal CO2 measurement</measure>
    <time_frame>1st day</time_frame>
    <description>A portable capnograph with a nasal cannula will be used for the measurement of mean ETCO2 and resting respiration rate over a ten-minute period. Individuals will be asked to breathe through the nose and not speak during the measurement.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Asthma control test</measure>
    <time_frame>1st day</time_frame>
    <description>Test is used to evaluate asthma control. The questionnaire consists of five items. The total test score ranges from 5 (weak control) to 25 (fully controlled) (14). A total score of &lt;20 indicates uncontrollable asthma.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Nijmegen Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>1st day</time_frame>
    <description>The Nijmegen Questionnaire has been validated as a screening tool for the detection of hyperventilation syndrome (HVS), consisting 16 items. A score of over 23 out of 64 suggests a positive diagnosis of HVS. It has also been used to detect dysfunctional breathing in patients with asthma.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of life questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>1st day</time_frame>
    <description>The overall quality of life will be determined by the Nottingham Health Profile (NHP). The NHP consists of 38 substances that the individual can complete without the need for a person. The questionnaire has six sub scales: energy (3 items), pain (8 items), emotional reactions (9 items), sleep (5 items), social isolation (5 items) and physical mobility (8 items). For each subsection there is a possible range of points ranging from 0-100 points. Higher scores indicate more limitations in quality of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disease-specific quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>1st day</time_frame>
    <description>Disease-specific quality of life will be determined by the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ). The Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire was found to be valid and reliable in Turkish. The quality of life questionnaire in individuals with asthma is a 32-item disease-specific questionnaire in four health domains, including activity limitation (11 items), symptoms (12 items), emotional function (5 items), and environmental stimuli (4 items). Scores range 1-7, with higher scores indicating better quality of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment of anxiety and depression</measure>
    <time_frame>1st day</time_frame>
    <description>The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) measures physical, emotional, cognitive, and motivational symptoms of depression. The aim of the scale is to determine the level of depression symptoms and the change in severity. BDI is a scale that includes 21 self-assessment sentences and there are four options in each symptom category. Each item is scored between 0-3 points and the total score varies between 0 and 63. The validity and reliability study of the scale was conducted in Turkish. The cut-off value of the Turkish form was determined to be 17.</description>
