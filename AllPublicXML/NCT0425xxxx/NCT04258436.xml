  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, randomized, prospective study evaluating the effect of serratus
      anterior plane block performed after induction of anesthesia, but before the start of surgery
      on postoperative opioid requirements. The hypothesis of the study is that serratus anterior
      plane blocks are relatively simple to perform, provide good postoperative analgesia,
      facilitate early tracheal extubation, and reduce the length of hospital stay after pediatric
      cardiac surgery through a thoracotomy.

      This is a single-center, randomized, prospective study evaluating the effect of serratus
      anterior plane block performed after induction of anesthesia, but before the start of surgery
      on postoperative opioid requirements. There is already a postoperative protocol for the
      management of pain in the pediatric cardiac intensive care unit. This protocol will be
      maintained so all patients will be receiving clinically accepted and standard postoperative
      pain management.

      Routine preoperative evaluation will be performed to establish eligibility for study
      inclusion. All patients will receive anesthesia by a pediatric cardiac anesthesiologist
      according to the clinical protocol established for these patients. The serratus anterior
      plane block will be performed by a pediatric anesthesiologist on the acute pain service team
      who routinely perform pain blocks at this institution.

      Group 1 will receive an ultra-sound guided serratus anterior block after induction of general
      anesthesia. Group 2 will not receive a serratus anterior block.

      Postoperative pain will be managed by a pediatric cardiac intensivist according to a standard
      pain protocol.
