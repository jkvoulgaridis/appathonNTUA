  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to (1) define and characterize brain networks of cognitive flexibility
      amongst patients with frontal lesions; (2) quantify the effects of ecological cognitive
      trainings and brain stimulation on behavioral performance and brain networks; (3) identify
      predictive markers of effective rehabilitation (patients)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Decision making impairments and perseveration are frequently observed in patients with
      frontal lobe lesions, associated with overall chronic and serious deficits in executive
      functions. In order to improve mental flexibility, patients can benefit from reeducation
      based on regular training of executive functions along with a non-invasive brain stimulation.
      One of the key areas for such processing is the prefrontal cortex. Previous studies have
      shown however that maintaining a good level of mental flexibility in complex tasks involves a
      dynamic integration of several brain areas distributed in large networks. These areas in
      cooperation can be solicited by a multi-modal intervention such as motor-cognitive tasks
      associated with a transcranial stimulation. The goal of the present project is to develop a
      new rehabilitation program and to assess its impact in comparison with current programs. The
      investigators will also develop new methods to measure long term cerebral modifications
      induced by these programs. This goal will be reached by: 1) the identification of the brain
      networks of mental flexibility. 2) The assessment of multimodal task effects associated with
      or without a transcranial brain stimulation. Behavioral (performance in executive tasks) and
      functional (parameters of cerebral functional connectivity networks at rest) measures will be
      used. 3) The identification of mental flexibility predictors. The goal will be to find which
      initial individual's parameters of brain functional connectivity at rest could predict an
      optimal level of mental flexibility after training. This project aims at improving the
      quality of life in the brain-damaged population; impact that could eventually extend to the
      other parts of the population.
