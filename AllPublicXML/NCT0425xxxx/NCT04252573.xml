      Prospective, multi-center, non-randomized study with consecutive, eligible subject enrollment
      at each site, for the evaluation of the ChEVAS System for Endovascular Repair of Complex
      Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective multicenter study with consecutive eligible subject enrollment at each
      site. Enrollment will include up to 150 subjects (120 ChEVAS subjects and up to 30 infrarenal
      roll-in subjects). The ChEVAS study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness outcomes
      following appropriate government and ethics committee/IRB requirements and guidelines.

      All enrolled (ChEVAS and Infrarenal) patients will undergo a high resolution,
      contrast-enhanced computed tomography angiography (CT) scan of the relevant aortic and
      aortoiliac vasculature within three months of the scheduled procedure and at specified
      follow-up intervals post-implantation. Follow-up visits will occur at 30-days, 6-months, and
      annually to 5-years to assess aneurysm morphology, the status of the implanted devices, and
      relevant laboratory test results.

    <description>The outcome at one-year post index procedure will be measured by the proportion of subjects that experience freedom from abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture and aneurysm-related mortality up until 1-year (day 365), freedom from imaging-related findings in the 1-year window (Type 1 or 3 endoleak, migration &gt; 10mm, AAA sac expansion &gt; 5mm, and occlusion within the ChEVAS System not seen at the index procedure), and open conversion through day 365.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adults at least 18-years old

          -  Subject provided informed consent

          -  Subject agrees to all follow-up visits

          -  Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) with maximum sac diameter ≥5.0 cm, or ≥ 4.5 cm which
             has increased by ≥ 0.5cm within the last 6-months, or which exceeds 1.5 times the
             transverse dimension of an adjacent non-aneurysmal aortic segment. No AAA &lt;4cm will be
             included

          -  Absence of significant cranial angulation of the visceral vessels that would preclude
             vessel cannulation and stenting

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Requirement of home oxygen

          -  Psychiatric or other condition that may interfere with the study

          -  Participating in another clinical drug and/or device study, which could confound the
             results of this study (patient must have completed the primary endpoint of any
             previous study at least 30-days prior to enrollment in this study)

          -  Known allergy or contraindication to any device material, contrast, or anticoagulants

          -  Serum creatinine level &gt;1.8mg/dL

          -  CVA or MI within three months of enrollment/treatment

          -  Prior stent in any target visceral vessel, the aorta or iliac artery that may
             interfere with delivery system introduction or stent placement

          -  Connective tissue diseases (e.g., Marfan Syndrome)

          -  Unsuitable vascular anatomy that may interfere with device introduction or deployment

          -  Pregnant, planning to become pregnant within 60 months, or breast feeding.
