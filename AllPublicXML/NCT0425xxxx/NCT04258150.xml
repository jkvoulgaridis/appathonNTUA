  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer (PC) remains a dreadful disease due to its often advanced stage at
      diagnosis and poor sensitivity to chemotherapy. Progression after 1. line chemotherapy is
      inevitable in patients with advanced PC, and treatment options for patients who progress
      after 1. line chemotherapy are limited. Considering the emerging role of the tumor
      microenvironment (TME), the combination of checkpoint blocking antibodies with agents that
      target the inhibitory effects of the TME could lead to better responses in tumor historically
      resistant to checkpoint blocking antibody approaches. Inflammation is one of the hallmarks of
      cancer, and contributes to PC initiation, enhanced invasiveness and metastasis. The
      immune-modulating cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) facilitates the inflammation cascade and key
      pathways within the respective TME, among others promotion of tumor-induced immunosuppression
      and facilitation of metastasis. Thus, IL-6 inhibition approach can potentially directly
      affect the immunosuppressive TME compartment.

      To explore the synergy of the proposed combinatorial approach, participants with locally
      advanced/metastatic pancreatic tumors who have progressed during or after at least 1 line of
      systemic chemotherapy in the metastatic setting will receive nivolumab and ipilimumab
      administered in combination with radiotherapy and tocilizumab. It is anticipated that this
      clinical study will inform the use of this 3-drug combination for further phase II and/or
      phase III clinical testing.

    <textblock>
      This is a phase II study assessing ipilimumab, nivolumab and tocilizumab in combination with
      SBRT of 15 Gy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic PC whose disease has progressed
      on at least 1. line chemotherapy with either a 5-FU-containing and /or gemcitabine containing
      chemotherapy. The trial is designed as an investigator initiated prospective open-label study
      in patients with advanced PC to determine the efficacy and safety ipilimumab, nivolumab and
      tocilizumab in combination with SBRT.

      This study will consist of Part A, Lead-in, as well as a possible Part B, non-randomized
      expansion (Part B: Expansion) or a possible Part B, randomized controlled study (Part B:
      RCT).

      Initially, patients will be enrolled in the study to treatment with ipilimumab, nivolumab and
      tocilizumab in combination with SBRT, until 30 patients have been treated (Part A: Lead-in).
      Patient recruitment and tumor assessment will be monitored on an ongoing basis. This Part A:
      Lead-in involves Department of Oncology, Herlev and Gentofte Hospital, Copenhagen University
      Hospital, Denmark.

      Multicenter extension will be activated in case of successfully completed lead-in phase and
      the format of that Part B will be determined based on the responses seen in the first 30
      patients in Part A. A protocol amendment will be made if criteria are met to proceed to Part
      B. The protocol amendment will include available data from Part A and any changes to study
      design, additional sites and statistical plan, if needed.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Signed informed consent

               -  Subjects must have signed and dated an IRB/IEC approved written informed consent
                  form in accordance with regulatory and institutional guidelines. This must be
                  obtained before the performance of any protocol related procedures that are not
                  part of normal subject care

               -  Subjects must be willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment
                  schedule, laboratory testing, and other requirements of the study

          -  Histological or cytological confirmation of locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic
             carcinoma prior to entering this study

          -  Prior therapy requirements:

               -  For Part A and Part B Expansion: there is no upper limit on the number of prior
                  chemotherapy regimens received. Patients must have received and progressed during
                  or after at least 1 line of systemic chemotherapy in the metastatic setting
                  (gemcitabine or 5-FU based regimens).

               -  For Part B RCT: patients must have tumor progression following prior standard
                  first-line 5-FU-containing or gemcitabine-containing chemotherapy (no more than 1
                  prior chemotherapy regimen or any other systemic therapy for recurrent/metastatic
                  pancreatic carcinoma).

               -  Notes:

                    -  If a participant received adjuvant/neoadjuvant systemic combinational
                       therapy, and progressed within 6 months, the adjuvant/neoadjuvant treatment
                       will be considered as 1 line of systemic treatment.

                    -  In general, discontinuation of 1 drug in a multi-drug regimen and
                       continuation of other drug(s), is considered part of the same line of
                       treatment. Restarting the same regimen after a drug holiday or maintenance
                       chemotherapy can also be considered part of the same line of treatment.
                       Switching from IV (5-FU) to an oral formulation (capecitabine) of the same
                       drug is also considered part of the same line of treatment

                    -  Minimum time from first systemic therapy for recurrent/metastatic
                       adenocarcinoma of pancreas to progression should be at least 3 months

          -  Age 18 years and older

          -  ECOG/WHO Performance Status (PS) 0-1

          -  All participants will be required to undergo mandatory pre- and on-treatment biopsies
             at acceptable clinical risk as judged by the investigator. An archival pre-treatment
             sample is not acceptable.

          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x 10⁹/L

               -  Platelet count ≥ 100 x 10⁹/L

               -  Serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) (patients with Gilbert's
                  Syndrome must have a total bilirubin ≤ 50 mmol/L)

               -  AST/ALT ≤ 5 x ULN

               -  Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN or CrCl ≥ 40 mL/min (using the Cockcroft-Gault
                  formula)

          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must use method(s) of contraception as
             indicated in Appendix 3. For a teratogenic study drug and/or when there is
             insufficient information to assess teratogenicity (preclinical studies have not been
             done), a highly effective method(s) of contraception (failure rate of less than 1% per
             year) is required. The individual methods of contraception and duration should be
             determined in consultation with the investigator. WOCBP must follow instructions for
             birth control when the half-life of the investigational drug is greater than 24 hours,
             contraception should be continued for a period of 30 days plus the time required for
             the investigational drug to undergo five half-lives. The half-life of nivolumab and
             ipilimumab is up to 25 days and 18 days, respectively. WOCBP should therefore use an
             adequate method to avoid pregnancy for 23 weeks (30 days plus the time required for
             nivolumab to undergo five half-lives) after the last dose of investigational drug

          -  Men who are sexually active with WOCBP must use any contraceptive method with a
             failure rate of less than 1% per year. The investigator shall review contraception
             methods and the time period that contraception must be followed. Men that are sexually
             active with WOCBP must follow instructions for birth control when the half-life of the
             investigational drug is greater than 24 hours, contraception should be continued for a
             period of 90 days plus the time required for the investigational drug to undergo five
             half-lives. The half-life of nivolumab is up to 25 days. Men who are sexually active
             with WOCBP must continue contraception for 31 weeks (90 days plus the time required
             for nivolumab to undergo five half-lives) after the last dose of investigational drug.
             Women who are not of childbearing potential (i.e. who are postmenopausal or surgically
             sterile as well as azoospermic men do not require contraception

          -  Subjects must have signed and dated a BIOPAC approved written informed consent form in
             accordance with regulatory and institutional guidelines.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any serious or uncontrolled medical disorder that, in the opinion of the investigator,
             may increase the risk associated with study participation or study drug
             administration, impair the ability of the subject to receive protocol therapy, or
             interfere with the interpretation of study results

          -  Participants with active, known or suspected autoimmune disease. Participants with
             vitiligo, type I diabetes mellitus, residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune
             condition only requiring hormone replacement, psoriasis not requiring systemic
             treatment, or conditions not expected to recur in the absence of an external trigger
             are permitted to enroll

          -  Current or prior use of immunosuppressive medication within 14 days before the first
             dose of ipilimumab, nivolumab and tocilizumab. The following are exceptions to this
             criterion:

               -  Intranasal, inhaled, or topical steroids; or local steroid injections (e.g.
                  intra-articular injection)

               -  Systemic corticosteroids at physiologic doses not to exceed 10 mg/day of
                  prednisone or equivalent

               -  Steroids as premedication for hypersensitivity reactions (e.g. CT scan
                  premedication)

          -  Patients should be excluded if they have known history of testing positive for human
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or known acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)

          -  Allergies and Adverse Drug Reaction

               -  History of allergy to study drug components

               -  History of severe hypersensitivity reaction to any monoclonal antibody

          -  WOCBP who are pregnant or breastfeeding
