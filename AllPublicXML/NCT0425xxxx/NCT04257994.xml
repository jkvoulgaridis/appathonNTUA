    <textblock>
      Every week in the UK, 12 apparently healthy and fit individuals under the age of 35 die
      suddenly, a tragic event known as sudden cardiac death (SCD). The investigators have shown
      that heritable cardiac disorders affect the distribution of proteins at the cardiac cell-cell
      junctions, the areas where cardiac cells are mechanically and electrically coupled. This
      knowledge has helped the investigators diagnose specific heart disorders in individuals thus
      reducing the risk and incidence of SCD. Yet, the primary material required is a heart sample.
      A heart biopsy is an invasive process that comes with risks and is not performed unless
      absolutely necessary. And it is impossible to obtain a heart sample from an individual that
      may be carrying a disease-causing mutation (and hence be at risk of SCD) but does not yet
      show evidence of disease manifestation. The investigators recently showed that buccal cells
      show changes in protein distribution equivalent to those exhibited by the heart,hence
      providing them with a surrogate tissue for the myocardium. The investigators aim to use
      buccal smears as a means to identify those at risk of SCD. Patients regularly seen at the
      cardiology clinics at St. George's Hospital can participate in the study. The investigators
      shall take a buccal smear simply by rubbing a soft brush at the inside of their cheek and
      smearing it on a slide. Most individuals willing to participate in the study will only have
      to provide the investigators with a sample once. However, in selected cases (for instance, if
      the patients show disease progression or have a change in medication) they may be asked to
      provide the investigators with a subsequent sample during one of their scheduled follow-up
      visits. The process takes only a few seconds, is totally risk- and pain-free and it is
      anticipated to have great implications in diagnosis and patient management.

      Exfoliated buccal mucosa cells have been used as a source of material for various genetic
      tests and in studies of oral cancer but their use in studies of cardiovascular disease has
      been limited. Previous applications have included analysis of telomere length in buccal cells
      from patients with ischemic heart failure and measurements of intracellular magnesium levels
      in patients undergoing radiofrequency catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation. To the best
      of the investigators' knowledge, their study published at Circulation Arrhythmia and
      Electrophysiology 9(2) in 2016, was the first analysis of buccal mucosa cells in patients
      with a heritable form of heart disease. This analysis included 39 patients diagnosed with
      arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM), a primary myocardial disease characterized by an
      unusually high burden of arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death as well as 15 carriers of
      disease-causing mutations without overt disease manifestation. In a subsequent analysis
      (unpublished data), 55 additional individuals affected by ACM were sampled and the positive
      predictive value of our approach in diagnosing the disease was 91.9%. Although highly
      arrhythmogenic, ACM is a relatively rare disorder. The investigators are now at a position to
      apply this simple, totally risk-free approach to help identify those individuals at risk of
      SCD due to more common forms of heritable arrhythmic disorders including the cardiac
      channelopathies. The cardiologists at St. George's University of London evaluate more than
      100 families of SCD victims per year for diagnosis and risk assessment. The large number of
      individuals evaluated at this single site provides the unprecedented opportunity to use this
      novel diagnostic approach to aid significant numbers of those at risk of developing
      life-threatening arrhythmias. There are no risks or potential discomfort associated with the
      study for the volunteer participants. The outcomes, however, may prove highly beneficial for
      prevention of SCD, timely and accurate diagnosis and management of arrhythmic disorders.

      The study participants will just be asked to open their mouth. A study team member will rub a
      soft brush a few times at the inside of their cheek and smear the brush on a microscopy
      slide. The slide will be sprayed with 70% ethanol to preserve the material and taken to the
      research laboratory where it will be subjected to immunostaining to study the distribution of
      key proteins. The patient will have a total of 4 smears taken (2 from each cheek). For the
      majority of the patients, only a single sampling will be enough which will take place during
      one of their regular follow-up appointments at the cardiology clinic. There is no pain and no
      discomfort associated with the procedure and it lasts only a few seconds. In selected cases,
      however, if for instance the investigators want to use the buccal smear to evaluate the
      effect of a novel drug treatment on protein distribution, the patient might be asked to
      provide the study team with another sample, again during one of his scheduled regular
      follow-up visits

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>alteration of protein distribution in arrhythmic disorders</measure>
    <time_frame>4 years</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome of the study is to evaluate if specific heritable arrhythmic disorders are associated with changes in selected protein distribution at cell-cell junctions within the buccal mucosa. The investigators' preliminary studies suggest that protein distribution alterations in the buccal mucosa mirror equivalent changes that occur in the myocardium of patients with ACM. This study will evaluate the use of this &quot;novel diagnostic tool&quot; in individuals at risk of sudden cardiac death due to other, more common forms of arrhythmic disorders. The processing approach (laboratory technique: immunocytochemistry) for protein visualization has been optimized to be qualitative rather than quantitative. In this sense - each sample will be characterized by &quot;presence&quot; or &quot;absence&quot; of a specific protein at the cell-cell connections. The investigators deem that the qualitative approach is not subject to bias and will ensure accuracy and reproducibility of the results.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>correlation of protein distribution with participants' genotype</measure>
    <time_frame>4 years</time_frame>
    <description>A potential secondary outcome of the research is whether the investigators can correlate protein distribution in the buccal mucosa with specific genotypes. The investigators' preliminary results on the cohort of patients with ACM suggest that mutations in different genes result in different protein distribution patterns within the buccal mucosa. Being able to predict the gene bearing the disease-causing mutation will significantly reduce the time and cost of genetic sequencing. Identifying the specific gene underlying a heritable arrhythmic disorder is of pivotal importance as increasingly developing genotype/phenotype correlations help individualized risk identification and patient management.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>correlation of treatments with Cx43 distribution</measure>
    <time_frame>4 years</time_frame>
    <description>Another potential outcome has to do with the effect changes in the patients' treatment plans may have on Cx43 distribution. Cx43 is the major gap junction protein responsible for the electrical coupling of the cells. It has been shown that patients with arrhythmic disorders show decreased distribution of Cx43 at the cell borders in their hearts and this has been associated with an increased risk for arrhythmias. The investigators' preliminary studies show that patients with cardiomyopathies show Cx43 remodeling in their buccal mucosa. If a patient seen at the arrhythmia service of St. George's shows Cx43 remodeling during initial sampling and in a follow-up visit his clinical care team deems necessary to change his treatment plan the investigators would like to study Cx43 distribution again during one of his/hers follow up visits. If the new treatment plan results in restoration of Cx43, this finding may be an indication of successful arrhythmia management.</description>
