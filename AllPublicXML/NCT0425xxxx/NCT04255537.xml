  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, observational, multicenter study that enroll consecutive and
      all-comers patients hospitalized with a diagnosis of Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) at
      admission.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Quality Improvement Program which enroll all the consecutive patients hospitalized
      with ACS. The data elements that are central to the study include the primary and secondary
      quality indicators (QIs) that are used to define the performance and to promote improved
      quality of care.

      At least 3000 patients will be enrolled. The primary endpoint are assessed in-hospital, at
      admission and discharge. Patients will be followed for 1 year after the ACS.

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Patients with STEACS intended for urgent angio/reperfusion.</arm_group_label>
    <description>This population mostly includes STEACS patients for whom primary PCI is intended. A minority of this population includes patients with STEACS intended for urgent angiography for persistent ST elevation and/or symptoms but with symptoms onset &gt; 12 hours (secondary PCI), urgent angiography after failed fibrinolysis (rescue PCI), or patients receiving fibrinolysis.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Patients with STEACS NOT intended for urgent angio/reperfusion</arm_group_label>
    <description>This population mostly includes STEACS patients not receiving reperfusion for late presentation (i.e. &gt; 12 hours) or patient preference. Note that patient in this category may receive diagnostic angiography for better diagnostic assessment and/or risk stratification but NOT on an urgent basis.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Patients with NSTEACS intended for invasive management</arm_group_label>
    <description>This population includes patients with NSTEACS managed invasively with coronary angiography within 72 hours. Most patients are a high-risk feature (i.e. positive troponin, GRACE risk score &gt; 140, hemodynamic/electrical instability) for whom angiography is intended.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Patients with NSTEACS NOT intended for invasive management</arm_group_label>
    <description>This population includes patients who are candidate for an initially conservative strategy. Note that this category may include patients who are subsequently managed with coronary angiography, including recurring symptoms of myocardial ischemia, or hemodynamic/ electrical instability.</description>

        The study is designed to include a consecutive and all-comers population hospitalized with
        a diagnosis of ACS at admission.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  STEACS patients: symptoms of myocardial ischemia and persistent (i.e. &gt; 20 min) ST
             elevation in at least two contiguous ECG leads. N.B. Positive biomarkers of cardiac
             necrosis (i.e. troponin) are not required to confirm the diagnosis. New or presumably
             new left-bundle branch block at presentation occurs infrequently, may interfere with
             ST-elevation analysis, and should not be considered diagnostic of acute myocardial
             infarction (MI) in isolation.

          -  NSTE-ACS patients: symptoms of myocardial ischemia of at least 10 minutes without
             persistent ST elevation in at least two contiguous ECG leads. To be included in this
             category patients should have at least one of the following two conditions: a) ECG
             evidence of NSTEACS defined as T wave inversion in leads with dominant R waves of at
             least of at least 1 mm (100 μV) or ST segment depression of at least 0.5 mm (50 μV)
             and/or b) Biomarker evidence of NSTEACS defined as at least one positive (i.e. above
             the 99th percentile upper reference limit) troponin value (i.e. NSTEMI)

          -  A written informed consent (to agree for a contact, usually by telephone) is required
             only to patients who are discharged alive.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who, in the opinion of the investigator, are unable to comply with study
             follow up procedures, including, but not limited to, patients who are in prison, who
             are expected to move to a remote country, or who refuse to be followed should be
             excluded.
