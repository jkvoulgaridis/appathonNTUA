  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if there is a difference in clinical outcomes after
      total knee replacement (TKR) performed with traditional ligament balancing compared to use of
      intraoperative sensing technology (IOS) to balance ligaments. IOS is used to send real time
      information to a monitor within the operating room that assists your surgeon in making
      decisions about the balance of the ligaments in your knee and the proper insertion of
      implants. A total of 150 subjects will participate in this study at Hospital for Special
      Surgery.

      The hypotheses are that the use of IOS technology will be associated with:

        1. Better soft tissue balance during TKR than by manual balancing alone.

        2. Higher patient reported clinical outcome measures (PROMs) following surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participation in this study will involve a knee replacement performed with IOS. Patients will
      be randomized into one of two groups:The study group will have soft tissue balance performed
      with the use of IOS. Control group patients will have soft tissue balance performed manually,
      with final soft tissue balance values measured using IOS, while the surgeon will remain
      blinded to those values. Intra-operative compartment loads will be measured in 10, 45, and 90
      degrees of flexion.

      Additionally, long leg limb alignment, passive range of motion, use of opioids, daily
      activity, and PROMS will be evaluated post-operatively to determine which group has better
      outcomes.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Knee Society Score</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome will be the difference in Knee Society Score (KSS) between baseline and 4 months post-operatively. The Knee Society Score is out of 100 points, with a higher score meaning a patient had a better outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Intra-operative Compartment Loads</measure>
    <time_frame>Intra-operative</time_frame>
    <description>Intra-operative compartment loads (medial and lateral component loads) will be measured between the groups at 10, 45, and 90 degrees of flexion during trial reduction and after cementation, using IOS technology.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Long Leg Limb Alignment</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Long leg limb alignment will be measured on post-operative standard of care (SOC) radiographs at patients' 6 week follow-ups.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Passive Range of Motion</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Passive range of motion will be measured pre-operatively, 6 weeks post-operatively, and 4 months post-operatively at all scheduled SOC appointments.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Opioid Use</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Use of opioids will be tracked using the Internet System for Tracking Over Prescribing (I-STOP) database and a daily pain diary maintained by patient for first 6 weeks post-operatively. The I-STOP database can be accessed by the prescribing physician to track how many opioid refills a patient has procured.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Function and Activity</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Function and activity will be monitored using Fitness Trackers. The device will be given to each patient in hospital and is to be worn for 6 weeks post-operatively. It will monitor a patient's daily and weekly steps while the patient is wearing it.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Level</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Daily pain levels will also be measured using the fitness tracker. The tracker will ask the patient to rate their pain on a scale from 0-10, with 0 meaning they have no pain, and 10 being the worst pain imaginable.</description>
