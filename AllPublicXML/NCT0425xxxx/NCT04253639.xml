  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective and transverse multicenter study to identify predictive factors for
      adherence to TENS by chronic pain patients followed in structures specialized in Chronic Pain
      management (SPC).

      The study contains 2 parts:

        -  A retrospective part of data collection in the patient follow-up file of the SPC during
           the 6 months elapsed after the first rental prescription.

        -  A transversal part, aimed at collecting additional information on the use of TENS,
           satisfaction and quality of life during a telephone interview after 6 months of use.

    <time_frame>Data are collected the day of the inclusion retrospectively on a 6 month period prior to the inclusion of each patient</time_frame>

Factors which can explain the lack of compliance will be collected and categorized within &quot;pain centre&quot;, &quot;clinician&quot;, &quot;TENS characteristics&quot;, &quot;patient socio-demographics&quot;, &quot;aetiology and characteristics of pain&quot;, &quot;efficacy and tolerance&quot; data.</description>
