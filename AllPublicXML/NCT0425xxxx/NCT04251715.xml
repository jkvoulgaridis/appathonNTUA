    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the efficacy and safety of systemic induction of mFOLFIRINOX,
      followed by hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) floxuridine-dexamethasone administered
      concurrently with systemic mFOLFIRI in treating patients with liver-dominant intrahepatic
      cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) that cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable). Drugs used in
      chemotherapy regimens, such as mFOLFIRINOX and mFOLFIRI (Oxaliplatin, Irinotecan,
      Fluorouracil, Folinic acid, Floxuridine) work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor
      cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from
      spreading. Delivering chemotherapy via HAI (hepatic arterial infusion) can allow for
      liver-directed treatment while limiting toxic side effects typically seen with traditional
      chemotherapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the efficacy of systemic induction of mFOLFIRINOX, followed by HAI
      floxuridine-dexamethasone administered concurrently with systemic mFOLFIRI.

      II. To assess safety of treatment with HAI floxuridine-dexamethasone delivered concurrently
      with systemic mFOLFIRI

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate response and survival following treatment.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the radiographic response using diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI).

      II. Evaluate quality of life (QoL) pre-, during, and post-treatment.

      III. Mutational profiling of exceptional and non-responders to treatment.

      IV. Examine the differential expression pattern of RNA (microRNA and mRNA) in ICC.

      V. Characterize circulating hybrid cells (CHCs) pre-, during, and post-treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase II, single arm, study that consists of a two-part treatment plan
      (Treatment Periods 1 and 2) of systemic induction of mFOLFIRINOX, followed by HAI
      floxuridine-dexamethasone administered concurrently with systemic mFOLFIRI. Six participants
      will be enrolled as part of the initial safety-run-in, after which an additional 24
      participants will be enrolled.

      After laparoscopic staging, eligible patients will receive a systemic regimen of mFOLFIRINOX
      with 25% dose reduction of oxaliplatin, irinotecan, and fluorouracil administered every
      2-weeks for 4 cycles (8 weeks) (Treatment Period 1). After completing mFOLFIRINOX induction,
      participants' disease will be reevaluated by MRI/CT imaging. Only those that achieve disease
      control based on RECIST criteria (v1.1) will be eligible for HAI therapy via a laparotomy and
      placement of a HAI pump. (Treatment Period 2).

      After completing 2 cycles of HAI treatment with concurrent FOLFIRI, participants will undergo
      repeat MRI/CT imaging to assess disease response. An image-guided liver biopsy will be
      performed after completion of the 8 weeks of treatment of HAI floxuridine/dexamethasone
      combined with systemic mFOLFIRI of Treatment Period 2. Participants with controlled disease
      (as defined by RECIST criteria) may receive additional cycles of HAI-delivered floxuridine
      and dexamethasone, along with systemic administration of mFOLFIRI.
