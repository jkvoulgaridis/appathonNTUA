  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to assess the effects of including mushrooms as part of a healthy
      eating pattern on indices of perceived mental health/anxiety/depression, along with risk
      factors for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that consuming mushrooms as part of a healthy eating pattern
      will lead to greater improvements in fasting insulin concentrations and systolic and
      diastolic blood pressures. The brain health-related outcomes and other cardiometabolic risk
      outcomes (e.g. lipoprotein particle size) are exploratory due to the paucity of human
      research addressing these important topics. Collectively, this short-term (8-week)
      randomized, controlled feeding trial will provide important pilot data to inform the
      plausibility, focus, and design of longer-term intervention trials, consistent with The
      Mushroom Council's research agenda.

    <intervention_model_description>For this investigator-blinded, randomized, parallel design study, 100 participants (60 to finish; n=30/group) will complete a 10-week study period, which includes a 2-week baseline testing period (no diet control), followed by an 8-week controlled diet period (Figure 1). In order to define the effects of adding mushrooms to a healthy dietary pattern on fasting blood glucose and insulin concentrations and blood pressures, we will provide a Mediterranean-style diet devoid of mushrooms as the control diet for this study. Questionnaires assessing depression/anxiety, perceived quality of life, and mood will be administered and the results will provide a foundation to power future, more robust, studies.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>During the 2-week baseline period all participants will consume their usual, unrestricted self-chosen diets. During intervention weeks 1-8, all participants will consume the same Mediterranean-style diet, rich in fruits and seafoods and lower in dairy, designed to meet their estimated energy needs. The mushroom group will consume 0.5 cups/day of cooked mushrooms (white button mushrooms and yellow oyster mushrooms on 4 and 3 days/week, respectively). All foods will be provided to subjects during the intervention to achieve the desired eating pattern.</description>
