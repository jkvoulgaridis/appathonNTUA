      This objective of this feasibility study is to evaluate the safety of the InnoVein Valve and
      Delivery System for treatment of chronic venous insufficiency.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Venous Insufficiency occurs when the venous wall and/or valves in the leg veins are
      not working effectively, making it difficult for blood to return to the heart from the
      legs.The core etiology of the disease stems from increased venous pressure and incompetent
      venous valves leading to regurgitation of blood that accumulates in the legs. It has been
      shown that implantation or recreation of a functional valve can lead to clearance of excess
      blood and resolution of symptoms.

      The InnoVein Valve and Delivery System is a new, investigational biocompatible valve intended
      to support natural flow in vessels in patients with Chronic Venous Insufficiency. The purpose
      of this study is to assess the safety of the InnoVein Valve and Delivery System for treatment
      of Chronic Venous Insufficiency.
