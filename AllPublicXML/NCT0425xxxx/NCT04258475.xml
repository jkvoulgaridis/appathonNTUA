  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Raltegravir is an antiretroviral (ART) medication used in combination with other drugs to
      treat HIV/AIDS. Calcium supplementation it is often recommended for persons with HIV due to
      bone mineral density loss associated with aging, and with other medications including ART.
      High dose of calcium is reported to reduce Raltegravir level. The standard currently is a
      lower dose of Calcium, so we would like to know if lower doses of calcium (500-1000 mg) will
      have any effect on Raltegravir levels.The patient population will consist of volunteers who
      are taking ART with good virological and immunological treatment effect and are willing and
      able to separate once-daily ART dosing from study medications of raltegravir and calcium by
      taking their ART medications in the evening and study medications in the morning, at least 8
      hours apart.

      Each study participant will take two oral raltegravir 600 mg tablets once daily for three
      one-week periods and have three end-week PK days of a 7-hour housing, observed dosing around
      a standardized meal, and serial 6-hour phlebotomy with 24 hour follow-up phlebotomy. Persons
      will take concurrent calcium carbonate one or two 500 mg tablets together with raltegravir
      during breakfast in the second or third week respectively. Safety, tolerance and adherence by
      returned pill count will be documented at each study visit. Patients who are already taking
      Raltegravir as part of their ART plan can be recruited and their medication schedule will be
      personally supervised and planned by the Study Physician.
