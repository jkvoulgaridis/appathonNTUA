  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators from eight tertiary care, level 1 pediatric trauma centers have developed a
      protocol for the establishment of a formal, prospective multi-center adolescent clavicle
      registry, with designs for standardized radiographic assessment and the prospective
      collection of validated outcome measures and complications data, for all patients, ages
      10-18, treated for clavicle shaft fractures, operatively and non-operatively. Eventually, the
      investigators would like to do comparative analysis for the operative and non-operative
      treatment arms, with additional sub-stratified analyses performed within these treatment arms
      by age and activity level. Among the primary goals of research projects stemming from the
      first arm of this registry, FACTS A, is to explore the hypothesis that non-operative
      treatment is associated with lower costs, greater safety, and equivalent or superior
      outcomes, compared with operative treatment, despite a national trend towards increasing
      surgical treatment. The second arm of the registry, FACTS B, will continue to investigate the
      same hypotheses, excluding cost outcomes, in patients only with completely displaced midshaft
      clavicle fractures.

    <measure>Changes in functional score from time of injury (or from time of surgery) using the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score (ASES)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Patient-reported function over time will be assessed using the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score (ASES).
The ASES is a composite instrument comprised of two sections, including patient self-reported pain (7 items) and patient self-reported activities of daily living (10 items). Scores range from 0 to 100 with a score of 0 indicating a worse shoulder condition and 100 indicating a better shoulder condition.</description>

    <measure>Changes in functional score from time of injury (or from time of surgery) using the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand Score (Quick-DASH).</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Patient reported function over time will be assessed using the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand Score (Quick-DASH).
The QuickDASH questionnaire evaluates presence and degree of symptoms as well as perceived ability to perform functional tasks with the injured upper extremity. There are 5 responses for each question, graded on a scale from '1' to '5'. A response of '1' reflects the patient's perception to have either 'no symptoms', no limitations, or no perceived disability to the question prompt. A response of '5' reflects the patient's perception to have either 'extreme' symptoms, or inability to perform the task prompted in the question.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Activity Level from time of injury (or from time of surgery) using the Marx Shoulder Activity Scale.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Patient-reported activity level over time will be assessed using the Marx Shoulder Activity Scale.
This questionnaire rates the frequency for which a patient is able to perform five functional activities with the injured upper extremity. Each prompt is rated on a five-point frequency scale from 'never performed' (0 points) to 'daily' (4 points). Two additional questions regarding ability to participate in sports generally considered 'contact sports' and ability to participate in sports involving 'overhead throwing' are rated on a scaled from 'No' (0 points) to 'Yes, on a professional level' (3 points). A higher cumulative score is reflective of 'better' function.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Quality of Life after injury (or surgery) using the EQ-5D-3L.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Patient reported quality of life will be assessed through distribution of the EQ-5D-3L questionnaire. The EQ-5D-3L questionnaire is comprised from 5 dimensions including: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 3 levels: no problems, some problems, and extreme problems. The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. This decision results into a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state. Responses are scored on an algorithm in which a higher number is indicative of a greater quality of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Quality of Life after injury (or surgery) using the EQ-VAS.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Patient reported quality of life will be assessed through distribution of the EQ-VAS questionnaire. The EQ VAS records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale where the endpoints are labelled 'Best imaginable health state' and 'Worst imaginable health state' ranging from the numerical value of '100' ('Best imaginable health state') to '0' ('Worst imaginable health state'). The VAS can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome that reflects the patient's own judgement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Satisfaction with treatment outcome after injury (or surgery)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be asked a series of 'yes-no' questions as well as questions related to their clinical progression since time of treatment for which responses range from 'completely satisfied' to 'completely unsatisfied'. If a patient underwent internal fixation with implanted hardware, the patient will be asked whether or not the hardware is bothersome.
The rate of choice selection for each response, per question, will be cumulatively assessed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Return-to-Sport after injury (or surgery)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be asked their ability to return to sporting activities and level of competition compared to before their clavicle injury. Self-reported athletes will be further queried as to what sport/s they returned to, and whether they returned to the same level of competition. If athletes have not returned to play, or have returned at a less competitive level, they will be asked whether the change in sport participation or sport intensity was related to the clavicle injury, or due to other circumstances.
The rate of choice selection for each response, per question, will be cumulatively assessed.</description>
