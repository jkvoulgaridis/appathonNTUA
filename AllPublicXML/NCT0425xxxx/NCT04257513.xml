  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A 2-year clinical longitudinal study to measure plasma concentrations of
      24S-hydroxycholesterol, a brain-derived cholesterol catabolite, in subjects with Huntington
      disease, from the presymptomatic to the symptomatic stages.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In cross-sectional studies, the plasma level of brain-derived 24S-hydroxycholesterol (24OHC)
      has been found to be significantly diminished in HD patients from the first stages of the
      disease. Furthermore, in HD gene-positive pre-symptomatic (pre-HD) the plasma levels can
      predict the development of motor signs of disease in subjects closer to onset, better than in
      subjects far from onset. These data suggest that circulating 24OHC might be a candidate
      biomarker for phenotypic conversion and for disease progression in different stages of the
      disease.

      Detailed neurological, cognitive and imaging data and blood samples will be collected at
      baseline, and after two years to investigate the rate of changes along the longitudinal
      study. Isotope dilution mass spectrometry (assay performed at Istituto di Ricerche
      Farmacologiche Mario Negri IRCCS) will be used to measure the plasma levels of brain-derived
      24OHC and other sterols reflecting peripheral cholesterol synthesis. The investigators expect
      to establish whether changes in plasma 24OHC mark disease progression and, eventually,
      phenoconversion from pre-symptomatic to symptomatic stages in combination with clinical,
      cognitive and imaging parameters.
