  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this single center, double-blind, randomized controlled clinical trial, we will include
      648 diabetes patients aged 18-70 undergoing laparoscopic pelvic tumor resection. They will be
      randomized to the following four groups: high-pressure pneumoperitoneum (10mmHg)+ deep
      neuromuscular block group, high-pressure pneumoperitoneum (15mmHg)+moderate neuromuscular
      block group, low-pressure pneumoperitoneum + deep neuromuscular block group and low-pressure
      pneumoperitoneum+moderate neuromuscular block group. Deep neuromuscular block is defined as
      post tetanic count (PTC) 1-2, and low neuromuscular block is defined as train-of-four (TOF)
      twitch 1-2. The outcomes will be indicators for acute kidney injury and surgical condition.

      In this single center, double-blind, randomized controlled clinical trial, we will include
      648 diabetes patients aged 18-70 undergoing laparoscopic pelvic tumor resection under general
      anesthesia. They will be randomized to the following four groups: high-pressure
      pneumoperitoneum (10mmHg)+ deep neuromuscular block group, high-pressure pneumoperitoneum
      (15mmHg)+moderate neuromuscular block group, low-pressure pneumoperitoneum + deep
      neuromuscular block group and low-pressure pneumoperitoneum+moderate neuromuscular block
      group. Neuromuscular block will be induced by rocuronium bolus and maintained by a continuous
      infusion of rocuronium. Deep neuromuscular block is defined as PTC 1-2, and low neuromuscular
      block is defined as train-of-four TOF twitch 1-2. The primary outcome will be serum Cystatin
      C level, and the secondary outcomes will be serum creatine level, urinary sediment,
      intraoperative urine output, duration of surgery, surgical space condition and occurrence
      bucking and body movement.
