  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intraoperative hemodynamic optimization decreases postoperative complications and length of
      stay in high risk patient. Therefore, continuous monitoring of cardiac output (Qc) is
      recommended to guide fluid management. Thoracic bio-reactance is a recent technique that
      allows cardiac output non-invasive monitoring. However, additional clinical validation
      studies in humans are required to better define the typologies of patients for whom this
      monitoring could be proposed routinely. Lung surgery is defined as an intermediate or high
      risk surgery regarding postoperative cardiac complications. However, surgical patients rarely
      benefit from continuous monitoring of cardiac output, the available methods being considered
      too invasive or insufficiently reliable in daily practice. Thoracic bio-reactance (Non
      Invasive Cardiac Output Monitor (NICOM) Starling SV) has not been studied in this subgroup of
      clinically relevant patients.

    <description>The primary endpoint is the accuracy of the cardiac output value measured with the NICOM Starling SV vs. oesophageal Doppler in thoracic controlled pulmonary exeresis surgery in adults. The accuracy considered valid and reliable will be defined as the error percentage for the Cardiac Output (CO) with an acceptability (concordance) threshold of 30 %. The accuracy will be evaluated on the totality of the time points of interrest.
All data will be recorded at several time points interest (T0-T7) during surgery:
T0 Post Induction / supine position
T1 Lateral position closed Thorax / bipulmonary ventilation
T2 Lateral position closed Thorax / selective unipulmonary ventilation.
T3 Lateral position open Thorax
T4 pleural cavity being Washed
T5 Before Lung Recruitment Maneuver
T6 During Positive End Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) Standardized Pulmonary Recruitment Maneuver 30 cmH20 30 seconds
T7 End of Surgery / Awakening in lateral decubitus</description>
