  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: The sending of text messages (short messaging service, SMS) has been proven as an
      effective strategy in behavior change. In Mexico, the Strategy of Comprehensive Care for the
      Nutrition (EsIAN for its acronym in Spanish ) focuses on improving access to information for
      the main caregivers of child beneficiaries on the practice of infant feeding and healthy
      physical activity.

      Objective: To assess whether the mHealth (or mobile health) strategy or the sending of SMS
      has an effect on knowledge, attitudes, intentionality, perceived control and practices to
      prevent childhood malnutrition in a population living in poverty.

      Design: Randomized effectiveness trial by conglomerates. Participants: 400 primary caregivers
      of children &lt;59 months and health personnel working in the health units included in the
      study.

      Control group: Healthy child care in standard health units plus exposure to EsIAN.

      Intervention group: In addition to the control group, the SMS are sent through a cell pone
      through the RapidPro platform on practices related to prevention of child malnutrition (in
      primary caregivers) and the reinforcement of counseling for the prevention of infant
      malnutrition (with health personnel).

      Randomization: The first level health units were stratified by state (Morelos or Yucatan);
      rural and urban area and affiliation institution (Secretary of Health or Mexican Institute of
      Social Security); and randomized to be assigned to the control or intervention group; 400
      primary caregivers of children &lt;59 months in total will be included for the study.

      Main measures of interest: State of nutrition and knowledge, attitudes or practices on
      breastfeeding, physical activity, adoption and preparation of healthy foods and beverages in
      primary caregivers of children&lt;5 years old; and advice on the key messages of EsIAN by health
      providers.
