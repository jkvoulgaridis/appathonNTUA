  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to reduce pathologic aspiration and pneumonia in the perioperative
      period by providing an oral care and oral hygiene education to patients preoperatively.
      Patients enrolled in the study will be given a dysphagia screening questionnaire, an oral
      care package and oral hygiene education. Patients who screen positive for dysphagia will be
      referred to Speech Pathology for evaluation. The rate of postoperative pneumonia will be
      determined for those who participate in the study and will be compared to retrospective
      patient data from our institution.

      Aspiration by high risk esophageal and lung cancer patients with either preexisting or
      post-therapy/post-operative dysphagia leads to morbidity (pneumonia) and mortality following
      surgery. The aim of this study is to reduce pathologic aspiration and pneumonia in the
      perioperative period by providing an oral care and oral hygiene education to patients
      preoperatively. Patients enrolled in the study will be given a dysphagia screening
      questionnaire, an oral care package and oral hygiene education. Patients who screen positive
      for dysphagia will be referred to Speech Pathology for evaluation. The rate of postoperative
      pneumonia will be determined for those who participate in the study and will be compared to
      retrospective patient data from our institution.

    <description>Patients who are scheduled for elective esophageal or lung resections who consent to participate will undergo oral hygiene education and be given an oral hygiene packet. An oral hygiene assessment using the Plaque Assessment tool will be conducted in the clinic. A Dysphagia Screening Tool questionnaire will also be administered. Patients who screen positive for dysphagia will be referred to Speech Pathology for evaluation but for the study purposes, the only data collected from the evaluation will be whether or not the participant received this intervention. A repeat dental exam will occur on the day of surgery. Patients will be followed for 30 days post operatively.</description>

    <ipd_description>After appropriate consent, patient charts will be reviewed by study members that have completed appropriate training. Protected Health Information (PHI) that will be accessed includes demographic data for patients such as Medical Record Number, date of surgery, planned operation, dental history, etc.(Also see the Data Collection Form). PHI will be collected and maintained in REDCap. For the retrospective review portion of the study, the charts of previous patients will be accessed. Data from those patients who underwent surgery within one year prior to beginning the study will be compared to the data collected during the study. Since obtaining consent for this portion of chart review will be difficult, we plan to request a HIPAA waiver of authorization.</ipd_description>
