  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed of this randomized, double blinded, placebo-controlled study is to assess the
      effect of SAMe compared to placebo in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis Child Class A and B.
      The primary objective of the study is to test relationship between SAMe
      (S-adenosylmethionine) supplement on liver function. The hypothesis is that SAMe supplement
      will improve liver function in patients with alcoholic liver disease. The improvement in
      liver function will lead to the reduction in all-cause mortality in patients with alcoholic
      cirrhosis in those who receive SAMe supplement when compared to those receiving placebo.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria for patients with alcoholic cirrhosis

          1. Patients must have had alcohol consumption averaging at least 80 grams per day (for
             men) or 50 grams per day (for women), for at least 10 years. These criteria are based
             on epidemiological evidence of the alcohol-cirrhosis relationship. The cutoff was set
             at a relatively high level so as to minimize the chance that cirrhosis was caused by
             factors other than alcohol

          2. Evidence of cirrhosis as per clinical signs and/or noninvasive transient elastography
             (FibroscanÂ®), computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging including MRI
             elastography compatible with cirrhosis and/or histopathology by biopsy and

          3. subjects with clinical presentation either in Child Class A or B at the time of
             enrollment

        Inclusion criteria for healthy control :

          1. individuals 18 to 70 years old

          2. able to provide informed consent

          3. subjects do not consume any alcohol or those who drink &lt; 50 grams per day on average
             in women and &lt; 80 grams per day on average in men and do not consume any alcohol
             within 3 months before the study and

          4. subjects are healthy without underlying acute or chronic medical conditions.

        Exclusion criteria for patients with alcoholic cirrhosis

          1. Active infection as evidenced by positive urine culture, blood culture, or pneumonia,

          2. Serum creatinine &gt;1.5 mg/dl

          3. Known co-existing infection with hepatitis C, hepatitis B, or HIV

          4. Significant systemic or major illness including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
             congestive heart failure, and renal failure that in the opinion of the Investigator
             would preclude the patient from participating in and completing the study

          5. Gastrointestinal bleeding within the prior 28 days3

          6. Participation in another investigational drug, biologic, or medical device trial
             within 30 days prior to screening

          7. Women who are pregnant, may become pregnant, or nursing

          8. Presence of any other disease or condition that is interfering with the absorption,
             distribution, metabolism, or excretion of SAMe such as those with gastric bypass
             surgery

          9. Subjects with history of/diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma

         10. Members from the same family of study participant. This is based on the recent paper
             on the non-random sampling in randomized controlled trials4. We acknowledge that if we
             assign family members to identical treatment, randomization would not be totally
             correct; but if properly randomized, there is a chance that the members of the family
             might mix the pills. To avoid this issue and maintain the integrity of randomized
             blinded fashion, we will not include members from the same family into the study

         11. Subjects with psychiatric illnesses such as bipolar disorders as SAMe may interfere
             with the levels of anti-psychotic drugs and

         12. Systemic antibiotic use or use of rifaximin for 10 days or more in last 2 months
             before the enrollment.

        Exclusion criteria for all healthy control participants:

          1. individuals under the age of 18 or over the age of 70

          2. not able to provide informed consent

          3. subjects who consume any alcohol or those who drink &gt; 50 grams per day on average in
             women and &gt; 80 grams per day on average in men and consume any alcohol within 3 months
             before the study and

          4. subjects that are unhealthy with underlying acute or chronic medical conditions.
