  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the benefits and risks of maintenance chemotherapy (MCT), maintenance
      endocrine therapy (MET) and none maintenance therapy after first-line treatment of metastatic
      breast cancer (MBC).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are several options for MBC patients who are responding to chemotherapy, to continue
      treatment with a fix number of cycles or until disease progression which also known as
      maintenance chemotherapy (MCT), to stop chemotherapy and take a watch and wait strategy, or
      to stop chemotherapy and start the maintenance endocrine therapy (MET) for hormone receptor
      (HR) positive patients. Since the role of maintenance therapy in prolonging the overall
      survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) of MBC was controversial in previous
      studies, the investigators performed a systematic review of randomized controlled trials to
      detect the association of survival with maintenance therapy in patients with MBC after
      first-line chemotherapy. And the investigators further performed a multi-center retrospective
      real-world study to evaluate these two maintenance modalities.

        This is a multi-center real world study to compare maintenance chemotherapy (MCT),
        maintenance endocrine therapy (MET) and observation in patients with HR-positive MBC who
        achieved disease control after first-line chemotherapy. Patients were retrospectively
        enrolled from 3 different medical center.
