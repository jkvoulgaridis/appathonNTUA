  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study ASTX030-01 is designed to move efficiently from Phase 1 to Phase 3. Phase 1 consists of
      an open-label Dose Escalation Stage (Stage A) using multiple cohorts at escalating dose
      levels of oral cedazuridine and azacitidine (only one study drug will be escalated at a time)
      followed by a Dose Expansion Stage (Stage B) of ASTX030. Phase 2 is a randomized open-label
      crossover study to compare oral ASTX030 to subcutaneous (SC) azacitidine. Phase 3 is a
      randomized open-label crossover study comparing the final oral ASTX030 tablet to SC
      azacitidine. The duration of the study is expected to be approximately 36 months.

          3. Life-threatening illness (e.g., uncontrolled bleeding and patients at risk for or are
             experiencing leukostasis [AML]), uncontrolled medical condition or organ system
             dysfunction, or other reasons, which, in the investigator's opinion, could compromise
             the participant's safety, interfere with the absorption or metabolism of oral
             cedazuridine + azacitidine or compromise the integrity of the study outcomes.

          4. Prior malignancy, except for adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin
             cancer, in situ cervical cancer, prostate cancer or breast cancer under control with

             at least 2 years.

          5. Participants with MDS/MPN who have clinical extramedullary disease including
             clinically palpable hepatomegaly or splenomegaly.

          6. Previous treatment with more than 1 cycles of decitabine, azacitidine, or
             guadecitabine (Phases 2 and 3 only).

          7. Treated with any investigational drug or therapy within 2 weeks, or 5 half lives,
             whichever is longer, before the protocol-defined first dose of study treatment, or
             ongoing clinically significant adverse events from previous treatment with
             investigational drug or therapy.

          8. Known or suspected hypersensitivity to cedazuridine or azacitidine, or any of their
             excipients.
