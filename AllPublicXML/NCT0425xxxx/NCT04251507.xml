    <textblock>
      To determine if a virtual reality simulation will reduce pain and anxiety in patients
      undergoing an ultrasound guided breast localization procedure (traditional wire, savi scout
      or a radiofrequency identification tag).

    <textblock>
      Needle localizations for breast cancer surgery are required to identify cancerous tissue
      before surgery. Currently this procedure is done with or without a local anesthetic. Patients
      report anxiety regarding cancer and cancer-related procedures. Different types of needle
      localization may have different pain and anxiety based on their duration, complexity, and
      invasiveness. This research is designed to determine if VR simulated environment can reduce
      pain and anxiety.

      Our aim is to study the efficacy of a virtual environment in reducing pain and procedural
      anxiety. It is intended for patients undergoing an ultrasound guided breast localization
      procedure that have had an abnormal breast biopsy. The overall aim is to discover an
      efficacious nonpharmacologic method to lower pain and anxiety during a standard of care
      procedure.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjective Pain Assessment: Visual Analog Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediate post-procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Pain Measured with the Visual Analog Scale. Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) is a measurement instrument that tries to measure a characteristic or attitude that is believed to range across a continuum of values and cannot easily be directly measured. The individual will score their pain level by circling a number 0 - 10 at baseline, pre-operative, and post-operatively. The scale range includes 0-10 scales, with &lt; 2 =well controlled, 2 - 5: partly controlled, &gt; 5: uncontrolled.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI: Y-6 item)</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediate post-procedure</time_frame>
    <description>The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory uses a 4 point Likert scale to assess how much worry, tension or apprehension the subject experiences in his or her present circumstances (state anxiety) and how much anxiety represent a personality characteristic (trait anxiety). Items emphasize the frequency of particular symptoms (ranging from 1 = not at all to 4 = very much). The range of possible scores for form Y of the STAI varies from a minimum score of 20 to a maximum score of 80 on both the STAI-T and STAI-S subscales. STAI scores are commonly classified as &quot;no or low anxiety&quot; (20-37), &quot;moderate anxiety&quot; (38-44), and &quot;high anxiety&quot; (45-80).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediate post-procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Patients in both groups will be asked to rate their satisfaction with their procedures using a five point likert scale (ranging from 1 = definitely disagree to 5 = definitely agree).</description>

    <measure>Blood Volume Pulse Signal</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediate post-procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Empatica E4 watch is a wearable device that collects real-time physiological data. The photoplethysmogram sensor from the watch will measure variation of volume of arterial blood under the skin resulting from the heart cycle computing Blood Volume Pulse (BVP). Blood Volume Pulse will be measured in beats min−1.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Galvanic Skin Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediate post-procedure</time_frame>
    <description>The Empatica E4 watch is a wearable device that collects real-time physiological data. The photoplethysmogram skin electrodes from the watch will capture the Galvanic Skin Response (GSR), also named Electrodermal Activity (EDA) and Skin Conductance (SC) or the measure of the continuous variations in the electrical characteristics of the skin. GSR will be reported in units of micro-Siemens (μS).</description>
