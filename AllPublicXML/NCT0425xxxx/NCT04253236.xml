  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, non-randomized, sequential, open-label study to investigate the safety,
      tolerability, PK, PD, and efficacy of RVT-1401 (680 mg/weekly and 340 mg/weekly) in patients
      with Warm Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia that is worsening or refractory in spite of therapy
      with steroids and or immunosuppressants or worsening with steroid or immunosuppressant taper.
      Two cohorts of participants will be enrolled in a non-randomized sequential approach.
      Participants will be enrolled into Cohort 1 (680 mg/weekly) first followed by Cohort 2 (340
      mg/weekly).

      Following the initial dose at the Baseline Visit (Week 1, Day 1), study visits will occur
      weekly throughout the treatment period. Following the final dose at Week 12, visits will
      occur weekly through Week 14 and then at Week 16 and Week 20. Safety, PK, PD, and clinical
      assessments will be collected throughout the study.

      Each participant will participate in the study for up to approximately 24 weeks: up to a
      4-week screening period, a 12-week treatment period, and an 8-week follow up period.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female ≥ 18 years of age.

          2. Diagnosis of primary or secondary WAIHA as documented by a positive direct
             antiglobulin test (DAT) specific for anti-IgG alone or anti-IgG plus C3d.

          3. Secondary WAIHA may only include Stage 0 chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in which
             separate treatment is not indicated, nor anticipated to require active management for
             the duration of the study.

          4. Have failed or not tolerated at least one prior WAIHA treatment regimen as per local
             standards (e.g., steroids, rituximab, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine,
             mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), danazol, or vincristine). Failure is defined as worsening
             or refractory disease despite steroids and or immunosuppressants.

          5. Participants with splenectomy ≥3 months from Day 1 who are up to date on vaccinations
             (based on age and local guidance) are allowed.

          6. At Screening and Baseline, subject's hemoglobin level must be &lt;10 g/dL and the subject
             must have documented symptoms related to anemia (e.g., weakness, dizziness, fatigue,
             shortness of breath, chest pain).

          7. Subject's concurrent treatment for WAIHA may consist only of steroids (stable dose for
             at least two weeks prior to Day 1), immunosuppressant therapy (azathioprine, MMF, or
             cyclosporine) that has been at a stable dose for at least four weeks prior to Day 1,
             or erythropoietin (stable dose for at least 6 weeks prior to Day 1). [Note: starting
             doses of WAIHA therapy must be maintained throughout the study except in the case of a
             rescue medication as per local standards for safety. Steroid taper down to 10 mg/day
             will be allowed for participants who achieve response for at least 2 weeks.]

          8. A female participant is eligible to participate if she is of:

               1. Non-childbearing potential defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented
                  bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy (removal of the ovaries) or
                  hysterectomy; hysteroscopic sterilization, or postmenopausal defined as 12 months
                  of spontaneous amenorrhea.

               2. Child-bearing potential and agrees to use one of the contraception methods listed
                  in the protocol for an appropriate period of time (as determined by the product
                  label or Principal Investigator) prior to the start of dosing to sufficiently
                  minimize the risk of pregnancy at that point. Female participants must agree to
                  use contraception until 90 days after the last dose of study treatment.

          9. Male participants must agree to use one of the contraception methods listed in the
             protocol. This criterion must be followed from the time of the first dose of study
             treatment until 90 days after the last dose of study treatment.

         10. Willing and capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with
             the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.

        Other, more specific inclusion criteria are defined in the protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Participants with other types of AIHA (e.g., cold antibody AIHA, cold agglutinin
             syndrome, mixed type AIHA, or paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria).

          2. Participants requiring more than 2 units of RBC per week in the 2 weeks prior to
             Screening and Baseline.

          3. Use of rituximab, any monoclonal antibody for immunomodulation, or proteasome
             inhibitor, within the past 3 months prior to Screening.

          4. Immunoglobulins given by SC, IV (IVIG), or intramuscular route, or
             plasmapheresis/plasma exchange (PE) within 60 days before Screening.

          5. Total IgG level &lt;6 g/L (at Screening).

          6. Absolute neutrophil count &lt;1000 cells/mm3(at Screening).

        Other, more specific exclusion criteria are defined in the protocol.
