  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the randomized controlled study is to investigate the effects of NMES superimposed
      on voluntary contraction combined with patient education and exercise training program in
      patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      When initial assessments will be completed, patients will be assigned to one of two possible
      sequences by simple randomization: Superimposed NMES group (SG) or control group (CG).

      All volunteers will receive an COPD patient education program for once and conventional
      physiotherapy exercise program for COPD with the duration of 8 weeks. Additionally,
      superimposed NMES will be applied on quadriceps muscle of both limbs at the same time with
      voluntarily contraction of quadriceps muscle in SG.

      All patients will be assessed in terms of functional capacity, pulmonary functions,
      quadriceps muscle endurance and strength, dyspnea, respiratory muscle strength and quality of
      life at the baseline and at the end of study. Data will be collected from all the patients at
      baseline and at the end of study (8 weeks) by the same physiotherapist who also will
      supervise the exercise sessions.
