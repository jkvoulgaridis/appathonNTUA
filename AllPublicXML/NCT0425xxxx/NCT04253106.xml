  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Activating somatic mutations and methylation profiles identified by liquid biopsies could
      identify CDH1 and CTNNA1 pathogenic variants carriers with invasive diffuse gastric cancer
      undetectable by upper G-I endoscopy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Carriers of germline pathogenic variants in the CDH1 and CTNNA1 genes have the Hereditary
      Diffuse Gastric Cancer Syndrome. Asymptomatic carriers have at high lifetime risk of diffuse
      gastric cancer (30-70%). Screening upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, even with multiple
      random biopsies, misses signet ring cell cancer foci. Invasive cancers can thus go
      undetected. There is therefore a recommendation of total risk-reducing gastrectomy, at least
      in carriers with a family history of gastric cancer. Novel screening strategies are needed.
      In this pilot project, we will perform liquid biopsies of both blood and gastric fluid in
      asymptomatic carriers who refuse gastrectomy and in controls. We aim to show that somatic
      mutations in a panel of genes involved in gastric cancer and methylation profiles are
      detected in a subset of carriers, and not in controls. These could be indicative of invasive
      cancer undetected by endoscopy, and would thus be a strong argument for risk-reducing
      gastrectomy. On the contrary, in the absence of somatic mutations in liquid biopsies,
      endoscopic surveillance could continue.
