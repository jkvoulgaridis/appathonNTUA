  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study protocol was designed to establish the feasibility of conducting a motor control
      exercise program with pregnant women presenting a history of lumbopelvic pain (LBPP) in order
      to reduce LBPP occurrence or limit its intensity. This randomized controlled trial also aims
      to preliminary assess the effectiveness of the program. To do so, 40 pregnant women with a
      history of LBPP will be recruited and randomly allocated to one of 2 groups: control (20
      participants) or intervention (20 participants). The control group will receive standard
      care, including basic information on what to do when suffering from LBPP. The intervention
      group will participate in a weekly 40-minute group session and two more 40-minute weekly home
      exercise sessions. The motor control exercise program will be designed to target
      strengthening of the lumbo-pelvic-hip core muscles in order to improve stabilization and
      protection of the spine and pelvis. Participants of this group will also receive standard
      care. Adequate prevention and treatment of LBPP, experienced by women during pregnancy,
      should help reduce LBPP occurrence or limit its intensity during pregnancy.
