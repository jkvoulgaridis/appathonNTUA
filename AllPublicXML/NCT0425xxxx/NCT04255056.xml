      Pathological complete remission (pCR) after neoadjuvant therapy in HER2-positive early breast
      cancer patients is closely related to disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS),
      which makes pCR an important evaluation indicator of recurrence risk. Trastuzumab combined
      with pertuzumab is a new standard targeted treatment regimen for HER2-positive early breast
      cancer. However, there are still quite a few patients who do not reach PCR. For these
      patients, current guidelines recommend the use of TDM-1 for intensive treatment after
      surgery, although a significant number of patients still have recurrence or metastasis.
      Besides, TDM-1 is unavailable in China. Pyrotinib has been approved for HER2-positive breast
      cancer patients who have previously failed after the treatment of trastuzumab. The
      investigators intend to conduct this phase II clinical study. Patients with poor response to
      the standard neoadjuvant treatment regimen of trastuzumab combined with pertuzumab are
      enrolled. These patients receive pyrotinib to observe that whether pCR has been improved. The
      investigators aim to explore the effect of pyrotinib in patients with poor response to
      standard dual-target neoadjuvant therapy, and further explore the improvement of neoadjuvant
      treatment strategy in HER2 positive early stage breast cancer patients.

    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most common malignant tumor in Chinese women, with 20% to 30% HER2
      overexpression. Pathological complete remission (pCR) after neoadjuvant therapy in
      HER2-positive early stage breast cancer patients is closely related to disease-free survival
      (DFS) and overall survival (OS), which makes pCR an important evaluation indicator of
      recurrence risk. Trastuzumab combined with pertuzumab is a new standard targeted treatment
      regimen for HER2-positive early breast cancer, with overall pCR rate of 57% to 66%. However,
      there are still quite a few patients who do not reach PCR after treatment in clinical
      practice. For patients who do not reach pCR with neoadjuvant therapy, current guidelines
      recommend the use of TDM-1 for intensive treatment after surgery, but even with TDM-1, a
      significant number of patients still have recurrence or metastasis. Besides, TDM-1 is
      currently unavailable in China. Pyrotinib has been approved for HER2-positive breast cancer
      patients who have previously failed after the treatment of trastuzumab. The investigators
      intend to conduct this single-arm, single-center phase II clinical study. Patients with poor
      response to the standard neoadjuvant treatment regimen of trastuzumab combined with
      pertuzumab are enrolled. These patients receive pyrotinib to observe that whether pCR has
      been improved after the replacement of targeted treatment regimen. The investigators aim to
      explore the effect of pyrotinib in patients with poor response to standard dual-target
      neoadjuvant therapy, and further explore the improvement of neoadjuvant treatment strategy in
      HER2 positive early stage breast cancer patients.
