  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the difference of deep and superficial serratus anterior plane block on
      intraoperative opioid consumption, emergence time and hemodynamic stability in patients
      undergoing video-assisted thoracic surgery.

    <textblock>
      Thoracotomy is known as one of the most painful surgery. Thus, there is a development to
      reduce surgical stress in terms of operation technique, which is video-assisted thoracoscopic
      surgery. Although it has reduced postoperative pain and complications compared with
      thoracotomy, VATS is still quite painful operation. Serratus plane block is a novel technique
      which provide analgesic effect for lateral chest wall by blocking lateral branch of
      intercostal nerve. Two methods were proposed to target the top and bottom of the serratus
      anterior muscle. However, the difference of deep and superficial serratus anterior plane
      block during intraoperative period has not yet been studied.

      In this study, therefore, the investigators decided to assess the difference of deep and
      superficial serratus anterior plane block on intraoperative opioid consumption, emergence
      time and hemodynamic stability in patients undergoing video-assisted thoracic surgery.
