    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human, dose escalation trial of an anti-CD47 antibody. The major aims of
      the study are to define the safety profile of this new drug, and to determine a recommended
      dose and schedule for potential additional trials. This study The study is composed of 3
      stages: Part 1 low dose group, and Part 2 high dose group. Part 3 pharmacodynamic (PD)/ dose
      expansion cohort will open after the completion of Part 1 and 2.
