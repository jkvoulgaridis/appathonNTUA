    <textblock>
      This study involves pilot testing a newly developed diabetes nutrition education program for
      American Indian and Alaska Native adults with T2D. The first phase of this study (COMIRB
      Protocol 18-006) included a qualitative needs assessment to inform the development of this
      program. The Study Aims include: piloting the newly adapted program at 6 AI/AN collaborating
      sites to gain feedback on satisfaction, likability, usability and clinical outcomes such as
      HgA1C (measure of blood sugar control), blood pressure, and body mass index (BMI).

    <time_frame>3 months for immediate intervention group 6 months for wait list control group</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will have 2 A1C checks for Immediate intervention and 3 for wait list control. Immediate will have A1C tested at baseline and after the 5th class (at 3 months from baseline). Wait list will have A1C checked baseline, immediately before class #1 (3 months after baseline) and after class #5 (6 months after baseline). A1C will be checked per standard of care at the clinical site</description>

    <description>Participants will have 3 BP checks for Immediate intervention and 5 for wait list control. Immediate will have BP tested at baseline, after the 4th class, and after the 5th class (at 3 months from baseline). Wait list will have BP checked baseline, immediately before class #1 (3 months after baseline), 1 month after baseline, after class #4, and after class #5 (6 months after baseline). Blood pressure will be checked per standard of care at the clinical site.</description>

    <description>Participants will have 3 weight checks for Immediate intervention and 5 for wait list control. Immediate will have weight tested at baseline, after the 4th class, and after the 5th class (at 3 months from baseline). Wait list will have weight checked baseline, at one month of wait list, immediately before class #1 (3 months after baseline), after class #4, and after class #5 (6 months after baseline). Weight will be checked per standard of care at the clinical site.</description>

Immediate intervention participants will take the survey 3 times (baseline, after class 4, after class 5). Wait list control participants will take the survey 5 times (baseline, at 1 month after baseline wait list, immediately before class #1, after class #4, after class #5)</description>
