      The study will assess the prevalence of mental health problems among different athletes. The
      study is based on the application of the battery of psychodiagnostic questionnaires, which
      were chosen aiming at investigating the prevalence of different symptoms related to problems
      in mental health or disorders.

      This descriptive cross-sectional study will undertake sample with athletes categorized by the
      quality of their achievement.

      In the field of sports, there is a lot of knowledge about sports injuries, nutrition and
      regeneration. Much less is known about mental health among athletes. The investigators often
      think that the incidence of mental problems is low among top athletes. As the main cause of
      this misconception, the authors attribute the idealization of sports and athletes. Both the
      professional and the lay public are often of the opinion that only mentally strong
      individuals can be successful, which of course means that there is no place in the highest
      level for individuals with mental problems and disorders.

      The clinical study will be performed with 400-500 athletes of both genders aged 18 to 40,
      from Slovenia. The investigators will invite all athletes who have been categorized in the
      current year and classified into the membership category, i.e. national, international, world
      or Olympic class (there were 500 at the last categorization) and they compete in various
      sports disciplines. The study will be designed as a cross-sectional study. For the purpose of
      the research, the investigators will use a battery of psychodiagnostic questionnaires
      consisting of five parts: demographics and sport characteristic, depression symptomatic,
      anxiety symptomatic, eating problems, alcohol use and abuse and resilience characteristics of
      individual athlete.
