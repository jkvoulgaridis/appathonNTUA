  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to confirm safety, performance and clinical benefits of the
      ASHCOM Shoulder System and its related instruments by analysis of standard scoring systems,
      radiographs and adverse event records.

      This study is a multicenter, prospective, non-controlled Post-Market Clinical Follow-up study
      involving orthopaedic surgeons skilled in reverse shoulder arthroplasty procedures. A minimum
      of three study centers will be involved. A total number of 97 implants will be included into
      the study.

      The primary endpoint is defined by the survival of the implant at 10 years which is based on
      removal or intended removal of the prosthesis and will be determined using Kaplan Meier
      method. The safety of the system will be assessed by monitoring the frequency and incidence
      of adverse events.

      The secondary endpoint is defined by the performance and clinical benefits of the ASHCOM
      Shoulder System at 5 years, which is assessed by the Constant and Murley score. Assessments
      of the overall pain, functional performance, survival, quality of life and radiographic
      parameters of all enrolled study subjects will be evaluated in addition.

    <description>The secondary endpoint of this study is defined by the performance and clinical benefits of the ASHCOM Shoulder System at 5 years, which is assessed by the Constant and Murley score.
The Constant and Murley score is a 100-point functional shoulder assessment tool in which higher scores reflect increased function. The subjective variables are pain (15 points) and function (activities of daily living - sleep, work, recreation/sport; 20 points), for a total of 35 points. The objective variables are active range of motion (clinician assessment; 40 points) and strength (25 points), for a total of 65 points.</description>
