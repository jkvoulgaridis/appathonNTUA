    <textblock>
      To find high sensitivity and specificity biomarkers to better diagnose and monitor
      progression of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In this study, we try to find miRNAs that
      can used to diagnose or monitor progression of IBD by exploring differential expression of
      miRNAs in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis
      and healthy controls. And we further validate these miRNAs in a larger population to assess
      their function as biomarkers.

    <textblock>
      Incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been rising in the past decades. However,
      diagnosis and differential diagnosis of IBD still lack gold standard. To diagnose IBD,
      physicians need to combine clinical manifestation, lab results, image examination, endoscopy
      examination and pathology. After diagnosis, patients still need to monitor their disease
      progression. The most accurate way is to do endoscopy examination, however, endoscopy
      examination is an invasive, expensive and uncomfortable procedure. At present, C-reactive
      protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and fecal calprotectin are used as main
      noninvasive biomarkers to monitor progression routinely. But their specificities are still
      unsatisfactory. So, it's urgent to find high sensitivity and specificity biomarkers to better
      diagnose and monitor progression of IBD. In this study, we try to find miRNAs that can used
      to diagnose or monitor progression of IBD by exploring differential expression of miRNAs in
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and
      healthy controls. And we further validate these miRNAs in a larger population to assess their
      function as biomarkers.

    <description>Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) has been developed to assess whether or not the pathology of Crohn's disease is progressing.
The index is the sum of 8 components, to each of which is assigned a specific weight. &lt;150 suggests remission, 151-219 suggests mild activity, 220-450 suggests moderate activity, &gt;450 suggests severe activity</description>

    <description>The full Mayo Score evaluates ulcerative colitis stage, based on four parameters: stool frequency, rectal bleeding, endoscopic evaluation and Physician's global assessment.
Each parameter of the score ranges from zero (normal or inactive disease) to 3 (severe activity).
0-2 suggests remission, 3-5 suggests mild activity,6-10 suggests moderate activity, &gt;10 suggests severe activity</description>
