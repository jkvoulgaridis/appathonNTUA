  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims at optimizing extended management of elderly patients (&gt; 75 years) with at
      least one of the known bleeding risk factor, who suffered from first episode of venous
      thromboembolism of the lower extremity (proximal deep vein thrombosis with or without
      pulmonary embolism) (VTE). Patients were randomized to receive three different treatment:
      Sulodexide 250 mg BIS in die; Sulodexide 500 BID in die or indistinguishable placebo to
      verify the efficacy and safety of extended treatment for 12 months with Sulodexide (Vessel®)
      in the secondary prevention of Deep Vein Thrombosis / Pulmonary Embolism (DVT/PE) recurrence.

      This prospective cohort study aims to assess the efficacy and safety of the extended
      treatment with Sulodexide (Vessel®) in the secondary prevention of DVT / PE recurrence in
      elderly outpatients (≥ 75 years old at the time of inclusion) ), with at least one of the
      known bleeding risk factor, who had a first episode of lower extremity proximal DVT and / or
      PE, idiopathic or associated with weak or removed risk factors, and who have received
      standard treatment with any oral anticoagulant drug lasting at least 3 months. The study
      seeks to verify the safety of the Sulodexide therapy, demonstrating non-inferiority compared
      to placebo, with an incidence of major bleeding around 1% (upper confidence limit not &gt; 3%).
