  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a rare and fatal neurodegenerative disorder. The pathologic
      hallmark is the accumulation of aggregated alpha-synuclein in oligodendrocytes forming glial
      cytoplasmic inclusions. Some symptomatic treatments are available while disease-modification
      remains an unmet treatment need. Post-mortem findings suggest insulin resistance, i.e.
      reduced insulin signaling, in the brains of MSA patients. The aim of this study is to
      complete the target validation of insulin resistance for future treatment trials.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple system atrophy (MSA) patients have a poor prognosis with a median survival ranging
      between 6 and 10 years. MSA belongs to the synucleinopathies, which are characterized by the
      abnormal accumulation of alpha-synuclein. We have recently shown brain insulin resistance
      (i.e. reduced insulin signaling) in post-mortem brain tissue of MSA patients and transgenic
      MSA mice, as illustrated by increased protein levels of insulin receptor substrate-1
      phosphorylated at serine 312 (IRS-1pS312). Additionally, exendin-4, an approved anti-diabetic
      drug targeting glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptors, was capable of decreasing brain
      levels of IRS-1pS312 and preserving dopamine neurons in transgenic MSA mice. We further
      observed an inverse correlation between plasma neural-derived exosomal IRS-1pS312 levels and
      survival of dopamine neurons in transgenic MSA mice.

      The aim of this study is to further characterize peripheral and central insulin resistance in
      MSA patients, thereby validating this target for future treatment trials. For this purpose,
      fasting blood glucose and insulin levels will be determined in samples of MSA patients and
      healthy controls for a homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA).
      Additionally, IRS-1pS312 will be measured in neural-derived plasma exosomes of MSA patients
      and healthy controls.
