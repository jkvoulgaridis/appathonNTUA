    <textblock>
      The investigators performed a randomised controlled trial with 202 healthy university
      students in the Oslo area, with 50:50 in a yoga intervention group and a waitlist control
      group. Measures included symptoms of depression and anxiety, sleep problems, heart rate
      variability (HRV), well-being and mindfulness at week 0 (baseline), week 12
      (post-intervention) and week 24 (follow-up).

      Universities around the world are facing an epidemic of mental health problems among their
      students. The problem is truly a public health issue, affecting many and with serious
      consequences. Moreover, the global burden of disease-agenda calls for effective interventions
      with lasting effects that have the potential to improve the mental health of young adults. In
      this study the investigators aimed to determine whether yoga, a popular and widely available
      mind-body practice, can improve student mental health.

      The participants were randomly assigned to a yoga group or waitlist control group in a 1:1
      ratio by a simple online randomisation program. The intervention group was offered 24 yoga
      sessions over 12 weeks. Measurements were taken at week 0 (baseline), week 12
      (post-intervention), and week 24 (follow-up). The primary outcome was psychological distress
      assessed by the HSCL-25 questionnaire. Analysis was performed based on the intention to
      treat-principle.

      The methods were laid out in a protocol, previously published on the website of the study.
      (available at http://yogastudy.tilda.ws/). The planned analyses were very straightforward and
      included a description of the study participants, and simple analyses of each of the a priori
      selected outcome measures. We have not included or excluded any variables post-hoc.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Psychological Distress</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0 (baseline), week 12 (post-intervention) and week 24 (follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>Measured with the Hopkins Symptom Checklist 25 (HSCL-25) questionnaire. Consists of 25 items on symptoms of depression and anxiety, each rated on a 1 (not at all) to 4 (very much) scale. Total scores range from 1 to 4, a higher score indicating more psychological distress.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Heart Rate Variability (HRV)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0 (baseline) and week 12 (post-intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Measured with nocturnal RMSSD (root mean square of successive differences), which is a validated measure of activity in the parasympathetic part of the autonomic nervous system. In general, an increase in RMSSD is associated with increased parasympathetic system activity and less distress.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Mental Well-being</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0 (baseline), week 12 (post-intervention) and week 24 (follow-up).</time_frame>
    <description>Measured with the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (WEMWBS), a 14-item Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (WEMWBS). This scale has five response categories (from &quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;all the time&quot;) that are added together to produce a total score ranging from 14 to 70. Higher scores indicate higher levels of mental well-being.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Life Satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>week 0 (baseline), week 12 (post-intervention) and week 24 (follow-up).</time_frame>
    <description>Measured with the Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS), a 5-item questionnaire. Items are scored on a 1- to 7-point Likert scale. The total score is computed by adding all response values (ranging from 5 to 35), with higher scores indicating higher satisfaction.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Mindfulness</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0 (baseline), week 12 (post-intervention) and week 24 (follow-up).</time_frame>
    <description>Mindful Attention Awareness Scale, MAAS, a 15-item scale. The total score was computed by adding the score value on all individual items, producing a total score ranging from 15 to 75, with higher scores indicating higher levels of mindfulness.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Sleep Problems</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0 (baseline), week 12 (post-intervention) and week 24 (follow-up).</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators used the Bergen Insomnia Scale (BIS), a 6-item scale. Scores from 0 (no bad nights during the course of a week) to 7 (all nights) give a total score ranging from 0 to 42 (higher scores indicating more troubled sleep and daytime tiredness).</description>
