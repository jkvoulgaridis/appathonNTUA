  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether daily treatment with intermittent
      pneumatic leg compressions (IPC) following a nonsurgical vascular procedure improves
      circulation and enhances walking distance.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Restenosis following revascularization procedures occur frequently and as early as 3 months
      after the intervention. There is an urgent need for adjunctive therapies that aid in the
      improvement of tissue blood flow and consequently relieve pain and improve functional
      capacity in these patients. It has been previously shown that exposure to IPC enhances leg
      blood flow to collateral-dependent tissues. In this study, subjects who have undergone
      nonsurgical revascularization will be randomly assigned to two groups: IPC or placebo pump.
      Subjects will receive a commercially available IPC device (Art Assist, ACI Medical, San
      Marcos, CA) and will apply the treatment at home for 2 hours daily over 3 consecutive months.
      At 3 time points (pre, 1 and 3 months post procedure) assessments will be performed
      (hemodynamics, rest pain, calf muscle oxygenation during exercise, walking endurance and
      quality of life).
