  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immersive Virtual Reality is a fast developing technology that allows a number of
      opportunities to engage people in activities that they otherwise might find difficult. For
      instance exercising in a fun way when they have difficulty exercising in the way they
      previously enjoyed. Alternatively the immersive nature of the experience might make it easier
      to engage in tasks in an otherwise distracting world.

      The investigators are interested in exploring how Virtual Reality games and programs can help
      people with Chronic Pain. Working with Researchers at Sheffield Hallam University the
      research team introduced Virtual Reality headsets and games to people engaging in a Pain
      Management Program Group lasting 6 weeks for 3 hours a week. This involved NHS patients in
      the UK, delivered by a physiotherapist and an occupational therapist. This group involved 8
      individuals with a variety of chronic pain conditions. Patients used Virtual Reality headsets
      and games throughout the program to aid exercise and mindfulness activities.

      This is a relatively new approach and the investigators are not aware of any other
      organisations making use of this technology in this way. It would be useful developing its
      use to explore the issues those leading the Pain Management Group and supporting patients
      found. Speaking to these individuals in interviews will explore their experiences and
      feelings deeply and allow us to learn about what worked well and what challenges they faced.
      These interviews would be conducted in a format of qualitative research that would explore
      the experiences staff had, and compare it to other experiences of introducing patient-used
      technology in healthcare.

      This is a new technology and form of clinical treatment. As such it is not possible to draw
      on existing literature to give a hypothesis. Rather this research will aim to help form new
      understanding of this developing technological approach. Subsequently a qualitative approach
      is best to gain an indepth and detailed understanding of the experiences of the clincians who
      delivered Virtual Reality in a chronic pain group structure. In the group, around 8 patients
      with Chronic, non-cancer pain were given the opportunity to use a range of programs; demos
      for commercially available computer games, a virtual natural world to support use of
      mindfulness approaches, and a program developed for us by Sheffield Hallam University
      involving climbing and bow and arrow components.

      Individual semi-structured interviews will allow the researchers to focus on aspects of the
      delivery of the technology and how it might be improved in the future. It will also give the
      freedom to respond to the participating clinicians and explore previously unanticipated
      issues or views.

      The Pain Management Program Group runs over 6 weeks. Exercise components and mindfulness
      makes up part of each session and is normally led by the clinician. They are largely made up
      of educational components that will be led as normal. In these Virtual Reality Pain
      Management Groups the exercise component will be replaced by active games in a virtual
      reality environment. This will involve a range of games that engage the patient to move their
      upper-limbs and trunk. The mindfulness component will place the patient in the immersive
      digital environment and then encourage them to engage with it by making use of conventional
      mindfulness exercises.

      At a date following the completion of the group, the staff leading the group will be involved
      in a single semi-structured interview lasting around 30 minutes. Participants will be asked
      about how they found using Virtual Reality technology in a Pain Management Group, what issues
      arose that they had to overcome and how they think the sessions need to be developed in the
      future. Interviews will take place during clinic times over the telephone. Time will be
      allowed so that staff can take part in these interviews. The interviewer will be another
      member of staff at the same organisation who has not been involved in the delivery of the
      Virtual Reality technology. They are also the chief investigator.

      The interviews will be recorded directly onto a secure laptop (password protected encryption)
      and the recordings will be stored on a secure server in a password protected file. It will be
      transcribed and analysed in Microsoft Word using a thematic approach. This will then be
      transferred to the Sheffield Hallam University Data Archive following analysis.

      Confirmation of the themes identified and outcomes of the qualitative research will be
      reviewed with the interviewed clinicians. This will attempt to address researcher bias and
      ensure that participants recognise the issues raised by the research.
