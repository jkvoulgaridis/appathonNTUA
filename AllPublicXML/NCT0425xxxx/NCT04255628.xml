  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer pain deteriorated in quality of life and related with numerous psychosocial problems.
      Over the one third of cancer patient suffered from moderate to severe cancer pain, even under
      adequate pain management.

      The 18F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT)
      images can provide quantitative results in clinical oncology. As a functional neuroimaging,
      the PET evidently provided anatomical activated regions, size, and spatial extent
      information. In this study, we use FDG-PET to investigate changes concerning the glucose
      metabolism in the brain with or without cancer pain. Therefore, we may provide useful
      information to treatment target in cancer pain patients.

      Overall, cancer incidence has decreased and the rate of cancer deaths in both men and women
      has also significantly declined among both men and women in all site.However, the prevalence
      of chronic pain is 28.2%, ranging from 22.5% to 35.4%, depending on the location of the
      primary tumor, and neuropathic characteristics were observed in 19.9% of patients with
      chronic cancer pain.

      Despite numerous studies on cancer pathogenesis and diagnosis, few reports have demonstrated
      the brain mechanism underlying cancer pain. One study used resting functional magnetic
      resonance imaging (fMRI) to identify the changes in the functional brain network of chronic
      bone cancer pain mice under anesthesia. Cancer-induced bone pain (CIBP) might alter resting
      state activity of the cingulate cortex, prefrontal cortex (PFC) and ventral striatum,
      indicating a strong affective component of the CIBP mice.In imaging studies of human patients
      with cancer, patients with chronic cancer pain exhibited activation in the PFC.

      The 18F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT)
      images can provide quantitative results in clinical oncology.Owing to the higher glucose
      metabolic rate in the brain, brain FDG-PET images are not routinely used in the clinical
      setting. However, several studies have demonstrated functional brain changes in human pain
      condition.In this study, we use FDG-PET to investigate changes concerning the glucose
      metabolism in the brain with or without cancer pain.
