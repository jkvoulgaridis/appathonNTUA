  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) are a significant contributor to adult and childhood
      obesity. Policies to place health warning labels on sugar-sweetened beverages are being
      pursued, but there is little empirical data on how such labels influence people. The proposed
      research will evaluate the impact of different types of sugar-sweetened beverage warning
      labels relative to standard calorie labels on the purchasing and consumption behaviors of
      parents and children.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this proposal is to determine, before wide-scale implementation, to
      what degree SSB warning labels increase consumers' knowledge about the potential health harms
      of SSBs and reduce SSB intake. The study is designed to answer two additional questions: 1)
      Do some warning labels work better than others? 3) If warning labels influence behavior, is
      it because they increase knowledge or simply provide a salient reminder that some drinks are
      less healthy? This aim is designed to test the effect of warning labels on total kilocalories
      (kcals) purchased and consumed by parents and children. We will examine how SSB warning
      labels influence snack and beverage purchases and intake among 405 racially and ethnically
      diverse parent-child pairs.

    <intervention_model_description>This randomized, controlled lab-based study will capture beverage and snack purchases from a concession stand and measure how much participants consume while watching a television show. Participants will be randomized to 1 of 3 groups: 1) calorie labels (control); 2) text warning labels; or 3) graphic warning labels displaying amounts of sugar.</intervention_model_description>
