      Background:

        -  Arterial Calcifications due to Deficiency in CD73 (ACDC) is a rare genetic disease.
           People with ACDC develop calcium deposits in the arteries and joints of the fingers,
           wrists, ankles and feet. These deposits cause severe pain in the hands and feet, even
           when the person is at rest, and may lead to loss of the affected hand or foot.
           Currently, there are no standard treatments for ACDC.

        -  Etidronate is a drug that helps to slow or stop the natural process that dissolves bone
           tissue. It is approved to treat Paget s disease, a condition in which the bones are soft
           and weak and may be deformed, painful, or easily broken. It is also used to treat high
           blood calcium levels. Researchers want to see if it can be used to treat the symptoms of
           ACDC and improve pain and blood flow in the hands and feet.

      Objectives:

      - To see if etridronate is a safe and effective treatment for ACDC.

      Eligibility:

      - People between 18 and 80 years of age who have been diagnosed with ACDC.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will also
           have imaging studies, including x-rays and DEXA bone scans, before starting treatment.
           Blood and urine samples will be collected. An exercise tolerance test will also be
           given.

        -  Participants will take etridronate by mouth once a day for 14 days every 3 months. They
           will be assigned an individualized 6-month drug schedule to follow. Participants should
           not eat foods that are high in calcium for at least 2 hours after taking the study drug.

        -  Participants will have regular study visits throughout the treatment period. These
           visits will involve imaging studies, full dental exams, and blood and urine tests.
           Participants will also have exercise tolerance tests and arm and leg blood pressure
           tests to measure pain and blood flow.

        -  Participants may also provide tissue samples for further study.

        -  Treatment will continue for up to 3 years as long as the side effects are not severe and
           the condition does not become worse. Participants will have a final follow-up visit
           after stopping treatment.

    <textblock>
      We have recently identified a novel genetic disease affecting nine known adults in whom de
      novo vascular calcifications develop in the lower extremity arteries and juxta-articular
      joint capsules of the fingers, wrists, ankles and feet. This rare disease results from
      bi-allelic mutations in the gene ecto-5-prime-nucleotidase (NT5E), encoding the CD73 protein.
      CD73, an enzyme involved in the extracellular ATP metabolic pathway, converts extracellular
      AMP to adenosine and inorganic phosphate. The clinical symptoms of this rare disease, termed
      ACDC (Arterial Calcifications due to Deficiency in CD73), include claudication of the calves,
      thighs, and buttocks, chronic ischemic pain of the feet at rest with threat of potential limb
      loss, and debilitating rheumatoid pain in the wrists and hands. Radiological and histological
      evaluations do not resemble classic atherosclerotic vascular calcification, since the
      calcification and dysplasia in ACDC occur in the medial portion of the arterial blood vessel
      wall. Data from patient-specific cell lines indicate increased activity of tissue
      non-specific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP), a key mediator of pathological ectopic tissue
      calcification, and thus reveals a potential therapeutic target.

      To date, no effective therapy exists for ACDC patients. However, since bisphosphonates are
      potent competitive inhibitors of TNAP activity and are widely used to modulate bone
      metabolism, they may beneficially alter vascular calcification. In addition, our preliminary
      in vitro studies demonstrate the effectiveness of etidronate, a nitrogen-containing
      bisphosphonate, in lowering TNAP activity in cells isolated from ACDC patients. Etidronate,
      and bisphophonates in general, have proven safe and well tolerated by most patients.

      This protocol provides for the administration of etidronate to ACDC patients, for whom no
      alternative treatment is available. Patients will be examined at the NIH Clinical Center
      bi-annually for 3 years. The primary objective of this clinical study is to test the
      effectiveness of etidronate in attenuating the progression of lower extremity arterial
      calcification and vascular blood flow based on CT calcium score and Ankle brachial index
      (ABI).

    <description>This trial is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of etidronate in subjects diagnosed with ACDC. The primary endpoints will be CT calcium score and Ankle- brachial Index (ABI). The planned analyses will include descriptive statistics and longitudinal trends in the CT calcium score and ABI. Percentage changes in CT calcium score and ABI will be compared between the pre-treatment phase baseline and treatment phase. The significance of the changes will be reported with the use of t-test or rank-based test as appropriate.</description>
