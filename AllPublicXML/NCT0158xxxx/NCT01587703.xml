  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is divided into two parts; Part 1 of the study is a dose escalation phase to
      select the recommended dose for Part 2 based on the safety, pharmacokinetic, and
      pharmacodynamic profiles observed after oral administration of GSK525762 in the following
      subjects: NMC, small cell lung cancer (SCLC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), colorectal
      cancer (CRC), neuroblastoma (NB), castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), triple
      negative breast cancer (TNBC), estrogen receptor positive (ER positive) breast cancer, and
      MYCN driven solid tumor subjects. Part 2 of the study will explore the safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and clinical activity of the recommended dose from Part 1
      in cohorts comprised of NMC, small cell lung cancer (SCLC), castration resistant prostate
      cancer (CRPC), triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), and estrogen receptor positive (ER
      positive) breast cancer subjects. Approximately 60 subjects will be enrolled in the Part 1
      and approximately 150 subjects will be enrolled in Part 2. A sub-study will be opened in Part
      1 to approximately 10-12 subjects in the United States to investigate the relative
      bioavailability of the besylate tablet compared to the amorphous free-base tablet at the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase 2 dosing (RP2D), the effect of high-fat
      high-calorie meal on the bioavailability of the besylate tablet at the MTD or RP2D and the
      dose proportionality of 2 doses of GSK525762 administered as besylate tablet.

        <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: results in death; is life-threatening; requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in disability/incapacity; is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; important medical events that may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes mentioned; events of possible study treatment-induced liver injury with hyperbilirubinemia; any new primary cancers; significant cardiac dysfunction; Grade 4 laboratory abnormalities; and drug related hepatobiliary event leading to permanent discontinuation of study treatment. All Treated Population comprised of all participants who received at least one dose of study treatment.</description>

        <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: results in death; is life-threatening; requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in disability/incapacity; is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; important medical events that may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes mentioned; events of possible study treatment-induced liver injury with hyperbilirubinemia; any new primary cancers; significant cardiac dysfunction; Grade 4 laboratory abnormalities; and drug related hepatobiliary event leading to permanent discontinuation of study treatment</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Grade Change From Baseline in Clinical Chemistry Data-Part 1 QD</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected for the analysis of: glucose, albumin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), amylase, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), direct bilirubin (Dir bil), bilirubin, N-Terminal proB-type natriuretic peptide (NT-BNP), calcium, cholesterol, creatine kinase (CK), chloride, carbon dioxide (CO2), creatinine, gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), high and low density lipoprotein (HDL and LDL), insulin, potassium, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), lipase, magnesium, protein, sodium, thyroxine, testosterone, triglycerides, troponin I and T, urate and urea. Grading was done according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) version 4.0. Grade 1: mild; Grade 2: moderate; Grade 3: severe or medically significant; Grade 4: life-threatening consequences; Grade 5: death. Baseline is the most recent, non-missing value prior to or on first study treatment dose date. Data for worst case post-Baseline is presented.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Grade Change From Baseline in Clinical Chemistry Data-Part 1 BID</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected for the analysis of clinical chemistry parameters: glucose, albumin, ALP, ALT, amylase, AST, Dir bil, bilirubin, NT-BNP, calcium, cholesterol, CK, chloride, CO2, creatinine, GGT, HDL and LDL cholesterol, insulin, potassium, LDH, lipase, magnesium, protein, sodium, thyroxine, testosterone, triglycerides, troponin I and T, urate and urea. Laboratory parameters were graded according to NCI-CTCAE version 4.0. Grade 1: mild; Grade 2: moderate; Grade 3: severe or medically significant; Grade 4: life-threatening consequences; Grade 5: death. Baseline is the most recent, non-missing value prior to or on the first study treatment dose date. Data for worst-case post-Baseline is presented.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Grade Change From Baseline in Clinical Chemistry Data-Part 2</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected for the analysis of clinical chemistry parameters: glucose, albumin, ALP, ALT, amylase, AST, Dir bil, bilirubin, NT-BNP, calcium, cholesterol, CK, chloride, CO2, creatinine, GGT, HDL and LDL cholesterol, insulin, potassium, LDH, lipase, magnesium, protein, sodium, thyroxine, testosterone, triglycerides (triglyc), troponin I and T, urate and urea. Laboratory parameters were graded according to NCI-CTCAE version 4.0. Grade 1: mild; Grade 2: moderate; Grade 3: severe or medically significant; Grade 4: life-threatening consequences; Grade 5: death. Baseline is the most recent, non-missing value prior to or on the first study treatment dose date. Data for worst-case post-Baseline is presented.</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected for the analysis of clinical chemistry parameters: glucose, albumin, ALP, ALT, amylase, AST, Dir bil, bilirubin, NT-BNP, calcium, cholesterol, CK, chloride, CO2, creatinine, GGT, HDL and LDL cholesterol, insulin, potassium, LDH, lipase, magnesium, protein, sodium, thyroxine, testosterone, triglycerides, troponin I and T, urate and urea. Laboratory parameters were graded according to NCI-CTCAE version 4.0. Grade 1: mild; Grade 2: moderate; Grade 3: severe or medically significant; Grade 4: life-threatening consequences; Grade 5: death. Baseline is the most recent, non-missing value prior to or on the first study treatment dose date. Data for worst case post-Baseline is presented.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Grade Change From Baseline in Hematology Data-Part 1 QD</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected for the analysis of hematology parameters: activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), platelet count, red blood cell count (RBC), white blood cell count (WBC), prothrombin international normalized ratio (INR), prothrombin time (PT), fibrinogen (Fib), hemoglobin, neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils and basophils. Laboratory parameters were graded according to NCI-CTCAE version 4.0. Grade 1: mild; Grade 2: moderate; Grade 3: severe or medically significant; Grade 4: life-threatening consequences; Grade 5: death. Baseline is the most recent, non-missing value prior to or on the first study treatment dose date. Data for worst case post-Baseline is presented.</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected for the analysis of hematology parameters: aPTT, platelet count, RBC, WBC, INR, PT, Fib, hemoglobin, neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils and basophils. Laboratory parameters were graded according to NCI-CTCAE version 4.0. Grade 1: mild; Grade 2: moderate; Grade 3: severe or medically significant; Grade 4: life-threatening consequences; Grade 5: death. Baseline is the most recent, non-missing value prior to or on the first study treatment dose date. Data for worst case post-Baseline is presented.</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected for the analysis of hematology parameters: aPTT, platelet count, RBC, WBC, INR, PT, Fib, hemoglobin, neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils and basophils. Laboratory parameters were graded according to NCI-CTCAE version 4.0. Grade 1: mild; Grade 2: moderate; Grade 3: severe or medically significant; Grade 4: life-threatening consequences; Grade 5: death. Baseline is the most recent, non-missing value prior to or on the first study treatment dose date. Data for worst case post-Baseline is presented.</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected for the analysis of hematology parameters: aPTT, platelet count, RBC, WBC, INR, PT, Fib, hemoglobin, neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils and basophils. Laboratory parameters were graded according to NCI-CTCAE version 4.0. Grade 1: mild; Grade 2: moderate; Grade 3: severe or medically significant; Grade 4: life-threatening consequences; Grade 5: death. Baseline is the most recent, non-missing value prior to or on the first study treatment dose date. Data for worst case post-Baseline is presented.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Increase in Blood Pressure From Baseline-Besylate Sub-study</title>
        <description>SBP and DBP were measured in a supine or semi-recumbent position after at least 5 minutes rest for the participant. Grading of SBP and DBP were done using NCI-CTCAE version 4.0 where, SBP (millimeters of mercury): Grade 0 (&lt;120), Grade 1 (120-139), Grade 2 (140-159), Grade 3/4 (&gt;=160) and DBP: Grade 0 (&lt;80), Grade 1 (80-89), Grade 2 (90-99), Grade 3/4 (&gt;=100). An increase is defined as an increase in CTCAE grade relative to baseline grade. Baseline is the most recent, non-missing value from a central laboratory prior to or on the first study treatment dose date. Data for worst case post-Baseline is presented.</description>

        <title>Overall Response Rate-Part 1 QD</title>
        <description>Overall response rate is defined as the percentage of participants who achieved a confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) from the start of treatment until disease progression or the start of new anticancer therapy, among participants who received at least 1 dose of treatment. Overall response rate was determined by the investigator according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST version (v) 1.1). CR=Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes must be &lt;10 millimeters (mm) in the short axis. PR=At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as a reference, the Baseline sum of the diameters.</description>

        <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: results in death; is life-threatening; requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in disability/incapacity; is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; important medical events that may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes mentioned; events of possible study treatment-induced liver injury with hyperbilirubinemia; any new primary cancers; significant cardiac dysfunction; Grade 4 laboratory abnormalities; and drug related hepatobiliary event leading to permanent discontinuation of study treatment</description>
