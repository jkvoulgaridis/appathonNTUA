    <textblock>
      This is a feasibility study to assess the effectiveness of cetuximab when administered with
      low dose oral cyclophosphamide. Patients with metastatic squamous cell cancer of head and
      neck who have progressed on first line chemotherapy other than a cetuximab containing regimen
      will be treated with standard of care weekly cetuximab and twice daily low dose oral
      cyclophosphamide for 12 weeks.

    <textblock>
      In this study, patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) will be given
      low-dose cyclophosphamide in combination with standard of care cetuximab. Tumor biopsies will
      be collected before and six weeks after treatment for measurement of tumor infiltration by
      effector cells, including CD8+ T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and monocytes. In
      addition, the proportion of Regulatory T Cells (Tregs) to effector cells will be measured in
      peripheral blood at the same time points.
