  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of vandetanib and everolimus when
      given together in treating patients with cancer that has spread to other places in the body.
      Vandetanib and everolimus may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or highest dose level, and the dose-limiting
      toxicity (DLT) of vandetanib (a multi-kinase inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor
      [EGFR], vascular endothelial growth factor receptor [VEGFR] and ret proto-oncogene [RET]
      inhibitor) when used in combination with everolimus (a mammalian target of rapamycin [mTOR]
      inhibitor) in advanced cancer.

      II. Preliminary descriptive assessment of the anti-tumor efficacy of the combination.

      III. Preliminary optional assessment of the pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic markers of
      target inhibition and correlates of response.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive vandetanib orally (PO) once daily (QD) and everolimus PO QD on days 1-28.
      Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment patients are followed up between 14-28 days at the
      discretion of the treating physician.

    <description>The response rate will be estimated by dose level and tumor type, along with the exact 95% confidence interval. Efficacy will be evaluated by using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria described in the supplement for response.
