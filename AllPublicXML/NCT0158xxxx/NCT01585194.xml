  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well nivolumab and ipilimumab work in treating patients with
      uveal melanoma that has spread to other places in the body (metastatic). Immunotherapy with
      monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab and ipilimumab, may help the body's immune system
      attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Overall response rate.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Progression-free survival. II. Median overall survival. III. One-year overall survival.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Tissue and blood correlates to define immune infiltration and signatures as a result of
      treatment with nivolumab plus ipilimumab.

      OUTLINE:

      INDUCTION PHASE: Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes and ipilimumab
      IV over 90 minutes during weeks 1, 4, 7, and 10. Treatment continues for 12 weeks in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      MAINTENANCE PHASE: Patients not experiencing disease progression or unacceptable toxicity by
      week 12 of the induction phase receive nivolumab IV every 2 weeks. Treatment continues in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 60 days.

             diarrhea

          -  Any non-oncology vaccine therapy used for prevention of infectious diseases (for up to
             1 month before or after any dose of ipilimumab)

             corticosteroids greater than physiologic replacement doses; ocular steroid use is
             acceptable; (a) concomitant palliative radiation for the purposes of symptom
             management is allowed

          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) who: (a) are unwilling or unable to use an
