  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research plan involves two aims: 1) Cultural adaptation of the Panic-Asthma Treatment and
      2) a randomized, placebo-controlled pilot study. Participants will be primarily recruited
      from two major, inner-city hospitals in the Bronx, NY. Diagnosis of Panic Disorder (PD) will
      be based on the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. Diagnosis of asthma will be based
      on national guidelines. The first year of the project will be devoted to approximately 5
      focus groups with Latino (primarily Puerto Rican) participants, pilot treatment and
      participant feedback. The protocol will be adapted based on key cultural issues that are
      systematically observed during Phase 1. During Years 2-3, 40 participants with PD and asthma
      will be randomized into two treatment arms: Panic-Asthma Treatment and an active placebo
      condition involving music therapy and paced breathing at resting respiration rates. Each
      treatment will involve 8 weekly sessions. An interviewer, who will be blind to treatment
      condition, will conduct assessments at pre-treatment, mid-treatment, post-treatment, and
      3-month follow-up. The primary hypotheses are that participants in the Panic-Asthma treatment
      group will have greater decreases than subjects in the placebo condition on the PD severity
      scale and albuterol use (i.e., rescue asthma medication) from pre-test to post-test and
      across 3-month follow-up.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma and panic disorder (PD) share strikingly similar phenomenology. Respiratory related
      symptoms, such as dyspnea, dizziness, chest tightness, feelings of choking and sensations of
      smothering are common in both disorders. The overlap in symptoms between asthma and panic may
      lead an individual to mistake a panic attack as an asthma attack. In order to better
      understand this overlap, we hypothesized that participants who received Cognitive Behavioral
      Psychophysiological Therapy (CBPT) would display greater reductions in PD severity and
      improvements in asthma control at post- treatment and 3-month follow-up. We predicted that
      improvements in PD severity in the CBPT group would be mediated by reductions in the
      perceived physical consequences of anxiety. We selected music therapy and paced breathing at
      each participant's average respiration rate for the comparison active treatment. Randomized
      participants will undergo either the CBPT or MRT protocol, be given the same psychological
      assessments, and have their physiological data collected.

    <measure>Change in severity of panic disorder as measured by the Panic Disorder Severity Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Post-Treatment (end of week 8)</time_frame>
    <description>The Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS) is a clinician-administered questionnaire used to assess the severity of panic attacks. The PDSS consists of seven items with each ranging in severity from 0 (none) - 4 (extreme); so total score ranges from 0 to 28.</description>

    <description>Doser devices are electronic devices used to monitor usage of metered-dose inhalers. Doser devices were attached to quick-relief asthma medication inhalers in order to count the number of puffs of medication used during the treatment period.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Asthma control as measured by the Asthma Control Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Post-Intervention (8 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants are given a self-report questionnaire to assess asthma symptoms, nighttime awakenings, and use of rescue medication for asthma. Each item is given a score from 0 to 6 with lower scores indicating better asthma control.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment responder as measured by Clinical Global Impression Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Post-Intervention (8 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>A 2-item scale rated by clinicians to assess panic disorder illness severity in patients and to identify subjects as treatment responders or not. The question on level of improvement ranges from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse). The question on severity of illness ranges from 1 (normal) to 6 (among the most extremely ill of patients)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adherence to controller medications for asthma as measured by the Medication Adherence Report Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Post-Intervention (8 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Self-report measure of adherence to controller medications with 10 items ranging from 1 (always) to 5 (never). Higher mean scores indicate greater adherence and a score &gt; 4.5 is considered good adherence.</description>
