  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Haemophilia A is an inherited disorder in which one of the proteins, Factor VIII, needed to
      form blood clots is missing or not present in sufficient levels. In a person with haemophilia
      A, the clotting process is slowed and the person experiences bleeds that can result in
      serious problems and potential disability.

      The current standard treatment for severe haemophilia A is regularly scheduled infusion of
      FVIII to keep levels high enough to prevent bleeding. Due to the short half-life of FVIII,
      prophylaxis may require treatment as often as every other day.

      In this trial safety and efficacy of a long-acting recombinant factor VIII molecule is
      evaluated in subjects with severe Hemophilia A.

      120-140 patients will receive open label treatment with long-acting rFVIII either on-demand
      to treat bleeds or prophylactically for 36 weeks in the main trial plus an optional extension
      to continue treatment for at least 100 total exposure days (ED). Patients on prophylactic
      treatment will receive study drug at dosing intervals between once and twice a week depending
      on their observed bleeding. Patients will attend the treatment centre for routine blood
      samples and be required to keep an electronic diary.

      Male patients aged 12-65, with severe hemophilia A, previously treated with FVIII for at
      least 50 exposure days may be eligible for this study.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects in prophylactic treatment arms will undergo clinical evaluation at 10 weeks. Those
      with adequate control of bleeding will undergo randomization to every 5 or 7 day infusion.
      Those with continued bleeding will remain in treatment arm and have an increase in dose.

      Part B-major surgery - optional sub study included to collect information on efficacy of
      BAY94-9027 in major surgical setting. Due to rarity of surgery in this population, enrollment
      to this sub-study may be independent of participation in main study.

    <description>The WPAI is a validated instrument to assess the effect of hemophilia on ability to work, attend classes, and perform regular daily activities in participants aged 12 and above. The WPAI also contained classroom impairment questions (CIQ). The questionnaire was self-administered and comprised of nine questions that elicited information on work, classroom, and daily activity impairment during the previous seven days. WPAI outcomes that are overall work and activity impairment, transformed to impairment percentages (range from 0 to 100), with higher numbers indicating greater impairment and less productivity.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>The study was conducted in 3 parts: Part A (main study [36-week treatment period] and an optional extension [at least 100 total exposure days]) and Part B for major surgeries (up to 3 weeks).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Of 149 participants screened in Part A, 134 were treated, reasons for non-inclusion were screen failure, consent withdrawal, and non-adherence to protocol visit windows. Participants selected either on-demand or prophylaxis treatment at start of study according to their preference. Randomization to prophylaxis arms occurred after week 10.</pre_assignment_details>
      <group_list>
        <group group_id="P1">
          <title>BAY94-9027 On-demand Treatment, Part A</title>
          <description>Participants received on-demand treatment with BAY94-9027 as an intravenous (IV) infusion at a dose as indicated based upon location and severity of bleeds (a maximum of 60 international units per kilogram [IU/kg]). Participants entering extension either continued their on-demand treatment or switched to one of the prophylaxis regimens.</description>
        </group>
        <group group_id="P2">
          <title>BAY94-9027 Prophylaxis Treatment, Part A</title>
          <description>All participants started BAY94-9027 IV infusion, with 2x/week at a dose of 25 IU/kg for 10 weeks. Thereafter, participants with less than 2 spontaneous joint and/or muscle bleeds were randomized 1:1 to either every 5 or every 7 days dosing regimen. High bleeders continued 2x/week infusion (2x/week ‘failed’). Participants qualified to be randomized but enrolled after randomized arms were filled, remained on 2x/week treatment (2x/week ‘forced’ group). Participants entering extension either continued their prophylaxis regimen or switched to one of the other prophylaxis regimens.</description>

          <title>BAY949027 Treatment in Major Surgery, Part B</title>
          <description>Participants who underwent major surgery received study drug during their hospital stay up to 3 weeks post surgery. Participants were treated according to the type of procedure, using tailored doses (a maximum of 60 IU/kg/infusion) expected to maintain acceptable therapeutic level of FVIII activity.</description>

        <title>Number of Surgeries According to Physician's Assessment of Adequacy of Hemostasis in Major Surgery - Part B</title>
        <description>Major surgery was defined as any surgical or invasive procedure (elective or emergent) in which the overall bleeding risk was excessive, required a general anesthetic in an individual without a bleeding disorder, penetrated or exposed a major body cavity, resulted in substantial impairment of physical or physiological functions, or required special anatomic knowledge or manipulative skill. Adequacy of hemostasis was assessed as excellent, good, moderate or poor, by the surgeon or interventionalist during Part B of the study.</description>

        <description>The WPAI is a validated instrument to assess the effect of hemophilia on ability to work, attend classes, and perform regular daily activities in participants aged 12 and above. The WPAI also contained classroom impairment questions (CIQ). The questionnaire was self-administered and comprised of nine questions that elicited information on work, classroom, and daily activity impairment during the previous seven days. WPAI outcomes that are overall work and activity impairment, transformed to impairment percentages (range from 0 to 100), with higher numbers indicating greater impairment and less productivity.</description>
