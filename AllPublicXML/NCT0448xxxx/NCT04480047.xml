  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this Pilot Study is to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the use of
      Tetranite-Stabilization Material (TN-SM) in delivering enhanced stability to immediately
      restored dental implants inserted into fresh extraction sockets, with both clinical and
      patient-related successful outcomes.

      The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a single stage
      approach using Tetranite Stabilization Material (TN-SM). The purpose of the efficacy
      component of this study is a composite comprising: (1) First - To demonstrate and evaluate
      the ability of TN-SM to achieve immediate implant stabilization in sites otherwise unable to
      provide primary stability without requiring the delay in treatment imposed by the current
      multi-staged standard-of-care method; (2) Second - To demonstrate and evaluate the ability of
      TN-SM to achieve sufficient short-term stabilization of implants, as measured by resonance
      frequency analysis, as the device undergoes initial resorption and replacement with new bone;
      (3) Third - To demonstrate the ability of TN-SM to aid in the maintenance of alveolar bone,
      without buccal plate collapse and loss of crestal bone height; and Fourth (4) - To
      demonstrate and evaluate the ability of a TN-SM stabilized implant to achieve implant success
      (after criteria of Buser, et. al 1) after 12 months while the device undergoes significant
      resorption, facilitates osteoconduction, and replacement with new bone. In addition to the
      Primary Endpoints of establishing the Safety and Efficacy of Implant Stabilization and
      Implant Success throughout the initial 12 months of post-functional loading, the study also
      assesses several secondary endpoints over the course of the study and one-year follow-up, as
      outlined in the sections below. These include assessment of incidence, duration, and severity
      of adverse effects and events; assessment of increasing implant stiffness; assessment of bone
      levels, bone volumetric changes; patient satisfaction surveys, and assessment of periodontal
      and peri-implant health integral to implant success.
