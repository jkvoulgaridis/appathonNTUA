  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose of
      fezolinetant and ES259564 (fezolinetant metabolite) in female participants with mild and
      moderate hepatic impairment compared to healthy female participants with normal hepatic
      function.

      This study will also evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single oral dose of
      fezolinetant in female participants with mild and moderate hepatic impairment and healthy
      female participants with normal hepatic function.

    <textblock>
      The study will comprise of three groups based on hepatic function. Participants will be
      screened for up to 28 days prior to investigational product (IP) administration on Day 1.
      Eligible participants will be admitted to the clinical unit on Day -1 and will be residential
      for a single period of six days/five nights. On Day 1, participants will receive a single
      oral dose of fezolinetant under fasting conditions followed by a 96-hour in-house blood and
      urine sampling period. Participants are to remain semirecumbent for four hours postdose.
      Standard safety and tolerability assessments will be conducted. Participants will be
      discharged from the clinical unit on Day 5 on the condition that all required assessments
      have been performed and that there are no medical reasons for a longer stay in the clinical
      unit.

      The study will be completed with an end-of-study visit (ESV). The ESV will take place five to
      nine days after the last pharmacokinetic sample is collected or at the time of early
      discontinuation from the study.
