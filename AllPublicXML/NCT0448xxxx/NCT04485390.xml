  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Emergency medical services (EMS) provide emergency care not only in the urban but also in the
      remote areas which could be up to 40 minutes from the EMS station. Thus, a cardiac arrest
      victim in those remote areas has a low likelihood to survive the cardiopulmonary
      resuscitation. Therefore, we have organized first responders (who are mostly volunteer
      fire-fighters) in the remote areas and taught them how to perform basic life support (BLS)
      with use of an automated external defibrillator (AED). In the case of a cardiac arrest the
      medical dispatcher activates simultaneously the EMS and the first responders, who perform the
      BLS with the use of an AED before the arrival of EMS.

      The aim of the study is to analyze and compare the survival of the cardiac arrest victims in
      remote areas in the time period when the first responders were not organized yet compared to
      the time period when the first responders were activated to perform BLS.
