  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to recent studies, patients following craniotomy suffer more than minimal pain;
      two-thirds of patients experienced moderate to severe pain. Postoperative pain most often
      occurs within 48 hours after surgery. Local infiltration of anesthesia is the most simple and
      effective analgesia. However, the analgesic effect only lasts for a short-time after surgery,
      and it cannot adequately meet the needs of postoperative analgesia after craniotomy. Several
      studies have shown that the mixture of dexamethasone with local anesthetics could reduce the
      postoperative pain scores better than local anesthetics alone. Lipid microsphere is a
      relatively new drug delivery system. It is an artificial lipid emulsion. Studies have shown
      that dexamethasone lipid microsphere have stronger anti-inflammatory effect than
      dexamethasone. Therefore, the investigators hypothesize that the pre-emptive scalp
      infiltration with dexamethasone or dexamethasone lipid microsphere plus ropivacaine could
      achieve superior postoperative pain-relief compared to ropivacaine alone; dexamethasone lipid
      microsphere plus ropivacaine could achieve superior postoperative pain-relief compared to
      dexamethasone plus ropivacaine for patients undergoing craniotomy.

    <measure>Cumulative sufentanil consumption by PCA device</measure>
    <time_frame>During 48 hours postoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will use PCA device for postoperative analgesia. When the patients feel pain, the PCA button will be pressed. The PCA device will provide a bolus dose of 2μg sufentanil with a 10 minutes lock-out time, and the maximum dose of sufentanil will be limited to 8μg /h. The sufentanil consumption can be calculated by the times of pressing PCA button.</description>
