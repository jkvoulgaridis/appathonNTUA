  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure is a prevalent and serious public health concern with the growing aging
      population. Patients with heart failure often experience attention impairment that decreases
      their ability to perform self-care and diminishes their health-related quality of life. In
      past studies, 15 - 27% of heart failure patients had attention impairment. Attention is
      fundamental to human activities including self-care management of heart failure. However,
      cognitive interventions focusing on attention are scarce in heart failure literature. This
      study focuses on developing a novel cognitive intervention specifically targeting improved
      attention and testing its efficacy on improving attention, self-care, and health-related
      quality of life.

      The investigators in this study are asking the following 3 questions: 1) does the newly
      developed cognitive intervention using immersive virtual reality technology (Nature-VR)
      improve attention compared with the control condition (Urban-VR)?; 2) does Nature-VR
      intervention improve HF self-care and health-related quality of life compared with Urban-VR
      control condition?; and 3) are selected biological factors associated with attention function
      in HF?

      The virtual reality-based cognitive intervention (Nature-VR) can be an efficacious
      intervention for the patients to use and enjoy without burdening already reduced attention.
      This study has great potential to improve attention and prevent attention impairment, thereby
      leading to healthier lives among heart failure patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure (HF) is a prevalent serious chronic illness that affects 6.5 million American.
      Among HF patients, prevalence of attention impairment is reported as 15-27%. Attention is
      fundamental to human activities including HF self-care. However, cognitive interventions
      focusing on attention are scarce in HF. The investigators developed a new cognitive
      intervention with immersive virtual reality technology and created a prototype of the virtual
      reality-based natural restorative environment intervention (Nature-VR). The prototype was
      feasible and showed larger effects in improving attention among 10 HF patients.

      In this 2-group randomized controlled pilot study, specific aims are to: 1) examine
      preliminary efficacy of Nature-VR compared with Urban-VR on improving attention; 2) examine
      preliminary efficacy of Nature-VR compared with Urban-VR on HF self-care and health-related
      quality of life; and 3) explore possible biomarkers of attention in HF. This study is
      important and novel because this is the first intervention study targeting attention using
      virtual reality technology and investigating possible biomarkers associated with attention in
      HF patients.

    <measure>Changes in attention - Multi-Source Interference Task</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Performances on the computerized cognitive test of Multi-Source Interference Task will be examined in terms of speed and accuracy. Participants are instructed to identify the target number, which is different than the other 3 numbers provided on the computer screen. There are two types of trials, congruent and incongruent. Congruent trials have a target number that is always matched its position on the button (e.g., 100, 020, or 223), in contrast, incongruent trials have the target number that is never matched with it position in the button (e.g., 010, 233, or 232). Faster response time and lower error rates indicate better attention.</description>

    <measure>Changes in attention - Digit Span Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants are instructed to remember the sequence of numbers the data collector told and repeat the numbers right after the instructor finished talking. This test has 2 subsets, Forward—repeat exactly the same sequence, and Backward—repeat the numbers in the backward from last to the first. More digits correctly repeated indicate better attention.</description>

    <measure>Changes in attention - Trail Making Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This traditional cognitive test of attention is a paper-pencil based measure and has 2 parts. Part A requires participants to connect a series of randomly arrayed, distinct circles numbered 1 to 25 in correct order as quickly as possible. Part B requires participants to connect a series of 25 circles numbered 1 to 13 randomly intermixed with letters from A to L, alternating between numbers and letters, and proceeding in ascending order (e.g., 1-A-2-B-3 and so on). Faster response time in seconds indicates better attention.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in attention - Stroop Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Stroop Test is a color-word test measuring the ability to processe different visual features and ignore distractions. The test has 2 parts of reading letters of color names and colors of color names using 4 color names (i.e., red, blue, yellow, and green). Congruent trials have the same letters and colors of the color names (i.e., red in red color). Incongruent trials have different letters and colors of the color names (i.e., red in blue color). Faster response time and lower error rates indicate better attention.</description>

    <measure>Changes in attention - Attentional Function Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This self-reported questionnaire has 13 items on 0 to 10 response scales asking effectiveness in behaviors requiring attention. Higher scores indicate better subjective attention</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in the Self-Care of Heart Failure Index (SCHFI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This self-reported questionnaire consists of 29 items divided into 3 scales measuring self-care maintenance, symptom perception, and self-care management. In addition, self-care confidence is measured by additional 10 items. Each scale is scored separately and standardized to achieve a possible score of 0 to 100. Higher scores indicate better self-care of HF.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire will be used to measure health-related quality of life. This self-report questionnaire consists of 21 items on which patients are asked to rate how their HF condition impacted their physical and emotional health. Lower scores indicate better HRQL.</description>
