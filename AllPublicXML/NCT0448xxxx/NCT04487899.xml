      The autonomous response of fighter and attack pilots who attend sessions in a flight
      simulator will be evaluated by measuring and analyzing heart rate variability (HRV). Eighteen
      pilot pilots with the status of instructor or student assigned at the time of the assessment
      to the ALA 23 district of the Talavera la Real Air Base of the Ministry of Defense of the
      Government of Spain (Badajoz) were studied during a flight simulator session. Subjects were
      assigned by non-probability randomization to a group of instructors (IG; 7 subjects), and a
      group of students (AG; 11 subjects). HRV was recorded for 15 minutes at rest and during the
      simulation of a mission in the flight simulator.

    <description>The HR HRV interval of the heartbeat (variations in the time interval between beats) was used as a measure of autonomous modulation, and the Firstbeat Bodyguard monitor (Firstbeat Technologies, Jyväskylä, Finland) was used to record HRV data for 15 minutes in rest and for one hour in the intervention in the flight simulator. Data was downloaded from the devices to a computer using Firstbeat Uploader software (Firstbeat Technologies), and all R-R interval series were imported into the Kubios software package (University of Eastern Finland, Kuopio, Finland). To calculate the autonomous equilibrium, the commonly used HRV method based on the Poincaré graph was used (Brennan et al., 2001; Mourot et al., 2004).</description>
