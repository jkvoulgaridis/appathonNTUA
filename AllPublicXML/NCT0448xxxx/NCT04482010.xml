  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sanu Gundo ANRS 12392 is a non-randomized and non-comparative intervention trial in Mali.

      The main objective of the project is to study the feasibility of the community-based HIV care
      in the context of the artisanal gold mining zones and to evaluate its contribution to the
      linkage-to-care of PLWHIV with the health system and their retention in care, as well as its
      effect on their health status.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Convergence of key-populations in the informal gold mining zones suggests the important
      exposure to HIV contamination of people living in these zones. The pilot project Sanu Gundo
      showed a prevalence of 8% in the site of Kokoyo, much higher than the 1.1% national
      prevalence. The large rates of HIV patients lost to followup underline the difficulties
      experienced by the health system. Introducing a community-based HIV care offer in proximity
      to people in the informal gold mining zones could contribute to the improvement not only of
      access to HIV prevention and testing, but also to the access and retention in care.

      Sanu Gundo ANRS 12392 is a non-randomized and non-comparative intervention trial.
      Community-based activities conducted by ARCAD Santé PLUS including HIV testing will
      contribute to the construction of both a control and intervention groups. These groups will
      be formed by people tested positive to HIV during the community-based activities conducted by
      ARCAD Santé PLUS in two artisanal gold mining sites.

      The control group will include 155 participants positive to HIV in Fala (Sikasso region), and
      the intervention group will include 172 participants positive to HIV in Kofoulatiè (Koulikoro
      region).

      The intervention consists local community-based activities for HIV care provided by ARCAD
      Santé PLUS for people living in Kofoulatiè (intervention group), whereas people living in
      Fala (control group) will be referred to the Referral Health Centers (CSRéf) as recommended
      by the national guidelines.

      The total number of 327 participants diagnosed positive to HIV enrolled in the study
      corresponds (at least) to the HIV prevalence of 8% estimated in the feasibility study
      conducted in 2015. Accounting for survey attrition, refusal of the community-based HIV care
      and non-inclusion criteria, it is expected that 206 participants (103 per group) will be
      followed-up during the whole duration of the study. This corresponds to the number of
      participants required to verify the primary endpoint of the study: a better retention rate in
      healthcare 12 months after of HIV diagnosis for people receiving community-based care by
      ARCAD Santé PLUS.

      A quantitative survey will be conducted with the administration of questionnaires at
      different point-times during the follow-up for HIV care: M1 (first contact with the
      healthcare system and linkage-to-care), M3 (linkage-to-care and initiation of ARV treatment),
      M6, M9 and M12 (medical follow-up and retention in care). Blood samples will be collected
      using Dried Blood Spot testing (DBS) at enrolment, M6 and M12. Furthermore, data will be
      collected about the characteristics of the healthcare centers around the artisanal gold
      mining sites (i.e. healthcare supply) and the costs of community-based HIV care.

      The results will overcome the lack of epidemiological data about HIV in the informal gold
      mining zones, about the way in which PLWH are linked-to-care, and about the extent of the
      PLWH loss to follow-up. The results will also allow both testing the feasibility of the
      implementation of proximity community-based services for HIV care in the informal gold mining
      zones, and evaluating their contribution to retention of PLWH in care. The success of this
      project could allow extending the proposed strategy to other informal gold mining zones in
      Mali.

    <intervention_model_description>ARCAD Santé PLUS NGO will offer community-based activities of HIV prevention and screening. 4088 people will be tested for HIV in the two artisanal gold-mining sites. Thus, 327 HIV-positive individuals will be enrolled:
Control group: 155 (Fala), 30% of attrition and 5% of discordant HIV screening and confirmatory tests;
Intervention group: 172 (Kofoulatiè), 30% of attrition; 10% of people accepting the study but refusing the community-based HIV care; and 5% of discordant HIV screening and enrolment tests.
This is the minimum number required to verify the primary endpoint of the study. The intervention consists in the provision of community-based healthcare services for HIV provided by ARCAD Santé PLUS's members in the Kofoulatiè site. People in the Fala site (control group) will be referred to the public healthcare centers for classic HIV care. A quantitative survey with follow-up at M1, M3, M6, M9 and M12 after HIV diagnosis.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Participants in the control group (HIV positive people at the artisanal gold-mining site in Fala) will not be aware of the existence of the community-based HIV care services provided by ARCAD Santé PLUS at the Kofoulatiè artisanal gold-mining site.
The distance between these sites is around 400km. However they share similar characteristics in terms of geographical localisation, size and healthcare supply.</masking_description>
