  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to learn whether it is possible and useful for
      caregivers to report behavioral or psychological symptoms of people with mild memory problems
      or Alzheimer's disease through a smartphone mobile application. The investigators believe
      that monitoring these symptoms and having a tool, like a mobile application, can provide
      quicker accessibility to the patient's clinical care team, which could improve care for
      patients and caregivers.

      These types of symptoms found in patients with mild memory problems or Alzheimer's disease
      are any type of psychiatric symptoms or abnormal behaviors one might develop as the result of
      these brain illnesses. Examples of psychological and behavioral symptoms are depression,
      anxiety, insomnia, irritability, agitation, and hallucinations. These symptoms differ from
      regular psychiatric symptoms, because they are caused by mild memory problems or Alzheimer's
      disease (AD). These symptoms can cause a lot of distress for patients and caregivers, and can
      lead to greater use of healthcare services.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As a part of this research study the patient and caregiver will undergo randomization, &quot;like
      flipping a coin&quot;, to assign the patient and caregiver to one of two research study groups.
      The patient and the partnered caregiver will join the same group. The group will either
      receive: 1) three in-person assessments on symptoms and behaviors that the patient may
      experience and a mobile application that will send surveys to the caregiver in order to rate
      the presence, severity and stress caused by these symptoms and behaviors; or 2) three
      in-person assessments on symptoms and behaviors that the patient may experience and no mobile
      application. The outcomes of these surveys and assessments will then be shared with the
      patient's clinical team.

      If the caregiver is assigned to the group that receives the mobile application they will
      receive the surveys either weekly or monthly. After each month of completing the surveys, the
      frequency will change. Depending on feedback from the first 10 participants, the
      investigators may modify the survey rate to happen more than weekly.

    <measure>Feasibility of the BrainCare Notes (BCN) app - Caregiver Completion Rate of the Neuropsychiatric Interview Questionnaire (NPI-Q) at 3 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Calculated at 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Feasibility of the BrainCare Notes (BCN) app will be measured by the number of completed Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q) surveys that were initiated from scheduled BCN app prompts divided by the total number of scheduled BCN prompts sent over a 3 month span. Caregivers will be prompted via the BCN app to complete the NPI-Q app at different intervals (e.g. daily, weekly).
The NPI-Q measures Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD) and is completed by a caregiver. There are 12 domains that focus on a different and specific BPSD (e.g. depression, hallucinations). Symptom severity scores for each of the symptom domains range between 0-not present, 1 - mild, 2-moderate, 3-severe. The summation of all symptom severity scores have a range of a min score of 0 and max score of 36. A higher number indicates worse symptom severity.</description>

    <time_frame>Calculated at 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Feasibility of the BrainCare Notes (BCN) app will be measured by averaging participants answers to the following likert style, survey burden question for the BCN app, &quot;How burdensome was completion of the prior survey? (Answer options: not at all burdensome - 1, mildly burdensome - 2, moderately burdensome - 3, or extremely burdensome - 4)&quot;.

    <description>The System Usability Scale (SUS) will be used to assess usability of the BrainCare Notes (BCN) app at 3 months. The SUS is a ten-item attitude Likert scale that provides a global view of subjective assessments of usability. John Brooke developed and validated the SUS in 1986.
The 10 items cover topics of effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction. The SUS items use a 5-point likert scale, with the answer &quot;strongly disagree&quot; being represented by a &quot;1&quot; and &quot;strongly agree&quot; by a &quot;5&quot;.</description>

The caregiver will be asked to complete three in-person assessments that involve answering survey questions and an interview.
Some of the questions asked will be related to Behavioral and/or Psychological Symptoms the patient experiences.
The caregiver will be asked to answer questions about the patient, the patient's experience with the research study and the caregiver's own experience with the research study.
If the patient's &quot;symptoms&quot; or the caregiver's &quot;distress&quot; answers reach a high enough level, a member of the research study team and clinical team will contact the caregiver to ask more questions and check in on the patient and caregiver's safety.
The research study team will also notify Dr. Bateman (the person responsible for the research).</description>
