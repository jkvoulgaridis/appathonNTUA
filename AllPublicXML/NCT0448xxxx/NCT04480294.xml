  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled study to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability and pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and food effect of HRS5091. The study
      will be conducted in three parts sequentially:

      Part 1a will consist of 58 healthy subjects, 5 groups. The purpose of this part is to explore
      the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of single doses of HRS5091 tablet in healthy
      subjects.

      Part 1b will consist of 18 healthy subjects and it is one of groups in Part 1a.The purpose of
      this part is to explore food effect of HRS5091 in healthy subjects.

      Part 1c will consist of 10 healthy subjects, 1 groups. The purpose of this part is to explore
      the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of multiple doses of HRS5091 tablet in healthy
      subjects.

      Part 2 will consist of 30 CHB patients.The purpose of this part is to explore the safety,
      tolerability and pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics of multiple doses of HRS5091 tablet in
      naïve and treatment-discontinued chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients.
