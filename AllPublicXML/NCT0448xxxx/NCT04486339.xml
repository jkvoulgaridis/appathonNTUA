  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to investigate the short-term (3 months) and intermediate-term (12 months)
      safety and preliminary efficacy of stereotactic radiotherapy for pulmonary vein isolation to
      treat refractory atrial fibrillation.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, single arm, prospective and phase 1 clinical trial. Patients with
      refractory atrial fibrillation (AF) will receive single fraction stereotactic radiotherapy
      for pulmonary vein isolation. To minimize the potential risks associated with this innovative
      technique, the study has been designed in a stepwise dose escalation fashion under carefully
      observation by the investigators. The dose escalation is guided by 3+3 algorithm to ensure
      more patients will be spared dose limiting toxicities and more patients will be entered on
      the dose level than will be chosen as optimal dose of maximal effects. Low dosing levels with
      established safety profile will first be applied before administering higher dosing levels
      based on preclinical studies.

      Safety is the primary endpoint of the study. Safety will be assessed by incidence and
      evaluation of any serious adverse evens using CTCAE V5.0 criteria associated with the
      procedure through 90 days (short-term) and 12 months (intermediate term). Efficacy will be
      evaluated by assessing atrial fibrillation recurrence (for paroxysmal AF) or AF burden (for
      persistent AF) after 90 days of blank period until 12 months post-treatment.
