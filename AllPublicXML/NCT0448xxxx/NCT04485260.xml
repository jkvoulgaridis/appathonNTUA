  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1b/2 study of KRT-232 combined with ruxolitinib in subjects with MF who have
      a suboptimal response after at least 18 weeks of treatment with ruxolitinib. The primary
      objective of the study is to determine a recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of KRT 232 in
      combination with ruxolitinib.
