  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate a physical activity intervention for children during acute cancer
      treatment. The intervention aims to encourage children to participate in increased levels of
      physical activity and reduce the amount of time they spend engaged in sedentary activities.
      This study also aims to evaluate different ways of assessing physical function in order to
      determine the best outcome measure to use for children during acute cancer treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All participants will receive the intervention which involves weekly sessions with a
      physiotherapist and the provision of an activity tracker. The sessions will aim to help
      motivate participants to be more physically active and identify barriers to physical activity
      in their environment. The activity tracker will be used to set a steps per day goal for the
      participant to achieve.

      The intervention will be assessed for feasibility using aspects of the Bowen Framework. Under
      this framework the intervention will be evaluated according to different domains:

        -  Acceptability: To what extent is a new idea, program, process or measure judged as
           suitable or satisfying

        -  Demand: To what extent is a new idea, program, process, or measure likely to be used

        -  Implementation: To what extent can a new program is successfully delivered to intended
           participants

        -  Practicality: To what extent can the program can be carried out with intended
           participants using existing means, resources, and circumstances

        -  Limited efficiency: Does the a new program show promise of being successful with the
           intended population

      In order to find out the best way to assess physical function, participants will complete 5
      different assessments. The results from these assessments will help to determine the best
      measure to use in this population.

          -  Currently receiving cancer treatment at the Royal Children's Hospital

          -  Has been an in-patient for &gt;7 consecutive days at the time of consent

          -  Provide a signed and dated informed consent form and/or has a legally acceptable
             representative capable of understanding the informed consent document and providing
             consent on the participant's behalf

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Deemed by the treating medical team as unsafe to participate

          -  Child/adolescent unable to mobilise independent of clinical staff assistance, as
             classified by the research team at the time of consent (use of a gait aid or
             assistance from a primary carer/support person is accepted). For example, if a
             child/adolescent requires assistance from nursing staff or physiotherapist in order to
             walk, they will be excluded.

          -  Child/adolescent unable to follow simple instructions

          -  Suitable support person (18 years and over) not available to participate in continuous
             monitoring of daily steps in tandem with the child/adolescent

          -  No suitable access to a device to sync with a Fitbit

          -  Inability or unwillingness of participant or legally acceptable representative to give
             written informed consent.
