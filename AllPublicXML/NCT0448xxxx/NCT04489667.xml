  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the impact of using a multicomponent intervention (patient reported
      outcomes, training, and telemedicine) to assist with the management of Mental Health (MH) and
      Substance Use Disorders (SUD) among people living with HIV (PLWH) engaged in care at UAB HIV
      Clinic, University of Alabama Family Clinic (Birmingham, AL), Thrive Federally Qualified
      Health Services Center (Huntsville), Health Services Center (Anniston), Medical Advocacy and
      Outreach (Montgomery), and The University of South Alabama Family Specialty Clinic (Mobile).
      The study will employ a hybrid type 2 implementation design. Because this intervention will
      be employed as the new standard of care at participating sites, all PLWH receiving care at
      the sites will receive this intervention. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) will be integrated
      into routine care to screen PLWH for substance use and mental health disorders during routine
      clinical encounters. Training will be delivered to frontline clinicians so that they receive
      targeted knowledge on best practices for treatment of MH and SUD along with clinic-specific
      protocols for response to PROs on MH and SUD including treatment and referrals. Telemedicine
      services for MH and SUD will be offered to patients in need of expanded access to services
      due to a lack of clinic-level resources or additional barriers to traditional clinic visits
      such transportation, stigma, or substance using behaviors.

    <ipd_description>The proposed project will comply with the NIH Data Sharing Policy, thus all data collected will be made available to outside investigators. To maintain HIPAA compliance, we will provide a limited-use dataset (i.e., stripped of identifying information). When possible, collaborative use of the data will be encouraged in order to enhance the quality of secondary analyses. Data will be made available as either a SPSS or Excel dataset, or as a tab-delimited ASCII file. Methods will be described through published papers, and relevant software and/or procedures documents.</ipd_description>
