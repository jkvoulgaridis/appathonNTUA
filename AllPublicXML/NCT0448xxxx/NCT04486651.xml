  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blinded, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and safety
      of HX008 injection combined with irinotecan versus placebo combined with irinotecan as
      second-line therapy in patients with adcanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ)
      adenocarcinoma who have had tumor progression after first-line treatment with platinum and/or
      fluropyrimidine therapy.
