      The present study is being undertaken as an open-label study to evaluate the safety and
      feasibility of near infrared therapy as an intervention for patients with refractory
      depression, anxiety, cognitive impairment due to a neurodegenerative disease (e.g.,
      Alzheimer's), and traumatic brain injury. Baseline and outcome measures in this study utilize
      validated tests that are appropriate for repeated measures. The present study can be easily
      implemented because instruments have been in routine clinical deployment providing for a high
      degree of availability and reliability. Quality assurance is tightly controlled. The study
      population is sufficiently broad and the conditions of interest are sufficiently prevalent so
      that recruitment of subjects is not a limiting factor.

    <measure>[Depression (MDD)] Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The BDI-II is a 21-question multiple-choice self-report inventory. Each question involves four possible responses, ranging in intensity from &quot;0&quot; (this item does not apply) to &quot;3&quot; (this item applies severely). The test is scored as the sum of all of the response values; this number is used to determine the severity of depressive symptoms. A score of 0 to 3 is possible for each question with a maximum total score of 63 points. The standard cutoff scores are as follows: 0-13 total points = minimal depression; 14-19 total points = mild depression; 20-28 total points = moderate depression; and 29-63 total points = severe depression. A reduction in the total score by at least 30% is considered to be clinically significant.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>[Anxiety] Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The BAI is a 21-question multiple-choice self-report inventory that is used for measuring the severity of anxiety symptoms. Each of the 21 items asks whether the patient has experienced various anxiety symptoms in the last two weeks, and if so, how severely. Each question/answer is scored on a scale value of &quot;0&quot; (not at all) to &quot;3&quot; (severely). Higher total scores indicate more severe anxiety symptoms. The maximum total score possible is 63 points. The standard cutoff scores are: 0-7 = minimal anxiety; 8-15 = mild anxiety; 16-25 = moderate anxiety; 26-63 = severe anxiety. A reduction in score by at least 30% is considered clinically meaningful.</description>

    <measure>[Dementia] Quick Dementia Rating Scale (QDRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Quick Dementia Rating Scale (QDRS) is an interview-based tool administered by study officials to participants' caregivers used to obtain observations from a consistent source. The QDRS form consists of 10 categorical questions (5 cognitive, 5 functional), each with 5 detailed options depicting the level of impairment as either 0 (normal), 0.5 (mild/inconsistent impairment), 1 (mild/consistent impairment), 2 (moderate impairment), or 3 (severe impairment). Based on the conversion table outlined in Dr. James Galvin's research (2015), total QDRS scores were converted to Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale levels ranging from 0 (normal aging), 0.5 (mild cognitive impairment), 1 (mild dementia), 2 (moderate dementia), and 3 (severe dementia).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>[Concussion/Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)] Brief Pain Inventory (BPI)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Self-report measure containing a composite pain score and functional interference score. The pain subscale contains 4 questions, each with answers ranging from 0 'no pain' to 10 'pain as bad as you can imagine.' Total possible score for the pain subscale is 40 points. The functional/interference subscale contains 7 questions, with each answer ranging from 0 'does not interfere' to 10 'completely interferes.' The maximum possible score for the interference subscale is 70 points. The total overall composite BPI score is out of 100 maximum points. A clinical improvement is considered a decrease in BPI overall composite score by at least 30% from baseline.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>[All] Global Rating of Change (GRC)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The GRC consists of a single likert-scale ranging from &quot;-5&quot; (very much worse) to &quot;0&quot; (neutral/no change) to &quot;5&quot; (very much better). The GRC is obtained in an interview format to assess a patient's perceived change in status following a treatment. A score that is at least 2 or greater is considered to indicate clinically significant change.</description>

    <measure>[MDD &amp; TBI] Patient Depression Questionnaire (PDQ-9)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PDQ-9 is a 9-item, self-report questionnaire to evaluate for depressive symptoms. Each question asks the patient if they have experienced a particular depressive symptom over the past two weeks. Answers may range from &quot;0&quot; (not at all), &quot;1&quot; (several days/week), &quot;2&quot; (more than half of the days), and &quot;3&quot; (nearly every day). Maximum total score is 27 points. A higher score indicates more severe depressive symptoms. A reduction in total score by at least 30% is considered clinically meaningful.</description>

A trained staff member administers this form to a patient and scores the patients' responses on a scale of &quot;0&quot; (symptom absent) to &quot;4&quot; (most severe option per symptom). A higher total score indicates a more severe level of depression. The maximum possible score is 50 points. A change in score of at least 30% is considered clinically meaningful.</description>

    <description>RBANS assesses immediate memory, visuospatial skill, language, attention, and delayed memory.

    <description>On the days of each near-infrared therapy session, patients will undergo 10 minutes of transcranial infrared laser stimulation.
The laser dose for all conditions will be a 3.4 W continuous laser wave, at a 1064 wavelength, with irradiance (power density) at 250 milli-Watts/cm2. All groups will have treatment once a week (10 minutes per session) for 5-6 weeks. For Alzheimer's, the site targeted will be the right prefrontal cortex. Parkinson's patients will have laser delivered to the brain stem, bilateral temporal lobes. TBI/CTE patients will have the laser stimulation site dependent on location of injury. Patients with depression/anxiety will have laser stimulation applied to the prefrontal area of the head.</description>
