    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the use of a mobile health app (Roadmap 2.0) intervention in
      caregivers of patients with cancer. In this study participants will be given the Roadmap 2.0
      app, with a focus on the positive aspects of caregiving (positive activity components), and a
      Fitbit. The primary objective of this pilot study is to test the feasibility and
      acceptability of using the mobile health app.
