  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 760 patients with thyroid
      nodule biopsy and 88 patients who had thyroid surgery. The investigators evaluated patients'
      thyroid ultrasonography reports and determined Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System
      scores (TIRADS score: 1-Benign, 2- very low malignant) risk, 3-low risk, 4-medium risk, 5
      -malignant high risk). The investigators evaluated patients 'existing thyroid fine needle
      aspiration biopsy (FNAB) reports and recorded the patients' cytology results (benign,
      malignant).

      Documents of 88 patients who were included in the study and who underwent thyroidectomy were
      reviewed.Pathology reports of these patients were evaluated and surgical pathology was
      determined as benign in 58 patients and malignant in 30 patients.

      Then, a statistical study was performed between the cor needle biopsy (CNB) results of these
      participants and the surgical pathology and TI-RADS scores.

    <ipd_description>We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of 760 patients with thyroid nodule biopsy and 88 patients who had thyroid surgery. We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of 760 patients who had undergone thyroid fine needle aspiration biopsy and core needle biopsy (CNB) and 88 patients who had thyroid surgery. After the study, core needle biopsy results were statistically compatible with Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TI-RADS) scores and surgical pathology results in patients. As a result, CNB is a reliable diagnostic method.</ipd_description>
