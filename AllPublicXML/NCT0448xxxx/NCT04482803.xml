  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To explore the feasibility of target biopsy of carbon nanoparticles labelled lymph node after
      neoadjuvant systemic therapy for cN+ breast cancer, and evaluate whether it can accurately
      predict axillary lymph node status after neoadjuvant systemic therapy.

    <textblock>
      Locally advanced breast cancer patients with clinical assessed positive axillary lymph node
      (cN+) who receive neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NST) will be enrolled in this study. Before
      NST, one of the suspected lymph nodes will be subjected to ultrasound-guided core needle
      biopsy (CNB) or fine needle aspiration (FNA), and a locating clip will be placed. Meanwhile,
      a small amount of Kanarine (Carbon Nanoparticles Suspension Injection) will be injected into
      or around the cortex of the locating lymph node as well as other positive lymph nodes. All
      patients will be confirmed to have axillary lymph node metastasis by pathologic or cytologic
      examination. After NST, FNA will be performed again for the lymph nodes labelled with
      previous locating clip. During the operation, the clip labelled lymph nodes were identified
      with carbon and sent to pathology separately. Meanwhile, the remaining carbon labelled lymph
      nodes were also separately examined. Axillary lymph node dissection will be performed in all
      patients. The detection rate of labelled lymph node will be record, and the pathological
      results of re-FNA of labelled lymph nodes will be compared with postoperative pathological
      results. Meanwhile, we will also analysis whether carbon labelled lymph node biopsy could
      predict the overall status of axillary lymph nodes after NST.
