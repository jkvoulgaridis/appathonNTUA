      Aim: This study aims to assess the effect of root canal disinfection with a 980 µm diode
      laser following chemomechanical root canal preparation on the severity of pain after root
      canal treatment (RCT).

      Materials and Methods: In present study, asymptomatic, single-rooted teeth with periapical
      index (PAI) score 3 or 4 were included. All patients were treated with two visits of root
      canal treatment including dressing with calcium hydroxide. Patients were randomly divided
      into two groups (n: 28). 'Control (no laser)': The final irrigation was performed using 5ml
      2.5% NaOCI, followed by 5 ml 17% EDTA and 5 ml distilled water. 'Laser Disinfection (LD)':
      Root canals were irradiated with 980 µm diode laser after final irrigation at both visits.
      The pain levels were evaluated using visual analog scale (VAS) after 8, 24, 48 hours and 7
      days. In addition, analgesic intake and time intervals were recorded by patients. The
      collected data were statistically analyzed with the Chi-square and Mann-Whitney U test
      (p&lt;0.05).

    <description>After final irrigation was performed using 5ml 2.5% NaOCI, followed by 5 ml 17% EDTA for 3 min and 5 ml distilled water, root canals were irradiated with 980 nm diode laser coupled with optical fiber 200 µm with setting at the average power 1.2-W in pulsed mode. 10 seconds irradiation followed by 10 seconds pause, which comprised one lasting cycle. This cycle was applied 4 times for each root canal. The optical fiber (Medency) was inserted 1 mm short of the apex and the root canals were slowly (at a speed of 2mm/s) irradiated from apical to coronal in continuous circling movements to treat all dentinal tubules in one cycle for each power.</description>
