    <textblock>
      RESONANCE-II trial is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled phase III study
      which will enroll 524 patients in total. Patients with eligibility will be registered,
      pre-enrolled and receive three cycles of SOX. Then, tumor response evaluation will be carried
      out. Those who achieve stable disease or progressive disease will be excluded. Patients
      achieving complete response or partial response will be enrolled and assigned into either
      group A for another three cycles of SOX (six cycles in total) followed by D2 surgery and
      group B for D2 surgery (three cycles in total). The primary endpoint is the rate of
      pathological complete response and the secondary endpoints are R0 resection rate, three-year
      disease-free survival, five-year overall survival and safety.

    <textblock>
      RESONANCE-II trial is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled phase III study
      which was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of different cycles of SOX as
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy for patients with locally advanced gastric cancer. All patients with
      eligibility will be registered, pre-enrolled and receive three cycles of SOX. Then, tumor
      response evaluation will be carried out according to the Response Evaluation Criteria for
      Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1. Those who achieve stable disease (SD) or progressive disease
      (PD)will be excluded. Patients achieving complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) will
      be enrolled and assigned into either group A (six cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with
      SOX) for another three cycles of SOX followed by D2 surgery and group B (three cycles of
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy with SOX) for D2 surgery. The primary endpoint is the rate of
      pathological complete response (pCR%) and the secondary endpoints are R0 resection rate,
      three-year disease-free survival (3-y DFS), five-year overall survival (5-y OS) and safety.

    <description>The preoperative SOX chemotherapy consists of three-week cycles of intravenously administered oxaliplatin 130 mg/m2 on day 1 and orally administered S-1 40-60 mg twice a day (BID) on day 1 to 14. The dose of S-1 depends on body surface area (BSA): 40mg BID for BSA &lt; 1.25 m2; 50mg BID for 1.25 m2 &lt; BSA &lt;1.5 m2; 60mg BID for BSA &gt; 1.5 m2. Day 15 to day 21 is the rest period.</description>

    <intervention_name>Gastrectomy</intervention_name>
    <description>Surgery is planned 3-4 weeks after the last cycle of chemotherapy. A standard D2 radical laparoscopic gastrectomy is recommended. The extent of gastric resection and lymphadenectomy were performed as per the treatment guidelines. Reconstruction after gastrectomy was decided by the surgeon. All operations are performed by well trained and experienced surgical team to guarantee the quality of surgery, including harvesting more than 16 lymph nodes.</description>
