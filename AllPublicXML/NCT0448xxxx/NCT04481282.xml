  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Single-arm, open-label, single center study to assess the efficacy and safety of terbutaline
      plus danazol in patients with corticosteroid resistant/relapsed ITP.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a severe bleeding disorder. Approximately 2/3 of patients
      achieve remission from first-line therapies. However, the underlying mechanism of
      corticosteroid-resistant or relapsed ITP is not well understood; thus, treatment remains a
      great challenge. β2-AR agonist terbutaline modulates T cell differentiation and effector cell
      function.

      A single center prospective study was performed in non-splenectomized ITP patients who were
      either resistant to a standard dose of corticosteroids or had relapsed. Patients were
      assigned to terbutaline plus danazol group. Platelet count, bleeding and other symptoms were
      evaluated before and after treatment. Adverse events are also recorded throughout the study,
      in order to assess the efficacy and safety of terbutaline plus danazol in patients with
      corticosteroid-resistant/relapsed ITP.
