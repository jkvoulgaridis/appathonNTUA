      Retrospective clinical study to evaluate whether there is any correlation between the
      pre-hospital incidence of cardiogenic pulmonary oedema (CPE) in the selected region and the
      space weather parameters.

    <textblock>
      Emergency Medical Service of the Central Bohemian Region is the exclusive provider of primary
      pre-hospital emergency care in the Central Bohemian Region, Czech Republic. The region
      includes both the rural and urban population, in total of 1 315 299 inhabitants on a total
      area of 11 015 km2. A computer search of patients with dyspnoea between 1.10.2008 and
      30.6.2014 will be conducted and all cases of cardiogenic pulmonary oedema will be selected.

      Physical parameters of space weather and geomagnetic field disturbances will be obtained from
      the database of Institute of Experimental Physics, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Slovak
      Republic. The datasets will be analysed whether there is any correlation between the
      pre-hospital incidence of CPE in the selected region and the parameters of space weather and
      geomagnetic field disturbances.
