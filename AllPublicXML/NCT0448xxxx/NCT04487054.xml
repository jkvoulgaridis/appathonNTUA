  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to conduct a feasibility study of identifying high-risk ICU
      patients using previously validated integrated prediction model and employing early
      palliative care intervention. The study will consist of two four-month time periods: usual
      care in time period one and usual care plus targeted pro-active palliative care intervention
      within 48 hours of ICU admission in time period two.
