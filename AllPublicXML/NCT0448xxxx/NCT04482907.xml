  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study was to investigate the functional and morphological effects of Anethum
      graveolens L. in patients with thyroiditis and nodular goiter by evaluating hormone levels,
      anti-Inflammatory markers and comparing thyroid nodule sizes measured by ultrasonography for
      90 days.

      The effect of Anethum graveolens L. was evaluated in euthyroid goiter patients diagnosed with
      benign thyroid nodule via fine needle aspiration biopsy. Aerial parts of Anethum graveolens
      L. were dried and grinded to yield a fine powder. Size 1 hydroxypropyl methylcellulose
      capsules were filled with 300 mg powder. Placebo was prepared in the same manner using
      maltodextrin. Patients were suggested to take 3 pills a day. Blood samples were collected at
      the initial and the final day for thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), free triiodothyronine
      (fT3), free thyroxine (fT4), anti-thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO), anti-thyroglobulin (Anti-Tg)
      and C-reactive protein (CRP) analysis. Nodule sizes were also measured at the beginning and
      at the end of the trial with ultrasonography to identify the changes and effectiveness of
      dill dosage forms.

      After 90 days in the study, the status of TSH, fT3, fT4, anti-TPO and CRP levels were
      examined in the group with and without Anethum graveolens L..

      Again, after the study, the size of thyroid nodules was evaluated in the group who received
      and did not receive Anethum graveolens L. by ultrasonography.

    <intervention_model_description>Two groups were created. Patients with thyroid nodules were divided into two groups given dill and placebo. The study was planned for 90 days. 900 mg of powder dill was given daily to the dill group. Placebo was given to the control group. Serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), free triiodothyronine (fT3), free thyroxine (fT4), anti-thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO), anti-thyroglobulin (Anti-Tg) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels of both groups were examined at the beginning and at the end of the study. Thyroid nodule dimensions were measured at the beginning and at the end of the study by ultrasonography. The results were evaluated statistically.</intervention_model_description>
