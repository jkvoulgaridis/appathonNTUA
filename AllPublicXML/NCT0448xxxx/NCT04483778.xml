  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, open-label, non-randomized study that will enroll pediatric and young
      adult research participants with relapsed or refractory non-CNS solid tumors to evaluate the
      safety, feasibility, and efficacy of administering T cell products derived from the research
      participant's blood that have been genetically modified to express a B7H3-specific receptor
      (chimeric antigen receptor, or CAR) that will target and kill solid tumors that express B7H3.
      On Arm A of the study, research participants will receive B7H3-specific CAR T cells only. On
      Arm B of the study, research participants will receive CAR T cells directed at B7H3 and CD19,
      a marker on the surface of B lymphocytes, following the hypothesis that CD19+ B cells serving
      in their normal role as antigen presenting cells to T cells will promote the expansion and
      persistence of the CAR T cells. Arm A CAR T cells include the protein EGFRt and Arm B CAR T
      cells include the protein HER2tG. These proteins can be used to both track and destroy the
      CAR T cells in case of undue toxicity. The primary objectives of the study will be to
      determine the feasibility of manufacturing the cell products, the safety of the T cell
      product infusion, to determine the maximum tolerated dose of the CAR T cells products, to
      describe the full toxicity profile of each product, and determine the persistence of the
      modified cell in the participant's body on each arm. Participants will receive a single dose
      of T cells comprised of two different subtypes of T cells (CD4 and CD8 T cells) felt to
      benefit one another once administered to the research participants for improved potential
      therapeutic effect. The secondary objectives of this protocol are to study the number of
      modified cells in the patients and the duration they continue to be at detectable levels. The
      investigators will also quantitate anti-tumor efficacy on each arm. Participants who
      experience significant and potentially life-threatening toxicities (other than clinically
      manageable toxicities related to T cells working, called cytokine release syndrome) will
      receive infusions of cetuximab (an antibody commercially available that targets EGFRt) or
      trastuzumab (an antibody commercially available that targets HER2tG) to assess the ability of
      the EGFRt on the T cells to be an effective suicide mechanism for the elimination of the
      transferred T cell products.
