      This study evaluates the impact of two dietary supplements (Glutalytic® and DE111®) and of
      oatmeal properties on the digestion of gluten and starch and on the glycemic response.

      RATIONALE Two important factors can influence the proportions of gluten and starch that
      resist digestion: (1) enzyme availability and specificity and (2) the structural properties
      of the food.

      Glutalytic®, is a dietary supplement based on an enzyme preparation which effectively
      degrades gluten in vitro (Healey, Hall et al. unpublished). As it has also been found that
      the rate of wheat protein digestion can be increased in the presence of amylases (Smith, Pan
      et al. 2015), Glutalytic ® is also enriched with amylase to aid in starch digestion.

      The structural properties of food are influenced by numerous factors including meal
      preparation practices. Two common practices that can influence nutrient availability
      differently are heating vs. refrigerating (e.g. oat porridge vs. soaked and refrigerated
      oats).

      Bacillus subtilis DE111® can produce and secrete many enzymes, including proteases, which, if
      secreted into the environment of the digestive tract, could support digestion and, in
      particular, the digestion of gluten. However, it is not clear whether diet supplementation
      with DE111 is a physiologically viable approach in terms of probiotic survival in the
      gastrointestinal tract.

      PURPOSE The aims of this study are to better understand the impact of each of these factors
      and whether supplementation with probiotic spores is a viable option.
