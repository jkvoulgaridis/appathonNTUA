  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the United Kingdom (UK), most childhood vaccinations are given in the community, although
      uptake has decreased in recent years. A Paediatric Emergency Department (PED) attendance
      offers an opportunity to check the vaccination status of children and young people (CYP) and
      all parents/carers should be asked about this routinely. Those not up-to-date with
      vaccinations could then be signposted to existing services or perhaps offered a vaccine in
      the PED.

      CYP attending the PED may also have lower vaccination coverage than their peers, so may
      benefit even more from interventions to increase uptake. However, recall by parents/carers is
      not always sufficiently accurate to identify those who have not yet received all their
      age-appropriate vaccinations. The most complete record of an individual's vaccination history
      is held within their primary care records. However, these records are often in a separate
      computer system that is inaccessible from the hospital's main computer system, although some
      information (including vaccination) may be accessed from within the hospital via a third
      system.

      This study aims to see if CYP attending the PED are under-vaccinated compared to their peers
      and assess the accuracy of parent/carer recall. The results of this study will then be used
      to inform recommendations for developing better ways to access accurate vaccination data
      during a PED consultation. If such a system existed, under-vaccinated children could be
      identified routinely during an attendance, and an intervention offered if appropriate. This
      would be particularly useful if there was an outbreak of a vaccine-preventable disease such
      measles.

      All CYP (&lt; 16 years old) attending two PEDs in Manchester will be invited to participate, one
      in a district general hospital and one in a specialist children's hospital. CYP/their
      parent/carer will be asked to provide consent for their vaccination records to be accessed as
      well as being asked if the child/young person is up-to-date with all their vaccinations.
      Approximately 600 participants will be enrolled at each PED.
