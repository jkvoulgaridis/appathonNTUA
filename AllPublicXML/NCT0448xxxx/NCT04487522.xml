      The study aims to explore the difference in outcomes relating to pain and quality of life
      after open, laparoscopic, and robotic-assisted retromuscular ventral hernia repair.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter, observational study assessing outcomes relating to pain
      and quality of life for subjects undergoing open, laparoscopic, or robotic-assisted
      retromuscular ventral hernia repair. The study will focus on short-term post-operative
      outcomes through 3 months. The study will also collect recurrence data through 1 year. During
      the post-operative period through 3 months, pain medication intake, subject reported pain (on
      post-operative day 7, 14, 21, 28, and 3 months) and quality of life (on day 28, 3 months, and
      1 year) and incidence of intra-operative and post-operative adverse events related to the
      ventral hernia repair will be collected.
