  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised, double-blind clinical investigation to evaluate the efficacy and safety
      of D005 vaginal mousse compared to placebo, in women with bacterial vaginosis.

      The study will be conducted at one site in Scotland, United Kingdom. The study population
      will consist of approximately 96 female subjects.
