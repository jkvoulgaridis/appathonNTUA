    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the user experience of an integrated insulin
      management system (IIM) in participants with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. The IIM system is
      comprised of an insulin injection pen with a data transmission module and blood glucose meter
      which are connected to a mobile phone application. The application will be used to record and
      track diabetes-data related information.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosed (clinically) with type 1 diabetes (T1D) for at least 1 year or type 2
             diabetes (T2D) for at least 6 months.

          -  Using insulin injection regimen of basal/bolus or basal only for 3 months prior to
             screening, which includes:

               -  for bolus insulin (U-100) - a rapid-acting insulin analog (glulisine, lispro, or
                  aspart).

               -  for basal insulin - degludec (U-100 or U-200), detemir (U-100), or glargine (U-
                  100 or U-300).

          -  Participants with T2D may be on ≤ 3 anti-hyperglycemic medications in addition to
             insulin, including alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4)
             inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA; oral or injectable),
             meglitinides, metformin, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLTi-2),
             sulfonylureas, or thiazolidinediones consistent with product labeling.

          -  Participants with T1D must be on insulin only.

          -  Have point-of-care hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) value of ≤11% at screening.

          -  Must be able to self-inject insulin dose (basal or basal/bolus) without assistance.

          -  If using Continuous Glucose Monitoring or Flash Glucose Monitoring device, must agree
             to stop use throughout duration of trial.

          -  Must be able to read and speak English.

          -  Able and willing to use only study-provided insulin Basaglar and/or Humalog for
             duration of trial.

          -  Able and willing to follow insulin regimen specified by investigator throughout
             duration of trial, insulin dose may be titrated at investigator's discretion.

          -  Have no physical or cognitive disabilities that would, in the opinion of the
             investigator, preclude participant from using sponsor-provided iOS device for study
             activities and comply with study requirements.

          -  Agree not to post any personal medical data, pictures of the IIM system or information
             related to the study on any website or social media site (for example, Facebook,
             Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.).

          -  Have refrigeration in home for storage of insulin.

                  or a combination of 2 effective methods of contraception for the entirety of the
                  study and

               -  Test negative for pregnancy based on a urine pregnancy test at the time of
