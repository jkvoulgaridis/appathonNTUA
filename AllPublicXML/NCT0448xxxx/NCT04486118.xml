  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SLE is a chronic autoimmune disease that often involves multiple systems and organs of the
      body. An autoimmune disease is one which your immune system attacks the cells and tissues in
      different parts of the body. SLE is characterized by inflammation that leads to tissue damage
      in many different organ systems. Lupus can cause fever, joint pains, rashes, and other
      symptoms. It can also affect organs such as the skin, the muscles, the kidneys, the heart,
      the lungs, the blood and the brain. The exact cause of SLE is not known.

      Problems with memory and concentration are common in lupus; these problems are called
      cognitive problems. Cognitive problems can be caused by things like depression, fatigue,
      medication and infections. However, previous studies that have been done in animal models of
      lupus and in lupus patients suggest that inflammation due to lupus can affect the brain
      directly.

      This research study is being done to test the effects of centrally-acting ACE inhibitor,
      named lisinopril, on resting metabolism in the brain and on cognitive function. The
      investigators will see if Lisinopril will decrease resting metabolism in the brain and
      improve cognitive function (memory and concentration) compared to a non-centrally acting ACE
      inhibitor called benazepril.

      The study is a randomized, double blind, controlled, multi-center clinical trial to test the
      efficacy of a CA-ACEi, lisinopril, compared to a nonCA-ACEi, benazepril, for CI in SLE as
      measured by improvement in regional resting brain hypermetabolism and cognitive testing. The
      study will also investigate the impact of CA-ACEi compared to nonCA-ACEi on microglia cell
      activation as measured by PBR28 binding, behavioral function, circulating inflammatory
      cytokines and whole blood gene expression. The target population is SLE subjects between the
      ages of 18 and 55 that have stable disease activity and have no history of active or prior
      CNS disease of any kind. If applicable, subjects must be on stable doses of corticosteroids
      (less than or equal to 10 mg daily of prednisone) and non-increasing doses of other
      immunosuppressive medications for at least 4 weeks prior to screening.

             follow-up.

          2. The participant is &quot;lost to follow-up&quot; (i.e., no further follow-up is possible because

          3. The participant dies.

          4. The Investigator no longer believes participation is in the best interest of the
             participant.

             of 20 mg daily for any reason.

          6. The participant is unable to demonstrate a minimum compliance rate of 75% (based on
             the returned pill count) at Visits 2.0, 2.1 and 3.0 in order to titrate up to the next
             dose level of study drug.

          7. The participant experiences a disease flare necessitating increased doses of
