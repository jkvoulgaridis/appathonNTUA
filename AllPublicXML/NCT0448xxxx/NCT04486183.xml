      Aims and Objectives: The purpose of this study is to compare whether or not there is a
      difference between venous and capillary blood samples in blood glucose measurements and
      investigate the effects of different aseptic methods used in skin cleaning before collecting
      blood samples on measurement results.

      Background: Capillary blood glucose measurement is a frequently used measurement method in
      both clinical environments and the home environment. However, several different aseptic
      techniques are used in collecting blood samples for glucose measurement.

      Design and Methods: This was a quasi-experimental study that was conducted with 109 patients
      who visited the blood collection unit of a University Hospital located in Western Turkey for
      75 gr OGTT between November 2017 and April 2018. The capillary first and second blood drop
      values taken from the patients after fasting and at two hours following OGTT and capillary
      and venous blood glucose values were compared.

      The data were collected by the researcher at the waiting room of the blood collection unit at
      a close distance to the lavatory. A nurse working at the venous blood sample unit collected
      fasting and 2 hours after OGTT venous blood samples from the individuals who arrived at the
      blood collection unit for 75 gr OGTT. All venous blood and capillary blood samples were
      obtained in a shorter time than 5 minutes. In this study, capillary blood samples were taken
      from the same participant in four different ways:

        -  As the first intervention, the middle finger of the individuals agreeing to participate
           in the study was rubbed and wiped with a cotton infused with 70% alcohol, and 10 seconds
           were given for it to dry. Afterwards, by perforating the finger with a lancet, firstly
           the first blood drop glucose value and then the second blood drop glucose value were
           measured.

        -  As the second intervention, after ensuring that the individuals washed their hands with
           soap at the lavatory of the blood collection unit and dried their hands with paper
           towels, the middle finger of the right hand was rubbed, perforated with a lancet, and
           firstly the first blood drop glucose value and then the second blood drop glucose value
           were measured.

        -  As the third intervention, for the individuals whose hands had been washed, the middle
           finger of the left hand was rubbed and wiped with 70% alcohol-infused cotton, and 10
           seconds were given for it to dry. The finger was perforated with a lancet and the first
           and second blood drop glucose values were recorded.

        -  As the fourth intervention, 2 hours after the individuals drank a beverage containing 75
           gr of sugar for OGTT, in a state where their hands had been washed, the finger was wiped
           with 70% alcohol, left to dry, perforated with a lancet, and the first and second blood
           drop glucose values were measured and recorded
