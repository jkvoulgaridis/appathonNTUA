  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We performed a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 28-week trial. 300
      non-diabetic obese subjects or overweight subjects with co-morbidities were randomly
      assigned. Eligible participants were randomized 2:1 to once-daily subcutaneous injections of
      either liraglutide or placebo. The primary outcome is to investigate the safety, tolerability
      from baseline to end of treatment.

      We performed a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 28-week trial. 300
      individuals (18-75 years of age, body-mass index ≥30 kg/m2 or BMI 27-30kg/m2 accompanied by
      at least one weight-related complication (treated or untreated hypertension, dyslipidemia,
      pre-diabetes)) were randomly assigned. All the patients provided written informed consent
      before participation. Key exclusion criteria were type 1 or 2 diabetes, the use of
      medications that cause clinically significant weight gain or loss, previous bariatric
      surgery, a history of pancreatitis, a history of major depressive or other severe psychiatric
      disorders, and a family or personal history of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 or
      familial medullary thyroid carcinoma. Eligible participants were randomized 2:1 to once-daily
      subcutaneous injections of either liraglutide or placebo using a computer-generated,
      centrally administered procedure. Patients, investigators, and the sponsor were unaware of
      the study-group assignments. The primary endpoint was change in bodyweight during the 28
      weeks of the study in the intention-to-treat population. The proportion of people losing more
      than 5% of baseline weight was also assessed. Secondary efficacy endpoints included the
      proportion of people losing more than 10% of baseline weight was also assessed, change in
      waist circumference, hip circumference, WHR, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, fasting
      lipids (total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein
      cholesterol, and triglycerides), glucose metabolism parameters (fasting plasma glucose,
      2-hour post-challenge plasma glucose and glycosylated haemoglobin [HbA1c]).
