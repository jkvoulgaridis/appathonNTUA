  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prescription opioids contribute to opioid related deaths, overdose and addiction. Unused
      prescribed opioids are not routinely being stored or disposed of appropriately and their
      availability is associated with harms. This study is designed to help have appropriate
      quantities of opioids dispensed for the treatment of short-term pain. Rather than targeting
      prescribing, this study targets the dispensing process by training community pharmacists to
      assess the appropriateness and safety of opioid prescriptions for short-term pain and to work
      with patients to partially fill prescriptions if the quantities prescribed are deemed
      excessive. Patient education tools were developed to help promote understanding of opioid
      safety, including the use of appropriate quantities, safe storage and safe disposal.
      Pharmacists in five randomly selected regions in Ontario, Canada are targeted for the
      eLearning intervention. The primary study outcome is the quantities dispensed for initial
      opioid prescriptions for short-term pain in the intervention regions compared to ten control
      regions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed intervention is designed to implement and evaluate a pharmacist‐led intervention
      to promote dispensing appropriate quantities of opioids for acute pain at the initial
      prescription stage. This would include patients discharged from hospital post‐surgery,
      following emergency room visits, after dental procedures, and patients visiting primary care
      prescribers. Thus it will capture a wide spectrum of prescribing. This study focuses on
      incorporating into routine pharmacy practice the assessment and adjustment of opioid
      quantities for the treatment of acute pain to appropriate levels. Pharmacists in Ontario are
      able to reduce the quantities of prescriptions with the agreement of the patient. The
      remainder of the prescription quantity can remain active to be filled subsequently if needed.
      By implementing the option of part-fills for prescriptions with higher quantities, this
      intervention does allow patients to access more analgesia if their pain management requires
      it.

      Project Objectives

        1. To develop, test, optimize and implement an intervention in 5 randomly selected regions
           in Ontario to promote pharmacist‐led practices to limit initial quantities of opioid
           prescriptions to appropriate levels for the treatment of acute pain. The intervention
           components include a pharmacist a training program, patient engagement tools and
           prescriber engagement communication.

        2. To measure pharmacist uptake and initial prescription quantities in the pilot
           intervention regions, and to compare prescription quantity outcomes to 10 matched
           control regions.

      This is a prospective, cluster randomized controlled trial evaluating a 6‐month pharmacy
      practice intervention to limit initial quantities of opioid prescriptions to appropriate
      levels for the treatment of acute pain. The intervention components include a pharmacist a
      training program, patient engagement tools and prescriber engagement communication. The
      development of the intervention was informed by the systematic approach described by French
      and colleagues (2012) for behaviour change interventions implementing evidence into practice.
      The 5 eLearning modules (15-20 minutes each) and the patient communication tools (patient
      handout and pharmacy poster) have undergone usability testing using a human factors research
      approach prior to finalization. The intervention will be implemented in 5 public health unit
      regions in Ontario randomly selected along with 10 matched (1:2) control public health unit
      regions. All community pharmacists in the intervention regions will be invited to undertake
      the eLearning program to promote the specific practice change related to opioid quantities.
      The primary outcome measure will be the quantities of opioids dispensed to patients receiving
      initial prescriptions for the treatment of acute pain. Analyses will be at the cluster level
      in which quantities dispensed will be compared both between intervention and control public
      health unit regions after 6 months, and before and after implementation within intervention
      sites.
