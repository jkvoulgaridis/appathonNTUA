A three-way crossover study in which Japanese healthy male subjects receive a single dose of MT-1186 under several dosing condition on Day 1, 4, and 7 according to their treatment sequence with 3-day wash out between doses. Caucasian healthy male subjects receive a single dose of MT-1186 at the same period with Japanese subjects under the corresponding condition on Day 1, 4, or 7 according to their treatment schedule.</description>
