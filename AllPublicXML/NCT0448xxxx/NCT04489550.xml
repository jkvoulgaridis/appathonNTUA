  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies demonstrated the high diagnostic value of non-echoplanar diffusion weighted
      magnetic resonance imaging (non-EP DWI) for residual cholesteatoma. However, limited data are
      available regarding a suitable length of imaging follow-up. The present study aimed to
      determine the optimal duration of non-EP DWI follow-up for residual cholesteatoma

    <textblock>
      A retrospective, monocentric study was performed between 2013 and 2019 and included all
      patients regularly followed-up after canal wall-up tympanoplasty with at least two non-EP DWI
      performed on the same 1.5T MRI scanner. MR images were reviewed independently by two
      radiologists. Sensitivity and specificity values were calculated as a function of time after
      the surgery. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves were analyzed to determine the
      optimal follow-up duration.
