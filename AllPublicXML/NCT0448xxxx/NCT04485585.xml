          1. Those who have history of clinically significant diseases including hypersensitivity
             reaction, intolerability and anaphylaxis to major ingredients (Tamsulosin and
             Mirabegron) and other ingredients of investigational products, Food Yellow No. 5
             (Sunset Yellow FCF) or Sulfonamide.

          2. Those who have a history of clinically significant diseases related to liver, kidney,

             drugs from other trials are not administered).

         13. Those who have given whole blood 8 weeks before screening, who have given
             plasma/platelet 4 weeks before screening or who have not expressed their consent for
             blood-donation prohibition between the period from the first administration and 30
             days after the final administration of the investigational drugs.

         14. Those who have not expressed their consent for diet restrictions (grapefruit, caffeine
             in particular) that can influence absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion
             of investigational drugs in the period between 3 days before the first administration
             and the last visit.

         15. Those who have not expressed their consent for using contraceptive measures (for

             sterilization (vasectomy, tubal ligation, etc.)) and barrier methods (combined use of
             spermicides and condom, contraceptive vaginal diaphragm, contraceptive sponge or
             cervical cap) that are allowed for clinical trials in the period between the first
             administration of the investigational drugs and the last visit.
