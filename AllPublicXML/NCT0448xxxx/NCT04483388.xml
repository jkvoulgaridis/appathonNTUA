      The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of training with Virtual Reality in
      the movement range of children with Cerebral Palsy spastic hemiparetic.The study protocol
      consisted of two days of training and 1 revaluation. The training A (Nintendo Wii®) and B
      (standard protocol) were randomized the children in AB and BA sequences, with one week
      interval. Immediately kinematics pre and post-training was held and after a week no
      significant changes were observed for the angular variables and space-time between groups.
      The Virtual Reality used for intervention to improve upper arm function in children with
      Cerebral Palsy is still a relatively new method.

      Introduction: The disability of upper limb function (MS) of children with Cerebral Palsy (CP)
      spastic hemiparetic restricts their participation in social activities. Virtual reality (VR)
      has shown promising results in functional recovery of this population, however, few studies
      have evaluated its effectiveness in the reaching of motion of these children. Objective: To
      assess the effects of training with VR in the movement range of children with CP spastic
      hemiparetic. Materials and Methods: We conducted a randomized crossover trial, where the
      sample consisted of 12 children diagnosed with CP hemiparetic, both genders, with a mean age
      of 9.63 ± 2.3 years. The sample description was performed by assessing muscle tone, range of
      motion, grip strength, functional performance and disability. Kinematic analysis of the upper
      limb was performed by Qualisys Motion Capture System®. The study protocol consisted of two
      days of training and 1 revaluation. The training A (Nintendo Wii®) and B (standard protocol)
      were randomized the children in AB and BA sequences, with one week interval. Immediately
      kinematics pre and post-training was held and after a week. Data were analyzed using SPSS
      20.0 (Statistical Package for Social Science) assigning a 5% significance level. The
      kinematic variables were analyzed by two-way ANOVA for repeated measures.

    <description>We used a standardized 3D-analysis protocol to evaluate upper limb kinematic. The evaluation was divided into two stages: static collection and dynamics. In static collection, the patient was seated on a bench with feet on the floor, so that a 90 ° angle hip, knee and ankle joints. A table was positioned at a distance of 100% of the length of the affected upper arm and at the height of the xiphoid process and were used 19 mm reflective markers at the following points anatomical. In the dynamic evaluation, the participant continued to sit on the bench, with arms at the side of the torso, maintaining 90 ° elbow flexion and hand on the table was asked to touch a cube. All children started reach movement with the unaffected limb. Therefore, 15 reaches per child in each member in total and it was performed one minute intervals between attempts. The following variables: duration of movement, peak velocity and angular variation of shoulder and elbow.</description>

    <description>Computed virtual reality therapy was performed using the Nintendo Wii® console equipment. This system allows interaction with the player by means of a movement detection system and the representation of his avatar graphical representation of a user in virtual reality. It has a remote control with a wireless system, responsible for capturing the speed, direction , acceleration and deceleration of movement. The movements performed by the player are captured and reproduced on a screen via an infrared light sensor, positioned above the TV. The feedback given by the TV provides the movement itself observing opportunity in real time, generating positive reinforcement and facilitating training and improved task. The software used in this study was the Nintendo Wii Sports.</description>
