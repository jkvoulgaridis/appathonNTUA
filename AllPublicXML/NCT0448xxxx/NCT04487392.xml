  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Menopause is a physiological event and is defined as the loss of ovarian follicular activity,
      with consequent permanent cessation of menstrual cycles. Its diagnosis is made
      retrospectively after 12 months of amenorrhea, with no pathological cause involved. This
      period is marked by several changes in the female organism, mainly the genitourinary syndrome
      (GUS), which is a collection of signs and symptoms resulting from the state of
      hypoestrogenism. Almost half of postmenopausal women will experience symptoms of GUS, with
      vaginal dryness being the most prevalent, followed by dyspareunia and vulvovaginal
      irritation. The aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of photobiomodulation with red LED
      (ligth emitting diode) on the symptoms of vulvovaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women. A
      randomized and controlled clinical trial will be developed, which will include postmenopausal
      women with signs and symptoms of vulvovaginal atrophy. Participants will be allocated into
      two groups: those who will undergo photobiomodulation with intravaginal LED, and those who
      will receive vaginal cream with estriol. Objective and subjective improvement of atrophy will
      be assessed using the Vaginal Health Index and the visual analog scale, respectively. Vaginal
      pH, cell maturation index and changes in sexual function through the Female Sexual Function
      Index questionnaire will also be assessed. The variables will be analyzed at the time of
      admission, in one and three months after the intervention.

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Vaginal Health Index: an objective assessment will be performed using the parameters of the Vaginal Health Index, in which elasticity, fluid volume, pH, epithelial integrity and moisture are evaluated. Each aspect evaluated receives a score, which varies from 1 to 5. The score can vary from 5 to 25, being considered a diagnosis of vulvovaginal atrophy when the values are less than or equal to 15. This evaluation will be performed by a qualified gynecologist during the exam physicist.</description>

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Visual Analog scale: the assessment of vulvovaginal atrophy symptoms will be made using the visual analog scale. The patient will receive a ruler with markings from 0 to 10, one end of which indicates complete absence of symptoms and the other indicates the worst possible symptom. This assessment will be applied to each of the symptoms: dyspareunia, dryness, irritation.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Vaginal pH</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The evaluation of the vaginal pH will be performed through the pH indicator strip, which when inserted in the middle third of the vagina in contact with the mucosa, has the color of the strip changed.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Female Sexual Function Index</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The quality of the participants' sexual activity will be assessed through the questionnaire validated for the Portuguese &quot;Female Sexual Function Index&quot;. This questionnaire is a brief and self-applied instrument that assesses the female sexual response in the last four weeks in relation to sexual desire, vaginal lubrication, orgasm, sexual satisfaction and pain.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Vaginal Cell Maturation Index</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Also known as Frost Index, whose aim is to assess the hormonal influence in women by counting the epithelial cells of the vagina. The frequencies of parabasal, intermediate and superficial cells are evaluated. For this, a scraping of the lateral wall of the vagina is performed with a spatula, in order to obtain vaginal cells for cytology. The cells will be fixed on a slide and later colored with HE (Hematoxylin-Eosin) for analysis and counting.</description>

    <description>The participants selected for group B will be undergo photobiomodulation with red LED. With the participant in the lithotomy position, the speculum will be introduced into the vaginal canal and a vaginal wash with 0.9% saline will be performed to remove secretions. Afterwards, the speculum will be removed and the device with a red LED inserted up to about 6 cm from the introitus. A non-lubricated condom will be used in the LED device for patient protection. Sessions will take place once a week for 4 weeks.</description>
