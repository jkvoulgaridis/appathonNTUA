      Eligible Glaucoma patients will undergo pre-surgery examination including:

      medicines list, blood tests and ECG. On surgery day: intraocular pressure (IOP) will be
      measured. Then a sub-conjunctival injection of Mitomycin C will be administered .

      The Minimally Invasive Micro Sclerostomy (MIMS) procedure is designed to create a drainage
      channel at the sclera-corneal junction by penetrating through the wall [scleral tissue] .
      MIMS procedure may be combined with cataract surgery.

      Patients will be followed up to 24 weeks post operation.

      Eligible patients will have ECG and blood test up to 30 days prior to the MIMS procedure.

      Description of MIMS procedure:

      on surgery day, intraocular pressure (IOP) will be measured. Then a sub-conjunctival
      injection of Mitomycin C will be administered .

      creating drainage channel at the sclera-corneal junction by penetrating through the wall
      [scleral tissue].MIMS procedure may be combined with cataract surgery.

      Post-operatively the patient will be treated with dexamethasone-neomycin drops for at least
      one month.

      Patients will be followed up to 24 weeks post operation.

      The following measurements will be included:

        -  Intra Ocular Pressure (IOP)

        -  Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA)

        -  Slit Lamp Biomicroscopic evaluation

        -  Anterior Segment Optical coherence tomography (OCT)

        -  Fundus Examination
