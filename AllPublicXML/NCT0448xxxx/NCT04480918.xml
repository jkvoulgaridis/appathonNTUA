  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of interventional/procedural therapies
      for treatment-resistant depression (TRD). These treatments include electroconvulsive therapy
      (ECT), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), racemic ketamine infusion and intranasal
      esketamine insufflation. The investigators will obtain various indicators, or biomarkers, of
      a depressed individuals' state before, during, and/or after these treatments. Such biomarkers
      include neurobehavioral testing, neuroimaging, electroencephalography, cognitive testing,
      vocal recordings, epi/genetic testing, and autonomic nervous system measures (i.e.
      &quot;fight-or-flight&quot; response). The results obtained from this study may provide novel
      antidepressant treatment response biomarkers, with the future goal of targeting a given
      treatment to an individual patient (&quot;personalized medicine&quot;).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment response biomarkers in TRD have been and will remain an active area of research.
      Interventional treatments in psychiatry, e.g. ECT, TMS, racemic ketamine infusions and
      intranasal esketamine insufflations, offer exciting opportunities for biomarker discovery due
      their procedural nature (obviating concerns for treatment non-adherence in non-supervised
      settings), more rapid-onset, and larger effect sizes than typically seen with traditional
      antidepressant medications or evidence-based psychotherapies. Although no well-replicated TRD
      biomarkers have been approved for standard clinical use, several potential biomarkers have
      been investigated across multiple modalities, i.e. neuroimaging(1,2), autonomic
      function(3,4), genetics(5-7), electroencephalography (EEG) (8,9), and computational analysis
      of behavior or speech(10). These studies have promising early results but often insufficient
      predictive power at the subject-level. The investigators anticipate that combinatorial,
      multimodal biomarkers will enhance predictive power and, as a result, improve treatment
      personalization in major depression.

      The University of Iowa Interventional Psychiatry Service Patient Registry systematically
      collects data from TRD patients undergoing procedural treatment(s) for major depression.
      First, the investigators seek to replicate and/or extend discoveries from prior
      investigations, e.g. TMS-induced autonomic changes as positive predictors of antidepressant
      efficacy. The investigators will also compare and contrast differences, not only in response
      to a given therapy, but also how individual subjects respond across different treatment
      modalities, e.g. how does functional connectivity in the brain change in response to an
      effective course of TMS as opposed to ECT? Such findings could inform the future development
      of clinical guidelines; this is especially critical as some of these treatment modalities
      have only recently been approved for TRD by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, e.g.
      intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) and intranasal esketamine insufflation.

      Next, a longitudinal database may also be valuable for future biomarker discovery and/or
      replication in independent samples, i.e. an epigenetic signature of antidepressant treatment
      response to an interventional modality identified by another research group. Similarly, this
      patient registry could be valuable for collaborative research with other institutions
      administering interventional treatments in psychiatry.

    <measure>Montgomery-Ã…sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) Pre-Post Change</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-assessment will be obtained within approximately 1 week of starting treatment. Post-assessment will be obtained as close as possible following completion of treatment course (usually 4-6 weeks later).</time_frame>
    <description>The MADRS contains 10 items, and each item is scored 0-6. These item scores are summed to create a scale score; thus, scale scores range from 0 to 60. A scale score of 0 indicates the absence of depressive symptoms, while a score of 60 indicates severe depression. The primary outcome is the mean change in total MADRS score. A decrease in the mean MADRS score indicates a decrease (or improvement) in depressive symptoms, whereas an increase in the mean MADRS score indicates an increase (or worsening) in depressive symptoms.</description>

    <time_frame>Pre-assessment will be obtained within approximately 1 week of starting treatment. Post-assessment will be obtained as close as possible following completion of treatment course (usually 4-6 weeks later).</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI is a clinician-measured scale of 3 items: Severity of Illness (item 1), Global Improvement (item 2), and Efficacy Index (item 3). Items 1 and 2 are rated on a 7-point Likert scale (1=normal, 7=among the most extremely ill patients) with a possible response of &quot;not assessed.&quot; Item 3 is rated on a 4-point Likert scale from &quot;none&quot; to &quot;outweighs therapeutic effect.&quot; Items 1 and 3 are assessed in relation to last clinical encounter (if possible).</description>

        Adult patients (18-99 years old) in a current major depressive episode in the context of
        major depressive disorder (MDD) or bipolar disorder (BD) will be recruited for this
        protocol. All treatment will be in addition to the patient's clinical care with the
        University of Iowa's Interventional Psychiatry Service for treatment-resistant major
        depression, and the decision to participate, withdraw from participation or not participate
        will if not affect clinical care decision-making. We appreciate that minority groups tend
        to be underrepresented in neuropsychiatric research studies. Therefore, we will make a
        concerted effort to keep the proportion of racial/ethnic minorities recruited consistent
        with the demographics of the surrounding communities.
