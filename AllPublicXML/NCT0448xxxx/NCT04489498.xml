    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to: 1) secure basic data of patients with cerebral palsy, 2)
      seek ways to simplify the data for clinical application, 3) progress of hip dislocation,
      presence or absence of hip surgery, and The purpose of this study is to compare differences
      in body development according to severity and nutritional methods.

        It is difficult to find the basis for calculation because there are no papers that measure
        the body size of children with cerebral palsy and papers that compare with normal children.
        In particular, children with cerebral palsy are rare diseases, and it is difficult to
        recruit a large number of subjects.
