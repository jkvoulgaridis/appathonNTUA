  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The potential effects of microbiota in bipolar disorder (BD) with microbiota-related
      dysfunction have not yet been explored clinically, and the integration of microbiota and
      pharmacometabolomic approaches can provide us the identification of the significant effects
      of mood stabilizers on metabolic homeostasis, treatment response, and cognitive performance.
      Therefore, we propose to develop the integration of the microbiota and pharmacometabolomics
      knowledge base about the mood stabilizer-induced metabolic abnormalities in BD patients.
