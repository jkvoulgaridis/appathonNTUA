  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal was to compare clinical and immunological versus clinical, immunological plus
      viral load criteria for switching to second-line ART by comparing 48 week treatment outcomes,
      including survival rates, viral suppression, failure to thrive, and AIDS-defining illnesses
      for treatment experienced children randomized to two switching criteria.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of the study was aimed at determining whether the use of the current WHO
      criteria alone (clinical and immunologic) to define treatment failure as the trigger for
      switching to second-line antiretroviral therapy leads to poorer 6 month and 12 month
      treatment outcomes when compared to combining clinical and immunologic parameters with viral
      load (VL) monitoring.

      In addition the study aimed at obtaining plasma samples from treatment experienced children,
      for future resistance testing. The results of this study may help guide WHO and national
      pediatric ART programs on the need for routine VL monitoring for children initiating HAART in
      resource limited settings, where virologic tests including resistance testing are not readily
      available or affordable.
