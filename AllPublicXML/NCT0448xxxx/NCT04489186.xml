  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a disease without a primary cure that requires lifelong care and is
      characterized by pulmonary exacerbations (PEx). Wearable devices could provide a way for
      long-term monitoring of disease progression and early signs of PEx to intervene as early as
      possible, thereby improving long-term outcomes.

      This in-hospital feasibility study will assess the ability of Byteflies Sensor Dots to
      collect relevant cardiorespiratory data in people with CF and its compatibility with clinical
      workflows, 2) identify candidate digital biomarkers, and 3) collect user feedback from
      patients and healthcare providers.
