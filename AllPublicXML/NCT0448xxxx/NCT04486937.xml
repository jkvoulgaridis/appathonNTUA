    <textblock>
      This study is a multicenter, single arm phase I / II clinical study in mCRPC subjects who
      failed to receive docetaxel chemotherapy, abitolone acetate and / or enzalutamide (including
      its analogues) for the treatment of BRCA mutations in germ cells and / or somatic cells.

      The subjects oral administration sc10914 tablets 400mg on an empty stomach, three times a
      day, for 28 consecutive days as a treatment cycle, until disease progression (PD) (according
      to Recist1.1 and the adjusted PCWG3 standard, the subjects met the imaging [CT / MRI / bone
      scan] PD standard) or the toxicity was intolerable.

      The study is divided into two stages: in the first stage,enrolled 36 patients whose response
      can be evaluated, if there are at least 7 cases of objective remission (CR or PR), the second
      stage is allowed, otherwise the study will be stopped; in the second stage, the number of
      subjects whose response can be evaluated is planned to continue to be enrolled to 70
      cases（stage 1 and stage 2）.
