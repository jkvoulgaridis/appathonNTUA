  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to determine if implementing structured exercises prevent decline
      in muscle mass, muscle strength and physical function in men with prostate cancer undergoing
      androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).

    <textblock>
      This randomized, controlled, parallel group trial of 6-months duration is determining the
      efficacy of structured resistance exercise training in preventing the decline in physical
      function in older men with prostate cancer undergoing androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). It
      will compare the structured resistance exercise training with a control group of men
      undergoing flexibility and balance exercises training.

      Men undergoing ADT for treatment of their prostate cancer experience a significant decline in
      muscle mass and muscle strength, which impacts their physical function. This predisposes them
      to frailty and a higher risk of falls. In addition to physical dysfunction, men undergoing
      ADT also experience a significant decrease in health-related quality of life and experience
      fatigue (tiredness). This research study is taking a preventative approach to the physical
      function problems in men with prostate cancer by implementing exercise interventions before
      participants begin ADT that are specifically designed to improve muscle mass, muscle strength
      and physical function to lessen the impacts of muscle mass and strength decline. The study
      includes a screening visit during which eligibility will be ascertained. If qualified,
      participants will undergo DEXA scans, perform muscle strength testing and complete
      questionnaires at baseline, 3- and 6-month visits. Participants will be randomly assigned to
      two different types of structured exercises: Resistance exercise training or flexibility and
      balance exercises.

      It is expected participants will be in this research study for up to 6 months. It is expected
      that about 40 people will take part in this research study.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men with PCa (60 years and older) who are about to undergo ADT(men on additional
             chemotherapeutic drugs such as enzalutamide and abiraterone and those undergoing
             radiation therapy will be eligible as long as they are on GnRH agonists or
             antagonists).

          -  Planned ADT for at least 6 months.

          -  Life expectancy of at least 6 months from enrollment (men with locally-advanced or
             high-risk prostate cancers will be eligible as long as expected life expectancy is at
             least 6 months).

        Exclusion Criteria:
