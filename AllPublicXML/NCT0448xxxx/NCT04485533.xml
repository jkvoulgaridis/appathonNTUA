  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a post-market, european multicenter study. This is a randomized, cross-over, double
      blind study with competitive enrolment, aimed to enroll a total of 90 patients with a
      diagnosis of moderate dry eye disease (DED).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the non-inferiority of the new treatment versus the
      comparator.

      Patients, after signing the Informed Consent, will enter into a 1-week screening phase during
      which the baseline tests will be conducted.

      Baseline (V0), Day 30 ± 1 week (V1), Day 38 ± 2 days (V2), Day 68 ±1 week (V3) of treatment.

      Between V1 and V2 one week of wash out should be performed. Of note, all ophthalmologic
      evaluations listed in the Flow-Chart will be performed on both eyes of the patient.
