  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The conventional intersphincteric resection (ISR) for low rectal cancer requires a combined
      abdominal and perineal approach, and followed with a handsewn coloanal anastomosis, which is
      time consuming and difficult to accomplish. A complete laparoscopic abdominal approach
      partial intersphincteric resection has been proved to be a safe and feasible alternative for
      low rectal cancer treatment, with the advantages of technical convenience and avoiding a
      permanent ostomy. But there are few reports concerning differences in clinical outcomes
      between patients with or without neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy undergoing partial ISR
      surgery. Therefore, it is necessary to compare the functional outcomes (including anal and
      sexual function, and postoperative quality of life [QOL]) and oncologic outcomes of patients
      who underwent completely abdominal approach laparoscopic partial ISR surgery after
      neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, with those who received ISR surgery directly. Furthermore, the
      operation difficulty between the above two groups is also worthy of intensive study.

    <textblock>
      Patients with cT1 to cT2 low rectal cancer are directly operated through completely abdominal
      approach laparoscopic partial ISR surgery. Patients with cT3 low rectal cancer are firstly
      treated with standard neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy until down staged to ycT1 to ycT2. The
      postoperatively functional outcomes and oncologic outcomes between the two groups are
      compared, including anal and sexual function, QOL and local recurrence rate. The operation
      difficulty between the above two groups is also investigated, including operation time, the
      intraoperative and postoperative complications, mesorectum integrity, time for mobilizing the
      intersphincteric plane, the intactness of the fascia of the levator ani muscle, pubis
      coccygeus, puborectalis, and external sphincter.
