      -  Thoracic incisions are painful and associated with chronic post-surgical pain and
           inadequate analgesia is associated with poorer postoperative outcomes. Recent progress
           has been made in the field of thoracic anesthesia by improving analgesic modalities such
           as PECS 1 and PECS 2, intercostal plane block, paravertebral regional anesthesia,
           ultrasound-guided erector spinae and serratus anterior plane block.

        -  Administered of the local anesthetic in erector spinae plane block is in the
           interfascial plane between the transverse process of the vertebra and the erector spinae
           muscles, spreading to multiple paravertebral spaces. It affects both the ventral and
           dorsal rami and leading to blockage of both visceral and somatic pain.

        -  Ultrasound-guided serratus anterior plane block is a facial plane block that provides
           analgesia by blocking of lateral branches of intercostal nerves above or below the
           serratus plane muscle.

        -  We hypothesize that the ultrasound-guided erector spinae plane block may have better
           quality than the serratus anterior plane block for patients undergoing thoracoscopic
           sympathectomy as erector spinea plane blocks visceral and somatic pain.

      Primary palmar hyperhidrosis (PPH) refers to the excessive secretion of exocrine glands on
      the palms, which is often accompanied by the head, face, or plantar hyperhidrosis. PPH
      demonstrates no obvious organic cause; however, some patients may feel distressed because
      their palms sweat more than normal, and such a situation may lead to severe psychological,
      social, and occupational dysfunction.

      Endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy abolishes eccrine sweating in all areas supplied by the
      postganglionic fibers with its complications which include post-sympathetic neuralgia which
      is the most important, wound infection, hemorrhage, pneumothorax, horner syndrome, no
      response to the operation and compensatory hyperhidrosis in non-denervated areas.

      Forero described ultrasound-guided erector spinae plane block for treatment of thoracic
      neuropathic pain and explained it as a peri-paravertebral regional anesthesia technique that
      has been used for prevention of postoperative pain in various surgeries.

      Ultrasound-guided serratus anterior plane block is a facial plane block which provides
      analgesia by blocking of lateral branches of intercostal nerves above or below the serratus
      plane muscle. There are few cases and studies in the literature reporting successful
      analgesia provided by serratus anterior plane block
