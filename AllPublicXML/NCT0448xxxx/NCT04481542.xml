  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We prospectively collected information on consecutive patients who had been evaluated using
      4D PC-MRI for aortic pathology in a tertiary hospital between April 2018 and Feb 2020.
      Patients were eligible for inclusion in the study if they had a clinical indication for CTA
      of aortic dissections.

      The exclusion criteria were non-MRI-compatible ferromagnetic devices and pregnancy. In
      addition, patients with poor compliance and with unstable status that prevented them from
      lying down for the MRI protocol were excluded. Initially, 26 patients evaluated. One patient
      was excluded due to fever at the scheduled time, and another was unable to lie down due to
      complicated spine disease. All patients underwent CTA scan on a 64-slice multidetector
      scanner (Somatom Sensation 64; Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany) with the intravenous
      administration of contrast media, followed by 4D PC-MRI to assess aortic pathology
