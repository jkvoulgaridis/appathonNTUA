  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is conducted to evaluate importance of bispectral index (BIS) monitoring in
      patients undergoing strabismus surgery when using propofol in comparison to sevoflurane
      anesthesia regarding their effects on oculocardiac reflex, intraoperative hemodynamic
      stability, emergence agitation, postoperative pain, nausea and vomiting.

    <textblock>
      Strabismus surgery can cause unfavorable side effects during intraoperative and postoperative
      periods including increased risk of the oculocardiac reflex, hemodynamic instability,
      emergence agitation, postoperative pain, nausea and vomiting. Sevoflurane is an inhalation
      anesthetic widely used in pediatric anesthesia with minimal airway irritation. Propofol is an
      intravenous sedative-hypnotic agent with amnestic properties that causes loss of
      consciousness. Bispectral index monitor provide some more evidence that deeper anesthesia can
      provide some protection against the oculocardiac reflex. Therefore, this study is conducted
      to evaluate the role of BIS monitoring in comparing the use of propofol and sevoflurane
      anesthesia in pediatric strabismus surgery.

      This prospective, randomized, comparative clinical study will include 100 children who are
      scheduled for elective strabismus surgery under general anesthesia in Mansoura ophthalmology
      center. Informed written consent is obtained from parents of all subjects in the study after
      ensuring confidentiality. The study protocol is explained to parents of all patients in the
      study who are kept fasting prior to surgery. Patients are randomly assigned to two equal
      groups according to computer-generated table of random numbers using the permuted block
      randomization method. The collected data are coded, processed, and analyzed using SPSS
      program. All data are considered statistically significant if P value is â‰¤ 0.05.
