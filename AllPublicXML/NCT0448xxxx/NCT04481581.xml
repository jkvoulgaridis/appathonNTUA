  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fractional oxygen during mechanical ventilation, is a life sustaining therapy in the
      intensive care unit , used for about a million patients annually. Oxygen therapy needs to be
      tightly balanced as both hypoxia and hyperoxia are harmful. Establishing precision in
      oxygenation has significant implications for improving patient outcomes, resource utilization
      and reducing iatrogenic harm to a vulnerable population. The investigators propose an
      approach using a oxygen titration protocol consisting of electronic health records based
      alerts to guide oxygen adjustment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a prospective randomized, clinical trial in the Medical
      Intensive Care Unit at Ohio State University Medical Center. In the intervention arm,
      respiratory therapists' will conduct oxygen titration with the help of a novel, high
      fidelity, electronic health records based, protocol consisting of electronic alerts and
      decision support tool. Oxygen titration in the control arm will be done without alerts and
      will be per &quot;current standard of care&quot;.

      Participants for this study will be identified and recruited from patients admitted to the
      Ohio State University, Wexner Medical Center and James Cancer Hospital, Medical Intensive
      Care Unit..
