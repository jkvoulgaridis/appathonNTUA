  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hand and upper extremity injuries are among the most common causes of admission of children
      to the emergency department since they are the most frequently injured part of body following
      head in pediatric and adolescent population. Although upper extremity fractures and
      contusions are the main reasons of pediatric hand injuries, tendon injuries are not also
      uncommon. There are limited data in the literature about the long-term results of children
      with flexor tendon injury. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term
      functional outcomes of children with flexor tendon injury.

      Hand and upper extremity injuries are among the most common causes of admission of children
      to the emergency department since they are the most frequently injured part of body following
      head in pediatric and adolescent population. Although upper extremity fractures and
      contusions are the main reasons of pediatric hand injuries, tendon injuries are not also
      uncommon. While extensor tendon injuries have been reported to be most frequent than flexor
      tendon injuries for all age groups, the ratio of flexor to extensor tendon injuries is higher
      in pediatric population than adults and in children younger than 10 years old flexor tendon
      injuries are more common than extensor tendon injuries.Despite some challenges in the
      treatment of flexor tendon injuries of children, the outcomes have been reported to be better
      in children than adults since they have better blood supply, more rapid tendon healing and
      better remodeling ability of scars and adhesions. However, there is still a risk of permanent
      morbidities such as significant scarring and stiffness which can cause worse functional
      outcomes.There are limited data in the literature about the long-term results of children
      with flexor tendon injury. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term
      functional outcomes of children with flexor tendon injury.

    <measure>Jebson Taylor Hand Function test</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0</time_frame>
    <description>Jebsen - Taylor Hand Function Test (JTHFT) was performed on both hands for evaluation of the fine and gross motor functions. It is a standard and objective assessment method of hand functions with activities similar to those performed in daily life. The test consists of 7 subtests. During the test, a separate period is kept for each step. The functions of both hands are evaluated by the following operations; writing, card turning, picking up small common objects, simulated feeding, stacking backgammon-checkers, moving large light objects and moving large heavy objects. Score of each subset is time (seconds) to complete the task and total score is calculated by summing of times for each sub-tests</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Grip strength</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0</time_frame>
    <description>The grip strength measured using a Baseline Hydraulic Hand Dynamometer according to the recommendations of the American Hand Therapists Association.. It was measured with the shoulder in the adduction, elbow 90 * flexion, forearm neutral and wrist 0-30 * dorsiflexion and 0-15 * ulnar deviation while the person was sitting position. The patient was asked to grasp the dynamometer as tightly as he could. For each side, 3 applications were made with an interval of 20 seconds and the average of these measurements was taken</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pinch Strength</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0</time_frame>
    <description>Baseline Hydraulic Pinch Gauge was used to measure pinch strength. The measurement was made in the same position as the grip strength measurement. The pinch gauge was placed between the tip of thumb and the tip of the index finger and the patient was asked to squeeze as strongly as he could. For each side, 3 applications were made with an interval of 20 seconds and the average of these measurements was taken</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Semmes -Weinstein Monofilament test</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0</time_frame>
    <description>Sensory examination was done with Semmes -Weinstein Monofilament test. This evaluation was started with the smallest monofilament and larger filaments were applied respectively, the test was stopped in the smallest monofilament the patient felt, and this value was recorded. Evaluations were made from the distal tips of the 1st and 2nd finger and the palmar surface of the 2nd metacarpophalangeal joint for the median nerve evaluation (monofilament test 1,2,3, respectively), distal tip of the 5th finger, the palmar surface of the 5th metacarpophalangeal joint and hypothenar area (monofilament test 4, 5, 6, respectively) for ulnar nerve evaluation.</description>
