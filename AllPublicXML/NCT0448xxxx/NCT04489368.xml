  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In esophageal carcinoma, neoadjuvant concurrent chemo-radiotherapy (NA-CCRT) followed by
      surgery is the current standard of care and ample evidence has accumulated supporting the
      view that complete pathological response (pCR) is a positive prognostic marker for improved
      outcomes. Predicting the probability of achieving pCR prior to neoadjuvant treatment could
      permit modification of treatment protocols for those patients unlikely to achieve pCR.

      Radiomics is a new entrant in the field of imaging where specific features are derived from
      the intensity and distribution pattern of pixels based on a region-of-interest (ROI). The
      features thus extracted can then be used for prediction modelling similar to other -omics
      datasets. Preliminary investigations examining its utility have been performed and its
      applications have thus far focused on screening and survival prediction after treatment. Due
      to the multi-dimensional nature of data extracted using radiomics, Artificial Intelligence
      (AI) methods are ideally suited for analysing and modelling radiomic features.

      Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL)[utilising Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)]
      are both part of the AI framework. In contrast to ML, DL is a new entrant and has been
      utilised by some medical researchers for modelling using prediction-type algorithms. Besides
      significantly reducing the workflow associated with Radiomics-based research, feature
      engineering and modelling using DL are immune to the effects of incorrect ROI delineation.
      However, the main limitation of DL is the 'blackbox' effect, in which the underlying basis of
      a CNN is not known. This has been mitigated in part by the visualisation of activation maps
      directly on the image dataset to prove biological plausibility of predictions. The
      comparative performance of both types of modelling is also not known.

      Our objective is to investigate pCR probability in our study population using radiomics-based
      ML and AI-based modelling. We will also investigate the comparative performance of both
      modelling techniques. For DL based prediction modelling, we will attempt to provide
      biological plausibility on the basis of activation maps.
