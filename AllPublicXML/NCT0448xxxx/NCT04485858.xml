      Prospective, open label, single arm, First in Human (FIH) clinical study to assess safety and
      efficacy of the CorNeat Keratoprosthesis, a synthetic cornea, for the treatment of corneal
      blindness

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this clinical study is to prove the safety and effectiveness of the CorNeat
      Keratoprosthesis (KPro), a synthetic, artificial cornea for or the treatment of corneal
      blindness in subjects who are not candidates for traditional corneal transplant.

      Ten subjects who are willing to take part in the study will undergo screening examinations to
      verify their eligibility.

      The CorNeat KPro will be implanted unilaterally in eligible subjects. Follow up procedures
      will be performed at 1 day, 1 week, 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 &amp; 12 months post implantation and will
      include clinical assessment of the implanted eye using slit-lamp biomicroscopy, intra ocular
      pressure measurement and ocular imaging. Additionally, subjects' visual acuity will be
      assessed and recorded throughout the 12 months follow up period.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female aged ≥ 18 and ≤ 80 years on the day of screening

          -  Candidates must have the ability and willingness to attend all scheduled visits and
             comply with all study procedures

          -  Keratoprosthesis surgery is indicated in cases when keratoplasty is not a reasonable
             option or following a verifiable history of prior failed corneal transplantation

          -  Indications that fall under poor candidate for keratoplasty include but are not
             limited to: herpetic keratitis, vascularized corneal scar, Ocular Cicatricial
             Pemphigoid, alkali burn, Steven Johnson Syndrome, and limbal stem cell deficiency

          -  Pseudophakia

          -  Adequate tear film and lid function

          -  Perception of light in all quadrants

          -  Female patients of childbearing age must have negative pregnancy test at screening and
             agree to use an effective method of contraception throughout the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Reasonable chance of success with traditional keratoplasty

          -  Current retinal detachment

          -  Connective tissue diseases

          -  End-stage glaucoma

          -  History or evidence of severe inflammatory eye diseases (i.e. uveitis, retinitis,
             scleritis) in one or both eyes within 6 months prior to planned implantation

          -  Severe generalized disease that results in a life expectancy shorter than a year

          -  Any clinical evidence that the investigator feels would place the subject at increased
             risk with the placement of the device

          -  Corneal thickness less than 400 or higher than 1,200 microns in any region of the
