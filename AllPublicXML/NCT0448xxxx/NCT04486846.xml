  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this single institution pilot study is to determine the feasibility of
      implementing an eHealth prostate cancer surveillance program through the eVisit electronic
      medical record patient portal. The investigators will assess patient compliance and
      satisfaction with eVisit follow up care in lieu of in person clinic visits.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Telehealth offers the opportunity to transform cancer surveillance into a patient-centered
      effort with shared leadership between patient and oncologist. Peer-to-peer electronic
      communications can improve the collaboration between oncologist and primary care provider
      (PCP) as patients transition back to primary care as their primary health provider. The
      investigators propose to test a patient-centered eHealth surveillance program utilizing novel
      asynchronous telehealth tools to provide patient-reported outcome symptom monitoring using
      the electronic medical record's patient portal (eVisit).
