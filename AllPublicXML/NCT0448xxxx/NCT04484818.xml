    <textblock>
      This phase III trial compares the effect of adding darolutamide to ADT versus ADT alone after
      surgery for the treatment of high-risk prostate cancer. ADT reduces testosterone levels in
      the blood. Testosterone is a hormone made mainly in the testes and is needed to develop and
      maintain male sex characteristics, such as facial hair, deep voice, and muscle growth. It
      also plays role in prostate cancer development. Darolutamide blocks the actions of the
      androgens (e.g. testosterone) in the tumor cells and in the body. Giving darolutamide with
      ADT may work better in eliminating or reducing the size of the cancer and/or prevent it from
      returning compared to ADT alone in patients with prostate cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine whether 12 months of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and darolutamide
      improves metastasis-free survival (MFS) compared to 12 months of ADT plus placebo in men with
      high risk prostate cancer (defined by Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment Post-surgical
      [CAPRA-S] score &gt;= 3 and a high Decipher score (&gt;= 0.6) [C3+D+]) who have undergone radical
      prostatectomy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether 12 months of ADT and darolutamide improves recurrence-free survival
      (RFS) compared to 12 months of ADT plus placebo in men with high-risk prostate cancer that
      have undergone radical prostatectomy.

      II. To determine whether 12 months of ADT and darolutamide improves event-free survival (EFS)
      compared to 12 months of ADT plus placebo in men with high-risk prostate cancer that have
      undergone radical prostatectomy.

      III. To determine whether 12 months of ADT and darolutamide improves overall survival (OS)
      compared to 12 months of ADT plus placebo in men with high-risk prostate cancer that have
      undergone radical prostatectomy.

      IV. To determine the rate of testosterone recovery and time to testosterone recovery in each
      treatment arm.

      V. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of ADT and darolutamide.

      CORRELATIVE OBJECTIVES FOR EXPLORATORY BIOMARKERS:

      I. To discover a novel gene expression signature in the Decipher transcriptome platforms that
      is predictive of clinical outcome, as defined by the primary and secondary objectives of this
      study, in response to ADT by intensification with darolutamide versus ADT alone.

      II. To assess the prevalence of subclasses of established transcriptome expression signatures
      and prospectively validate their predictive value for ADT response, these include: (i)
      androgen (AR) activity (ii) Basal-luminal subtyping based on modified PAM50, and (iii) ADT
      score.

      III. To assess whether the spectrum of high Decipher scores (0.6-1.0), prostate-specific
      antigen (PSA) levels at presentation and post-radical prostatectomy (RP) and final pathology
      variables affect the response and outcome to ADT and darolutamide.

      QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare overall quality of life, measured by Functional Assessment of Cancer
      Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P) total score, at 18 months between the two arms. (Primary) II. To
      compare the change in overall quality of life, measured by FACT-P total score, from baseline
      to 18 months between the two arms. (Secondary) III. To compare patient-reported fatigue
      (Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy [FACIT]-Fatigue scores) at 12 months
      between the two treatment arms. (Secondary) IV. To compare the change in subjective
      patient-reported cognitive function (FACT-Cognitive [Cog]) from baseline to 12 months between
      the treatment arms. (Exploratory) V. To compare subjective patient-reported cognitive
      function (FACT-Cog scores) at 12 months between the two treatment arms. (Exploratory)

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive goserelin acetate, leuprolide acetate, or triptorelin via injection
      every 3 months for 12 months (4 injections), every 4 months for 12 months (3 injections), or
      every month for 12 months (12 injections) in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive a placebo four times daily (QID) for 52 weeks in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive goserelin acetate, leuprolide acetate, or triptorelin via injection
      every 3 months for 12 months (4 injections), every 4 months for 12 months (3 injections), or
      every month for 12 months (12 injections) in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive darolutamide QID for 52 weeks in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 36 months.

    <description>Will include androgen receptor activity, basal-luminal subtyping by modified PAM50 and androgen deprivation therapy score using Cox proportional hazards models. Similar analysis will be performed to evaluate the prognostic value of luminal-basal subtype. The treatment-by-subtype interaction will also be assessed. For androgen deprivation therapy score, patients will be categorized into either low or high androgen deprivation therapy score using a cutoff of 0.36.</description>

    <measure>Decipher scores</measure>

    <description>Will be associated with MFS as well as disease characteristics. Cox proportional hazards models will be performed with adjustment for important disease characteristics, including prostate-specific antigen, Gleason score, disease stage, pathology of the radical prostatectomy specimen, etc. Decipher score could be categorized into a few risk groups and the Akaike information criterion method will be used to determine the optimal number of cutoff points. To assess whether treatment effect is affected by Decipher score levels, the treatment-by-Decipher interactions will be included in the model as well.</description>

    <measure>Genome-wide alterations</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>Prostate cancer specimens will be banked for future studies to perform genome-wide alterations in coding and non-coding deoxyribonucleic acid sequences. To identify the genetic alterations that are associated with development of metastasis, Cox proportional hazards models and logrank test will be used. The analysis will focus on actionable alterations first. The treatment-by-alteration interactions will also be assessed to determine whether response to darolutamide is affected by distinct genomic subgroups. Ultimately the findings on gene expression signatures and deoxyribonucleic acid alterations will be assessed in the models simultaneously to identify subsets of patients who might benefit most from the treatment of ADT with or without darolutamide.</description>

             to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure (New York Heart
             Association class III and IV heart failure), unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR RANDOMIZATION (STEP 1)

          -  Patient must not have pre or post-operative radiographic evidence of cancer recurrence
             or metastasis by abdominal and pelvic imaging (computed tomography [CT]
             abdomen/pelvis, whole body magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], MRI abdomen/pelvis, or
             equivalent, AND bone scan) which must be done before or after prostatectomy prior to
             randomization. If pre-operative risk does not indicate a need for bone scan,
             post-operative Decipher score of &gt;= 0.6 indicates increased risk of metastatic disease
             and may be used to obtain CT abdomen/pelvis and bone scan prior to randomization
