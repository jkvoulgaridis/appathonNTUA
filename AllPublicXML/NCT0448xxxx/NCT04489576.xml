  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hair appearance is an important issue for females. Treatment of hair with keratin has been
      popular among females nowadays. Although chemical hair straightening application has a
      beneficial effect on hair shafts with the repair of the broken cuticle, some side effects may
      occur. Therefore, this study aims to study the efficacy and safety of such new
      non-formaldehyde widely used keratin treatments on hair by assessment of changes of the
      scalp, hair density, and the morphology, color, and ultrastructure of hair shaft after
      application.

      Hair is an important feature for most women that contribute to one's individual identity. The
      appearance and morphology of the hair is one of the divergent traits in humans. Keratin in
      hair care products has two effects; it can penetrate the cortex of the hair fiber improving
      the mechanical properties of damaged fibers and promotes a surface coating that prevents or
      decreases water diffusion through the hair fibers.These properties have beneficial effects on
      the hair structure replacing lost keratin.However, the side effects and safety of this
      treatment have not yet been completely evaluated.There are many different brands of the
      keratin hair treatment, all with nearly the same basic chemical composition. Non-formaldehyde
      containing keratin straightening products, also known as safe keratin treatments (SKT) have
      recently been introduced to the market.Therefore, this study aims to study the efficacy and
      safety of such new non formaldehyde widely used keratin treatments on hair.

    <measure>Change of hair shedding using the Visual analogue scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 2 months, 4 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>It will be used to evaluate hair shedding. Hair shedding is scored on a scale of 1-6. Women are asked to look at the scale and point to the photograph that best correlates with the amount of hair shed on an average day. Grades 1-3 are considered normal. Grade 4 is borderline, while Grades 5 and 6 indicate excessive shedding.</description>

    <measure>Change of patient satisfaction questionnaire about keratin treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 2 months, 4 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>A 5 items Questionnaire will be completed by the patients to evaluate their satisfaction about the treatment. The questionnaire consists of Q1 (1-5), Q2,3 (1-7), Q4 (1-4) and Q5 has 3 sub-items Q5a, Q5b, Q5c (1-5 for each). Total score ranges from 7-38. Higher scores are associated with higher dissatisfaction.</description>
