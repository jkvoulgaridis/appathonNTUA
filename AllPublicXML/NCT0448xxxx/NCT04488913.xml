  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As part of the planned implementation of a new clinical pathway using hs-cTnI, we will
      measure patient outcomes and clinical processes in a real-world scenario throughout an
      integrated health system across 9 emergency departments (ED).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pragmatic, implementation study testing the implications of a real-world execution
      of a rapid evaluation pathway for suspected ACS using the Beckman hs-cTnI assay. As the new
      protocol is executed across 9 EDs within an integrated health system, we will study its
      effects on patient and system-level metrics. A modified stepped wedge design will be utilized
      that allows comparison of the RACE-IT pathway with standard of care management
