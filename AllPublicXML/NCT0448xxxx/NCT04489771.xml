  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the efficacy and safety of two doses of MK-6482 in participants with
      advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) with clear cell component after prior therapy.

      The primary hypothesis is that the higher dose of MK-6482 is superior to the standard dose in
      terms of objective response rate (ORR).

    <time_frame>Up to approximately 48 months</time_frame>
    <description>ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who have a complete response (CR: Disappearance of all target lesions) or a partial response (PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) per RECIST 1.1. The percentage of participants who experience a CR or PR as assessed by blinded independent central review based on RECIST 1.1 will be presented.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to approximately 48 months</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Per RECIST 1.1, PD is defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered PD. PFS as assessed by blinded independent central review will be presented.</description>

    <description>For participants who demonstrate a confirmed complete response (CR: Disappearance of all target lesions) or confirmed partial response (PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) per RECIST 1.1, DOR is defined as the time from first documented evidence of CR or PR until disease progression or death. The DOR as assessed by blinded independent central review will be presented.</description>

    <description>CBR is defined as the percentage of participants who have a complete response (CR: Disappearance of all target lesions) or a partial response (PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) or stable disease (SD: Neither sufficient decrease to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.) ≥6 months per RECIST 1.1.
