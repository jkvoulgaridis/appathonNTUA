    <measure>Clinical Results measured by Neck Disability Index (NDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>One retrospective visit, between one and approx. five years post-op.</time_frame>
    <description>The NDI is designed to measure neck-specific disability. The questionnaire has 10 items to measure patient-reported disability secondary to neck pain and activities of daily living including personal care, lifting, reading, headaches, concentration, work status, driving, sleeping and recreation and patients rate their status from 0 (best) to 5 (worst imaginable). Individual item responses are summed to a total score, where 0 points indicate no activity limitations and 50 points indicate complete activity limitation.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Neck and arm pain</measure>
    <time_frame>One retrospective visit, between one and approx. five years post-op.</time_frame>
    <description>Visual analogue scale for pain: The visual analogue scale (VAS) is a scale used to determine the pain intensity experienced by individuals. It consists of a line, approximately 10-15 cm in length, with the left side signifying no pain with a smiling face image and the right side signifying the worst pain ever with a frowning face image.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>One retrospective visit, between one and approx. five years post-op.</time_frame>
    <description>Patient satisfaction with Outcome of surgery documented in two aspects: is the Patient satisfied (four Point scale:
very satisfied, satisfied, unsatisfied, very unsatisfied) and would the Patient like to undergo surgery again (yes, no, not willing to say)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of life measured by EQ-5D-5L</measure>
    <time_frame>One retrospective visit, between one and approx. five years post-op.</time_frame>
    <description>The descriptive system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/ depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. This decision results in a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dysphagia assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>One retrospective visit, between one and approx. five years post-op.</time_frame>
    <description>Bazaz score: The Bazaz Dysphagia Score is one criterion used to define dysphagia; it classifies dysphagia as severe, moderate, mild, or none</description>
