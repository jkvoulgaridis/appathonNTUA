  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-center, multi-cohort, Phase 2 study to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) for the treatment of selected HER2-expressing
      tumors.

      This study will enroll 7 tumor-specific cohorts: urothelial bladder cancer, biliary tract
      cancer, cervical cancer, endometrial cancer, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, and rare
      tumors.

      Study hypothesis: Trastuzumab deruxtecan will show meaningful clinical activity and a
      favorable risk benefit profile in selected HER2-expressing solid tumors.
