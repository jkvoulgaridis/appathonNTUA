  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of an active voiding trial compared to a
      passive voiding trial on time to discharge following a planned same day discharge
      laparoscopic hysterectomy. The investigators hypothesize that performing an active voiding
      trial will assess urinary function and lead to a reduction in length of stay.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following laparoscopic surgery with hysterectomy, there is no standard method for assuring
      urinary function prior to discharge. Total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH) has been
      demonstrated to be safe with a reduction in post-operative morbidity and length of hospital
      stay with no difference in cancer related outcomes in endometrial cancer. Furthermore, the
      investigators have demonstrated that following the adoption of same day discharge, there was
      no difference in composite complication rates or readmissions. Awaiting a passive void trial
      may impact time to discharge as well as same day discharge; however, this has not been
      clearly studied in this patient population. The aim of this study is to determine the
      difference in time to discharge following an active voiding trial with bladder backfill in
      the post-operative recovery unit compared to a passive voiding trial with removal of the
      Foley catheter in the operating room at the end of the procedure. Secondary outcomes include
      time to void, catheter replacement, discomfort with the voiding trial, and overnight
      admission.

    <intervention_model_description>Patients who were scheduled to undergo a same day discharge laparoscopic hysterectomy were assessed for eligibility to participate in this study. A computer generated blocked randomization schema was utilized with alternating block sizes to determine study groups. Participants were randomized 1:1 to each study group (active voiding trial vs. passive voiding trial). There was no cross-over between arms. If the participant did not receive the study intervention as allocated they were withdrawn from the study.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Voiding trial protocols for each group (AVT and PVT) as well as data collection sheets were stored in sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes which were assigned after enrollment and were opened in the operating room at the completion of surgery by the surgical assistant. Attending surgeons and investigators were blinded to the individual patient study assignment. Due to the nature of the study, participants were not masked to their intervention.</masking_description>

    <description>At the completion of surgery, a Foley catheter was left in place. When the patient was determined to be ambulatory by the recovery room nurse, the bladder was backfilled with 300cc of sterile normal saline. Voiding 200cc or (2/3) of the backfill amount was considered passing.</description>

    <description>At the completion of surgery, a Foley catheter was removed in the operating room. Study participants were allowed six hours to void spontaneously, with 200cc being considered adequate consistent with institution standard practice. At the completion of six hours, if spontaneous voiding has not occurred, a bladder scan was performed and additional time was allowed based on bladder volume with criteria previously established as institution standards based on published practices.</description>
