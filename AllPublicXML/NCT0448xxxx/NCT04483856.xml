  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a post marketing, interventional, randomized, single-center, prospective, controlled
      study, for the evaluation of the clinical performance and tolerability of a cream-based
      medical device (DermoRelizemaTM cream) in the management care of radiodermatitis in women
      with breast cancer. Assessments and evaluations will be performed by a physician in a blind
      fashion.

      The primary objective is Evaluation of the effects of DermoRelizemaTM cream in the management
      of the progression of RT-induced skin reactions and toxicity, using the grading system of the
      Radiation Therapy Oncology Group / European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer
      (RTOG/ EORTC), at the conclusion of the treatment period

      medical device (DermoRelizemaTM cream) in the management care of radiodermatitis in women
      with breast cancer. Assessments and evaluations will be performed by a physician in a blind
      fashion.

      The aim of this clinical study is to collect controlled evidences of the effectiveness and
      tolerability of DermoRelizemaTM cream in the management of RISRs in patients with breast
      cancer who will start the treatment with the product about one week before the start of RT.

      The primary objective is Evaluation of the effects of DermoRelizemaTM cream in the management
      of the progression of RT-induced skin reactions and toxicity, using the grading system of the
      Radiation Therapy Oncology Group / European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer
