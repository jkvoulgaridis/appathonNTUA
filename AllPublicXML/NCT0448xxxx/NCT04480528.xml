  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patellofemoral pain (PFP) is a common running-related injury that is often referred to as
      runner's knee. The condition typically presents with pain in the front of the knee that is
      located around or behind the knee cap. This injury occurs twice as frequently in females and
      is often associated with weakness of the muscles of the thigh and hip, as well as altered
      running form. Heavy-weight strength training is needed in order to improve muscle weakness;
      however, this puts a significant amount of load on the knee joint and it is difficult for
      individuals with PFP to train at this level without experiencing increased pain and joint
      discomfort. Blood flow restriction training (BFRT) is a promising alternative method to
      safely improve muscle weakness while reducing knee joint loading. With BFRT, a pressurized
      band is applied to the thigh in order to partially restrict blood flow as a patient exercises
      in order to decrease the amount of oxygen delivered to the muscle. Lack of oxygen to the
      muscle combined with strength training creates an environment within the muscle that results
      in the ability of low-weight strength training to provide the same results as heavy-weight
      strength training.

      This study will evaluate how low-weight strength training with and without BFRT affects thigh
      and hip strength, and consequently pain, function, running ability, and running form in
      female runners with PFP. The hypothesis is that 10 weeks of low-weight strength training with
      BFRT will lead to greater thigh and hip strength, reduced pain, improved knee function,
      improved running ability, and improved running form compared to low-weight strength training
      without BFRT. The expected results will have a significant impact within the running
      community by providing a safe and effective treatment that increases strength and improves
      running form while reducing pain and joint loading. This will also have an impact on the
      larger field of sports medicine by providing an alternative method to improve strength, as
      well as improve function when heavy-weight strength training is not well tolerated or unsafe
      due to injury.

Scores are transformed to a 0-100 scale and represent the percentage of total possible score achieved. Lower numbers indicate limited running ability while higher numbers indicate full running ability.</description>
