    <textblock>
      Idiopathic thrombocytopenia or immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a hematological condition
      which is characterized by a low platelet count of less than 100 x 109L . Symptoms of ITP can
      vary but tend to be symptoms of thrombocytopenia in general, such as petechiae, purpura,
      mucosal bleeding and in the most severe cases fatal intracranial hemorrhage(1,2) Interleukin
      (IL)-37, a novel anti-inflammatory cytokine previously known as interleukin-1 family member 7
      before it was renamed, has a pivotal role in the suppression of immune responses (3,4). IL-37
      is widely expressed in several types of cells, tissues and organs, including peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells (PBMCs) (5). The major role of IL-37 is to decrease excessive inflammation
      in innate and adaptive immune diseases, mainly by inhibiting the expression, production and
      function of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1Î±, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)
      and macrophage inflammatory protein-2. The abundance of these cytokines has been reported to
      increase with the silencing of endogenous IL-37 in human blood cells (3,6).Aberrant
      expression of IL-37 has been observed in several inflammatory and autoimmune diseases
      However, the role of IL-37 in ITP has remained elusive. Immune thrombocytopenia pathogenesis
      is a complicated process. T cell immune abnormalities are involved in ITP pathogenesis. These
      abnormalities include platelet auto-antigen reactive cytotoxic T cells, abnormal numbers and
      functions of T regulatory cells, loss of Th1/Th2 balance, megakaryocyte maturation
      abnormalities and abnormal T cell anergy.
