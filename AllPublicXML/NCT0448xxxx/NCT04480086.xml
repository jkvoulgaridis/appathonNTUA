  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Myelofibrosis (MF) is a bone marrow illness that affects blood-forming tissues in the body.
      MF disturbs the body's normal production of blood cells, causing extensive scarring in the
      bone marrow. This leads to severe anemia, weakness, fatigue, and an enlarged spleen. The
      purpose of this study is to see how safe and tolerable mivebresib is, when given alone, and
      in combination with navitoclax or ruxolitinib, for adult participants with MF.

      Mivebresib is an investigational drug being developed for the treatment of MF. The study has
      4 segments - A, B, C, and D. In Segment A, the safe dosing regimen of mivebresib is
      identified, and then given alone as monotherapy. In Segment B, C, and D, combination
      therapies of mivebresib with either ruxolitinib or navitoclax are given. Adult participants
      with a diagnosis of MF will be enrolled. Around 130 participants will be enrolled in 60 sites
      worldwide.

      In Segment A, participants will receive different doses and schedules of oral mivebresib
      tablet to identify a safe dosing regimen. Additional participants will be enrolled at the
      identified monotherapy dosing regimen. In Segment B, participants will receive oral
      ruxolitinib and mivebresib will be given as &quot;add-on&quot; therapy. In Segment C, participants will
      receive mivebresib and oral navitoclax. In Segment D, participants will receive mivebresib
      and ruxolitinib. Participants will receive treatment until disease progression or the
      participants are not able to tolerate the study drugs.

      There may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their
      standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study at a hospital or
      clinic. The effect of treatment will be checked by medical assessments, blood and bone marrow
      tests, checking for side effects, and completing questionnaires.
