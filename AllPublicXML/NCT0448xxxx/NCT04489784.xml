  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Overuse injuries and painful symptoms in athletes and dancers (especially classical
      ballerinas) may lead to reduced functional performance. However, laser application may reduce
      pain and increase physical conditioning. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the
      immediate and long-term effects of infrared laser on classical ballerinas' feet. The
      hypothesis investigators was that the infrared laser would be able to reduce pain perception
      and enhance functional performance in ballerinas.

    <textblock>
      High risk of injuries and painful symptoms in athletes and dancers (especially classical
      ballerinas) may lead to reduced functional performance. The use of photobiomodulation may
      improve functional performance in ballerinas that are affected by foot pain. An aluminum
      gallium arsenide (AlGaAs) diode laser device was uded. Infrared laser (808 nm) was applied on
      ballerina's feet twice a week during three months. Thermography, algometry and unipodal
      static standing balance test were performed. There were pain relief and improvement of
      functional performance in ballerinas.

    <measure>Analysis of pain for feet by algometry</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Pressure pain thresholds (PPT) were assessed with an electronic algometer. The pressure was applied and the ballerinas were instructed to ask to say &quot;stop&quot; when the sensation changed from pressure to pain. Three PPT measurements were performed to obtain an average.</description>

    <measure>Analysis of pain for feet by the visual analogue pain intensity scale</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>A continuous scale comprised of a horizontal line with 10 centimeters in length was used. All ballerinas were instructed to make a mark with a pen at any point on the line between 2 verbal descriptors, one for each symptom extreme [&quot;No pain&quot; (score=0) and &quot;as bad as it could be&quot; or &quot;worst imaginable pain&quot; (score=10)].</description>

    <description>An aluminum gallium arsenide (AlGaAs) diode laser device (Twin laser, MMOptics, São Carlos, SP, Brazil) was used. The irradiation parameters were as follows: infrared laser (808 nm wavelength) with a spot area of 0.04 cm2, and an average optical power of 100 mW operated in a continuous mode during 1 minute per point, leading to an irradiance of 2,500 mW/cm2, energy of 6 J and fluence of 125 J/cm2 per point. The laser was applied on ballerina's feet twice a week during three months.</description>
