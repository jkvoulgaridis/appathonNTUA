    <textblock>
      It is a multicenter, open-Label, randomised phase 2 study to compare the efficacy and safety
      study of R2-MTX chemotherapy（Lenalidomide, Rituximab and Methotrexate）with R-MTX
      chemotherapy（Rituximab and Methotrexate ）as first-line regimens in the treatment of newly
      diagnosed primary central nervous system lymphoma.2-year Progression free survival (PFS) is
      the primary endpoint.

      This is a multicenter, open-Label, randomised phase 2 study designed to evaluate the efficacy
      and safety of rituximab plus methotrexate with or without lenalidomide as first-line regimens
      in the treatment of primary central nervous system lymphoma. A total of 240 patients plan to
      participate in this study to receive a total 6 cycles of induction chemotherapy followed by 4
      cycles of maintenance chemotherapy. Follow-ups should be taken up to the first 3 years.The
      primary endpoints were 2-year PFS rate and and secondary endpoints including objective
      response rate (ORR), PFS, overall survival (OS), and adverse events.
