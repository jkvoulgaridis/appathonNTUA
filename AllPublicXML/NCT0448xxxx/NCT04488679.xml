  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      eligible carious teeth with exposed pulp by the undergraduate students will be randomly
      divided into two groups to be treated with direct pulp capping (A), where (A1) represents
      teeth to be treated with an application of platelet Rich Fibrin on exposure site along with
      MTA application followed by provisional restoration, (A2) represents comparator group to be
      capped with MTA only followed by the provisional restoration. clinical and radiographic
      assessment of tooth vitality, history of pain, pain on percussion and dentin bridge formation
      will be performed at baseline, 6 months and 1 year

    <description>10 ml of the participant blood will be drawn into 10 ml test tubes without an anticoagulant and centrifuged immediately .centrifugation will be done using a tabletop centrifuge for 12 min at 2700 rounds per minute. The resultant product will exhibit three layers. plateletâ€‘poor plasma at the surface, PRF clot in the middle, and red blood cells at the bottom. Sterile tweezers inserted into a test tube to retrieve the PRF clot. The prepared fibrin membrane will be gently packed over the pulp</description>

    <description>MTA is primarily calcium oxide in the form of tricalcium silicate, dicalcium silicate and tricalcium aluminate. Bismuth oxide is added for radiopacity, MTA is considered a silicate cement rather than an oxide mixture, a so its biocompatibility is due to its reaction products. MTA elevates the expression of transcription factors, induces dentin bridge formation, possesses biocompatibility9, and sustains a high pH for a longer duration and a close physiochemical seal with dentin that forms an insoluble barrier to prevent microleakag</description>
