      This study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Jin-yuan-kang granule in the treatment
      of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) preliminarily, and provide reference for further study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is a type of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with a rapid
      disease progression and poor treatment effect. The LUAD patients have a short median survival
      time with 8-11 months. Up to now, chemotherapy is still the first-line treatment for LUAD. PC
      protocol (pemetrexed + cisplatin) is most commonly used, which is also recommended by NCCN
      guidelines. However, critical side effects have limited the application and efficacy.
      Patients will undergo poor quality of life, and the disease will progress rapidly. We still
      face the stern situation for the treatment of LUAD. It is urgent to develop new treatment and
      management strategies. Our previous study showed that jing-yuan-kang granule has certain
      curative effect on LUAD.

      This is a multi-certers, randomized, controlled clinical trial to assess the efficacy and
      safety of Jing-yuan-kang granule in improving quality of life for LUAD patients. After a
      2-week wash-out period, a total of 144 LUAD patients will be randomly assigned into
      experimental or control group with a ratio of 1:1. On the basis of that all the participants
      will receive PC chemotherapy and symptomatic treatment, the patients in the experimental
      group will receive jing-yuan-kang granule with no other treatments for control group. The
      primary outcome is quality of life. The secondary outcomes include Karnofsky (KPS) scores,
      clinical symptoms, and change of tumor volume. Safety and adverse events will also be
      assessed.

    <description>TCM symptom index will be recorded and calculated referring to the Guiding Principles of Clinical Research of New Chinese Medicine Treating Primary Bronchial Lung Cancer (2002 Edition) published by National Medical Products Administration of China. A total of scores of all the related symptoms will be calculated with a 0-4 for each symptom at baseline and after treatment. A higher value will indicate a worse symptom. The difference of TCM symptoms between baseline and posttreatment will be calculated first. Then, we will obtain the TCM syndrome index by the ratio between the above difference and the scores at baseline.</description>
