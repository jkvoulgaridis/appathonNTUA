        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed primary non-metastatic adenocarcinoma of the prostate

          -  High-risk or unfavorable intermediate-risk as defined below:

        High-risk localized prostate cancer, as defined by any one of the following factors:

        Pre-biopsy or any PSA ≥20 prior to enrollment, or Gleason score 8 or higher on any biopsy
        core, or cT3a or higher.

        Unfavorable intermediate risk localized prostate cancer, as defined as any of the following
        factors:

        Gleason score of 4+3 or higher on any biopsy core, or Gleason score 3+4 and &gt;50% biopsy
        cores positive, or The presence of any two of the following: PSA&gt;10, cT2b-c, Gleason score
        3+4 in any core

          -  No pelvic nodal metastases (based on CT or MRI findings)

          -  No distant metastases, based upon:

        CT scan or MRI of the pelvis within 120 days prior to registration, Bone scan within 120
        days prior to registration; if the bone scan is suspicious, a plain x-ray and/or MRI must
        be obtained to rule out metastasis

          -  Age ≥ 18

          -  KPS ≥ 70 (or ECOG 0-2)

          -  Ability to understand, and willingness to sign, the written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with low-risk or favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer do not meet
             inclusion criteria (these patients would be eligible for SBRT off-trial as a standard
             of care option)

          -  Patients with any evidence of distant metastases

          -  Hormonal therapy (LHRH agonist or oral anti-androgen) exceeding 7 months prior to
             registration

          -  Prior cryosurgery, HIFU or brachytherapy of the prostate

          -  Prior pelvic radiotherapy

          -  History of Crohn's Disease or Ulcerative Colitis
