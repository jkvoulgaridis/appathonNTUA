  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A three-period, randomized, crossover controlled feeding trial will be conducted to examine
      the effect of including 2 oz./day of pecans, as a snack, in a diet representative of average
      American intake, compared to a diet representative of average American intake devoid of nuts,
      and a healthy dietary pattern including 2 oz./day of pecans on markers of peripheral vascular
      health, lipids and lipoproteins, blood pressure, and glycemic control.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be randomized to each diet for 4-weeks with a minimum 2-week break between
      the diet periods. All caloric foods and beverages will be provided. Outcome assessments will
      be done at baseline and the end of each diet period.
