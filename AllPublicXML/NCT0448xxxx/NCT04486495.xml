  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Today, the majority of clinically node positive (cN+) breast cancer patients is treated with
      neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NST). Axillary staging and treatment after NST in cN+ patients
      are areas of controversy. Patients with a pathological complete response (pCR) of the
      axillary lymph nodes are not expected to benefit from axillary lymph node dissection (ALND).
      Hence, less invasive axillary staging procedures are being introduced to avoid unnecessary
      ALND. However, evidence supporting the safety of replacing ALND by less invasive techniques
      in terms of oncologic safety and impact on quality of life (QoL) is lacking.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The MINIMAX study is a multicenter observational registry study in cN+ breast cancer patients
      treated with NST (chemotherapy and ± immunotherapy) in order to gain insight in oncologic
      safety and impact on QoL of less and more invasive axillary staging and treatment strategies.

      Patients who are included in this study will complete Patient Reported Outcome Measures
      (PROMs) at baseline (time of diagnosis) and 1 and 5 years after diagnosis to assess impact on
      QoL. A database will be built by the Netherlands Cancer Registry. Data on patient-, tumor-,
      pre-NST staging-, post-NST staging- and treatment-characteristics are retrieved from
      patients' records by trained data registrars of the Netherlands Comprehensive Cancer
      Organisation (IKNL) using electronic case report forms (eCRFs). Five-year survival and
      recurrence will be evaluated to determine oncologic safety.

      The results will be incorporated in the national guidelines. In case of an equilibrium
      between less and more invasive strategies, the data of this study will at least be extremely
      suitable to be used in the shared decision making process.
