  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MARCH is the first randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled evaluation of the efficacy
      and pathologic mechanism determined by synovial biopsy of 6 months of methotrexate (n=134)
      versus placebo (n=67) therapy for chronic chikungunya (CHIKV) arthritis in Colombia with the
      option for open-label use of the medication for up to one year for all participants. Our
      central hypothesis is that methotrexate will significantly decrease chronic CHIKV arthritis
      disease severity compared to placebo via suppression of leukocyte accumulation in synovial
      tissue and decreased expression of inflammatory cytokines from synovial macrophages and
      fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS).

      -  In the treatment group, participants will receive methotrexate 15mg by mouth/week with
           optional for increase up to 20mg/week in non-responders and folic acid 1mg by mouth
           daily for six months in Phase I.

        -  In the control group, participants will receive placebo methotrexate tablets by
           mouth/week with faux increase optional in non-responders and folic acid 1mg by mouth
           daily for six months in Phase I.

        -  In Phase II, any patient may elect to stop taking the study drug or transition to open
           label active treatment group for the following six months.

    <description>An improvement in the American College of Rheumatology (ACR 20) response. The ACR20 is a composite measure defined as both improvement of 20% in the number of tender and number of swollen joints, and a 20% improvement in three of the following five criteria: patient global assessment, physician global assessment, functional ability measure [most often Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ)], visual analog pain scale, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein (CRP). For the purposes of our study we will use the number of tender and number of swollen joints, and a 20% improvement in three of the following five criteria: patient global assessment, physician global assessment, functional ability measured by the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ)], visual analog pain scale, C-reactive protein (CRP).</description>

    <description>Methotrexate is vibrant yellow-orange colored powder with physical properties of near insolubility in water formulated into methotrexate tablets containing an amount of methotrexate sodium equivalent to 2.5 mg of methotrexate and are round, convex, and yellow. The chemical name is N-[4-[[(2,4-diamino-6pteridinyl)methyl]methyl amino]benzoyl]-L-glutamic acid. Methotrexate is an anti-metabolite that is a folate antagonist that inhibits lymphocyte proliferation and functions as an immunosuppressant in arthritis.</description>
