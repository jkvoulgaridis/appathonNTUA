  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled first-in-human study in which
      the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of orally administered HPN-01
      will be evaluated in healthy subjects
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to obtain safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data when
      HPN-01 is orally administered as single doses and as multiple doses to healthy subjects.

      The study will be conducted in 2 parts: a single ascending dose (SAD) phase (Part 1) and a
      multiple ascending dose (MAD) phase (Part 2). One cohort of Part 1 will receive HPN-01 after
      a standard high fat/high calorie breakfast (the fed condition) to investigate the effect of
      food on the pharmacokinetics of HPN-01.
