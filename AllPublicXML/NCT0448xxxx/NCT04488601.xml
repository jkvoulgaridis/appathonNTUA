      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled trial into the safety and efficacy in reducing
      clinical measures of aging in an older adult population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial assessing the effects of low, medium,
      and high doses of intermittent Rapamycin on a weekly schedule. The researchers aim to
      establish a long-term safety profile, determine the long-term efficacy of Rapamycin in
      reducing clinical aging measures, and biochemical and physiological endpoints associated with
      declining health and aging in healthy older adults.
