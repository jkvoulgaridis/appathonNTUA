  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial was designed to evaluate the functional and safety effects on dyspeptic
      symptoms compared to the placebo when ingested with EDL (Extract of Dolichos lablab Linne) in
      adults who complain of dyspeptic symptoms.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dyspepsia is a common disease and accounts for about 5% of all patients visiting primary
      care. Of these, about 70~90% of dyspeptic patients who visit the tertiary medical institution
      have functional digestion, considering that about 8~20% of dyspeptic patients who are
      referred from the primary medical institution to the tertiary medical institution are found.
      It is estimated to be bad. Functional dyspepsia is not life-threatening, but its symptoms
      persist throughout life and are not easily cured, which can limit social life and reduce the
      quality of life.

      Therefore, this clinical trial was designed to evaluate the functional and safety effects on
      dyspeptic symptoms compared to the placebo when ingested with EDL (Extract of Dolichos lablab
      Linne) in adults who complain of dyspeptic symptoms.
