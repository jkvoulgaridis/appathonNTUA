  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate whether placing nasogastric tubes for gastric decompression
      improves respiratory distress for patients with bronchiolitis who are receiving oxygen via
      high-flow nasal cannula.

      All patients will be consented per IRB procedure. The study will be a prospective study.
      Study participants will be enrolled after placement on high flow nasal cannula. The
      respiratory therapist or study staff will use a bronchiolitis scoring tool, the Marlais Risk
      of Admission Score, to assess the respiratory status of patients after placement on high flow
      nasal cannula, and prior to placement of NG tube to establish a baseline measurement. This
      tool includes the following components: respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, heart rate, age,
      and length of illness. An NG tube will then be placed. Thirty minutes and sixty minutes after
      placement of the NG tube, the respiratory therapist or study team will again use this scoring
      tool to assess the respiratory status of the patient. After 60 minutes the study will be
      concluded. As subject will be requiring oxygen use, admission to an inpatient unit is
      required. The NG tube will be removed at the discretion of the provider or the admitting
      physician, who may choose to keep it in at their discretion.
