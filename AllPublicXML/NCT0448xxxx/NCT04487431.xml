  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers are looking for a new way to treat people suffering either from a condition where
      the bladder is unable to hold urine normally (overactive bladder), or a condition in which
      tissue similar to the tissue that normally lines the inside of the womb grows outside the
      womb (endometriosis) or a condition where the cough lasts longer than 8 weeks in adults
      (chronic cough). BAY1817080 is a new drug that is in development as a potential treatment for
      these conditions.

      In this trial, the researchers want to learn how a new liquid form of BAY1817080 is taken up
      by the body in a small number of healthy participants. The trial will include men who are
      aged 18 to 54.

      The trial will have 2 parts: A and B. The participants in Part A will stay at the trial site
      for about 5 days. During this time, the participants will take 1 dose of a liquid form of
      BAY1817080 by mouth. The doctors will take blood and urine samples and check the
      participants' health. Part A will be done so the researchers can see how much BAY1817080 gets
      into the participants' blood. The participants in Part B will stay at the trial site for
      about 16 days followed by a maximum of 4 re-admission visits over 24 hours at intervals of 7
      days. These participants will take 1 dose of a liquid form of BAY1817080 labeled with a
      radioactive substance (carbon 14), which means it is &quot;radiolabeled&quot;. This allows the
      researchers to understand how BAY1817080 moves through and leaves the body. During Part B,
      the doctors will take blood, urine, stool, and vomit samples if applicable. They will also
      check the participants' health.
