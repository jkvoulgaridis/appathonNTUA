  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This echocardiography study will characterize heart structure and function during labor.
      Imaging of the heart during the stress of labor could increase detection of subclinical
      cardiovascular disease using advanced imaging techniques. Cardiac serum biomarkers and
      complication rates will also be measured and compared between patients with and without
      evidence of cardiovascular disease on echocardiography.
