  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot, feasibility study to evaluate, test and optimize sample analysis procedures
      and protocols before the full-scale, crossover study is conducted.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two important factors can influence the proportions of gluten and starch that resist
      digestion: (1) enzyme availability and specificity and (2) the structural properties of the
      food. A complete evaluation of gluten digestion and of the impact of dietary supplements is
      difficult to conduct because it is not easy to obtain samples of digestive chime. The
      analysis of the ileal effluent of healthy ileostomy patients constitutes a non-invasive
      alternative to intubation techniques for the study of nutrient digestion and of the fate of
      probiotics in the small intestine.

      The main aim of this study is to test and optimize sample analysis protocols before
      conducting the full-scale, crossover study which will aim at evaluating the impact of two
      dietary supplements (Glutalytic® and DE111®) and of oatmeal properties on the digestion of
      gluten and starch and on the glycemic response.
