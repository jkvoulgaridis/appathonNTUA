      This study is a single-arm phase II study of sintilimab after SABT for refractory
      oligometastatic NSCLC, who had failed second-line systemic therapy.In this study, 44 patients
      with oligometastatic NSCLC were treated with sintilimab after SABT every 3 weeks until
      disease progression and intolerance. Toxicity, withdrawal of informed consent, death or other
      cessation of treatment as prescribed by the program, whichever occurs first. The primary end
      point was the ORR based on RECIS 1.1, which was evaluated by the Independent Imaging Review
      Board (IRRC). An interim analysis will be conducted during the course of the study. The
      results and reports will be provided to the Independent Data Audit Committee (IDMC), which
      determines whether the trial is valid based on the valid cut-off value of the trial and
      whether the study data can be submitted in advance. Make recommendations to the sponsor.
      Prior to the interim analysis, the IDMC charter will be finalized and approved by IDMC and
      the sponsor. The responsibilities and related procedures of IDMC members will be defined in
      the IDMC charter.
