  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Owing to the recent classification of CDKL5 Deficiency Disorder (CDD) as a unique disorder,
      there is a limited understanding of overall disease natural history and meaningful outcome
      measures. An international patient registry aimed at collecting both patient/caregiver and
      clinician-entered demographic, patient-reported outcome (PRO) and treatment data would
      benefit both the scientific and patient communities. This CDD registry will follow up to 500
      patients diagnosed with CDD over several years through both the patients/caregivers and their
      clinicians. Initial data will be collected upon enrollment in the registry, followed by the
      collection of additional CDD-specific data on a bi-annual/ annual basis. No procedures will
      be performed as part of this registry. Clinician-entered data will be collected following
      standard of care visits conducted as part of patients' ongoing clinical care. Ultimately, the
      goal is to create a contact registry to allow patients/families to be alerted about relevant
      clinical trials and to collect valuable information that is accessible to the patient and
      scientific communities, thereby aiding and encouraging research in CDD.

        We expect to enroll up to 500 CDD patients over a 5 year period. As CDD affects people
        globally, we anticipate enrollment from several countries. Patients will learn about the
        registry through the Orphan Disease Center's social media presence, disease-specific
        foundations, other families impacted by CDD and/or physicians involved in the registry.

             applicable per local regulations or have a legal guardian to provide consent on the
