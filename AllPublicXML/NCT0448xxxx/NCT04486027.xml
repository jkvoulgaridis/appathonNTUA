      RA is a chronic, autoimmune, inflammatory disease that involves small joints in the form of
      symmetrical polyarthritis and progresses with exacerbations and remissions. Pain, swelling,
      tenderness and morning stiffness are typical of the joints involved. Although it is
      approached as a primary joint disease, a wide variety of extra-articular involvements may
      also occur. In this cross sectional study sedimentation rate (ESR), C- Reactive protein
      (CRP), Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, soluble-TNF-α receptor (TNF-R), Interleukin (IL)-1B and
      IL-10 were measured in three groups which were healthy volunteers, patients with RA in active
      period, and patients with RA in remission.

      TNF-R can be the main pathophysiological factor and a marker showing activation. TNF-R can be
      very important in revealing the effect of TNF on the disease and the value of this effect in
      the treatment and ensuring the follow-up of the disease with CRP instead of ESR in
      activation.

      Aims: The etiopathogenesis of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is not clearly understood. However,
      role of the cytokines takes an important part of this mechanism. The investigators aimed to
      bring a new approach to the concept of 'remission' in patients with RA.

      Background: RA is a chronic, autoimmune, inflammatory disease that involves small joints in
      the form of symmetrical polyarthritis and progresses with exacerbations and remissions. Pain,
      swelling, tenderness and morning stiffness are typical of the joints involved. Although it is
      approached as a primary joint disease, a wide variety of extra-articular involvements may
      also occur. It is an interesting pathophysiological process, the exact cause of which is
      still unknown, with many environmental, genetic and potentially undiscovered possible factors
      in a chaotic manner.

      Objective: In this prospective study, sedimentation rate (ESR), C- Reactive protein (CRP),
      Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, soluble-TNF-α receptor (TNF-R), Interleukin (IL)-1B and IL-10
      were measured in three groups which were healthy volunteers, patients with RA in active
      period, and patients with RA in remission. Disease activity score-28 (DAS-28) was calculated
      in active RA and RA in remission.

      Methods: This study included 20 healthy volunteers, 20 remission patients with RA and 20
      active RA patients. Venous blood samples were collected from patients in both healthy and RA
      groups.
