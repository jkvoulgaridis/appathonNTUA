  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand addiction to filtered cigars (FCs) compared to
      cigarettes in young adults who are dual users of cigarettes and cigars, if flavor, such as
      fruit or menthol, makes FCs more addictive, and if there are differences for men and women.
      The first hypothesis is that the potential for FCs to cause addiction will be lower than that
      of cigarettes, but will increase as cigarette cost increases. Second, flavored FCs will be
      more addictive than unflavored FCs, and that the effect of flavored FCs on addiction will be
      greater in women than men. Last, participants will smoke more FCs and fewer cigarettes when
      given flavored compared to unflavored FCs. Prior to conducting the study, we will conduct a
      pilot phase to test baseline procedures.

    <ipd_description>A verified database will be available once the main findings from the final dataset have been reported and accepted for publication. Information that does result from our analysis of the urine samples will be available after publication of the findings. De-identified dataset will contain the data merged from all study visits. We will include with the data file proper documentation of all data (including definitions of variables and derived variables, frequencies, details about codes, etc.), and procedures used to collect the data, to ensure others can use the dataset and to prevent misuse, misinterpretation, and/or confusion. The database intended for public distribution will be free of identifiers that would permit linkages to individual research participants and variables that could lead to deductive disclosure of the identity of individual subjects.</ipd_description>
    <ipd_time_frame>In the final year of the Award after the dataset is finalized we will prepare a file in Excel and Stata that contains all study variables intended for use in presentations and publications.</ipd_time_frame>
