  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed clinical study is a prospective, non-randomized, multi-center, single-arm,
      observational, post-market surveillance (PS) study of the Ellipsys Vascular Access System in
      subjects eligible for arteriovenous (AV) fistula.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this post-market surveillance study are to support short-term
      safety of the device and procedure, to further assess long-term safety and effectiveness, and
      to assess the safety profile in subjects treated by newly trained providers of the Ellipsys
      Vascular Access System in the creation of a native AV fistula via percutaneous access in
      subjects who are on hemodialysis and are medically indicated for the creation of an upper
      limb anastomosis.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects ≥ 18 years of age and ≤ 80 years of age

          2. Life expectancy of at least one year, in the investigator's opinion

          3. Diagnosed with ESRD or chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis.

          4. Subjects deemed medically eligible for upper extremity autogenous AV fistula creation,
             per institutional guidelines and/or clinical judgment

          5. Adequate quality vein based on pre-operative assessment

               1. Adjacent vein diameter of ≥2.0 mm at target anastomosis site

               2. Confirmed clinically significant outflow

          6. Adequate quality radial artery based on pre-operative assessment

             a. Arterial lumen diameter of ≥2.0 mm at target anastomosis site

          7. Adequate collateral arterial perfusion with patent palmar arch as demonstrated by
             Allen's Test.

          8. Radial artery-adjacent vein proximity ≤1.5 mm measured lumen edge-to-lumen edge as
             determined by pre-procedural ultrasound and confirmed pre-procedure

          9. Patient is able to provide written informed consent and attend follow-up examinations
             at the enrolling institution

         10. If female, not pregnant or lactating confirmed by history, or for women of
             reproductive potential, verified with a urine/blood pregnancy test

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pre-existing ipsilateral vascular disease interfering with the study procedure or
             potentially confounding the study results including:

               1. Documented or suspected central venous stenosis (≥ 50%) or

               2. Upper extremity arterial stenosis or

               3. Vascular disease at the radial artery / adjacent vein site

          2. Prior vascular surgery at or proximal (central) to the AVF target site interfering
             with AVF maturation or other ipsilateral surgery that could potentially confound the
             study results such as prior axillary dissection or mastectomy

          3. History of steal syndrome from a previous surgical ipsilateral hemodialysis vascular
             access which required intervention or abandonment

          7. Immunocompromised subjects due to underlying disease or immunosuppressant therapy such
             as sirolimus (Rapamune®) or Prednisone at a dose of &gt; 10 mg per day

          8. Known bleeding diathesis, coagulation disorder or medications putting the subject at
             increased risk, in the Investigator's judgment

          9. Subjects with acute or active infection

         10. Scheduled kidney transplant within 6 months of enrollment

         11. Subjects on peritoneal dialysis (PD) who are not suitable for hemodialysis

             studies not requiring a consent form)

         13. History of substance abuse or anticipated to be non-compliant with medical care or
             study requirements based on investigator judgment
