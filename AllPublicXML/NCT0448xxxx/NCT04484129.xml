      To investigate the incidence of etiologically confirmed or clinically diagnosed active
      tuberculosis in close contacts of MDR-TB patients.

      This study is a prospective observational cohort study. MDR-TB patients from multi-centers in
      China were continuously evaluated one by one, their close contacts were screened for
      elibgility. All subjects were followed for the same length of time: 80 weeks after
      enrollment. The symptoms and signs of tuberculosis were followed up to monitor the occurrence
      of tuberculosis.

      The primary objective is to investigate the incidence of etiologically confirmed or
      clinically diagnosed active TUBERCULOSIS in close contacts of MDR-TB patients.

      The secondary objective is to assess latent TB infection rates in close contacts of MDR-TB
      patients; evaluate the high risk factors of TUBERCULOSIS in close contact population; assess
      the loss rate of close contacts within 80 weeks; assess the 80-week mortality rate among
      close contacts; isolate the mycobacterium tuberculosis from all patients with active
      tuberculosis and analyze drug resistance to evaluate the homology and drug-resistant
      transmission pattern of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

    <description>Mycobacterium tuberculosis was indicated to be positive by etiology, and the positive ones were confirmed by molecular identification. A false positive may be determined if the investigator determines that the etiological diagnosis is inconsistent with the patient's clinical condition, or that the patient's symptoms, signs, or influence of the medical diagnosis has not responded to treatment.</description>

    <description>Close contacts of MDR-TB who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were enrolled. Routine follow-up is scheduled at week 8, 20, 32, and 80. During the visit, participants with suspected tuberculosis symptoms will have detailed clincial assessent, weight measurement, sputum smear, sputum culture and drug sensitivity examination, imaging examinations, etc. For patients diagnosed with TB, the trial ends. Proper treatment will be started. For all paricipants who are not diagnosed with tuebrculosis in previous follow-up, the last follow-up of this study is all &quot;face-to-face&quot; visits. Sputum smear, sputum culture and chest imaging screening will be performed when necessary to exclude the possibility of tuberculosis infection. In addition, If the participants has suspected TB symptoms or is diagnosed with TB in another hospital, the researchers can be contacted for follow-up at any time.</description>
