  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given the evolving uses of technology in rehabilitation, the investigators aimed to measure
      the change in aphasia severity using PCT App, a digital therapeutic adapted from Constant
      Therapy (CT), a dynamic, personalized therapy program for people with cognitive, speech, or
      language disorders.

      The entire study, including recruitment, enrollment, assessment and treatment were conducted
      remotely.

      The proposed pilot study seeks to compare performance of PCT therapy vs. conventional
      workbook intervention for stroke patients. The investigators hypothesize that the
      experimental (PCT) group will experience greater gains on the WAB-AQ at follow-up compared to
      baseline compared to a control (workbook) group.

      Subjects were prospectively assigned to an experimental or active control group in a random
      order with both groups balanced for their baseline level of speech, language and/or cognitive
      ability:

        1. Experimental Group: Participants were instructed to use PCT for at least 30 minutes/day,
           5 days/week. Performance and usage data were automatically reported by the PCT software
           to the treating clinician and was used to modify task assignment over time and monitor
           participant adherence to the treatment program.

        2. Active Control Group: Participants were provided with a standard regime of paper
           workbooks (e.g. Workbook for Aphasia; Brubaker, 2006) that are typically used by
           clinicians with persons with aphasia (PWA) for at least 30 minutes/day, 5 days/week.
           Notably, the control procedure employed here is similar to a large-scale study examining
           technology as a treatment option by Palmer and colleagues (2015).

      The treatment period was 10 weeks. All participants received a bimonthly check-in through
      video-chat with a member of the research staff during the treatment period.

    <intervention_model_description>Final study eligibility will be assessed after administration of the Western Aphasia Battery, Revised (WAB-R). Eligible subjects will be pseudorandomly assigned to the experimental group OR the control group, while trying to balance for aphasia severity (WAB-R Aphasia Quotient, WAB-AQ). Subjects in the experimental group will receive therapy via the PCT app during the treatment period. Subjects in the control arm will receive conventional workbook therapy. Subjects in both groups will be asked to refrain from obtaining one-on-one individual aphasia or cognitive therapy. Subjects may participate in organized social groups, such as community aphasia groups.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>At the start of the study, subjects will be provided with a tablet with videoconferencing software and the PCT app pre-installed. Research staff will remotely setup a PCT account for the subjects, and provide instructions for logging into the PCT application. During the treatment period, patients will be instructed to use PCT for at least 30 minutes a day and at least 5 days a week. Performance data (accuracy and latency) will be reported by the PCT software to the treating clinician and will be used to modify task assignment over time. PCT tracks usage of the program so that research staff can access automated reporting of subject use to monitor participant adherence to the treatment program.</description>

    <description>PCT is designed to deliver similar therapy as is conventionally provided in-clinic by a Speech Language Pathologist (SLP), which the patient can access from any location using the application installed on a supported tablet. The device functions by allowing clinicians to create a personalized therapy program for each patient from 75 categories of clinical therapies, which patients may access from their tablet device remotely. The PCT software is comprised primarily of authentication and an algorithm that suggests advancement of the therapy program based on observed patient deficits and progress.</description>
