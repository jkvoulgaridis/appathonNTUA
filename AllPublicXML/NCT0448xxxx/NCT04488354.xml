  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed as a long-term follow-up study of participants who have receive
      genetically modified autologous CLBR001 CAR-T cells in all clinical trials including
      NCT04450069, A Phase 1, Open-label, Dose Escalating Study Evaluating the Safety,
      Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics and Clinical Activity of the Combination of
      CLBR001 and SWI019 in Patients With Relapsed/Refractory B-cell Malignancies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be enrolled following either the completion or early
      termination/discontinuation from Study NCT04450069 or any protocol in which patients were
      administered CLBR001. Patients will begin the long-term follow-up period regardless of
      whether they responded to treatment or progressed on treatment. Patients will be followed for
      up to 15 years post CLBR001 infusion and will continue to be monitored for safety,
      immunogenicity, and efficacy.
