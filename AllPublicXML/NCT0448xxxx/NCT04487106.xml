  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial investigates how well azacitidine, venetoclax, and trametinib work in
      treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia or higher-risk myelodysplastic syndrome that
      has come back (relapsed) or has not responded to treatment (refractory). Chemotherapy drugs,
      such as azacitidine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by
      killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.
      Venetoclax and trametinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. The goal of this study is learn if the combination of azacitidine,
      venetoclax, and trametinib can help to control acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic
      syndrome.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine overall survival rate at 1 year of the regimen in patients with newly
      diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML). (Cohort A) II. To determine the complete remission
      (CR)/complete remission without recovery of counts (CRi) rate of the regimen in patients with
      relapsed/refractory AML or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). (Cohort B)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess other efficacy endpoints (CR rate, minimal residual disease negativity by flow
      cytometry, relapse-free survival, event-free survival, and overall survival).

      II. To assess proportion of patients proceeding to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
      (HSCT).

      III. To determine the safety of the combination regimen.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the impact of baseline genomic alterations on response and survival of the
      combination regimen.

      II. To evaluate clonal evolution from diagnosis to relapse.

      OUTLINE:

      INDUCTION (CYCLE 1): Patients receive azacitidine intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes or
      subcutaneously (SC) on days 1-7, venetoclax orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28, and
      trametinib PO QD on days 1-28 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      CONSOLIDATION (CYCLES 2-24): Patients receive azacitidine IV over 30-60 minutes or SC on days
      1-7, venetoclax PO QD on days 1-21, and trametinib PO QD on days 1-28. Treatment repeats
      every 28 days for up to 23 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, and then every 6
      months thereafter.
