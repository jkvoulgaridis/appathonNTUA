    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the best dose and side effects of mephalan in treating patients
      with multiple myeloma who are undergoing stem cell transplant. Chemotherapy drugs, such as
      mephalan, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the
      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. This trial uses a
      new method of dosing that is based on analysis of each individual's blood levels of melphalan
      after receiving a part of the dose, termed pharmacokinetic analysis. This may help to learn
      more about how to dose melphalan correctly and which patients are likely to benefit from a
      personalized dose.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Measure achievement of target melphalan systemic exposure in the first 20 patients.

      II. Identify safety and preliminary efficacy within each systemic exposure range of melphalan
      using a 5+5 design.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Describe International Myeloma Working Group response levels and selected grade 3/4
      toxicities in an expansion set of patients at the recommended phase 2 area under the curve
      (AUC) range.

      II. Measure deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair score from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded
      diagnostic bone marrow sample (FFPE) and from pretransplant marrow aspirate sample.

      III. Assess melphalan-induced DNA damage in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from
      melphalan-treated patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive standard of care high dose melphalan hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over
      30 minutes on day -3 and PK-directed melphalan hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on day -1.
      Patients then undergo autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) on day 0.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 7, 14, 30, 60, and 90 days.

    <description>The number and percentage of subjects experiencing objective response will be descriptively summarized overall and by cohort.

    <measure>Incidence of selected grade 3/4 toxicities at the recommended AUC range</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 60 days post transplantation</time_frame>
    <description>The maximum grade for each type of toxicity will be recorded for each patient, and frequency tables will be reviewed to determine toxicity patterns. Adverse events will be summarized and described within each cohort. They will initially be reviewed regardless of attribution, but also whether they are possibly, probably, or definitely related to treatment. In addition, will review all adverse event data that are graded as 3, 4, or 5 and classified as either &quot;unrelated&quot; or &quot;unlikely to be related&quot; to study treatment in the event of an actual relationship developing. The incidence of severe adverse events or toxicities will be described. Will assess the proportion of patients who experience grade 3 or higher non-hematologic toxicity. To assess tolerability, will also capture the proportion of patients who go off treatment due to adverse events.</description>

          -  Patient must have the clinical diagnosis of a plasma cell neoplasm requiring treatment
             per the treating physician using the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) and
             World Health Organization (WHO) criteria as guidelines. This can include extraosseous
             plasmacytoma, monoclonal immunoglobulin deposition disease, and heavy-chain diseases
             as these diagnoses, while rare, can be treated in part with autologous transplant

          -  If enrolling in phase A of this protocol, the patient

                    -  If enrolling in phase B of the protocol, the transplant must be part of
                       first line therapy to provide some level of homogeneity for toxicity

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =&lt; 2 (Karnofsky &gt;= 60%)
             is required for eligibility. Those patients with lower performance status based solely
             on bone pain secondary to multiple myeloma are eligible

          -  Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy
             test prior to starting therapy. The effects of protocol therapy on the developing
             human fetus are unknown. For this reason, FCBP and men must agree to use adequate
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study
             entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or
             suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she
             should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this
             protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the
             duration of study participation, and 3 months after completion of protocol therapy

          -  Patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does
             not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the
             investigational regimen are eligible for this trial

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients known to meet criteria for progressive disease or clinical relapse between
             screening and planned melphalan infusion day -3

             following: CD4 &gt; 350 cells/mm^3, undetectable viral load, maintained on modern
             therapeutic regimen utilizing non CYP interacting agents (e.g. excluding ritonavir),

             infections.

          -  Seropositive for hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg]) EXCEPT subjects with resolved
             infection (ie, subjects who are positive for antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen
             [antiHBc] and/or antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen [antiHBs]) must be screened
             using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) measurement of hepatitis B virus (HBV)
             DNA levels. Those who are PCR positive will be excluded. Subjects with serologic
             findings suggestive of HBV vaccination (antiHBs positivity as the only serologic
             marker) AND a known history of prior HBV vaccination, do not need to be tested for HBV
             DNA by PCR

          -  Seropositive for hepatitis C except in the setting of a sustained virologic response
             [SVR], defined as without viremia for at least 12 weeks after completion of antiviral

          -  Concurrent medical condition or disease (eg, active systemic infection) that is likely
             to interfere with study procedures or results, or that in the opinion of the
             investigator would constitute a hazard for participating in this study

          -  Known or suspected of not being able to comply with the study protocol (eg, because of
             alcoholism, drug dependency, or psychological disorder) or the subject has any
             condition for which, in the opinion of the investigator, participation would not be in
             the best interest of the subject (eg, compromise their well-being) or that could
             prevent, limit, or confound the protocol-specified assessments

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because protocol therapy has the potential
             for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential
             risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to protocol treatment of the
             mother, breastfeeding should be discontinued
