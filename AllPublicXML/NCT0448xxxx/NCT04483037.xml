    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of administration routine
      bowel cleansing medication (Bowklean) for the Bowel Preparation at Different Times Prior
      Colonoscopy in the morning or in the afternoon.

      After bowel preparation, colonoscopy operator will evaluate the overall colon cleansing based
      on Aronchick and Ottawa scale. A total of 600 eligible subjects scheduled to a colonoscopy
      will be randomly assigned with equal allocation to 1 of 3 treatment groups. The 1st group:
      split dose, day before, colonoscopy in the morning. The 2nd group: split dose, day before,
      colonoscopy in the afternoon. The 3rd group: same day, colonoscopy in the afternoon. Each
      subject's participation is expected to be maximally 3 weeks in study duration.
