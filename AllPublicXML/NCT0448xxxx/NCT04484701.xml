  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is the third most common cause of cancer death in men. Most patients with
      localized prostate cancer will be cured with surgery or radiation therapy, but up to 35% of
      patients will have their prostate cancer return. Whether it has returned locally or distantly
      determines which type of treatment they will receive. Current conventional imaging modalities
      have limitations particularly at low prostate specific antigen levels. This study proposes to
      use Gallium-68-PSMA-11 (68Ga-PSMA-11) Positron Emission Tomography / Computer Tomography
      (PET/CT) scans which targets prostate-specific membrane antigens (PSMA) to detect where in
      the body the prostate cancer has recurred.

  <detailed_description>

      This is a prospective registry study to evaluate the diagnostic utility of 68Ga-PSMA-11
      PET/CT to stage patients with high risk prostate cancer, localize sites of biochemical
      recurrence of prostate cancer, and restage patients with advanced prostate cancer before and
      after onset of new therapy.

      Eligible subjects will undergo a 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT at the British Columbia Cancer (BCC) -
      Vancouver. Each subject will receive a 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT scan at the BCC - Vancouver, as
      part of this research study. Each study subject will receive a bolus intravenous dose of
      68Ga-PSMA-11. The subject will rest in a comfortable chair for 60 minutes and will then be
      taken to the PET/CT scanner for images. The PET/CT scan will take approximately 2.5 hours of
      patient time above and beyond the time needed for standard of care.

      Medical History Questionnaire: Demographic and medical history data will be collected either
      in person before the PET scan appointment or by mail or phone, whichever is the most
      convenient to the subject.

      Follow-up assessments: All subjects will be contacted by phone the day after the injection of
      68Ga-PSMA-11. The subjects will be asked if they experienced any undesirable effects during
      the 12 hours after the administration of 68Ga-PSMA-11. The local site attending nuclear
      medicine physician will then make an assessment as to whether these effects are likely
      related to 68Ga-PSMA-11 administration.

      All subjects will be followed for 5 years following the 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT exam to assess
      the presence of recurrence. The evaluation will include a chart review of available imaging,
      laboratory tests, and treatment. The data required can be obtained from a review of the
      patient's paper and electronic charts, supplemented by telephone contact as needed to
      complete the information.

    <description>The accuracy (along with the confidence interval) of 68Ga-PSMA-11 will be calculated for subjects with an available gold standard.
The gold standard for the detection of lesions will be established through a combination of: 1) pathology results following surgical resection; 2) disease progression of specific 68Ga-PSMA-11 findings on clinical or conventional imaging follow-up; 3) unequivocal disease response of specific 68Ga-PSMA-11 findings on conventional imaging follow-up after treatment; 4) decrease of PSA level after targeted radiation of 68Ga-PSMA-11 findings; 5) progression of 68Ga-PSMA-11 findings on subsequent 68Ga-PSMA-11 imaging associated with a concurrent increase in PSA level; 6) regression of [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 findings on subsequent [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 imaging associated with a concurrent decrease in PSA level.</description>

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 2 or less.

          -  Subjects with high risk prostate cancer (CAPRA score 6 or higher) being considered for
             curative-intent surgery or radiation therapy (including brachytherapy)

          -  Subjects with biopsy confirmed prostate cancer being considered for curative-intent
             surgery or radiation therapy (including brachytherapy), who have unconfirmed

          -  Subjects with biochemical recurrence or persistence of prostate cancer following
             initial curative treatment by radical prostatectomy, with two consecutive PSA values
             &gt;0.2 ng/ml measured more than 6 weeks after radical prostatectomy. If subjects

             imaging must be greater than 0.2 ng/mL.

          -  Subjects with biochemical recurrence or persistence of prostate cancer following
             initial curative treatment by radical prostatectomy and subsequently treated by
             salvage radiotherapy or pelvic node dissection, with two consecutive PSA values &gt;0.2
             ng/ml. If subjects received subsequent systemic therapy, the most recent PSA
             measurement prior to PET/CT imaging must be greater than 0.2 ng/mL.

          -  Subjects with biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer after initial curative therapy
             with radiation therapy (including brachytherapy), or non-standard local ablative
             therapy (such as high frequency ultrasound, cryoablation, focal laser ablation, etc.),
             with a PSA level &gt;2 ng/mL above the nadir after radiation therapy.

          -  Subjects with advanced castration sensitive or castration resistant prostate cancer
             being considered for localized treatment (surgery, brachytherapy, radiotherapy) of
             recurrent or oligometastatic prostate cancer. Castration resistance is defined as a
             PSA level &gt; 1.0 ng/mL, with 2 consecutive rises above the nadir, in the presence of
             castrate levels of testosterone (&lt; 1.7 nmol/L).

          -  Subjects with metastatic or castration resistant prostate cancer being evaluated for
             systemic therapy administered in therapeutic clinical trials. The PSA level must be &gt;
             1.0 ng/mL, with 2 consecutive rises above the nadir, in the presence of castrate
             levels of testosterone (&lt; 1.7 nmol/L).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Medically unstable (e.g. acute illness, unstable vital signs)

          -  Unable to lie supine for the duration of imaging

          -  Unable to provide written consent

          -  Exceeds safe weight limit of the PET/CT bed (204.5 kg) or unable to fit through the
             PET/CT bore (diameter 70 cm)

        Exclusion criteria for the use of furosemide Subjects can still participate in the research
        study and undergo the [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 scan if they are unable or unwilling to receive a
        furosemide injection.

          -  Subjects with end stage renal disease.

          -  Subjects with documented history of severe progressive chronic kidney disease
             (glomerular filtration rate less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2).

          -  Subjects with hypersensitivity to furosemide (Lasix).

          -  While cross-reactivity between sulfonamide antibiotics and non-antibiotics has been
             disproven, subjects who have a history of sulfonamide antibiotics or sulfonylureas may
             be at a higher risk of allergic reaction to furosemide due to a higher general
             predisposition to allergic reactions. In those instances, the administration of
             furosemide is left at the discretion of the local site investigator after discussion
             with the study subject.

          -  Subjects with severe hypokalemia, hyponatremia, hypovolemia, dehydration or
             hypotension.
