  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People suffering from chronic pain exhibit changes in the way the central nervous system
      processes pain. Some of the changes in the central nervous system are associated with how the
      brain adapts to the process of different stimuli. There are several physiological mechanisms
      that regulates how the brain adapts to changes and one of these mechanisms is called
      homeostatic plasticity (or equilibrium plasticity ). In healthy participants homeostatic
      plasticity mechanisms have been tested and considered normal, whereas in patients with
      chronic conditions, such as low back pain, this mechanism was shown to be dysfunctional.
      However, it is unknown when this difference in the pain system develops. It is possible that
      homeostatic mechanism becomes impaired during early stages of pain. This experiment will
      investigate the effect of capsaicin-induced pain on homeostatic plasticity in healthy
      participants.

      The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of capsaicin-induced pain on homeostatic
      plasticity.

      A within-subject repeated-measures design will be used to evaluate the effect of
      capsaicin-induced pain on homeostatic plasticity using cathodal transcranial direct current
      stimulation (tDCS). Each participant will take part in four experimental sessions during
      which homeostatic plasticity and corticomotor excitability will be induced and measured in
      the left primary motor cortex. Participants will receive in randomised order capsaicin or
      placebo patch placed on the dorsal part of the right hand.

      Each participant will attend four sessions, being two consecutive sessions separated by two
      weeks (i.e. wash-out period). During the experiment, participants will be seated comfortably
      with hands and arms at rest. First, the electromyography electrodes will be placed at the
      right hand muscle to be used for assessing the corticomotor excitability by recordings of
      motor evoked potentials by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) on the left primary motor
      cortex. Then, the cap for tDCS on the left primary motor cortex will be mounted. The optimal
      scalp position (hot spot) for TMS stimulation will be identified and marked with a pen on the
      cap for standardisation. A 5 x 7 cm capsaicin/placebo patch will be placed on participants'
      right hand. After 30 minutes of patch application, baseline measures of pain and motor-evoked
      potentials will be taken. Then, the homeostatic plasticity induction process will take place
      followed by motor-evoked potentials recordings every 15 minutes up to 45 minutes post
      protocol. Finally, ice will be placed over the patch as to reduce pain intensity to zero and
      homeostatic plasticity will be induced and measured as previously. The patch will be left in
      place for 24 hours, at which point participants will return to the laboratory and homeostatic
      plasticity will once again be induced and measured. After a wash-out period of two weeks,
      participants will go through an identical process but at this time with a different patch.

      Homeostatic plasticity will be induced in the left primary motor cortex using tDCS applied
      for 7 minutes followed by an interval of 3 minutes and another block of 5 minutes of
      stimulation. A constant current of 2mA will be transmitted through the tDCS system, using two
      25 cm2 electrodes placed into holes of a cap over the hot spot and right supraorbital area.

      A sample size calculation was conducted using α of 0.05, β of 0.80 and effect size of 0.29
      based on motor evoked potential (MEP) analysis of previous studies resulting in a target of
      18 participants.

      Data distribution will be assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk test. A repeated measures analysis
      of variance (ANOVA) will be conducted on mean MEPs with factors Intervention (Capsaicin and
      Placebo), Time (baseline, 0 min, 15 min, min, 30 min, 45 min) and Time with pain (immediate,
      post pain relief post prolonged pain). A Greenhouse-Geisser correction will be used if
      Mauchly's test shows that sphericity cannot be assumed. Adjustments will be made for multiple
      post-hoc comparisons using the Bonferroni correction. Results will be interpreted according
      to the level of statistical significance p≤0.05 and effect size reported as partial eta
      squared.
