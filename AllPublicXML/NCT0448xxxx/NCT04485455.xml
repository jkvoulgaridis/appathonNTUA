  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, pilot, feasibility study evaluating effects of Intermittent Theta
      Burst Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (iTBS) on 5 eligible adolescents for the treatment of
      depression. Safety and tolerability will be evaluated with changes in depression scores, and
      suicidality and non-suicidal self injurious behavior will also be monitored for exploratory
      and safety measures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the efficacy and durability of the effects of Intermittent Theta
      Burst Stimulation (iTBS) in adolescent depression by measuring changes in clinical ratings
      before, during, and after 4 weeks of treatment, up to 12 weeks following treatment. The
      investigators expect that subjects will show: improvement in symptoms over 20 iTBS sessions
      as measured by the Children's Depression Rating Scale Revised (CDRS-R), Hamilton Depression
      Rating Scale (HAM-D) and Non-suicidal Self Injurious Behavior (NSSIB) measures, and
      persistence of this reduction of depressive symptoms through the 12 weeks follow up period of
      the study. In this study, the investigators will investigate the safety of the effects of
      iTBS in adolescent depression. The investigators will investigate safety of the treatment
      regimen by assessing suicidality. The investigators expect suicidal thoughts and behavior
      will reduce with iTBS treatment as measured by the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale
      (C-SSRS) and a psychiatrist's clinical assessment. The investigators also expect that those
      with NSSIB at the start of the trial will have less after iTBS treatments. The investigators
      do not expect any change in cognition measured with the Mini Mental Status Exam (MMSE),
      Trails B, and List Generation. The investigators will investigate treatment feasibility by
      assessing treatment completion and withdrawal. The investigators define the feasibility of
      iTBS will be defined as feasible by as completion of 15/20 (75%) iTBS treatment sessions by
      all subjects and withdrawal from treatment of no more than one of five subjects (20%) due to
      intolerable side effects or persistent symptoms of MDD. Investigation of efficacy,
      durability, safety as well as feasibility simultaneously is essential in this preliminary
      study of the use of iTBS in adolescents in order to justify a larger future study. This study
      will include a screening visit, 20 iTBS treatments, and 3 planned follow up visits.

    <description>Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) is a semi-structured interview that has &quot;yes or no&quot; answers to assess the likelihood of a subject harming themselves. Based on subject's response to questions, a clinician scores &quot;acute lethality/ medical damage&quot; from a score of 0-5, with a higher score indicating more medical attention is needed and the patient is less safe. &quot;Potential lethality&quot; is scored 0-2, with a higher score indicating a higher risk of future harm to self. This scale also uses clinician judgment to determine these scores based on the subject's responses to the &quot;yes/no&quot; questions and follow-up descriptions to answers as needed.</description>

    <description>Motor Threshold determination, done prior to starting treatments, determines the location and the intensity for the iTBS treatments. A magnetic field is applied with increasing intensity stimulating the motor region of the brain until there is thumb movement; this indicates the intensity of the treatments; the location for treatment is in the sensory area parallel to this location.</description>

    <description>iTBS is a particular TMS protocol which delivers the magnetic field in triplet bursts (three stimulations very close together at a frequency of 50 Hz very quickly). The triplet bursts are repeated at a rate of 5 Hz for 2 seconds (30 pulses), followed by 8 seconds rest, repeated 20 times for a total of 600 pulses. Each treatments lasts approximately 3 minutes, and sessions are provided 20 times (Monday-Friday for 4 consecutive weeks).</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A score of greater than 40 on the CDRS-R and 17 on HAM-D.

          -  Documentation of DSM-V criteria for current MDD or TRD will be required for study
             entry.

          -  Patients may be on antidepressant medication at a stable dose or receiving
             psychotherapy with a licensed provider during the active phase of TMS treatment for 4
             weeks.

          -  Ability to provide consent and take part in questionnaires and scales (i.e.: not
             currently intellectually disabled).

          -  The presence of suicidality or NSSIB are not required to enter this study. Although
             our secondary end-points include suicidality, and the investigators are also exploring
             NSSIB, and thus this may not lead to many data, the investigators' plan is to use data
             from this study to justify a larger study where this can be more robustly
             investigated.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Past or current diagnosis of bipolar disorder, psychosis, seizures or traumatic brain
             injury.

          -  Presence of intracranial metallic implants or fragments, which is a contraindication
             for TMS.

          -  Lifetime history of (or currently present) epilepsy.

          -  Current diagnosis of substance abuse, eating disorder, PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress
             Disorder), or intellectual disability.* Nicotine use disorder will not directly
             preclude a potential subject from this study. Although chronic nicotine use does
             effect central nervous system excitability, what would be more confounding to our
             study would be if there is a sudden change in nicotine use during the treatment phase,
             as this may affect the motor threshold. Inclusion will however be at the PI's
             discretion.

          -  Current imminent suicide ideation or other clinical reasons for inpatient psychiatric
             hospitalization.

          -  Currently pregnant. There is currently not adequate data from this population to
             ensure safety with the scope of this protocol.

          -  Any reason the investigator determines may cause noncompliance with study rules or is
             unfit for receiving treatment.

          -  Currently taking certain medications including antidepressants, stimulants,
             benzodiazepines, and antipsychotics, antiepileptic (per investigator discretion).

          -  Any positive drug testing from a urine drug test unless medically indicated with a
             valid prescription.

               -  Those with marijuana/cannabis positive results may retest later if at that time
                  they do not meet criteria for substance abuse at screening and agree to refrain
                  from use for the duration of study participation. Decision to be made by
                  Investigator discretion.
