  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed exploratory research will pilot a family-focused, behavioral health intervention
      while also developing and piloting innovative and cost-effective mHealth tools to support
      Community Health Workers (CHWs) in Sierra Leone. This dual focus will help build capacity
      both for delivery of evidence-based mental health services to reduce family violence and
      harsh parenting practices, and for effective use of mHealth strategies to improve healthcare
      delivery and quality. This study will leverage Government of Sierra Leone investments in
      community health initiatives and mHealth innovations as a strategy to address critical
      healthcare workforce limitations that plague delivery of evidence-based interventions to
      vulnerable families in post-conflict Sierra Leone. The study will pilot mHealth-supported
      delivery of a culturally adapted version of the Family Strengthening Intervention for Early
      Childhood Development (FSI-ECD). The FSI-ECD has demonstrated effectiveness in improving
      parental emotion regulation and reducing family violence and harsh parenting practices among
      high-risk families with children aged 6-36 months in Rwanda. Study aims are to:

      Aim 1. Employ a five-phase user-centered design approach to develop and test mHealth tools to
      improve training, supervision, and fidelity monitoring of Community Health Workers. Study
      investigators hypothesize that mHealth tools will be feasible, acceptable, and user-friendly.

      Aim 2. Conduct a Randomized Controlled Pilot Study to assess feasibility, acceptability, and
      preliminary effects of the mHealth-supported delivery of FSI-ECD on parent mental health,
      emotion regulation, and familial violence in high risk families with children aged 6-36
      months (n=40) in comparison to control families (n=40) who receive standard care. Parental
      mental health, emotion regulation, household violence, and parenting practices will be
      assessed at baseline, post-intervention and 6-month follow-up. The pilot study will also
      integrate a cost-effectiveness analysis to assess the economic value of the mHealth-supported
      delivery of the FSI-ECD vs. standard care. Study investigators hypothesize that (a) the
      effects of the FSI-ECD will be comparable to results observed with vulnerable families in
      Rwanda; (b) digital tools will be feasible and acceptable to CHWs and supervisors; and (c)
      mHealth-enhanced supervision and fidelity monitoring will increase supervisor engagement and
      support CHW quality improvement cycles.

      Aim 3. Leverage well-established relationships and government partners to strengthen capacity
      for mHealth research and quality healthcare delivery in Sierra Leone. Partners include the
      University of Makeni, the Directorate of Science, Technology and Innovation, and the Ministry
      of Health and Sanitation.

    <description>The Family Strengthening Intervention for Early Childhood Development (FSI-ECD) is an evidence-based home-visiting behavioral intervention for vulnerable families with children aged 6-36 months. The FSI-ECD targets improving parental emotion regulation and parent-child interactions to improve parental mental health and child development outcomes and reduce family violence. FSI-ECD compromises five core components delivered in 12 modules delivered in weekly sessions via active coaching by community health workers. Core components include coaching on: a) nutrition, health and hygiene; b) early stimulation and playful parenting; c) building resilience and coping skills; d) building problem-solving skills; and d) building emotion regulation and conflict resolution skills.</description>

    <description>Standard CHW care involves three home visiting sessions delivered to families following childbirth with weekly supervision via phone or face-to-face. Topics of home visiting sessions include: skilled post-natal care for mothers, early initiation of breastfeeding and exclusive breastfeeding practices, adequate nutrition, immunization services and timely use of these services, hand washing and hygiene practices (including waste disposal and food hygiene), building the capacity of family members to appropriately take care of newborns and children under age 5, and building the capacity of family members to recognize and act on postnatal danger signs for newborns, mothers, and children under 5. CHWs also conduct screenings for acute malnutrition and growth monitoring to identify early referrals, and they can provide family planning methods, deworming tablets and other vitamins for acute malnutrition, dehydration, and anti-malaria treatment. Each home-visiting session lasts about 60 minutes.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Focus Group-User Interface/User Experience (UI/UX) Participants: Aged 18 or older;
             ability to attend 1-2 sessions (90 minutes per session)

          -  Family Participants: Families who are (a) a Sierra Leonean household with cohabitating
             caregivers (e.g., father/mother, mother/grandmother, mother/intimate partner), and
             child (aged 6-36 months) with both parents aged 18 or older and; (b) one parent
             scoring at least 62.5 on the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS). The DERS
             cut-off score has been used successfully as a risk assessment screening tool in our
             prior and ongoing studies in Sierra Leone. Sierra Leonean caregivers scoring above
             this threshold on the DERS have reported significantly higher levels of severe
             physical punishment with their children as well as intimate partner violence. Both
             parents must agree to attend FSI-ECD sessions. If enrolled families have more than one
             child aged 6-36 months, we will include all eligible children as study participants.
