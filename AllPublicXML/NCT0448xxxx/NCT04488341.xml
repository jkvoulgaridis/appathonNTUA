      PURPOSE:

      to determine the effect of aerobic exercise training on sex hormones and coagulation factors
      in postmenopausal elderly women

      BACKGROUND:

      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the largest cause of death in women, and the risk of
      developing CVD increases after menopause . Because thrombosis is thought to be a cause of
      most acute cardiovascular events, abnormalities in endogenous coagulation and fibrinolysis
      may play an important role in the risk of an acute cardiovascular event. Aging is also
      associated with adverse changes in both coagulation and fibrinolysis. For instance,
      postmenopausal women exhibit higher fibrinogen levels and lower levels of endogenous
      fibrinolysis. Physical activity and physical fitness have consistently been linked to lower
      CVD rates in women. In fact, an inverse association between physical activity and total
      mortality, as well as a 50% reduction in risk of myocardial infarction, has been observed in
      physically active postmenopausal women. In addition to the numerous other benefits provided
      by regular physical activity, one of the mechanisms mediating the cardioprotective effect may
      be changes in the hemostatic system, particularly fibrinolysis

      HYPOTHESES:

      Aerobic exercises may have no effect on sex hormones and coagulation factors in elderly
      postmenopausal women

      RESEARCH QUESTION:

      Do aerobic exercises effect on sex hormones and coagulation factors in elderly postmenopausal
      women in response to exercises?

      It is an interventional study in which 40 women estimated to enroll according to random
      allocation and assigned into two groups equally. The study group will receive aerobic
      exercises in addition to diet recommendations while the control group will receive diet
      recommendations. the aerobic exercises time of session 40-50 min initial 10 min warm up
      exercises on treadmill in low intensity and active phase 20- 30 min intensity will increase
      until patient reach to target heart rate then intensity decrease until session will be ended
      by cooling down phase for 10 min . The volunteers will perform exercises 3 times per week for
      12 weeks .coagulation factors(Prothrombin time, Partial Thromboplastin Time , plasminogen
      activator inhibitor-1 , fibrinogen and tissue plasminogen activator )will be measured and sex
      hormones (estradiol ,testosterone. sex hormone binding globin ) pre and post intervention
