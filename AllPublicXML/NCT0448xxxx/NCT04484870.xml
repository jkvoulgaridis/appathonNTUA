      [objective] to compare the efficacy of Danshu capsule and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in
      preventing recurrence of choledocholithiasis after operation. [methods] one hundred and fifty
      ERCP patients with choledocholithiasis were randomly divided into two groups: Danshu group (n
      = 75) and UDCA group (n = 75). The Danshu group took 2 Danshu capsules three times a day, and
      the UDCA group took 250 mg of Ursofalk twice a day. The clinical efficacy, changes of liver
      function indexes before and after treatment and stone recurrence were compared between the
      two groups.
