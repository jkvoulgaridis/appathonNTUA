  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Persons with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) account for 3.2 million
      hospital admissions per year and have over three times more hospitalizations than those
      without cognitive impairment, yet hospital caregivers (HCGs) are ill-prepared to manage
      patients with ADRD with less than 5% reporting mandatory dementia care training.
      Three-quarters of hospitalized persons with ADRD display Behavioral and Psychological
      Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD) associated with functional and cognitive decline, increased
      resource consumption, institutionalization, premature death, and caregiver burden. The
      overall objective is to test the preliminary efficacy of an innovative model of care,
      PES-4-BPSD, for reducing BPSD by empowering Patient Engagement Specialists (PES) to deliver
      dementia care for acutely-ill patients with ADRD. Traditionally, mental health assistants
      with training in crisis-prevention techniques provide care to psychiatric patients. On the
      intervention unit, these mental health assistants, as PES, purposefully engage patients with
      BPSD. In the pilot study, investigators found patients with cognitive impairment admitted to
      the PES unit were significantly less likely to require constant observation, chemical and
      physical restraints, suggesting improved management of BPSD. The central hypothesis is that
      PES-4-BPSD will improve the ability of PES to create an &quot;enabling&quot; milieu that addresses
      factors leading to BPSD and improves the experience of hospital caregivers. Guided by a
      social-ecological framework, PES-4-BPSD incorporates dementia education and training,
      environmental modifications-cohorting, increased staffing-PES, and staff support. The
      investigators' multidisciplinary research team is well-positioned to accomplish the
      following: Aim 1) Determine the preliminary efficacy of PES-4-BPSD for reducing BPSD during
      hospitalization, and Aim 2) Evaluate whether dementia care training improves the perceived
      ability of PES staff (intervention) and nurse assistant staff (control) to care for
      hospitalized persons with ADRD. For Aim 1, investigators will conduct a non-randomized
      preliminary efficacy trial of the PES-4-BPSD intervention enrolling N=158 patients (79
      control, 79 intervention). The primary outcome will be presence of BPSD during
      hospitalization using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Questionnaire (NPI-Q). In Aim 2,
      investigators will use survey methodology in a repeated measures design to evaluate within
      and between-group differences in attitudes, experience, and satisfaction toward managing
      patients with ADRD. Measures will be completed at baseline (T1), immediately following
      training (T2), and at the end of the intervention period (T3). This proposal will be the
      first to study an innovative model of care utilizing PES as specialized hospital caregivers
      for reducing BPSD in the hospital setting. The investigators' findings will lay the essential
      groundwork for a multi-site trial of PES-4-BPSD and inform the development of a program that
      can be easily implemented in other hospitals.

    <textblock>
      Prior to patient recruitment, a 3 month dementia training program will be implemented on both
      the intervention and control units. On the intervention unit, training will target the
      Patient Engagement Specialists (PES) and on the control to the nurse assistants (please refer
      to NCT# 04179721 for more details on this aim). Following the implementation of the dementia
      care training, eligible patients will be offered the opportunity to participate in the study.
      A research coordinator will offer the information and opportunity to participate to the
      patient's lawful caregiver. The signed consent forms will be stored in secured file cabinets.
      Once a participant has been enrolled in the study, demographic information will be obtained
      from the electronic medical records (EMR) and verified by Family Caregiver (FCG), including:
      age, gender, race/ethnicity, marital status, education, work status, current living
      situation, medical comorbidities, and reason for admission. A member of the research team
      will conduct a short interview with the FCG to verify patient background information and
      obtain baseline (1 month prior to admission) functional status (Barthel Index), dementia
      severity cognitive (Clinical Dementia Rating Scale)(5 stages of severity: no 0, questionable
      0.5, mild 1, moderate 2, and severe 3), and behavioral symptoms using the Neuropsychiatric
      Inventory-Clinical version NPI-C.

      A member of the research team will then complete daily NPI-Qs to determine the number of
      behaviors and symptoms for each patient on a daily basis. The data collector will use a
      multimodal approach drawing from electronic medical record (EMR) notes and interviews with
      nursing staff regarding the patient's behavior and treatment over the past 24 hours. Delirium
      will be assessed daily by the research coordinator using same multimodal approach and during
      the time of NPI observation. A final EMR chart review will be conducted collecting
      information such as length of stay, discharge disposition, in-hospital mortality as well as
      total usage practices for management of BPSD: use of special observation (1:1 or enhanced),
      restraints, psychoactive medications, psychiatric evaluation. Within 48 hours of discharge,
      family caregivers will be interviewed regarding satisfaction with care using the Carer
      Questionnaire Data from the National Audit of Dementia Round 3.

    <description>The Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q) is a validated tool with 12 behavioral domains for the assessment of neuropsychiatric symptomology designed for completion by caregivers of patients with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias. The tool asks the interviewee to rate each symptom, if present, as mild, moderate, or severe. Total scores range from 0-36 with higher scores indicating greater prominence of dementia symptoms. A Research Coordinator (RC) will utilize a multimodal approach, consisting of daily NPI-Q interviews with Hospital Caregivers and daily reviews of the patient's medical record, to provide a daily assessment of the 12 NPI-Q domains during hospitalization. Upon discharge, the average of each patient's daily NPI-Q total scores will be calculated, and this average will serve as the primary outcome.</description>

    <description>The intervention arm consists of PES and nurse assistants who work on the intervention unit which consists of: I. Cohorting of patients with cognitive impairment AND past or present indication of BPSD, acutely admitted to the medicine or telemetry service, are cohorted on a 10-bed medical unit. II. PES staff: mental health assistants with high school level education, who receive training in de-escalation and crisis prevention techniques and provide direct personal care to psychiatric patients. On the intervention unit, these PES purposefully engage patients with BPSD. III. Staff Support: The PI will hold monthly 20 minute group sessions to reinforce training and discuss challenging patient behaviors; meant to improve the attitude and empathy of HCGs towards patients. IV. Staff Training (please refer to NCT# 04179721 for more details on staff support and training).</description>

    <description>We will conduct a non-randomized preliminary efficacy trial, enrolling N=158 patients (79 control and 79 intervention). The primary outcome will be presence of BPSD as measured by a patient's total score on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Questionnaire (NPI-Q) during hospitalization. A multi-modal approach (including chart review and HCG questionnaires) will be used to determine the presence and severity of BPSD.</description>
