      Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) is indicated in cases where antithyroid medications cannot
      be used due to the side effects or attain no adequate hormonal suppression response at the
      highest dosage and in cases of rapid onset of clinical symptoms. This study presents the
      treatment results of patients who underwent TPE and subsequently operated for thyrotoxicosis.

      Background: Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) is indicated in cases where antithyroid
      medications cannot be used due to the side effects or attain no adequate hormonal suppression
      response at the highest dosage and in cases of rapid onset of clinical symptoms. This study
      presents the treatment results of patients who underwent TPE and subsequently operated for
      thyrotoxicosis.

      Methods: The files of 27 patients who underwent preoperative TPE for thyrotoxicosis between
      January 1999 and February 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. The demographic and clinical
      features of the patients were included.

        Therapeutic plasma exchange was performed in 27 thyrotoxic patients at the Adult
        Therapeutic Apheresis Center between January 1999 and February 2019. The patients were
        previously on treatment and follow-up in the Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism
        Diseases at our hospital.
