  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder. It is the second
      most frequent cause of presenile neurodegenerative dementia in those less than 65 years of
      age. Currently, there is no effective pharmacological treatment to slow down the progression
      of FTD. Recently, it has been proposed that neuroinflammation could be involved in specific
      forms of FTD and that novel drugs targeting neuroinflammation could potentially be useful in
      FTD treatment. An available form of ultra-micronized PEA combined with luteoline (PEA-LUT)
      has gained attention for its proven anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties reported
      in neurodegenerative conditions related to FTD, such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. The
      administration of PEA-LUT treatment may have a clinical impact in behavioural variant FTD
      (bv-FTD) patients. In particular, PEA-LUT treatment could be able to reduce behavioural
      disturbances, the more disabling symptoms in bv-FTD, with a related improvement of daily
      living activities of affected people. Moreover, a multimodal approach
      (cognitive/neurophysiological) can be used to assess the brain correlates related to the
      clinical improvement associated with PEA-LUT treatment, thus making remarkable strides in
      understanding how FTD affects the brain. Potentially the proposed project could provide a
      valid treatment for cognitive and behavioural dysfunction in FTD patients, with consistent
      impact for the National Health Systems and minimum cost for the patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient has a diagnosis of probable Frontotemporal dementia behavioural variant
             (bv-FTD) based on the International consensus clinical diagnostic criteria described
             by Rascovsky et al., 2011.
