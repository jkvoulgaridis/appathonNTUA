    <textblock>
      In the past three decades, the burden of stroke has increased in China and has gradually
      become the leading cause of death. The data acquisition and medical quality management still
      need to be improved in China. The purpose of this study was to establish online database of
      acute stroke patients for stroke management quality evaluation in China.

      This study is a prospective multi-center registration study. The data of acute ischemic
      stroke patients who underwent reperfusion therapy were registered on emergency platform. The
      data of stroke patients who were hospitalized were registered on stroke meidical quality
      control platform. The information including demographics, risk factors (history of
      hypertension, diabetes, stroke/TIA or atrial fibrillation, etc), prior antiplatelet usage,
      onset to door time (ODT), baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score,
      baseline infarct core volume, laboratory data, ect were recorded. Clinical outcome at 3
      months and 1 year was assessed.
