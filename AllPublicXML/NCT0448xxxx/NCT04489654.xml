  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adequate bone volume and a proper aesthetic outcome have become the main focus of interest in
      implant dentistry. Alveolar bone resorption is a natural course occurring after tooth
      removal. Partial extraction therapy through root preservation has been reported to help in
      bone maintenance at the extraction site. In 2010, Hurzeler et al. evaluated a new approach,
      at that time, called socket shield technique. Han et al. in 2018 reported the modification of
      this technique and leaving the jump gap between the shield and the implant non-grafted. The
      importance of bone grafting of the gap between the implant and the labial shield in improving
      quality of regenerating bone and prevention of the soft tissue ingrowth has been described.
      Thus the hypothesis, of improving the modified socket shield technique by bone grafting could
      be tested.

      Aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical and radiographic outcomes of using xenogenic
      bone graft on outcome of immediate dental implant placement using the modified socket shield
      technique.

      16 patients who are admitted to the outpatient clinic of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery
      Department, are divided into two study groups. Control group will receive an immediate
      implant with modified socket shield technique. Test group will receive immediate implant with
      modified socket shield and deproteinized bovine bone mineral (DBBM) put in the buccal gap.
      Outcome measurement is primary and secondary implant stability measurement and CBCT
      evaluation.
