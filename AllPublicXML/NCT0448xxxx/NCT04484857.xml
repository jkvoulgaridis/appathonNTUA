        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Receiving chronic dialysis for end stage renal disease (ESRD)

          -  Vascular access must be a functioning native arteriovenous fistula or graft with
             adequate flow in the opinion of the investigator, or permanent tunneled catheter

          -  Screening hemoglobin criteria: Subjects converting from an ESA: between 9.0 to 12.0
             g/dL; Subjects initiating anemia treatment: &lt; 10.0 g/dL

          -  Ferritin ≥ 50 ng/mL, Transferrin saturation (TSAT) ≥ 10% at screening

          -  Subject's alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) are ≤ 3
             x upper limit of normal (ULN), and total bilirubin (TBL) is ≤ 1.5 x ULN at screening
             and prior to initiating roxadustat treatment.

          -  Body weight between 45.0 to 160.0 kg

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion within 4 weeks prior to enrollment

          -  Known history of myelodysplastic syndrome or multiple myeloma

          -  Known hereditary hematologic disease or other known causes for anemia other than
             chronic kidney disease (CKD)

          -  Known chronic inflammatory disease that is determined by the investigator to be the
             primary cause of anemia

          -  Active or chronic gastrointestinal bleeding

          -  Treated with iron-chelating agents within 4 weeks prior to enrollment

          -  History of New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV congestive heart failure

          -  History of MI, acute coronary syndrome, stroke, seizure, or a
             thrombotic/thromboembolic event (excluding vascular dialysis access
             stenosis/thrombosis) within 12 weeks prior to enrollment

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension, in the opinion of the Investigator

          -  Diagnosis or suspicion of renal cell carcinoma as shown on renal imaging performed
             within 24 weeks prior to enrollment

          -  History of malignancy, except for cancers determined to be cured or in remission for ≥
             2 years, curatively resected basal cell or squamous cell skin cancers, cervical cancer
             in situ, or resected colonic polyps
