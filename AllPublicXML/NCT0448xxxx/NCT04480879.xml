  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is intended to evaluate the systemic pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics and the
      safety of AZD8154 following administration of the Monodose DPI formulation compared with the
      administration of the nebuliser suspension.

    <textblock>
      This study will be a randomised, open-label, 3-period, single-dose, single-centre, crossover
      study in healthy males and healthy females of non-childbearing potential.

      The study will comprise:

        -  A Screening Period of maximum 28 days;

        -  Three treatment periods during which subjects will be resident at the Clinical Unit from
           the morning of the day before dosing with AZD8154 or placebo (Day 1) until 72 hours
           following dosing for collection of PK samples; discharged on the morning of Day 4 of
           each treatment period;

        -  A Follow up Visit within 6 ± 1 days after last dose administration of investigational
           medicinal products (IMPs) (i.e., AZD8154 or placebo).

      A total of 15 healthy subjects will be randomised in this study to ensure that at least 12
      subjects are evaluable.

      Each subject will be involved in the study for approximately 9 weeks.
