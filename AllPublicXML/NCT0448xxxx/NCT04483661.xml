  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Precision medicine is to achieve individual optimal health care, given the biological
      mechanisms, genetic variants, and environmental measurements. Take mood disorder (MD) as an
      example, we aim to develop systems and precision medicine in Taiwanese population.

      MD is a very serious and dysfunctional mental disorder. Since MD patients with treatment have
      high risk of neurocognitive impairment and metabolic disturbances, the therapeutic strategies
      are of clinical importance. Individual difference of treatment outcome in MD patients would
      result from genetic variants, environmental factors, and their interactions. Also, the
      treatment outcome of MD contains multiple dimensions, including improvement of disease
      severity, neurocognitive function, and optimized medication strategy. However, comprehensive
      development of approaches to investigate the multiple dimensions of treatment outcome in MD
      patients is limited. In this three-year proposal, we explore the interactions of genetic
      variants and environmental factors (represented by psychosocial stress and gut microbiota)
      driven approaches to develop precision medicine.
