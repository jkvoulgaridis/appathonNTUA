    <textblock>
      Multicenter prospective cohort observational study based on a termless epidemiological
      registry.

      Periodic inspection and collection of data from the subjects is carried out annually, in the
      last quarter of the current year.

      Patient data is recorded in a promising digital database and is constantly updated.

        The main cohort is formed from those who do not have CVD, who are affected by different
        factors that we register (various physical activities, the presence or absence of
        pregnancy, etc.).

        An additional cohort is formed from those who have CVD at the time of inclusion.

        The goal is to track the natural evolution (progression) of the disease, to evaluate the
        incidence and risk factors of complications.

        An extremely important criterion for the formation of the study population is the
        possibility to control the lower legs veins of observed individuals by a qualified vascular
        specialist. To date, a qualitative assessment of veins according to the CEAP classification
        is a weak point in longitudinal epidemiological studies.
