  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study includes an observational pharmacokinetic study and an interventional medication
      adherence study. The purpose of this study is 1) to describe the concentration-time profiles
      of targeted anticancer drugs and to characterize the concentration-effect/toxicity
      relationships in the target population of patients (observational study) and 2) to
      characterize patterns of adherence to oral targeted anticancer drugs and identify key-driver
      modifiable adherence factors in patients participating in an adherence program
      (interventional study).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Targeted anticancer therapies are often prescribed at the same dosage regimen in all
      patients. However, it is known that the marked interindividual variability in drug level may
      affect treatment outcomes. Several factors are known to modulate drug levels, such as weight,
      genetics host-drug and drug-drug interaction. The identification of these factors could give
      the possibility to propose better adjusted dosage regimens according to patient's individual
      characteristics. Moreover, the presence of high or low drug concentrations may partially
      explain toxicity or lack of efficacy of targeted anticancer drugs in some patients. The
      characterization of the relationship between drug levels and treatment response (efficacy and
      toxicity) would allow an optimized and a more individualized patient management with targeted
      anticancer drugs.

      Oral targeted therapies must be taken on the long term and adherence issues have been shown
      to compromise treatment efficacy. Side effects and lifestyle management are among factors
      affecting treatment adherence. The characterization of adherence over time and the
      identification of factors susceptible to improve it will represent a great benefit for
      healthcare professionals and patients.

    <measure>Change from treatment start in efficacy of targeted anticancer drugs</measure>
    <time_frame>The cancer progression is evaluated at each PET-scan (once per 3 months) from the inclusion in the study during 2 years maximum or from the inclusion in the study to the end of the treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>The progression free survival (PFS) is used to evaluate the drug efficacy. The PFS is defined as the time interval between the first dose of drug and the date of progression or any cause death. Patient without progression at the study end will be censored.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Medication adherence : persistence rate and daily implementation of targeted anticancer drugs</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Adherence to oral anticancer therapies will be monitored thanks to Electronic monitoring Systems (MEMS, AARDEX) during maximum 12 months. This is a 1:1 randomized medication adherence intervention, which compares an intervention group vs. usual care. The intervention consists in monthly motivational interviewing sessions between the patient and the pharmacist, along with the delivering of oral targeted anticancer drugs in electronic pill bottles (Electronic Event Monitoring EEM, MEMSTM, AARDEX Ltd.). The patient meet the pharmacist after each clinical visits (usually once per month).</description>
