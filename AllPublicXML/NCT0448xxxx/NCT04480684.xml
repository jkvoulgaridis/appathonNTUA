  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Perineal injury following childbirth can result in complications such as wound infection. The
      perineum has closely related anatomical structures including the external genital organs and
      the anal triangle which contains the anal sphincter muscles. Therefore as wound infection can
      extend and as muscles of the perineum sit in such close proximity to each other, the anal
      sphincter muscles could potentially be affected. This could also potentially include cases of
      perineal injury where the anal sphincter was not injured.

      However ultrasound has never been used to investigate this. Endoanal ultrasound is the gold
      standard diagnostic tool in the assessment of obstetric anal sphincter injury. The anal
      sphincter can also be visualised using multiplanar transperineal
      ultrasound(three/four-dimensional. Therefore both modalities could be used. However, it has
      been shown that transperineal ultrasound has a high positive predictive value and therefore
      is able to correctly identify an intact anal sphincter, but low positive predictive value;
      meaning poor detection of sphincter defects. Therefore, although it cannot completely
      substitute endoanal ultrasound (the gold standard in investigating obstetric anal sphincter
      injuries), it provides and adjunct/alternative for women who cannot tolerate endoanal
      ultrasound.

      The investigators plan to perform an observational study to evaluate to the natural history
      of perineal wound infections. Patients will be assessed weekly with endoanal ultrasound
      and/or transperineal ultrasound until the wound infection has resolved and the wound has
      clinically healed.

      If a bacterial wound swab has not been taken prior to recruitment or wound swab results are
      not available, one will be taken to detect the causative organisms. Appropriate antibiotics
      will then be given to cover the detected organism.

      Bacterial burden and will also be measured weekly using the MolecuLight i:X; a bacterial
      autofluorescence camera which captures the presence and load of bacteria.

      In wounds that have superficially dehisced; exact wound measurements including wound surface
      area, depth, volume and healing progress will be precisely measured using the Silhouette速 3D
      camera

    <time_frame>Baseline until wound infection resolved and wound healed, or up to 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Endoanal ultrasound and/or transperineal ultrasound will be performed to assess involvement of the anal sphincter.
Anal sphincter defects will measured on both modalities with a 3-point angle, with the angle vertex in the middle of the anal canal. The 3D volume will be assessed at the deep, superficial, and subcutaneous levels for defects. A change in radial angle size will be measured.
On transperineal ultrasound the extent of the defect will be measured circumferentially using a 3-point radial angle(0 degrees being no defect). A change in radial angle size will be measured.</description>

    <measure>Change in sphincter defect Stark Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline until wound infection resolved and wound healed, or up to 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>On endoanal ultrasound, anal sphincter defects will also be scored using a validated Starck score which accounts for depth, length and size of the defect for both internal and external anal sphincter, with a range from 0 being no defect to 16 being maximal defect. Therefore, a change in this score will be measured.</description>

    <description>Three-dimensional endoanal ultrasound is the gold standard diagnostic tool in the assessment of obstetric anal sphincter injury. The anorectal transducer is inserted directly into the anal canal which allows assessment of the anal sphincter complex.
Patients will be assessed at weekly intervals with until the wound infection has resolved and the wound has clinically healed.</description>
