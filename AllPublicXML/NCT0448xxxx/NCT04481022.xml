      the aim of study is to investigate the effect of body mass index (BMI), age, duration of
      symptoms, pain severity and knee angle valgus on patient̕̕s response to proximal control

      Patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) is recognized as one of the most common lower-extremity
      disorders encountered by orthopaedic physical therapists. Females were 2.23 times more likely
      to develop PFPS than males. Various authors have suggested that hip weakness may be an
      impairment associated with PFPS, because poor hip control may lead to abnormal lower
      extremity or patellofemoral motions. Clinical prediction rules (CPRs) are tools designed to
      improve decision making in clinical practice by assisting practitioners in making a
      particular diagnosis, establishing a prognosis, or matching patients to optimal
      interventions.

    <description>Kujala questionnaire is a 13-items knee specific self-report questionnaire. It documents response to six activities thought to be associated specifically with anterior knee pain syndrome (walking, running, jumping, climbing stairs, squatting, and sitting for prolonged periods with knees bent), as well as symptoms such as limp, inability to bear weight through the affected limb, swelling, abnormal patellar movement, muscle atrophy and limitation of knee flexion. This questionnaire was used to ssess the individual's functional status and PFPS experienced during specific functional tasks.</description>

    <description>study investigates the effectiveness of proximal control exercises for patients with PFPS in improving pain and function. The findings of this systematic review are consistent with previous evidence reporting effectiveness of exercise for PFPS. In particular, there is consistent moderate to high quality evidence (three RCT, one CCT, three cohort studies, and one case series) that proximal interventions provide relief of pain and improved function in the short term, whereas the knee programs have variable effectiveness. Physical therapists should consider using proximal interventions for early stage treatment for PFPS (Peters et al., 2013).
After 4 weeks of a combined knee and hip strengthening exercise program, sedentary females with PFPS had a greater reduction in pain during stair descent compared to the group who performed knee strengthening exercises only. Both groups also showed significant improvement in function and pain during stair ascent (Fakuda et al., 2010).</description>
