  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Time-restricted eating (TRE) is a dietary manipulation that involves restricting food intake
      to 6-12 h/day with no energy intake the rest of the day. In rodents, TRE improves metabolic
      function without caloric restriction, potentially by activating nutrient sensing mechanisms
      and effects on circadian oscillations. However, an understanding of the effect of TRE on
      cardiometabolic health in people is not clear and few studies have evaluated this issue.
      Accordingly, the investigators propose to conduct a randomized controlled trial in people
      with obesity and prediabetes to determine the effect of 9 h TRE for 12 weeks, without a
      change in body weight, on key metabolic outcomes that are risk factors for cardiovascular
      disease (CVD): 1) multi-organ insulin sensitivity; 2) 24 h metabolic homeostasis and diurnal
      rhythm; and 3) adipose tissue and skeletal muscle biology. The proposed studies will
      elucidate the cardiometabolic implications of TRE in people with obesity and prediabetes.
