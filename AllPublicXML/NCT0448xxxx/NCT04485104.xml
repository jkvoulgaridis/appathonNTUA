  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of
      GWP42003-P compared with standard of care (SOC) antiepileptic treatment (AET) assessed during
      the 17-week treatment period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be comprised of 2 parts: Part A will evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics
      of cannabidiol oral solution (OS) compared with SOC treatment for a period of 17 weeks in
      participants with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). The duration of Part A will be
      approximately 29 weeks total, which includes a 1- to 2-week screening period, a 4-week
      baseline period, and a 17-week treatment period (including a 2- to 5- week titration period).
      For participants who do not wish to continue into Part B of the trial, there will be an up to
      2-week taper period and a safety follow-up period (4 weeks after the end-of-taper visit).
      Part B will be available to participants who complete Part A of the trial and continue to
      meet all eligibility criteria, and for participants whom the investigator feels continued
      treatment in Part B represents a favorable risk-benefit assessment for the participant. Part
      B will evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of cannabidiol OS for a period of 52
      weeks in participants with TSC. All participants in Part B will receive cannabidiol OS. The
      duration of Part B will be approximately 59 weeks total, including a 2- to 5-week titration
      period for those participants randomized to SOC treatment only in Part A of the trial, a
      2-week taper period, and a safety follow-up period (4 weeks and end-of-taper visit).

             to comply with all trial requirements (including accurate diary and electronic
             participant-reported outcome [ePRO] diary completion).

          -  Must have a clinical diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) according to the
             investigator and as defined by 2012 International TSC Consensus Conference and
             International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) Classification. Multichannel (minimum
             8-channel) 8- to 24-hour video EEG (VEEG) for confirmation of diagnosis may be
             collected from the participant's medical record if suitable.

        Part B Only:

          -  Has completed Part A of this trial.

          -  Was compliant with all requirements of Part A (e.g., dosing, ePRO, participant
             visits/procedures), in the opinion of the investigator and sponsor.

          -  Investigator considers continued treatment in a 1-year extension trial represents a
             favorable risk-benefit assessment for the participant.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Part A Only:

          -  Has tumor growth which, in the opinion of the investigator, could affect participant
             safety.

          -  Has clinically significant abnormal laboratory values, in the investigator's opinion,
             at screening or baseline.

          -  Has clinically significant abnormalities in the electrocardiogram (ECG) measured at
             screening or randomization. Including, QT interval corrected for heart rate with
             Bazett's formula (QTcB), of &gt; 460 milliseconds (msec) on ECG.

          -  Has any concurrent cardiovascular conditions, which will, in the investigator's
             opinion, interfere with the ability to assess their ECGs.

          -  Has any known or suspected hypersensitivity to cannabinoids or any of the excipients
             of the investigational medicinal product (IMP) such as sesame seed oil.

          -  Has significantly impaired hepatic function prior to randomization, defined as:

               -  Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &gt; 3 ×
                  upper limit of normal (ULN) and total bilirubin (TBL) &gt; 2 × ULN or international
                  normalized ratio (INR) &gt; 1.5).

               -  Elevated ALT or AST should be discussed with the medical monitor prior to
                  randomization; the medical monitor may allow for a confirmatory re-draw prior to
                  randomization.

          -  Has any other clinically significant disease or disorder which, in the opinion of the
             investigator, may either put the participant at risk because of participation in the
             trial, may influence the result of the trial, or may affect the participant's ability
             to take part in the trial.

          -  Any clinically significant abnormalities identified following a physical examination
             of the participant that, in the opinion of the investigator, would jeopardize the
             safety of the participant if they took part in the trial.

          -  Has previously been randomized into this trial.

          -  Has plans to travel outside their country of residence during the trial, unless the
             participant has confirmation that the IMP is permitted in the destination country.

             randomization. Including, QT interval corrected for heart rate with Bazett's formula
             (QTcB), of &gt; 460 msec on ECG.

          -  Has any concurrent cardiovascular conditions, which will, in the investigator's
             opinion, interfere with the ability to assess their ECGs.

          -  Has any known or suspected hypersensitivity to cannabinoids or any of the excipients
             of the IMP such as sesame seed oil.

          -  Has significantly impaired hepatic function prior to Part B, defined as:

               -  Serum ALT or AST &gt; 3 × ULN and (TBL &gt; 2 x ULN or INR &gt; 1.5).

               -  Elevated ALT or AST should be discussed with the medical monitor prior to
                  rollover in Part B; the medical monitor may allow for a confirmatory redraw prior
                  to rollover.

          -  Has any other clinically significant disease or disorder which, in the opinion of the
             investigator, may either put the participant at risk because of participation in the
             trial, may influence the result of the trial, or may affect the participant's ability
             to take part in the trial.

          -  Any clinically significant abnormalities identified following a physical examination
             of the participant that, in the opinion of the investigator, would jeopardize the
             safety of the participant if they took part in the trial.

          -  Has previously been enrolled in Part B of this trial.
