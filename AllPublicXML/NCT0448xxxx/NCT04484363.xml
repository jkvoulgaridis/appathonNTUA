  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to provide access to pevonedistat prior to Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) approval for eligible participants in the United States with no suitable
      alternative treatment and who cannot enter a clinical trial.

    <textblock>
      This is an expanded access program in which the drug being tested is called pevonedistat,
      which is used in combination with azcitidine. This study will provide expanded access of
      pevonedistat (in combination with azacitidine) for the first-line treatment to participants
      with HR-MDS and option of real world data (RWD) collection for the benefit of future
      participants.

      All participants will receive azacitidine via intravenous or subcutaneous route in
      combination with pevonedistat intravenous infusion.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted win the United States. Participant will continue
      treatment until benefit is no longer derived from the treatment (that is, until disease
      progression, or treatment is no longer tolerable), the benefit-risk no longer favors the
      individual, an appropriate alternative therapy becomes available, the patient chooses to
      discontinue the treatment, or pevonedistat becomes commercially available.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Has morphologically confirmed diagnosis of MDS

          2. With MDS have one of the following Prognostic Risk Categories, based on the Revised
             International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R)

               -  Very high (greater than [&gt;] 6 points).

               -  High (&gt;4.5-6 points).

               -  Intermediate (&gt;3-4.5 points): a participant determined to be in the Intermediate
                  Prognostic Risk Category is only allowable in the setting of greater than or
                  equal to (&gt;=) 5 percent (%) bone marrow myeloblasts.

          3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 0, 1, or 2.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Has previous treatment for HR MDS with chemotherapy or other antineoplastic agents
             including hypomethylating agent (HMAs) such as decitabine or azacitidine.

             o Previous treatment with lenalidomide given within 8 weeks of first dose of drug.

          2. Has acute promyelocytic leukemia as diagnosed by morphologic examination of bone
             marrow, by fluorescent in situ hybridization or cytogenetics of peripheral blood or
             bone marrow, or by other accepted analysis.

          3. Is eligible for intensive chemotherapy and/or allogeneic stem cell transplantation.
             The reason a participant is not eligible for intensive chemotherapy and/or allogeneic
             stem cell transplantation may consist of one or more of the following factors:

               -  Age &gt;75.

               -  Comorbidities.

               -  Inability to tolerate intensive chemotherapy

               -  Physician decision (example, lack of available stem cell donor).

          4. Has either clinical evidence of or history of central nervous system involvement by
             acute myelogenous leukemia (AML).

          5. Active uncontrolled infection or severe infectious disease, such as severe pneumonia,
             meningitis, or septicemia.

          6. Has prothrombin time (PT) or activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) &gt;1.5*upper
             limit of normal (ULN) or active uncontrolled coagulopathy or bleeding disorder.
             Participants therapeutically anticoagulated with warfarin, direct thrombin inhibitors,
             direct factor Xa inhibitors, or heparin are excluded from enrollment.

          7. Has known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seropositivity.

          8. Has known hepatitis B surface antigen seropositivity, or known or suspected active
             hepatitis C infection. Note: Patients who have isolated positive hepatitis B core
             antibody (that is, in the setting of negative hepatitis B surface antigen and negative
             hepatitis B surface antibody) must have an undetectable hepatitis B viral load.

          9. Has known hepatic cirrhosis or severe preexisting hepatic impairment.

         10. Has known cardiopulmonary disease defined as unstable angina, clinically significant
             arrhythmia, congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association Class III or IV),
             and/or myocardial infarction within 6 months before first dose, or severe pulmonary
             hypertension.

         11. Has treatment with strong cytochrome P 3A (CYP3A) inducers within 14 days before the
             first dose of pevonedistat.
