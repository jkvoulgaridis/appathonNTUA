      This study will investigate the Globe® Positioning System, which is a new mapping module
      intended to assist in intra-atrial navigation during standard cardiac ablation procedures
      using the Globe Mapping and Ablation System.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient diagnosed with AF, who is eligible for ablation treatment with the Globe
             Catheter.

          -  Between 18 and 80 years of age, inclusive.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients from an Intensive Care Unit.

          -  Patients requiring concurrent right atrial ablation.

          -  Patients with either known abnormalities or previous cardiac procedures that would
             interfere with device delivery, position, or treatment efficacy.

          -  Women who are pregnant (as evidenced by pregnancy test if premenopausal), lactating,
             or who are of childbearing age and plan on becoming pregnant during the course of the
             clinical investigation.

          -  Mental impairment or other conditions, which may not allow patient to understand the
             nature, significance, and scope of the study or inability to legally provide informed
             consent.
