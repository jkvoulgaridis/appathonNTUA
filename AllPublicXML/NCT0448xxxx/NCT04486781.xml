    <textblock>
      sEphB-HSA may prevent tumor cells from multiplying and blocks several compounds that promote
      the growth of blood vessels that bring nutrients to the tumor. The purpose of this study is
      to evaluate the combination of Pembrolizumab + sEphB4-HSA in the population of patients with
      previously untreated advanced (metastatic or recurrent) urothelial carcinoma who are
      chemotherapy ineligible or who refuse chemotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The combination of Pembrolizumab + sEphB4-HSA will be given through an intravenous infusion
      (into a vein). Each cycle of sEphB4-HSA will be given at Day 1, 8, and 15 of each 3 week
      cycle. Each cycle of Pembrolizumab will be given at Day 1 of each 3 week cycle.

      Participants may continue on study protocol as long as they continue to respond and remains
      clinically stable on study medication.

      Patients may come off treatment for the following reasons:

        -  Disease progression.

        -  If tumor resolves.

        -  For participants who become pregnant.

        -  Incidence or severity of adverse drug reaction in this or other studies indicates a
           potential health hazard to subjects.

        -  Patient withdraws consent.

        -  Study termination by the Sponsor.

        -  Participants who are non-compliant with respect to taking drugs, keeping appointments,
           or having tests required for the evaluation of drug safety and efficacy.

        -  Participant's condition renders them unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment
           of the investigator.

    <description>Objective tumor response (OR), a derived endpoint, will be based responses as coded at each evaluation. A patient who experiences either a confirmed complete response (CR) or a confirmed partial response (PR) according to RECIST v1.1, will be classified as having experienced an objective response. To estimate the overall response rate (ORR) of the combination of Pembrolizumab + sEphB4-HSA in this population of patients, the number of patients who experience a confirmed complete response (CR) or a confirmed partial response (PR) will be divided by the number of eligible patients who began treatment.</description>

    <description>Overall survival (OS) is calculated as the time from start of protocol treatment until death from any cause.

    <description>Progression-free survival (PFS) is calculated as the time from start of protocol treatment until documentation of disease progression (as defined by RECIST v1.1) or until death from any cause, whichever comes first. Patients who are alive and have not progressed at the time of analysis will be censored at the last date that they were documented alive and free of progression. In addition, patients who begin another treatment (i.e. other than Pembrolizumab or sEphB4-HSA alone) prior to progressing, will be censored at the time of the start of the other treatment for the primary analysis of this endpoint.</description>

             imaging after receiving pembrolizumab. Other PD1/PDL1 antibodies are now allowed.

          -  Have measurable disease based on RECIST 1.1. We request an OPTIONAL core biopsy from
             an accessible metastatic site after a minimum of 2 cycles of treatment AND prior to
             progression of disease to help the investigators better understand the activity of
             these drugs in tumor tissue.

        In addition, we request an OPTIONAL collection of any surgical specimens obtained per
        standard of care during the study. For instance, specimens from metastasectomy while
        patient is undergoing therapy on this study.

             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a
             form of systemic treatment.

          -  Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment.
             Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma potentially cured after surgery or prostate
             cancer that is under control by hormonal agents.

             pembrolizumab or places the patient at undue risk for treatment related complications.

          -  Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy. Note:
             Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and
             are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist®) are live
             attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed.

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension is excluded- systolic blood pressure &gt;140mmHg or diastolic
