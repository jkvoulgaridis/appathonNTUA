  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the overall CASUS project is to develop the first fully molecular integrated
      cervical cancer screening approach, based on first-void urine as an easily accessible and
      non-invasive source of biomarkers. In contrast to current screening modalities, the CASUS
      approach will identify women with clinically relevant disease in need of treatment using only
      a single sample that can be collected at home (one-step triage).

      CASUS work package 1 (WP1): To accommodate for the detection of biomarkers in first-void
      urine, a next-generation first-void urine collection device is necessary, which includes
      internal process control, novel collector tubes for collection of smaller urine volumes, and
      integration of a non-toxic nucleic acid preservative.

      Hereto, new generations of the Colli-Pee® (Novosanis) first-void urine collector allowing
      collection of smaller volumes (Colli-Pee Small Volumes 4 and 10 mL) next to the 'standard'
      Colli-Pee FV5000 (20 mL) first-void urine collector will be developed and validated. The
      optimal urine volume needed for detection of host and viral biomarkers, as well as
      optimization of the nucleic acid preservative solution by introduction of a sample/extraction
      validation control (non-human DNA internal control (DNA IC)) will be evaluated by measuring
      the concentration of human DNA, HPV DNA, and the DNA IC in all first-void urine samples using
      different DNA extraction protocols.
