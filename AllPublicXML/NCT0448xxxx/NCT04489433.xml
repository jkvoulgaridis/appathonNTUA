      The patient's Treating Physician should follow the suggested treatment guidelines and comply
      with all local health authority regulations.

      The requesting Treating Physician submitted a request for access to drug (often referred to
      as Compassionate Use) to Novartis which was reviewed and approved by the medical team
      experienced with the drug and indication.

      This program will provide access to patients until:

        -  All participating countries have received marketing authorization and product is
           commercially available and accessible to all participating patient(s) or

        -  Alternative treatment options are available and/or

        -  In case of changes in the safety profile or a lack of overall efficacy of the product.
