      The purpose of this study is to assess the evolution of disease control, health-related
      quality of life, and the risk of severe asthma exacerbations in children and adolescents with
      persistent asthma in Spain at short, mid and long-term follow-up. Patient-reported
      information in this project is collected by computer assisted telephone interviews (CATI) and
      a mobile application (ARCA App).

      Primary Objectives:

        1. To evaluate the asthma control in children and adolescents with persistent asthma, and
           its relationship with patient characteristics, treatment and health-related variables
           (treatment adherence, inhalation technique, inhaler device, asthma triggers, and smoking
           exposure, among others).

        2. To assess the health-related quality of life of children and adolescents with persistent
           asthma, and its relationship with patient characteristics, treatment and health-related
           variables (asthma control, treatment adherence and inhalation technique, inhaler device,
           asthma triggers, and smoking exposure, among others).

        3. To assess the risk of severe asthma exacerbations in children and adolescents with
           persistent asthma and its relationship with patient characteristics, treatment, and
           health-related variables (asthma control, treatment adherence and inhalation technique,
           inhaler device, health-related quality of life, asthma triggers, and smoking exposure,
           among others).

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. To evaluate the effect of monitoring inhalation techniques on patients' performance
           according to recommended actions when using inhalers, and outcomes such as asthma
           control, health-related quality of life, and asthma exacerbations.

        2. To assess the treatment adherence in children and adolescents with persistent asthma,
           and its relationship with other treatment-related factors (inhaler technique, inhaler
           device, adherence attitudes, and beliefs about illness, inhaler and exacerbations, among
           others).

        3. To evaluate health inequalities in children and adolescents with asthma in Spain.

      ARCA is a prospective multicenter observational study in children and adolescents with a
      clinical diagnosis of persistent asthma. This clinical diagnosis of asthma is defined as the
      presence of wheezing three times in the last year that improves with the use of
      bronchodilators. Participants are consecutively recruited in outpatient pediatric pulmonology
      hospital consultations and primary care physicians.

      Patient-reported information is obtained by computer-assisted telephone interviews (CATI) and
      a mobile application (ARCA App). Telephone interviews are performed by trained interviewers
      to children 8-16 years old and parents/caregivers of children 6-7 years of age, immediately
      after recruitment and every 6 months. It includes the evaluation of asthma control,
      prescribed asthma treatment, adherence, and severe asthma exacerbations. Information about
      inhalation techniques, socioeconomic status, smoking exposure, triggers, use of peak flow,
      symptom diary, perceived asthma care, adherence attitudes, and beliefs about illness, inhaler
      and exacerbations is also collected.

      The 'ARCA app' combines 3 age versions: parents/guardians (proxy response) for children 6-7
      years old, children aged 8-11 years (self-response), and adolescents aged 12-16 years
      (self-response). The application consists in an interactive chat, simulating a conversation
      by Short Message Service (SMS) or Instant Messaging Application (WhatsApp) with someone in
      real time. It includes the monthly administration of 2 questions (global rating of change and
      severe asthma exacerbations). At the beginning, after downloading the app, and every two
      months different standardized questionnaires are administered by turns: the EuroQol (EQ-5D),
      the Pediatric Asthma Impact Scale (PAIS), inhalation techniques scale, and environment
      support. These latter scales are administered randomly to two groups of equal size, defined
      within the subsample recruited by each pediatrician.

      All the information that each participant answers through the app can be viewed by the
      pediatrician through a specific platform. The results of the different questionnaires are
      shown in charts reflecting the patient's answers over time, using the traffic lights code:
      green for good outcomes, amber for intermediate, and red for poor. Clinical data is
      registered at recruitment and annually during the follow-up.

      Sample size: To detect differences between two groups in the Asthma Control Questionnaire
      score of 0.3 SD, 175 patients per group would be required to have a statistical power of 80%,
      at a significance level of 5%.

    <time_frame>2, 5, 7 and 10 years after inclusion</time_frame>
    <description>Symptoms control is measured with the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-symptoms) only, which assesses the frequency of 5 asthma symptoms (night-time waking, symptoms on waking, activity limitation, shortness of breath, and wheeze) during the previous week on a 7-point Likert scale from 0 (no impairment) to 6 (maximum impairment). The overall score, calculated as the mean of item responses, ranges from 0 to 6. A score &gt;1.5 is considered not well-controlled asthma, and scores &lt;0.75 well-controlled asthma.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in Health-Related Quality of Life, measured with the EuroQol</measure>
    <time_frame>2, 5, 7 and 10 years after downloading the ARCA app</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D consists of 5 dimensions (&quot;mobility&quot;, &quot;looking after myself&quot;, &quot;doing usual activities&quot;, &quot;having pain/discomfort&quot; and &quot;feeling worried/sad/unhappy). It includes also a visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS) on the general health status from 0 (worst health status) to 100 (best health status possible). The EQ-5D index ranges from 1 (best health state) to negative values (health states valued as worse than death), where 0 is equal to death, allowing the calculation of Quality-Adjusted Life-Years (QALYs).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of severe asthmatic exacerbations</measure>
    <time_frame>5 and 10 years after inclusion</time_frame>
    <description>As a screening to detect asthma exacerbation, the experience of asthma worsening question is administered through the ARCA app: &quot;In the last month, have you had to take any pill, syrup, oral solution or go to the doctor or hospital, due to asthma worsening?&quot; (Yes/No). If the answer is &quot;yes&quot;, a phone call confirms or discards a severe asthma exacerbation through the following questions: &quot;Did you visit or phone your general practitioner, out-of-hours, or walk-in center because your asthma got worse?&quot;, &quot;Did you call an ambulance or go to the hospital because of your asthma?&quot;, &quot;Did you take steroids tablets (such as Prednisolone or Deltacortril) for at least 2 days because of your asthma?&quot; If the participant answers &quot;yes&quot; to at least one of the 3 questions, an asthma exacerbation is confirmed. These questions were constructed applying the definition of the American Thoracic Society and the European Respiratory Society.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in adherence to the treatment, measured with the Medication Intake Survey adherence scale-Asthma (MIS-A)</measure>
    <time_frame>2, 5, 7 and 10 years after inclusion</time_frame>
    <description>Adherence is assessed separately for each controller inhaler, based on self-reported prescription start date, daily dosage recommendations and 3 questions on controller use over increasing time periods (day before, previous week, and previous month). Percentages of medication used versus prescribed are calculated first for each question, and subsequently as composite scores (0-100). The total score is categorized into complete (100%), intermediate, and low (50%) adherence. Medication abuse (temporary occasional) is also evaluated for each treatment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in quality of the inhaler technique, measured with the Inhalation Technique Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>2, 5, 7 and 10 years after downloading the ARCA app</time_frame>
    <description>The Inhalation Technique Scale includes five questions on how often participants perform recommended actions when using inhalers, on a 5-point Likert scale from 0 (never) to 4 (always). The overall score, calculated as the mean of items responses, ranges from 0 to 4 points. Higher values indicate better inhaler technique.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in the Pediatric Asthma Impact Scale (PAIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>2, 5, 7 and 10 years after downloading the ARCA app</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) developed the short version of the Pediatric Asthma Impact Scale (PAIS), composed of 8 items assessing the past seven days in a 5-point response scale with the options: never, almost never, sometimes, often, and almost always. The total raw score (adding the values of the response to each question) is translated into a T-score with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation (SD) of 10. A score lower than 50 is one SD lower than the mean of the reference population.</description>
