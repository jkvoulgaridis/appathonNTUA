  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II study investigates how well radium-223 works in treating patients with
      castration-resistant prostate cancer than has spread to the bones (bone metastases). Prostate
      cancer is the most common cancer in men and the second leading cause of cancer death.
      Furthermore, many men with notably advanced disease have been found to have abnormalities in
      DNA repair. The purpose of this research is to study the role of a DNA repair pathway in
      prostate cancer, specifically in response to administration of radium-223, an FDA-approved
      drug known to cause DNA damage to cancerous cells. Understanding how defects in the DNA
      repair pathway affects radium-223 treatment of prostate, may help doctors help plan effective
      treatment in future patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive standard of care radium Ra 223 dichloride given by intravenous (IV) bolus
      every 4 weeks for up to 6 cycles. Patients undergo collection of blood every 1-3 months
      during radium Ra 223 dichloride treatment.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 5 years from the
      date of treatment completion.

    <measure>Response rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Response will be defined as having one or both of the following: confirmed prostate specific antigen (PSA) decline of &gt;= 30% from baseline AND/OR confirmed alkaline phosphatase (ALP) decline &gt;= 30% from baseline. Response is evaluated throughout the course of treatment until the post-radium-223 end of treatment laboratory studies. Confirmation of response by PSA and/or ALP requires a second consecutive value obtained &gt;= 2 weeks after the first with sustained &gt;= 30% decline. Characterization of response rate to radium-223 in the DRD patient population will be assessed by binomial proportion with Clopper-Pearson exact 2-sided 95% confidence intervals.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Comparison of treatment response (outcome/dependent variable) between cases and controls will be assessed using multivariate logistic regression modelling adjusting for secondary variables as appropriate. Risk estimates will include odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals.</description>

    <measure>Overall survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Survival by DRD status will be illustrated using univariate Kaplan-Meier curves. Additionally, Cox-PH model adjusting for age, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, Gleason grade score, baseline ALP, PSA, hemoglobin (HB), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) will be performed. This analysis may be limited by expected small number of events, thus it may be limited to raw reporting of events by DRD status.</description>
