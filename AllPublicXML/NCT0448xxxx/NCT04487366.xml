  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim of this study is to compare learning curves of single(1- Jedi grip: Pappin and Christie/
      2- Bedforth/ 3- on lock: Gupta and Berrill) and double operator ultrasound-guided peripheric
      nerve block techniques on a home-made gelatin-based phantom model.

    <textblock>
      Ultrasound-guided peripheral blocks are conventionaly performed by double operators. One
      operator controls both the ultrasound probe and peripheric block needle. Another assistant
      operator aspirate or injects local anesthetic. In this technique operator do not sense
      resistance in the syringe. Also this technique requires a well-done communication and
      coordination between operators.

      In order to eliminate disadvantages of this technique several single-operator grip techniques
      of the needle and syringe have been described(1- Jedi grip: Pappin and Christie/ 2- Bedforth/
      3- on lock: Gupta and Berrill). Single operator techniques allow the provider to perform
      independently.

      Aim of this study is to compare learning curves of single and double operator
      ultrasound-guided peripheric nerve block techniques on a home-made gelatin-based phantom
      model.
