  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      controversy remains about the stretching parameters needed to achieve a particular goal or
      treatment outcome. In clinical practice, multiple stretching techniques are used;
      nevertheless, there is no evidence-based agreement on the most effective parameters. One of
      these parameters, that might be affecting the treatment outcome the most, is the stretching
      duration, thus far there is a little agreement on the optimal stretching duration.

      This non agreement in exact stretching parameters is obvious between authors and researchers
      in the field of muscle energy techniques (MET) as well as those who have used and advocate
      various durations for the passive stretch that follows the contraction phase in MET.

      comparison and subsequent conclusions about appropriate stretching times are mainly based on
      mechanical factors such as range of motion and flexibility, while ignoring the neural
      adversative mechanical tension that may be created during stretching exercises. According to
      the literature , stretching induced neural tension may adversely affect the central nervous
      system and nerve root function due to the absence of the perineurium, which is the primary
      load carrying structure. Thus, safe or unsafe limits of nerve elongation are not well
      established, despite several basic scientific and clinical studies.. Consequently, in the
      present study, the current study aimed to answer the question: Is it theoretically possible,
      that increased longitudinal strain and stress on the spinal cord and nerve root from
      continuous stretching exercises may subtly impair the neural function? Our hypothesis is that
      a duration threshold exists where, once reached, adverse neural function will be apparent
      resulting in a reduction of either or both latency and amplitudes of evoked potentials.

    <description>Dermatomal Somatosensory Evoked Potentials will be elicited by repetitive, square wave (0.5 ms) electrical pulses (at 3 Hz) from standard clinical surface gel electrodes (20 mm) overlying cervical sensory dermatomes. Dermatomal somatosensory evoked potential will be collected at a stimulus intensity well above perception threshold.Complete recording runs will be undertaken during each session with averages of 250 to 1200 cortical responses from scalp surface recording electrodes (C3'-C4' in a 10-20 electrode configuration) of the contralateral scalp to the C4 to C8 dermatomes being stimulated</description>

    <description>The Neck Disability Index , consisting of 10 items related to daily living activities, will be our primary patient-reported outcome measure. Each item is scored out of five (with the no disability response given a score of 0) giving a total score for the questionnaire out of 50. Higher scores represent greater disability.</description>

    <time_frame>will be measured at two intervals ;pre-treatment and 24 Hours after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Cervical spine global range-of-motion will be measured using the valid and reliable cervical range-of-motion (CROM) device. The participant will perform flexion, extension, right/left lateral flexion, right/left rotation in upright sitting. The patient was instructed to perform each movement when he/she attained the maximum active range of motion. Three trials were conducted for each direction of movement, and the average of the three measurements will be recorded for analysis.</description>

    <description>Neck pain intensity will be measured using the numerical pain rating scale . The patients will be asked to place a mark along the line indicating their current pain intensity; 0 reflecting ''no pain'' and 10 reflecting the ''worst pain''.</description>

    <description>60 seconds stretching group Stretching exercises for upper Trapezius and Levator the examiner will passively place the participant's head into flexion, side-bending away and rotation towards the side to be stretched (for upper trapezius muscle) and flexion, side-bending away and rotation away from the side to be stretched (for levator scapula ). The patient introduces a light resisted effort to take the stabilized shoulder towards the ear and the ear towards the shoulder. The contraction is sustained for 10 seconds and, upon complete relaxation of effort, the therapist gently eases the head/ neck into an increased degree of side-bending and rotation, where it is stabilized, as the shoulder is stretched caudally. The examiner will depress the participant's shoulder with 100 Newton's of force measured with pressure dynamometer. Once the examiner achieved this level of force, he maintains the stretch for 60 seconds . The procedure is repeated three times.</description>
