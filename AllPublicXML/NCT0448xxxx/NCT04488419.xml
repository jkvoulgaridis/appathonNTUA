      The study is designed to evaluate safety and efficacy of ATH-1017 in mild to moderate AD
      subjects, with double-blind, parallel-arm treatment duration of 26 weeks, and based on
      clinical diagnostic criteria of Alzheimer's disease. Clinical efficacy is demonstrated by
      improvement in cognition and global/functional assessments comparing treatment to placebo.

          -  Reliable and capable support person/caregiver

          -  Treatment-free or receiving stable acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI) treatment,

               -  Subjects who received continuous dosing for at least 6 months, and are on a
                  stable, approved dose of an AChEI for at least 3 months before Screening OR

               -  Subjects who received an AChEI in the past and discontinued, e.g., due to
                  tolerability issues

               -  For subjects who received high dose donepezil at 23 mg PO, or galantamine at 24
                  mg PO or patch, a 3-month drug-free period is required between the last dose
                  received and Screening.

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of significant neurologic disease, other than AD, that may affect cognition,
             or concurrent with the onset of dementia

          -  Subject has atypical variant presentation of AD, if known from medical history,
             particularly non-amnestic AD

          -  History of brain MRI scan indicative of any other significant abnormality

          -  Diagnosis of severe major depressive disorder even without psychotic features.

             cardiomyopathy, or cardiac conduction defect (note: pacemaker is acceptable)

          -  Subject has either hypertension or symptomatic hypotension

          -  Clinically significant ECG abnormality at Screening or Baseline

          -  Renal insufficiency (serum creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg/dL)

          -  Hepatic impairment with alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase &gt; 2
             times the upper limit of normal, or Child-Pugh class B and C

          -  Malignant tumor within 3 years before Screening

          -  Memantine (Namenda®) and combination product of donepezil and memantine product
             (Namzaric®) within 6 weeks prior to Screening

          -  The subject has received active amyloid or tau immunization at any time, or passive
             immunization within 12 months of Screening
