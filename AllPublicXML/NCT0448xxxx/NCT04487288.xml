  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      So far, there have been studies showing that the CEUS-grafted technique has added value in
      biopsy and RFA, but no studies have compared the group using only fusion and the group using
      CEUS+fusion. Therefore, the additional added value of CEUS will be evaluated by comparing the
      two groups.

    <textblock>
      Despite the rapid development of tumor markers and liver imaging, pathological confirmation
      is still necessary for atypical liver lesions that do not meet imaging criteria. US guided
      procedures are widely used as a method to identify focal lesions of the liver pathologically,
      and these US guided procedures have no burden on the operation, can be easily accessed, and
      have a lower cost than surgery. However, the frequency of pathological confirmation with this
      US guided procedure remains at around 90%. In order to increase this probability, a technique
      for fusion of liver CT/MRI and US has been widely used in recent years, and this allows
      accurate targeting of small lesions through structures seen in CT and MR. Through the fusion
      technique, the biopsy success rate for focal lesions can be increased to 94.4%. However,
      there are many cases where lesions deeply located in patients with cirrhosis are invisible,
      and biopsy is difficult only with fusion due to poor sonic window in patients with high BMI.
      To this end, a technique called contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS), such as the fusion
      technique, was added, which is a technique that can identify tumor vascularity in real-time
      using second-generation contrast media. In recent studies, there are studies combining this
      fusion technique and CEUS technique, and the success rate of these techniques varies from
      87.6% to 97.5%. Although CEUS with fusion techniques are theoretically superior to fusion
      only technique, the use of CEUS adds cost of contrast media and is limited in patients with
      side effects on contrast media. . Also, there is no study comparing the two so far, and this
      study intends to compare the technique combining CEUS and fusion and the technique using only
      fusion.
