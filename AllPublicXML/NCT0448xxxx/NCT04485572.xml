  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lumbar radiculopathy is a nerve root disorder which affects quality of life of the patient
      and it is considered as an important health problem. Therefore, its correct diagnosis is
      essential. The objective of the present study is to analyse the diagnostic validity of 8
      neurodynamic and/or orthopedic tension tests using magnetic resonance imaging as the Gold
      Standard.

      This is an epidemiological study of randomized consecutive cases which was observational,
      descriptive, transversal, double blinded and followed the STARD (Standards for Reporting
      Diagnostic accuracy studies) declaration.

    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Is is an indicator of the internal validity of the test. The range of values are interpreted as: 0-10% null, 10-30% very low; 30-60% low; 60-70% low moderate; 70-80% high moderate; 80-90% high; 90-100% very high.</description>

    <description>Is is an indicator of the external validity of the test.The range of values and their impact on the clinical utility are: LR+: &gt; 10 great increase, excellent test; 5-10 moderate increase, good test; 2-5: small increase, bad test; &lt; 2: minor increase, useless test. LR-: 0.5-1 minor decrease, useless test; 0,5-0,2 small decrease, bad test; 0,1-0,2 moderate decrease, good test; &lt; 0,1 great decrease, execelent test</description>
