      Detailed Description:

      The investigators have developed [68Ga]CBP8, a gallium-68 labeled collagen binding PET
      imaging probe, which selectively binds collagen type I. Collagen deposition is a pivotal
      event in several human conditions including radiation induced lung injury. The investigator's
      studies in murine models of lung injury including radiation induced lung injury showed that
      [68Ga]CBP8 binds collagen with high affinity and has excellent pharmacological and
      pharmacokinetic profiles with high target uptake and low retention in background tissues and
      organs. [68Ga]CBP8 was shown in a mouse model to be effective for detecting lung fibrosis.
      [68Ga]CBP8 showed high specificity for pulmonary fibrosis and high target:background ratios
      in diseased animals. In addition, [68Ga]CBP8 could be used to monitor response to treatment.
      Ex vivo analysis of lung tissue from patients with IPF supported the animal findings.

      The investigators have conducted preliminary studies in humans with idiopathic pulmonary
      fibrosis and demonstrated a significant increase in [68Ga]CBP8 signal in subjects with IPF vs
      healthy controls.

      The investigators thus aim to evaluate [68Ga]CBP8 in human subjects with radiation induced
      lung injury:

      To establish the ability of [68Ga]CBP8-PET to detect radiation-induced fibrosis in lung
      cancer patients through the course of disease development with repeated measures, and
      correlate signal with standard measures of radiation induced lung injury such as HRCT.

    <time_frame>3-6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Probe uptake will be measured in lung cancer patients 1) prior to radiation therapy and 2) 3-6 months after radiation therapy. We expect [68Ga]CBP8 signal to be increased in post radiation measurements over pre-radiation measurements in areas of irradiated lung. Furthermore we expect that these areas will go on to develop radiation fibrosis.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Eligible patients will be those harboring locally advanced clinical stage I-III NSCLC
             who are not eligible for surgical resection, or those with stage IIIa NSCLC who are
             deemed candidates for multi-modality therapy, i.e. concurrent chemotherapy and
             radiation followed by pulmonary resection.

          -  Age greater than 18 years

          -  Have the ability to give written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Electrical implants such as cardiac pacemaker or perfusion pump

          -  Ferromagnetic implants such as aneurysm clips, surgical clips, prostheses, artificial
             hearts, valves with steel parts, metal fragments, shrapnel, metallic tattoos anywhere
             on the body, tattoos near the eye, or steel implants ferromagnetic objects such as
             jewelry or metal clips in clothing;

          -  Body weight of &gt; 300 lbs (weight limit of the MRI table);

          -  Determined by the investigator(s) to be clinically unsuitable for the study (e.g.
             based on screening visit and/or during study procedures);

          -  Known history of pulmonary disease (Except lung cancer or smoking related lung
             disease,)
