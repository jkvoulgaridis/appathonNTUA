  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, non-randomized, clinical trial of discarded liver transplants that
      have received normothermic machine perfusion (NMP), compared with standard cold preservation
      liver transplants. The discarded livers rejected by all other centers and meeting pre-NMP
      eligibility criteria will receive NMP using the OrganOx® metra device. The NMP-treated liver
      that meets the viability criteria will be transplanted to patients who are eligible and
      consented to the study. Liver transplant outcomes will be ascertained during 12 months
      post-transplantation. The results of the trial will be compared with those of contemporary
      comparison groups of patients who received the standard criteria donor liver transplantation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, prospective, non-randomized, clinical trial to assess the
      feasibility of successful transplantation of NMP-treated livers to patients. First, up to 71
      marginal livers declined for transplantation will be treated with NMP using the OrganOx®
      metra device and tested for viability using previously defined criteria. NMP-treated viable
      livers will be subsequently transplanted to patients (n=5 in the 1st stage; additional 10
      transplantation in the 2nd stage; additional 10 transplantation in the 3rd stage: total
      N=25). Patients will be closely followed for clinical outcomes of the transplantation during
      6 months post-transplantation. The follow-up will also be extended up to 1 year
      post-transplantation. The trial will compare the results to those of three comparison groups
      - 1) matched patients who received liver transplantation at Washington University/Barnes
      Jewish Hospital; 2) matched patients who received DBD liver transplantation in the OPTN/UNOS
      database; and 3) matched patients who received DCD liver transplantation in the OPTN/UNOS
      database. Given that patient safety is the priority, the trial uses a multi-stage design in
      which the study stops earlier when NMP-treated liver transplantation is observed to be
      ineffective (see trial schema in Section 3.1).

    <description>The study will have three comparison groups - one local comparison group and two comparison groups from the national UNOS data.
Comparison group 1 will be patients who received a standard liver transplantation and follow-up care at the Washington University/ Barnes Jewish Hospital (n=50). Patients will be matched by a 5-year age category, sex, MELD score, donor liver graft type (e.g., DCD, DBD), donor age (5-year category), and donor sex. Washington University/ Barnes Jewish Hospital maintains a liver transplantation database that prospectively collects pre- and post-transplantation patient data.
Comparison group 2 will be patients who received DBD liver transplantation in the OPTN/UNOS database (n=100). Patients will be matched by age, sex, MELD score, donor age, and donor sex.
Comparison group 3 will be patients who received DCD liver transplantation in the OPTN/UNOS database (n=100). Patients will be matched by age, sex, MELD score, donor age, and donor sex.</description>
