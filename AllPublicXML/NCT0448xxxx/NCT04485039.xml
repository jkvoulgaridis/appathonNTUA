        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Each subject must meet all of the following criteria to be enrolled in this study:

               1. Subject is male or female 18 to 50 years of age, inclusive.

               2. Phosphorus levels within normal laboratory reference range.

               3. Women of childbearing potential have a negative human chorionic gonadotropin
                  pregnancy test (serum) at the screening visit and a confirmatory negative serum
                  pregnancy test on Day -1 of each period before receipt of study drug, and meet
                  one of the following criteria:

                    1. The subject or their partner has undergone surgical sterilization

                    2. The subject is postmenopausal, defined as 12 consecutive months with no
                       menses without an alternative medical cause and has a documented plasma
                       follicle-stimulating hormone level &gt;40 IU/mL

                    3. The subject agrees to be abstinent (ie, heterosexually inactive or women in
                       a religious order)

                       consistently using for at least 30 days before the first dose of study
                       drug)through 30 days after the last dose of study drug:

                  i. Condoms, male or female, with a spermicide NOTE: For male subjects, condoms
                  must be used for 90 days after last dose of study drug ii. Diaphragm or cervical
                  cap with spermicide iii. Intrauterine device with spermicide iv. Oral
                  contraceptives or other hormonal methods NOTE: Another nonhormonal method of
                  contraception must be used in conjunction with oral contraceptives v. Male sexual
                  partner who has undergone a vasectomy at least 3 months before screening.

               4. Male subjects must agree to not donate sperm from the first dose of study drug
                  through 90 days after the last dose of study drug.

               5. Subject is considered by the investigator to be in good general health as
                  determined by medical history, clinical laboratory test results, vital sign
                  measurements, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) results, and physical examination
                  findings at screening.

               6. Subject agrees to comply with the dietary requirements.

               7. Subject agrees to comply with all protocol requirements.

               8. Subject is able to provide written informed consent.
