  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi center, retrospective, chart review study to document the evolution of ocular
      disease progression in pediatric patients with CLN2.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CLN2 is a rare disease with limited available ocular natural history data. While current
      standard of care slows motor degeneration, it is not known to treat the ocular manifestations
      of disease. This study is planned to document, through retrospective data collection, ocular
      disease progression in children with a clinical presentation consistent with CLN2. No
      investigational product is administered in this retrospective, chart review study.
