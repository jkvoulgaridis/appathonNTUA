  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial investigates the side effects of CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T
      cells and acalabrutinib, and to see how well they work in treating patients with mantle cell
      lymphoma that has come back (relapsed) or does not respond to treatment (refractory). T cells
      are infection fighting blood cells that can kill cancer cells. The T cells given in this
      study will come from the patient and will have a new gene put in them that makes them able to
      recognize CD19, a protein on the surface of the cancer cells. These CD19-specific T cells may
      help the body's immune system identify and kill CD19 positive cancer cells. Acalabrutinib may
      stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.
      Giving CD19 CAR T cells together with acalabrutinib may kill more cancer cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the safety of adding CD19CAR-CD28-CD3zeta-EGFRt-expressing Tn/mem-enriched
      T-lymphocytes (CD19 CAR T cells) to acalabrutinib treatment. (Safety Lead‐in) II. Estimate
      the complete response (CR) rate within 6 months after adding CD19 CAR T cells to
      acalabrutinib treatment. (Phase 2)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess best response, time to and duration of CR. II. Estimate the 1‐year progression free
      survival (PFS) rate and overall survival (OS).

      III. Describe the full toxicity profile.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess CD19‐CAR T cell persistence. II. Assess CD19‐CAR T cell activity as measured by
      CD19 B cell aplasia. III. Describe the duration of CR from completion of acalabrutinib. IV.
      Describe immunogenicity of CD19‐CAR T cells in the presence of the BTK inhibitor.

      V. Characterize CD19 expression on tumor cells. VI. Describe cytokine profile after CD19‐CAR
      T cell infusion. VII. Determine BTK and PLCG2 mutational status prior to treatment.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive acalabrutinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days -5 to 28 of cycle 1 and
      on days 1-28 of subsequent cycles. Patients also receive CD19 CAR T cells intravenously (IV)
      on day 0. Treatment with acalabrutinib repeats every 28 days for up to 6 cycles in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who have not attained CR
      after the first disease assessment and tolerated the initial CAR T cell infusion may receive
      a second CAR T cell infusion in cycle 2.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3, 6 and 12 months, then
      yearly for up to 15 years post CAR T cells infusion.
