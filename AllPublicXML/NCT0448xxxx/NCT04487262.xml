  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale:

      Evidence regarding the timing of chest tube removal after cardiac surgery is sparse. The
      timing of chest tubes removal constitutes a balancing act between risk of retained blood
      syndrome, infection, patient discomfort and opioid-related side effects. Several studies have
      shown that chest tubes can safely be removed on the first postoperative day compared to
      later. A single retrospective study raised concern as chest tube removal on the day of
      surgery was associated with an increased requirement of drainage of pleural effusions.

      Primary Objective:

      To compare the impact of two standard chest tube removal protocols following open-heart
      surgery on the incidence of pleural and/or pericardial effusion requiring invasive drainage

      Secondary Objectives

      To evaluate the impact of chest tube removal on the day of surgery (DAY0) compared to the
      first postoperative day (DAY1) regarding:

        -  Comsumption of analgetic drugs

        -  Early postoperative pain

        -  Incidence of infection

        -  Early postoperative respiratory function

      Study design:

      Single-center, open, parallel-group, prospective, cluster-randomized controlled trial
      Alternate assignment of chest tube removal according to Day 0 versus Day 1 protocol based
      upon the month of surgery (even versus odd months).

      Study population:

      1300 consecutive patients undergoing elective open heart surgery in full or lower
      hemisternotomy with or without cardiopulmonary bypass including coronary artery bypass
      grafting, valve surgery, simple aortic surgery or combinations.
