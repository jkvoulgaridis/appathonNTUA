      Aim of the study to asses the realition between HPV infection, Nabothian Cyst and Cervical
      Intraepithelial lesions or Cervical Cancer
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nabothian cysts are one of the common gynecological pathologies. They rarely have clinical
      significance. Transvaginal ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging are the most useful
      imaging methods for cervical cystic lesions.HPV infection is the most important factor which
      can cause cervical malignancy and premalignant lesions. In women between 30-65 years of age
      HPV-DNA testing, is used as a screening test in Turkey. In this research, the aim is to
      examine whether there is a connection between Naboth cysts and HPV infection in the cervix.
      During the examination, the swab sample required for HPV PCR testing will be taken. The
      number and size of Naboth cysts with vaginal USG will be noted. If the patient had colposcopy
      / LEEP (Loop Electrosurgical Excision Procedure), the result will be investigated and noted.
