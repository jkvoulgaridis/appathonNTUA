    <textblock>
      Background and Aims: Music therapy has a wide range of uses in health care practice. The aim
      of this study was to investigate the effects of intraoperative music played during spinal
      anesthesia operation on the patients' intraoperative vital signs, postoperative pain, and
      anxiety status.

      Methods: The study was performed in an operating room with a total of 90 patients, of whom 30
      were in the music group, 30 were in the control group and 30 were in the sedated group. The
      ethics committee's approval, institutional permission, and the study participants' written
      informed consent were obtained. Data were collected using patient information and
      intraoperative observation form for vital signs as well as through the Visual Analog Scale
      and State Anxiety Scale. Preoperative and postoperative anxiety, the intraoperative and
      postoperative vital signs and postoperative pain and anxiety of all groups were analyzed.

    <intervention_model_description>In the study, 30 patients were assigned to the music group, 30 patients were assigned to the group that received sedation and 30 patients were assigned to a group that was not sedated, all occurred in a randomized controlled way.
The music were chosen by a researcher under guidance of an expert and grouped as relaxing, classical, mystical, and Turkish folk music. One of them was chosen by the patients following the application of spinal anesthesia in the music group. Sedation (Dormicum) was performed to the sedated group after spinal anesthesia based on the height and weight data and the doctor's decision. The patients in the non-sedated group were followed without any procedure (sedation and music).</intervention_model_description>

    <description>State- Trait Anxiety Scale was applied to all three groups in preoperative period.Distribution of preoperative and postoperative state anxiety scores according to groups. State- Trait Anxiety Scale: This scale was developed by Spielberger et al. in 1970 to determine the level of the individual anxiety state. It has 40 items in two constructs of state and trait. Since state anxiety scale was emphasized in the present study, only 20-item state scale construct was used. Each item had a 4-point Likert scale answer, from 1 (almost never) to 4 (almost always), and the possible total score ranged from 20 (the lowest level of anxiety) to 80 (the highest level of anxiety)</description>
