    <textblock>
      This protocol is a phase III study designed to compare the efficacy and the safety of Isa-KRd
      induction, transplant, Isa-KRd post ASCT consolidation and Isa-KRd light consolidation vs KRd
      induction, transplant, KRd post ASCT consolidation and KRd light consolidation After
      confirmation of eligibility criteria patients will be randomized to one of the 2 treatment
      groups in a 1:1 randomization ratio.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a open-label randomized phase III study that enrolls newly diagnosed MM patient
      eligible for high-dose chemotherapy and ASCT. Patients will be randomized at enrolment (1:1,
      stratification according to ISS Stage [3 levels: I vs II vs III] and cytogenetic risk FISH [2
      levels: high-risk vs standard risk/missing] based on presence of t(4;14), t(14;16), and/or
      del 17p)) into 2 treatment arms: -ARM A: induction with 4 cycles of
      Isatuximab-Carfilzomib-Lenalidomide-dexamethasone (Isa-KRd) followed by cyclophophamide and
      stem cell collections, chemotherapy with Melphalan 200 mg/m2 followed by ASCT (Mel200-ASCT),
      4 cycles of Isa-KRd post ASCT consolidation and 12 cycles of
      Isatuximab-Lenalidomide-Carfilzomib-dexamethasone (IsaKRd) light consolidation; ARM B:
      induction with 4 cycles of Carfilzomib-Lenalidomide-dexamethasone (KRd) followed by
      cyclophophamide and stem cell collections, chemotherapy with Melphalan 200 mg/m2 followed by
      ASCT (Mel200-ASCT), 4 cycles of KRd post ASCT consolidation and 12 cycles of
      Carfilzomib-Lenalidomide-dexamethasone (KRd) light consolidation. Details of all treatments
      (dose and schedule) are given in paragraph 8. After light consolidation patients are allowed
      to receive Lenalidomide maintenance as per standard of care.

          -  Significant neuropathy (Grades 3-4, or Grade 2 with pain) within 14 days prior to
