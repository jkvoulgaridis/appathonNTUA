  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Trainees' experience in cleft surgery is limited due to the high-risk nature of the surgery
      and centralization of cleft care. Simulations allow trainees to learn complex surgical skills
      whilst ensuring patient safety. Existing cleft surgical simulators are over-simplified or
      prohibitively expensive. We developed and tested a high-fidelity yet cost-effective simulator
      for cleft palate repair.

      Skeletal elements were obtained through high-resolution scanning of a pathologic specimen, 3D
      printed and then molded in plastic. Soft tissue components were formed through molding layers
      of silicone. 26 UK specialty trainees performed a vomerine mucosal flap and intra-velar
      veloplasty in a one-hour workshop. Pre- and post-simulation questionnaires assessing cleft
      knowledge and surgical confidence were compared for statistical significance.

    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>The confidence questionnaire was a 10-part questionnaire, each scored on a Likert scale of 1-5 that has previously been published and validated for use in cleft palate surgery(Appendix 3).(18) The total score ranged from 10-50, converted by division of 10 to an overall confidence score of 1-5 with 1 being not at all confident to 5 being very confident/at the level of an attending/consultant surgeon</description>
