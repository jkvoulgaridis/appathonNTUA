      Study D5290C00008 is a Phase 2, open-label, uncontrolled, single-dose study to evaluate the
      safety and tolerability, PK, occurrence of ADA, and efficacy of nirsevimab in
      immunocompromised Japanese children who are ≤ 24 months of age at the time of dose
      administration. Approximately 30 subjects will be enrolled. Subjects will be followed for
      approximately 1 year after dose administration.

    <textblock>
      Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause of lower respiratory tract
      infection (LRTI) among infants and young children, resulting in annual epidemics worldwide.
      Children with congenital or acquired immunodeficiencies, transplant recipients, and those
      receiving immunosuppressive therapy are at increased risk for severe RSV-associated LRTI with
      prolonged viral shedding and higher viral loads, resulting in prolonged hospitalizations,
      admissions to the intensive care unit (ICU), and the need for mechanical ventilation.
      Palivizumab (Synagis®) is the only approved agent for RSV prophylaxis, and its half-life
      (t1/2) is approximately 1 month, infants and young children need to receive monthly
      intramuscular doses of palivizumab throughout the RSV season to maintain protection. This
      constitutes a significant burden on healthcare providers as well as the infants/children and
      their families.

      Nirsevimab may provide a cost-effective opportunity to protect all infants from RSV disease
      based on an improvement in potency and the extended t1/2 that is expected to support
      once-per-RSV-season dosing.
