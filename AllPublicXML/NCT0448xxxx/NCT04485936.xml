      The participants will be enrolled in one investigational site. Subjects meeting eligibility
      criteria will undergo a gastric emptying test using gastric scintigraphy before any treatment
      (baseline).

      Following the scintigraphy, the subjects will receive Tulip Device treatment - 2
      capsules/day.

      After repeated capsule intake for either 4 or 11 or 28 days, the subjects will undergo
      additional gastric emptying test with a capsule intake prior to the test meal.
