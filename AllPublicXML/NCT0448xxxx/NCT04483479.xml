  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted as an open-label safety follow-on to a multi-center,
      double-blind, randomized study. All subjects who participated in the randomized study will be
      offered participation in this unblinded, single-arm, safety study. Approximately 50 subjects
      will be entered into the study and ENT-01 will be administered daily in escalating doses
      followed by a fixed dose for 12 weeks. Each subject will participate for approximately 20
      weeks; dosing duration will be approximately 14 weeks.

  <detailed_description>

      The study will be conducted on an out-patient or in-patient basis with visits performed at
      the screening visit, at 6 and 12 weeks, and at the end of the 6th week of the wash-out period
      (end of study).

      The dose escalation period will last up to 20 days, the fixed dose period will last 12 weeks,
      and the wash-out period will last 6 weeks.

      Subjects will begin dosing at the same dose level they were stratified to in the ENT-01-030
      randomized study (i.e., starting at either 3 tablets or 6 tablets,) and escalate up to a
      pro-kinetic dose or a maximum dose of 250mg.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. All subjects who participated in the randomized study ENT-01-030 (KARMET Stage 2
             Extension subjects) and who completed the dosing period.

          2. Subjects aged 30-90 years at the time of screening for the ENT-01-030 study, both
             genders

          3. Subjects must provide informed consent and be willing and able to comply with study
             procedures.

          5. Female subjects must have negative serum or urine pregnancy tests and must not be
             lactating. For females able to bear children, a hormonal (i.e., oral, implantable, or
             injectable) and single-barrier method, or a double-barrier method of birth control
             must be used throughout the study. A vasectomized partner will be allowed as one in
             conjunction with another single-barrier method.

          6. Female subjects unable to bear children must have this documented in the CRF (i.e.,
             tubal ligation, hysterectomy, or postmenopausal [defined as a minimum of one year
             since the last menstrual period]). Post-menopausal status will be confirmed by
             follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) in women less than 60 years of age.

             and throughout the rest of the study.

          4. Diagnosis of secondary constipation beyond that of Parkinson's disease.

          5. A compromised gastrointestinal system which includes:

                  exclusionary as long as they were performed more than 30 days before the
                  screening visit).

          6. Neurological disorder other than Parkinson's disease that in the opinion of the
