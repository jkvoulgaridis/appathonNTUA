  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a phase 1, multicenter, open-label trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability,
      PK and efficacy of ZN-A-1041 as a monotherapy or in combination with Capecitabine in patients
      with HER2-positive advanced solid tumors with or without brain metastases.

      The study will consist of three phases: phase 1a (dose escalation with ZN-A-1041
      monotherapy), phase 1b (dose escalation with ZN-A-1041 and Capecitabine combination therapy)
      and phase 1c (dose expansion with ZN-A-1041 and Capecitabine combination therapy).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phase 1a of the study will adopt the &quot;modified 3+3&quot; dose escalation design with a total of 7
      planned dose levels. Patients with HER2-positive advanced solid tumor (including those with
      brain metastases) will be enrolled to receive a single-dose administration of ZN-A-1041
      followed by multiple-dose administration of ZN-A-1041.Phase 1b of the study will adopt the
      &quot;traditional 3+3&quot; dose escalation design with a total of 2 planned dose levels. The dose
      levels will be determined based on the MTD identified in the phase 1a study.

      In phase 1b, patients with HER2-positive advanced breast cancer (including those with brain
      metastases) will be enrolled to receive multiple doses of ZN-A-1041 in combination with
      Capecitabine. Patients with HER2-positive breast cancer with brain metastases were planned to
      be enrolled in the Phase 1c of the study to receive ZN-A-1041 in combination with
      Capecitabine. The dose levels will be determined based on the recommended doses obtained from
      the Phase 1b study.

      Each phase of the study includes a screening period, a treatment period and a follow-up
      period. During the trial, the safety, tolerability, PK and efficacy data of ZN-A-1041 as
      monotherapy and in combination with Capecitabine in the subjects will be collected and
      analyzed, thereby providing RP2D for the subsequent clinical trials.
