  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The emergence of CDK4/6 inhibitors has brought hope to breast cancer patients resistant to
      endocrine therapy. In the mouse model, pyrotinib maleate combined with CDK4/6 inhibitor
      exhibits higher anti-tumor activity than any anti-tumor drug alone. Moreover, the toxicity of
      the combined therapy does not increase compared with monotherapy. This provides a good
      preclinical model for the treatment of breast cancer by pyrotinib maleate combined with
      CDK4/6 inhibitor. Based on above, it is hypothesized that pyrotinib maleate, CDK4/6 inhibitor
      SHR6390 and aromatase inhibitor letrozole in combination can provide a better neoadjuvant
      strategy for stage II-III triple-positive breast cancer.

      This single-center, single-arm, open-label trial will include 89 patients with stage II-III
      triple-positive breast cancer (Simon's two-stage design). After providing written informed
      consent, the participants will undergo combined treatment of pyrotinib maleate, CDK4/6
      inhibitor SHR6390, and letrozole. The effectiveness of the combined treatment will be
      evaluated by MRI every two treatment cycles. If the disease progresses, the participant will
      withdraw from the trial. If the combined treatment has identified effectiveness, the
      participant will undergo surgical treatment within 4 weeks (over 2 weeks) after termination
      of the neoadjuvant treatment. The patients will be followed up for 5 years.
