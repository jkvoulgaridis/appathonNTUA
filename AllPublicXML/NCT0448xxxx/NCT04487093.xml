  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neoantigen vaccine is a new field of research in tumor immunotherapy, and some studies have
      been conducted with success on Melanoma and glioblastoma. Nearly 80% of lung cancers are
      diagnosed in an advanced stage (IIIB, and IV) and EGFR mutant non-small cell lung cancer will
      be resistant after targeted drug treatment. Neoantigen vaccine is a new treatment method for
      lung cancer, especially for patients with drug resistance.

      This is a phase I clinical study of individualized neoantigen peptide vaccine combined with
      targeted drugs in the treatment of EGFR mutant non-small cell lung cancer aimed to evaluated
      the safety and immune response of the neoantigen vaccine treatment.
