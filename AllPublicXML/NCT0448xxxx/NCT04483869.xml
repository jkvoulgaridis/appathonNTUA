      Background: The Apgar score assesses the newborn's adaptation in the first minutes of life.
      It is rated between 0 and 10 by the midwife, at 1-3-5 and 10 minutes of life. A low Apgar
      score at 5 minutes of life is associated with increased neonatal mortality and neurological
      impairment. However, this score has limitations and its measurement remains subjective: it
      does not guide resuscitation actions in the event of poor adaptation, significant
      inter-observer variability in scoring, variations according to the physiological maturation
      of the newborn, in particular according to gestational age.

      Infrared thermography is a rapidly developing imaging technique based on the measurement of
      infrared radiation. It is an accurate, reliable and easy instrument of providing rapid
      non-contact, non-invasive and non-irradiating diagnosis. A recent 2018 study showed that the
      use of thermography would allow accurate and non-invasive monitoring of newborns in neonatal
      intensive care unit for early diagnosis of certain pathologies such as infection. During the
      transition, during the first minutes of life, the circulatory and respiratory systems of the
      newborn change. Vasodilatation occurs progressively in the central and peripheral areas.
      Thermoregulation is also a crucial stage of adaptation.

      In view of this physiopathological knowledge, it seems interesting to correlate this
      adaptation , with the analysis of thermographic images. The principle of this technique is
      indeed based on the analysis of the heat emitted, and would thus make it possible to evaluate
      the blood perfusion of the newborn, and its evolution in the first minutes of life in an
      objective way. Our hypothesis is that a poor adaptation could be detected more efficiently on
      photographs taken at time T, contrary to the calculation of the Apgar score for which there
      are several limitations mentioned above.

      Main objective of the study: To study the ability of the thermographic image to objectively
      evaluate the adaptation to ectopic life of newborns compared to existing evaluations (Apgar,
      pH, Lactates).
