      Feasibility of neoadjuvant therapy in resectable biliary adenocarcinoma.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial will evaluate whether a neoadjuvant paradigm is feasible in resectable biliary
      adenocarcinoma. All components of therapy are currently used standards of care, however they
      have not been used in the neoadjuvant setting for the management of resectable biliary
      cancers. The study will use Gemcitabine/cisplatin, followed by chemoradiation.

      This is a feasibility trial with an accrual goal of 12 patients using the primary endpoint of
      completion of neoadjuvant therapy and surgery as an assessment of feasibility.

    <description>Feasibility trial with accrual goal of 12 patients using primary endpoint of completion of neoadjuvant therapy and surgery as an assessment of feasibility. Interim assessment of first 6 patients enrolled will be performed. Resection rate benchmark for neoadjuvant pancreas trials ~70% accounting for patients found to have progression. Completion of all therapy is defined as completing 4/6 doses of gem/cis chemo, 80% of RT dose, and surgical resection. If 2 or less of first 6 patients enrolled complete all therapy the trial will be closed and treatment will be considered unfeasible. Upon trial completion, if 5 or less of 12 patients complete all therapy the trial will be deemed unfeasible.</description>

    <description>Radiation Therapy:
Sim: All patients will undergo 4D-CT simulation with 3 hours fasting with or without IV contrast. Compression may be used depending on the tumor motion.
Radiation Target Volume: The gross tumor volume (GTV) will be defined on all relevant imaging datasets including diagnostic CT, MRI, MRCP and/or ERCP data. An iGTV will be generated using the 4D datasets. The clinical target volume (CTV) will include the entire iGTV as well as portal lymphatic and celiac nodal space for all patients with selective treatment of the SMA and pancreaticoduodenal depending on the tumor location. A 5 mm margin will be added to the CTV to generate the planning target volume (PTV).
Radiation Dose: The dose will be 30 Gy in 10 fractions (3 Gy per fraction) for all patients using either 3D Conformal or Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy techniques.</description>
