      The bRIGHT EU PAS study is an observational real-world study evaluating severe tricuspid
      regurgitation patients treated with the Abbott TriClip™ device (bRIGHT EU Post-Approval
      Study).

    <textblock>
      The TriClip™ bRIGHT EU post-approval study (PAS) study is designed to confirm the safety and
      performance of the TriClip™ device in a contemporary real-world setting. The bRIGHT PAS study
      is a prospective, single arm, open-label, multi-center, post market registry, conducted to
      satisfy condition of CE Marking for the TriClip™.

    <description>The primary endpoint is Acute Procedural Success (APS) defined as successful implantation of the TriClip™ device with resulting TR reduction at least 1 grade at discharge (30-day echocardiogram will be used if discharge is unavailable or uninterpretable). Subjects who die or undergo tricuspid valve surgery before discharge are considered to be an APS failure.</description>
