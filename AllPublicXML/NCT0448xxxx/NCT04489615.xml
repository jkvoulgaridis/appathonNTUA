    <textblock>
      Monocentric, prospective, observational and descriptive study on the evaluation of risk
      factors for alteration of the alveoarterial gradient of CO2 in pre-hospital patients,
      intubated and then ventilated in an invasive manner; and their impact on intra-arterial
      fatehospital.
