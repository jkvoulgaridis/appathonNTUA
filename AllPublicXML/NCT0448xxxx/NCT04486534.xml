  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Increased risk of osteoarthritis (OA) has been previously demonstrated in patients with lower
      limb amputation. Although there are many studies on knee joint of intact limb of amputees in
      the literature, the number of studies on intact foot and ankle is extremely limited. The
      primary aim of the study is to compare the intact talar cartilage, tibialis anterior and
      gastrocnemius muscle thickness measurements of traumatic unilateral transtibial amputee
      patients with that of healthy individuals using ultrasound. The secondary aim is to
      investigate the relationship between cartilage and muscle thickness measurements with
      clinical parameters.

      Methods: A total of 36 patients with unilateral transtibial amputations and 36 age and body
      mass index (BMI)-matched male controls will be participated in this cross-sectional study.
      Functional performance will be assessed by 6-minute walking distance (in meter). The Foot and
      Ankle Outcome Score (FAOS) will be used for the assessment of the symptoms and the functional
      limitations of the foot and ankle. The health-related quality of life of the subjects will be
      evaluated with Short Form-36 (SF-36). Subjects' talar cartilage, tibialis anterior and
      gastrocnemius muscle thickness measurements will be performed using musculoskeletal
      ultrasound.

    <measure>The Foot and Ankle Outcome Score (FAOS)</measure>

    <description>The Foot and Ankle Outcome Score (FAOS) will be used for the assessment of the symptoms and the functional limitations of the foot and ankle. The FAOS consists of 42 questions, divided into five different patient-relevant subscales: pain (nine questions); symptoms such as stiffness, swelling and range of motion (seven questions); activities of daily living (17 questions); ability to perform sports and recreational activities (five questions); and foot/ankle-related quality of life (four questions). Answers are given on a five-point Likert scale. Total and subscores are calculated by summing the scores of the individual items. The total score is recoded into a 0-100 scale, with 100 representing no symptoms or limitations.</description>

    <description>The health-related quality of life of the subjects will be evaluated with Short Form-36 (SF-36). This comprises 36 questions related to eight different subscales, physical functioning, bodily pain, role limitation, due to physical health problems, general health perceptions, vitality, energy and fatigue, role limitations due to emotional problems, social functioning and general mental health, which covers psychological distress and wellbeing. Each of eight subscales is scored between 0 and 100, with higher scores indicating a better quality of life.</description>
