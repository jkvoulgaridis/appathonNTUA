  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute heart failure (AHF) is a frequent condition in emergency department and is responsible
      of high number of admissions, complications, and deaths.

      despite advances in diagnostic techniques, AHF diagnosis still be challenging .

      Measurement of cardiac output (CO) is used to evaluate global cardiac function and changes in
      CO may be used to identify a change in the hemodynamic status of patient.

      the gold standard of measuring CO is thermodilution catheterization, however it is an
      invasive technique with high risks.

      Impedance cardiography (ICG) is a noninvasive method for measuring CO. it is performed by
      applying small electrical current to the chest through electrodes placed on the neck and
      sides.

      the pulsatile flow of blood causes fluctuations in the current, and the device calculates CO
      from the impedance waveform.

      In practice, the investigators connect the device &quot;BIOPAC&quot; by using four electrodes which the
      investigators place on the base of the neck (posterior face) and on the base of the thorax
      (posterior face).

      The ECG recording is taken simultaneously with two other electrodes placed at the right upper
      limb and left lower limb.

      In addition to detecting the electric current and the ECG, heart sounds are recorded using a
      sensor that is placed at the mitral site.

      Each patient is initially placed in a semi-sitting position at 30° for 5 minutes and then CO
      is measured (baseline CO). NTG (0.6 mg) is then given to the patient sublingually and CO
      measurement was repeated. CO is calculated by averaging three measurements at one minute
      intervals at baseline and after NTG administration. DeltaCO was defined as the percent of
      change of baseline CO after NTG test.
