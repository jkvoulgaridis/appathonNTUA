    <textblock>
      Deficient mismatch repair (dMMR) or microsatellite instability high (MSI-H) accounts for 4-5%
      in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). The efficacy and survival of patients with dMMR/MSI-H
      status received palliative chemotherapy have not clear yet. In this study, the investigators
      observed the efficacy and survival of dMMR/MSI-H status mCRC patients received palliative
      first-line chemotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the one of most common cancer in the world. Loss of function of
      DNA mismatch repair (MMR) is an important mechanism of CRC development. Mutation or
      modification of MMR genes result in MMR protein deficient (dMMR) and microsatellite
      instability (MSI). It has been reported that the dMMR or MSI high (MSI-H) phenotype is
      present in approximately 15-18% of CRC patients. Most dMMR/MSI-H tumors are sporadic CRC, and
      only approximately 3% of dMMR/MSI-H tumors are Lynch syndrome (LS) or hereditary nonpolyposis
      colorectal carcinoma (HNPCC).

      The dMMR/MSI-H status was reported to be a predictive marker for adjuvant chemotherapy.
      Multiple retrospective studies showed that dMMR/MSI-H is correlated with a favorable
      prognosis in stage II/III CRC. Previous studies suggested that dMMR/MSI status may be a
      predictive marker of decreased benefit form adjuvant monotherapy of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in
      patients with stage II disease, but not in those with stage III disease. For metastatic
      colorectal cancer (mCRC), the relationship of the MMR/MSI phenotype and prognosis is unclear.
      Some researchers found that CRC patients with the dMMR/MSI-H phenotype have a worse
      prognosis. But other researchers thought the dMMR/MSI-H phenotype is no associate to efficacy
      and survival of palliative chemotherapy, even is benefit for efficacy and survival.Therefore,
      the aim of this study was to clarify whether the status of dMMR/MSI-H affected
      progression-free survival (PFS) in mCRC patients who received first-line palliative
      chemotherapy.
