  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether endometriosis and adenomyosis are
      progressive diseases, in terms of symptoms (pain, abnormal uterine bleeding and infertility),
      anatomical lesions size, and recurrences. We also aimed to address molecular questions on
      immune dialogues between ectopic lesions and the eutopic endometrium, auto-immunity in
      endometriosis and adenomyosis and the role of the microbiota in their respective
      pathophysiologies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endometriosis and adenomyosis are benign gynecological conditions which affect more than 10%
      of women, that typically cause pain and / or infertility, thereby exerting a negative impact
      on the patients' quality of life.

      Although the pathogenesis of endometriosis and adenomyosis are controversial, both diseases
      are defined by the presence of endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity. Endometriosis
      is a heterogeneous disease, with three phenotypes: superficial peritoneal endometriosis
      (SUP), ovarian endometrioma (OMA), and deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE) The most widely
      accepted pathophysiological hypothesis for endometriosis is that of the implantation of
      ectopic endometrial cells following peritoneal reflux. Endometriosis can be associated with
      adenomyosis, also heterogeneous, characterized by the infiltration of endometrial tissue into
      the myometrium, presenting different forms: diffuse, focal or cystic.

      Due to diseases heterogeneity, the diagnosis of endometriosis and adenomyosis is difficult
      and affected patients are subject to a long delay for appropriate management.

      We hypothesize that the disease may be progressive in terms of symptoms (pain, abnormal
      uterine bleeding and infertility), anatomical lesions and recurrences. Furthermore,
      highlighting specific clinical and molecular markers would shorten the diagnostic time.
