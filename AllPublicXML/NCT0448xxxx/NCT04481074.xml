      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of inspiratory muscle training program in
      inspiratory muscle endurance, breathlessness, inspiratory muscle strength, functional
      capacity and quality of life in patients with interstitial lung disease. Patients are
      evaluated before the inspiratory muscle training and after 8 weeks of training.

      Inspiratory Muscle Training has been described as an effective intervention and contribute to
      the improvement of inspiratory muscle function and breathlessness in patients with chronic
      lung disease. The aim of this study is to evaluate, the effects of inspiratory muscle
      endurance, breathlessness, inspiratory muscle strength, functional capacity and quality of
      life in patients with interstitial lung disease. It is a quasi-experimental study. Patients
      with interstitial lung disease are recruited from interstitial disease ambulatory. In each
      session patients performs two times 30 breaths with a minute rest between them. The load is
      set according with 50% of actual PImax, the Borg score should be between 4 and 6, otherwise
      the load will decrease (if Borg more than 6) or increase (if Borg less than 4). New PImax is
      measured weekly and the new load is defined following the same protocol for 8 weeks. Patients
      are evaluated before the inspiratory muscle training and after 8 weeks of training.
