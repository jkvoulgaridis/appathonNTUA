  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The standard treatment of stage Ibl 2-4 cm cervical cancer in women who wish to preserve
      fertility is an abdominal radical trachelectomy with pelvic lymph node dissection. Since the
      number of take home babies after completing this procedure is below 10%, there is a need for
      exploration of alternative treatment modalities with better chances of preserving fertility
      at equal risk of recurrence.

      Aim of the study is to assess the feasibility of preserving fertility in women with 2018 FIGO
      stage IB2 cervical cancer with lesions measuring &gt;2cm - &lt;4cm
