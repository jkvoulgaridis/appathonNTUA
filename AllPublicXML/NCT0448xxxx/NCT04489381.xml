        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female outpatients at least 12 years of age

          -  Presence of clinical signs and/or symptoms consistent with worsening or stable cold
             due to Enterovirus/Rhinovirus infection (one of the following is required):

               1. Presence of at least two respiratory symptom domains (head, throat, nose, chest,
                  cough) with a score of ≥2 as determined by Screening FLU-PRO OR

               2. Presence of at least one respiratory symptom domain (head, throat, nose, chest,
                  cough) with a score of ≥2 as determined by Screening FLU-PRO with pulse rate ≥90
                  OR

               3. Presence of at least one respiratory symptom domain (head, throat, nose, chest,
                  cough) with a score of ≥2 as determined by Screening FLU-PRO with respiratory
                  rate ≥16

        AND patient reported assessment that symptoms are present, the symptoms are not consistent
        with the subject's usual health, the symptoms interfere with daily activities, and the
        symptoms have worsened or remained the same relative to the previous day, as confirmed by
        responses to questions in the Screening FLU-PRO.

          -  Onset of symptoms no more than 48 hours before enrollment in the trial. Onset of
             symptoms is defined as the first time at which the subject experienced any respiratory
             symptom (head, throat, nose, chest, or cough symptoms).

          -  Willing and able to provide written informed consent (including assent by legal
             guardian if under 18 years of age) and comply with the requirements of the protocol,
             including completion of the subject diary and all protocol procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with oral temperature ≥100.4°F.

          -  Subjects who experienced a previous episode of acute upper respiratory tract
             infection, otitis, bronchitis or sinusitis or received antibiotics for these
             conditions within two weeks prior to and including study day 1.

          -  Severely immunodeficient persons including:

               1. Subjects with immunologic disorders or receiving immunosuppressive therapy (e.g.,
                  for organ or bone marrow transplants, immunomodulatory therapies for certain
                  autoimmune diseases).

               2. Subjects with untreated human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) infection or treated
                  human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) infection with a CD4 count below 350
                  cells/mm3 in the last six months.

               3. Subjects actively undergoing systemic chemotherapy or radiotherapy treatment for
                  malignancy.

          -  Subjects with active respiratory allergies or subjects expected to require anti-
             allergy medications during the study period for respiratory allergies.

          -  Females of childbearing potential who are either pregnant or sexually active without
             the use of birth control. Female subjects of child-bearing potential that are sexually
             active must have a negative baseline pregnancy test and must agree to continue an
             acceptable method of birth control for the duration of the study and for 1 month
             post-treatment. A double barrier method, oral birth control pills administered for at
             least 2 monthly cycles prior to study drug administration, an Intrauterine Device
             (IUD), or medroxyprogesterone acetate administered intramuscularly for a minimum of
             one month prior to study drug administration are acceptable methods of birth control
             for inclusion into the study. Female subjects are considered of childbearing potential
             unless they are postmenopausal (absence of menstrual bleeding for 1 year - or 6 months
             if laboratory confirmation of hormonal status), or have had a hysterectomy, bilateral
             tubular ligation or bilateral oophorectomy.

          -  Subjects residing in the same household with another subject participating in the
             study.

          -  Treatment with any investigational drug or vaccine therapy within 30 days prior to
             screening and willing to avoid them during the course of the study.

          -  Receipt of any dose of nitazoxanide (NTZ) within seven days prior to screening.

          -  Known sensitivity to nitazoxanide (NTZ) or any of the excipients comprising the study
             medications.

          -  Subjects unable to swallow oral tablets or capsules.

          -  Subjects with known severe heart, lung, neurological or other systemic disease that
             the Investigator believes could preclude safe participation.

          -  Subjects likely or expected to require hospitalization unrelated to cold during the
             study period.

          -  Subjects who, in the judgment of the Investigator, will be unlikely to comply with the
             requirements of this protocol including completion of the subject diary.
