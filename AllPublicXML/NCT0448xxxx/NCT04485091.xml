  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Photodamage is a growing concern in contemporary society because promotes early skin aging
      and different pathologies resulting from prolonged and repeated exposure to ultraviolet solar
      radiation, which is considered the main extrinsic factor of this process. Affected by
      radiation, the hands play an important role in the manifestation and visibility of aging, as
      they are very exposed body regions. The study proposal is developed by the potential
      mechanism of tissue repair, skin rejuvenation, anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects of
      photobiomodulation, complementing the benefits of chemical peel. The main objective of this
      randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical trial is to compare the photorejuvenating
      effects of 20% trichloroacetic acid (TCM) peel applied alone and the effects of the
      association of 20% TCM peel with 660nm light emitting diode (LED) photobiomodulation (PBM) in
      the treatment of the back of the hands. Participants will be divided into 2 groups and will
      receive different therapies according to the allocation group. Group A will be subjected to
      04 chemical peel sessions of 20% TCM and PBM. Group B will also receive the 04 chemical peel
      sessions of 20% TCM with PBM simulation. The application sessions will be monthly and the
      consultations for fortnightly evaluations. Analysis of photoaging characteristics such as
      fine and coarse wrinkles, dyschromias and global assessment of the back of the hands will be
      carried out using periodic standardized photographs. A visual-analog pain scale and a 5-point
      Likert scale will also be applied regularly to assess participants' satisfaction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be divided into two groups for the treatment of photoaging of hands:

      (A) Group 20% TCM + PBM: Application of chemical peel of 20% trichloroacetic acid solution in
      association with photobiomodulation with red spectrum LED (660nm) on the back of the hands.

      (B) Group 20% TCM + PBM placebo: Application of chemical peel of 20% trichloroacetic acid
      solution in association with simulated photobiomodulation on the back of the hands.

      It is observed that all participants included in the study will receive treatment recommended
      for photoaging on the back of the hands. The chemical peel (20% TCM solution) will be
      performed monthly, totaling 04 sessions with an average time of 40 minutes (guidelines,
      photos, skin exfoliation) with intervals of 04 weeks between applications. Biweekly
      assessments (guidelines and photos) will be carried out with an average time of 20 minutes
      during the study period. In addition, a group will also be subjected to photobiomodulation
      with 660nm LED during the sessions for the analysis of the association of therapies and
      comparison with exfoliation monotherapy.

      It is noteworthy that both hands will be treated and control will be maintained in another
      randomized and uniform group, with no possibility of ethical compromise of different
      therapies with asymmetric results in the participants. Another important benefit provided by
      the separation of the control group will be the impossibility of light to influence the
      non-irradiated tissue. This case would occur if the hand subjected to photobiomodulation plus
      exfoliation was in the same individual as the hand subjected to exfoliation monotherapy. This
      influence is defended by countless scientists who research on the systemic effects of
      phototherapy.

      In addition, both groups will prepare the skin properly before the treatments in order to
      enhance the effects of the exfoliation, allow the uniform penetration of the chemical
      solution in the back of the hands, decrease the healing time after the procedure and
      significantly reduce the risks of major complications such as post-inflammatory
      hyperpigmentation. Throughout the period, the participants will also be instructed on the
      importance of photoprotection with the daily use of factor 30 sunscreen. If there is a
      patient with severe hypersensitivity or major complications, the intervention will be
      discontinued immediately and properly treated according to its severity.

      It should be noted that regardless of the results obtained at the end of the research, even
      if photobiomodulation improves or accelerates the benefits of chemical peeling, participants
      will not be submitted to new treatment sessions, as both groups will already receive
      treatment recommended for photoaging of hands. Furthermore, the application of
      photobiomodulation without the association of previous skin exfoliation is unlikely to bring
      better results, because early application after tissue injury is the most important factor
      for this purpose.

    <description>The back of both hands of the participants will be photographed before starting the skin preparation for the experiments (day 0). Standardized photo sessions according to the Clinical Photography Committee of the Plastic Surgery Educational Foundation will also take place in each biweekly medical evaluation to monitor the evolution of photorejuvenation. All photographs will be evaluated after 30 days of the last treatment session by 02 independent experts in 04 distinct clinical signs about photoaging: fine wrinkles, coarse wrinkles, abnormal pigmentation and global evaluation. The global evaluation is used to have a general impression of the photodamage, as shown by Mckenzie, 2011. The 04 clinical signs will be characterized separately by a scale from 0 to 9, with 0 representing the absence of changes and 9 representing the maximum of changes. The Kappa coefficient will be used to measure agreement between the examiners.</description>

    <measure>Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The visual analog scale has been used to measure intangible quantities such as pain, quality of life and anxiety, since the 1920s. Measuring the subjective experience of pain is a continuous challenge in medicine, and VAS, despite its limitations, is a primary outcome measure validated for pain intensity. Participants will use the scale to measure pain intensity during the study during biweekly medical evaluations. The number 0 means the total absence of pain complaints, while the number 10 is equivalent to the greatest pain ever experienced by the participant.</description>

    <description>The chemical peel (20% TCM) will be carried out monthly, totaling 04 sessions. The application of photobiomodulation (PBM) will start shortly after the observation of frosting level I, which characterizes an exfoliation of superficial depth. Although the application sessions take place monthly, medical evaluations will be carried out fortnightly for the other orientations, filling in scales and photographs. For the PBM, a 100 milliwatt (mW) LED device with a 660nm wavelength will be used. It will provide energy density of 5 J/cm² in 150 seconds of irradiation. Irradiance of 33.3 mW/cm² in continuous operation mode.</description>
