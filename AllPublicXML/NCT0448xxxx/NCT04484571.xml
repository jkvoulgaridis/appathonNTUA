      The proposed clinical trial will employ the NEUROExos Elbow Module (NEEM), an active robotic
      exoskeleton, for the passive mobilization and active training of elbow flexion and extension
      in 60 sub-acute and chronic stroke patients with motor impairments (hemiparesis and/or
      spasticity) of the right arm. The study protocol is a randomized controlled trial consisting
      of a 4-week functional rehabilitation program, with both clinical and robotically
      instrumented assessments to be conducted at baseline and post-treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The reliable assessment, attribution, and alleviation of upper-limb joint stiffness are
      essential clinical objectives in the early rehabilitation from stroke and other neurological
      disorders, to prevent the progression of neuromuscular pathology and enable proactive
      physiotherapy towards functional recovery. However, the current clinical evaluation and
      treatment of this stiffness (and underlying muscle spasticity) are severely limited by their
      dependence on subjective evaluation and manual limb mobilization, thus rendering the
      evaluation imprecise and the treatment insufficiently tailored to the specific pathologies
      and residual capabilities of individual patients. To address these needs, the proposed
      clinical trial will employ the NEUROExos Elbow Module (NEEM), an active robotic exoskeleton,
      for the passive mobilization and active training of elbow flexion and extension in stroke
      patients with motor impairments (hemiparesis and/or spasticity) of the right arm. The study
      protocol provide a functional rehabilitation program, with both clinical and robotically
      instrumented assessments to be conducted at baseline and post-treatment.

    <measure>Change in Maximum Extension Torque (MET)</measure>

    <measure>Change in Zero Torque Angle (ZTA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Before and within 1 week after 4 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>It is the angular value corresponding to null torque exerted by the robot; in this configuration, flexor and extensor torques are equal and opposite and the system is ideally not applying any force to hold the elbow in position, which has reached its equilibrium point</description>

    <time_frame>Before and within 1 week after 4 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>A measure of the limb resistance to muscle elongation, extracted as the ratio between joint torque and joint angular position for constant, slow-speed movements, the main contribution to the joint impedance can be identified in the joint stiffness (i.e. rigidity).</description>
