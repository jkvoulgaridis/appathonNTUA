      To evaluate the efficacy and safety of Cevira® compared to placebo in treatment of patients
      with cervical histologic HSIL.A total of 384 subjects will be enrolled globally, among which,

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Biopsy-confirmed HSIL histology determined by a panel of 3 pathologists from a central
             laboratory in each region (China, US, and Europe);

          2. Adequate colposcopy including:

               1. visualization of entire cervical transformation zone including the squamocolumnar

          9. Nursing

         10. Childbirth or miscarriage within six weeks of enrolment

         11. Patients who previously received surgical treatment, have incomplete cervical
             structure and have recurrent HSIL; or patients who received other treatment after the
             confirmed diagnosis of HSIL

         12. History of toxic shock syndrome

         13. Known or suspected porphyria

         14. Known allergy to hexaminolevulinate or similar compounds (e.g. methyl aminolevulinate

         15. Known allergy to silicone

         16. Use of heart pacemaker

         17. Participation in other therapeutic clinical trials using investigational agents either
             concurrently or within the last 30 days

         19. Patient is the investigator or any sub-investigator, research assistant, pharmacist,
             study coordinator, other staff or relative thereof directly involved in the conduct of
             the study
