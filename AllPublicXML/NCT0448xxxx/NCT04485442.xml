    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate the psychological well-being in patients diagnosed with skin cancer
      (melanoma and Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) in the face) at the time of diagnosis and after
      treatment. Patients diagnosed with primary melanoma and/or SCC and/or infiltrative basal cell
      carcinoma on the face subjected to surgical treatment (excision or Mohs Surgery) will be
      included. All patients will receive questionnaires.

    <time_frame>at Screening Visit (V1), V3 (7 days post surgery), V4 (90 days post surgery), V5 (180 days post surgery), V6 (360 days post surgery)</time_frame>
    <description>TheEORTC- QLQ-C30 is composed of both multiitem scales and single-item measures. These include 5 functional scales (cognitive, CF; emotional, EF; physical, PF; role, RF; and social functioning, SF), 3 symptom scales (fatigue, FA; nausea/vomiting, NV; and pain, PA), a global health status/QoL scale and 5 single items assessing additional symptoms (appetite loss, AP; constipation, CO; diarrhea, DI; dyspnea, DY; and sleep disturbance, SL) and perceived financial impact, FI. Each of the multiitem scales includes a different set of itemsâ€”no item occurs in more than 1 scale. All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0-100. A high scale score represents a higher response level.</description>

    <measure>Change in WHO-DAS questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>at Screening Visit (V1), V3 (7 days post surgery), V4 (90 days post surgery), V5 (180 days post surgery), V6 (360 days post surgery)</time_frame>
    <description>The WHO-DAS measures items in six domains of functioning as experienced over the past 30 days: mobility, self-care, life activities, understanding and communicating (U&amp;C), interpersonal interactions, and participation in society. The 12-item tool assesses each domain with two items that are measured on a 3-point scale in which 1 indicates no disability, 2 indicates mild to moderate disability, and 3 indicates severe to extreme disability. These items were summed to generate a total score between 12 (no disability) and 36 (maximum disability).</description>

    <measure>Change in FACE-Q questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>at Screening Visit (V1), V3 (7 days post surgery), V4 (90 days post surgery), V5 (180 days post surgery), V6 (360 days post surgery)</time_frame>
    <description>The FACE-Q questionnaire measures three overarching domains: facial appearance, quality of life and experience of care over the past 7 days. The FACE-Q Skin Cancer Module is composed of 56 items with scales from 1-4 which range in scoring from 0-100. The FACE-Q Skin Cancer module includes two quality of life scales measuring appearance-related distress and skin cancer worry. Additionally, the participants will be asked about skin protection behaviours and adverse events following the skin cancer treatment. The FACE-Q appearance scale consists of satisfaction with the appearance of the face overall and how bothered a patient is by facial scars</description>
