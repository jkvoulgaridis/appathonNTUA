    <textblock>
      Patients with Cushing disease was randomized to 2 groups. After surgery, the patients were
      managed with mechanical prevetion or mechanical prevention plus anticoagulant drugs(LMWH
      followed by rivaroxaban), VTE was observed 24h,5day,4weeks and 12weeks after surgery.Bleeding
      events were also recorded.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Cushing's disease patient diagnosed and treated with sphenoid surgery at Huashan
