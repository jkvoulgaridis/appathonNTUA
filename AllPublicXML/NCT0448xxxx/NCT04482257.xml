      The purpose of this study was to determine the bioequivalence of two formulations of
      Irinotecan Liposome Injection (70mg/m2) in Chinese patients with Advanced Pancreatic Cancer,
      under fasting condition. These data were to be evaluated statistically to determine if the
      products meet bioequivalence criteria.
