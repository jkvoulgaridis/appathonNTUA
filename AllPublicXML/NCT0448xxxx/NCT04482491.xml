  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer has become a public health priority considering its increased prevalence
      and high mortality rate when diagnosed late. As a consequence, many countries have promoted
      and uptaken of colorectal cancer screening programs leading to an increasing detection of
      advanced but also superficial lesions ESGE (European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy)
      guidelines states that the majority of those colonic and rectal superficial lesions can be
      removed in a curative way by standard polypectomy and/or by EMR (Endoscopic Mucosal
      Resection) and that ESD (Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection) can be considered for removal of
      colonic and rectal lesions with high suspicion of limited submucosal invasion.
      Histologically, a resection is curative for the patient when the adenocarcinoma is
      well-differentiated (G1/G2), with a depth of invasion ≤ sm1 (≤ 1 mm submucosal invasion),
      with no lymphovascular invasion nor budding and with lateral and deep margins free of cancer

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients with colorectal lesions&gt; 2 cm because any gastroenterologist must be able to
        resect 2 cm polyps on their own and therefore should never need to take biopsies to clarify
        the histology before resection.

        Patient consenting after information If the lesion is defined by an endoscopist as CONECCT
        IIA, simple adenoma, the lesion will be resected by en bloc mucosectomy or piece meal
        depending on its size (after a biopsy, secondary objective).

        If the lesion is defined by an endoscopist as CONECCT IIC, adenoma at risk or superficial
        cancer (&lt;1000µm depth), the lesion will be resected by R0 en bloc by mucosectomy or
        dissection if the lesion is greater than 20mm (after a biopsy, secondary objective).

        If the lesion is defined by an endoscopist as CONECCT III, deep adenocarcinoma (≥1000µm
        depth), it will be sampled from the most severe part by biopsy forceps and the patient will
        be referred to oncology or surgery according to the extension assessment .

        Pathology available of endoscopic or surgical resection piece Follow-up at 6 months after
        treatment for CONECCT IS, IIA, IIC lesions by endoscopic control and III by clinical or
        imaging control.

        .

        -

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Metastatic lesion immediately before colonoscopy Patients under guardianship Age &lt;18
        Pregnant woman Contraindication to colonoscopy.
