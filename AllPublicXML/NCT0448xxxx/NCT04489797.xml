  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to support the clinical development of acalabrutinib in
      participants who need treatment with proton pump inhibitors while taking acalabrutinib.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-center, randomized study in healthy participants to evaluate
      the effect of proton-pump inhibitors (rabeprazole; PPI) on acalabrutinib 100-mg capsule dosed
      orally with COCA-COLA. Participants will receive a single dose of acalabrutinib alone or with
      rabeprazole, and PK, safety and tolerability will be assessed.
