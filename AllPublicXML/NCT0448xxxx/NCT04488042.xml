    <textblock>
      Stapler-less laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is emerging as a new potential affordable
      cost-effective alternative procedure. However, no pre-clinical data are currently available
      on human tissue. We aimed to evaluate whether traditionally suturing without the use of
      surgical stapling may produces a comparable bursting pressure on human gastric tissue.

      Stapler-less laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is emerging as a new potential affordable
      cost-effective alternative procedure. However, no pre-clinical data are currently available
      on human tissue. We aimed to evaluate whether traditionally suturing without the use of
      surgical stapling may produces a comparable bursting pressure on human gastric tissue.

      A prospective cohort of consecutive patients underwent LSG was divided in two groups to
      compare a barbed extramucosal running suture (stapler-less) versus a standard stapler line. A
      burst pressure test was applied to the gastric specimen employing high-resolution manometric
      catheter. Type, location and features of the leak were described.

      In human ex-vivo model, traditional surgical suture (i.e. running hand-sewn) produced an
      effective temporary closure, with superior resistance to increasing volume and pressure. How
      this may impact on clinical LSG outcomes needs further evaluations and was not the object of
      this study.
