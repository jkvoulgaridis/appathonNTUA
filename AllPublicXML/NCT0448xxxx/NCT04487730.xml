  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Abnormalities in the Positive Valence System (PVS) are associated with depressive symptoms
      and reduced behavioral activation in mid- and late-life. This study will investigate the
      engagement of the PVS during exposure to social rewards, part of a novel streamlined
      psychotherapy for mid- and late-life depression. Use of computational modeling will enable
      identification of neuroimaging and behavioral profiles associated with greater treatment
      response, and may guide future personalization of psychotherapy.

    <description>&quot;Engage-S&quot;, a modified adapted version of &quot;Engage&quot;. Its principal intervention is &quot;social reward exposure&quot; - facilitating engagement in rewarding and meaningful social activities with significant others. In &quot;Engage-S&quot; therapy, individuals with depression work with a therapist to develop &quot;action plans&quot; to pursue rewarding social activities of their choice.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Symptom Review and Psychoeducation (SRP)</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>In this intervention, the therapist will review the participant's symptoms and provide literature-based clinical explanations and clarifications about the symptoms, the course, and the causes of depression. In SRP, the therapist reviews the depressed individual's symptoms, and level of information on depression, identifies misconceptions, and guides selection of educational material which could benefit the patient.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Ages aged 50-85 [stratified so that 50% are older than 65]

          2. Diagnosis of unipolar major depressive disorder without psychotic features, determined
             by the SCID

          3. Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score ≥ 20.

          4. Mini Mental Status Exam (MMSE) ≥ 1 SD below the mean score for patient's age and
             education

          5. Off antidepressants or on a stable dose of an antidepressant for 8 weeks and do not
             intend to change the dose in the next 10 weeks.

          6. Capacity to provide written consent for research assessment and treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Intent or plan to attempt suicide in the near future.

          2. History or presence of psychiatric diagnoses other than major depressive disorder
             without psychotic features, generalized anxiety disorder, or specific phobia.

          3. Use of psychotropic drugs or cholinesterase inhibitors other than use of ≤ 0.5 mg of
             lorazepam daily up to seven times per week.

          4. Neurological disorders (dementias, history of stroke, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's
             disease, epilepsy, etc.); cardiac, renal, or respiratory failure; severe chronic
             obstructive pulmonary disease; metastatic cancer; or debilitated states or less common
             medical illnesses that may either influence brain systems of interest or ability to
             participate in the study. Dr. Alexopoulos or another research psychiatrist will review
             any medical illnesses that does not appear in the list above and determine whether it
             interferes with the study of positive valence system functions in depression.

          5. Contraindications to MRI scanning including cardiac pacemaker, heart valve
             replacement, vascular stent, insulin pump, cochlear implant, any other metallic
             biomedical implant contraindicating to MRI, and claustrophobia.
