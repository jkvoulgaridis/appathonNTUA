      Ankylosing spondylitis is a chronic inflammatory disease, which mainly invades sacroiliac
      joint, spinal osteoid process, paraspinal soft tissue and peripheral joints, and can be
      accompanied by extraarticular manifestations, in severe cases, spinal deformity and ankylosis
      can occur. The overall prevalence rate of ankylosing spondylitis in China is about 0.3%, the
      peak of which is 20 to 30 years old. although the prevalence rate is not high, the disability
      rate is high, and the patients with ankylosing spondylitis are mainly young people of
      childbearing age, which are in a critical period of work and study. If the disease can not be
      controlled smoothly, it will seriously affect its learning and work efficiency, image
      appearance and even the ability of daily life.

      Bawei Shenqi Pill originates from Zhang Zhongjing's synopsis of the Golden Chamber, is the
      representative prescription of warming and tonifying kidney yang, and is also suitable for
      the pathogenesis of ankylosing spondylitis &quot;deficiency of kidney yang&quot;. The purpose of this
      study was to observe the therapeutic effect of Bawei Shenqi Pill on ankylosing spondylitis of
      kidney-yang deficiency type through a randomized controlled clinical study. To clarify the
      effect of Bawei Shenqi Pill on disease activity, joint function, TCM syndrome integral and
      quality of life in patients with ankylosing spondylitis, and to provide basis for the
      treatment of ankylosing spondylitis with Bawei Shenqi Pill.
