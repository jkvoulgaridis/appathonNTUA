  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will identify 10 patients in the department of radiation oncology who will
      receive standard of-care radiation therapy, and the treating radiation oncologist anticipates
      a mean left ventricular dose of at least 5 Gy. Patients will be evaluated by CMRI before and
      within one week of the completion of RT. We will compare the pre- and post-RT CMRI scans to
      identify changes related to radiation exposure. Our primary endpoint will be changes in
      myocardial strain. Secondary endpoints will include other CMRI parameters.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac toxicity is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in cancer survivors after
      radiation therapy (RT) to the chest. Typically, cardiotoxicity is identified years after
      radiation exposure. Emerging clinical data show that subclinical injury can be identified
      immediately after treatment. Early identification of subclinical injury may enable
      intervention to reduce the risk of progression to clinically significant toxicity. The
      investigators hypothesize that cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) will detect early
      cardiac injury after RT and that imaging changes will be associated regionally with cardiac
      radiation dose.

    <description>Clinical data will be collected regarding cardiac risk factors, cancer type, and cancer treatment.
CMRI will be performed:
Within 2 weeks before the first fraction of radiation therapy (RT)
Within 1 week of the final fraction of RT (before or after)
Any patient with a pre-RT and post-RT MRI scan will be considered evaluable.
Pre- and post-RT CMRI parameters will be compared.
3D reconstructed CMR images will be co-registered with RT treatment plans to assess for spatial associations.</description>
