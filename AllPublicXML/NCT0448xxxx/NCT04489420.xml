  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will find the maximum safe dose (MSD) or maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of CYNK-001
      which are NK cells derived from human placental CD34+ cells and culture-expanded. CYNK-001
      cells will be given after lymphodepleting chemotherapy for the systemic cohort (IV)
      (intravenous). The intratumoral cohort (IT) will not be giving lymphodepletion. The safety of
      this treatment will be evaluated, and researchers want to learn if NK cells will help in
      treating recurrent glioblastoma multiforme.

    <description>Cohort 1A ( recurrent GBM) will receive CYNK-001 at a dose of 1.2 x 10^9 cells intravenous ( IV) on Days 0, 7, and 14 and will include up to 6 subjects. The subjects will be followed for a 42 day DLT period from the initial CYNK-001 infusion (or 28 days after the last dose). No other treatment interventions are planned between the last day of CYNK-001. In the event of DLTs, Cohort 1C ( recurrent GBM dose-De escalation) will receive CYNK-001 at a dose of 600 x 10^6 cells (IV) on Days 0, 7, 14, and will include up to 6 subjects who will be followed for a 42-day DLT period from the initial CYNK-001 infusion (or 28 days after the last dose. Cohort 1B (surgical cohort) will receive CYNK-001 at the maximum safe dose (MSD) (either 1.2x10^9 cells or 600x10^6 cells) (IV) at Days 0, 7, 14, and will include up to 6 subjects. The tumor resection surgery will be performed after the last CYNK-001 infusion during the DLT period.</description>

    <description>The cohort 2A or cohort 2C (recurrent GBM) IT route of administration can be started only after the safety results were acceptable from the completion of cohort 1A or Cohort 1C (IV route of administration). The Treatment Period for the IT cohorts will begin with having the Ommaya catheter placement per institutional policy, which is planned to occur within one week prior to the CYNK-001 administration on Day 0. Cohort 2A will be treated with CYNK-001 IT at 200 x 10^6 ± 50 x 10^6 cells IT on Day 0, 7 and 14 includes up to 6 recurrent GBM subjects Cohort 2C ( dose de-escalation) will be treated with CYNK-001 200 x 106 ± 50 x 106 cells IT on Day 0, and Day 7 ( only two days dosing) and include up to 6 recurrent GBM subjects. Cohort 2B ( the surgical IT cohort) will be treated with CYNK-001 at the maximum safe dose ( MSD) (either 200 x 10^6 ± 50 x 10^6 cells on Days 0, 7 and 14 or at 200 x 10^6 ±50x10^6 cells on Days 0 and 7) and include up to 6 surgical GBM subjects</description>
