  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study tests the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of using a brief
      pamphlet in the primary care waiting room focused on promoting patient-initiated
      weight-related discussions in primary care appointments.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a chronic and complex disease that many national and professional organizations
      recommend be discussed frequently in primary care. However, rates of weight-related
      communication in primary care are suboptimal. When patients and physicians communicate about
      weight (defined as usage of any the 5As—ask, assess, advise, agree, and/or assist—in a
      weight-related conversation), patients are more likely to improve dietary habits, demonstrate
      more motivation for health behavior change, attempt weight loss treatment, and lose more
      weight as compared to patients who do not engage in weight-related communication with their
      physicians. Interventions have attempted to increase the rates of weight-related
      communication in primary care. However, they have focused solely on physicians and have only
      yielded modest efficacy. Intervention with patients on proposed patient-related barriers may
      be key to improving the rate of weight-related communication in primary care. The waiting
      room prior to appointments is an underutilized intervention setting. Prior waiting room
      interventions have shown promising results for increasing health communication between
      patients and physicians. However, no prior study has focused on weight-related communication.
      Thus, this study aims to test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of an
      experiential pamphlet delivered in the waiting room targeting patient-related barriers to
      weight communication.
