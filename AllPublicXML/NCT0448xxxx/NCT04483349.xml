    <textblock>
      To assess the importance patients place on each of the attributes of value (i.e., outcomes,
      quality of life [QOL], cost, experience), and how these patientsâ€™ views differ depending on
      the stage of their therapy (pretreatment, preoperative therapy, post-operative, long-term
      surveillance, recurrence).

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess the importance patients place on each of the attributes of value (i.e.,
      outcomes, quality of life [QOL], cost, experience).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess which attributes of value (i.e., outcomes, QOL, cost, experience) health care
      providers (i.e., physicians, nurses, administrators) feel are most important in health care
      delivery.

      II. To assess how these patients' views differ depending on the stage of their therapy
      (pretreatment, preoperative therapy, post-operative, long-term surveillance, recurrence).

      III. To assess how patients' view differ to health providers.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients and healthcare providers complete a survey over 10-15 minutes.
