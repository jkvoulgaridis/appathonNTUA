    <intervention_model_description>Patients in this current trial will initially be randomized to either needle or cannula injections, or no treatment (control; ratio 3:3:1, respectively). Subjects will proceed from randomization in parallel assignment. Subjects initially randomized to the control group at Baseline will be randomized to either needle or cannula treatment at Visit 3, Month 1 (crossover). Subjects in the crossover group will then be seen at weeks 2 and 4 post last treatment, as per Schedule 1.</intervention_model_description>
