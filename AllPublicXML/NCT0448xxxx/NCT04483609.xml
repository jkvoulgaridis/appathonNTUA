  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Urological dysfunction is common in patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and its prevalence
      has been reported at a high rate of 32-97%. Bladder dysfunction is associated with a
      significant deterioration in the quality of life of people with MS. In chronic diseases such
      as MS, patients experiences need to be measured directly in order to have information about
      patients perceptions about the effect of the disease on quality of life. However, there are a
      small number of valid and reliable Turkish scales on this subject.SF-Qualiveen is a validated
      scale for patients with MS who assess the urinary-specific quality of life by examining the
      impact of a wide range of bladder problems.The aim of our study is to make the Turkish
      cultural adaptation, validity and reliability of the SF-Qualiveen scale.

      The aim of this study is to reveal the Turkish cultural adaptation, validity and reliability
      of the SF-Qualiveen scale. In our study, Sf-Qualiveen and Urogenital Distress Inventory
      (UDI-6) scales will be used. Pre-testing will be done in 10 patients with multiple
      sclerosis.Then, the validity and reliability of the scale will be performed in 80 patients
      with multiple sclerosis.

    <description>After the pre-test is completed, if necessary, arrangements will be made, and then the validity and reliability of SF-Qualiveen will be made in 80 individuals with Multiple Sclerosis.First of all, participants will be asked to complete two questionnaires (SF-Qualiveen and Urinary Distress Inventory). Two weeks after this assessment, they will be asked to respond to SF-Qualiveen again.</description>
