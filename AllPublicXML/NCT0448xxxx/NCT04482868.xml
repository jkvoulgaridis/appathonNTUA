  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The scaphoid is the most common fractured carpal bone in active adults, accounting for up to
      80% of all carpal fractures. The optimum treatment approach of the acute scaphoid fractures
      is under discussion. Cast immobilization is the main treatment for non-displaced scaphoid
      fractures, however, about 20% of scaphoid fractures fail to heal with conservative treatment.
      Long periods of cast immobilization may result in wrist stiffness, loss of grip strength,
      muscle atrophy and disuse osteopenia. Operative treatment for displaced and unstable scaphoid
      fractures was mostly adopted, however, open fixation for scaphoid fractures have the inherent
      disadvantages of ligament and capsular dissection, blood vessels damage. This study
      introduces a novel measures of percutaneous screw fixation for acute scaphoid fractures. We
      used one K-wire maintaining the reduction of the scaphoid fractures throughout the entire
      process of drilling and screw insertion and screw fixation for acute scaphoid fractures.

        From January 2015 to December 2018, 10 patients (seven males and three females) with acute
        scaphoid fractures were consecutively treated with the proposed technique. Among these
        patients, six were right-handed, and four were left-handed. The average age was 30.9 years
        (range 16-58 years), and the mean time of injury to treatment was 7.0 days (range, 3-10
        days). The patients were initially evaluated because of pain, swelling and limited wrist
        range of motion. Eight of the injuries resulted from a fall onto the outstretched wrist
        during sporting event, and two resulted from automobile accidents. According to the
        classification of Hebert, B1 (distal oblique fracture) occurred in four cases, and B2
        (complete waist fracture) was observed in six cases.
