  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the effects of music intervention in relieving burnout among
      nurses. Burnout is a condition of deceased job performance resulting from increased stress in
      the workplace.This study is to attempt to examine whether music therapy would decrease
      burnout symptoms and whether there would be a greater decrease of burnout in the music
      intervention group than the non-music intervention group. In this randomized controlled trial
      study, we will be using a convenience sample of nurses from Emergency room, medical unit,
      surgical unit, pediatric, ICU, labor and delivery at the Majuro hospital. Participant will be
      met for three session each week for a five week period. The participant will be divided into
      an experimental group (group A) using a music relaxation intervention and control group
      (group B) with usual care. The study will used the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) with a
      pretest/post-test design measuring burnout at the beginning before the first session starts
      and at the end of the last session ends. We hypothesized that clinical nurses who will
      received music intervention will experience reduction in burnout compared with those in
      control group will not.

      We aim to explore the potential of music therapy to support burnout among nurses and
      convenience sampling method will be adopted. This will be a randomized single-blinded,
      two-arm, parallel study, with data to be collected between August to December 2020. Eligible
      participants will be assigned to either music therapy group or the waiting-list control
      group. This study will be submitted to Leroj Atama Memorial Hospital at the Ministry of
      Health and Human Services and the College of the Marshall Islands Research committee for
      approval.We will enroll nurses from the General units of Leroj Atama Memorial Hospital in
      Majuro, Marshall Islands. The invitation to participate will be communicated by the Chief
      Nursing Officer and baseline assessment will be given by a trained study interviewer for
      participant recruitment. A structured questionnaire will be used to collect data on
      demographics, burnout, depression, stress, and anxiety. Participants will be recruited from
      the emergency units and 5 inpatients wards of general hospital of Leroj Atama Memorial
      Hospital in Majuro, Marshall Islands. We anticipate to enroll 42 nurses into this study. They
      will be divided into 2 group which are 21 for music group and 21 for control group.Random
      assignment will be performed by generating sequential numbers using computer software. The
      random sequential number will then be sealed in thick, opaque, consecutively numbered
      envelopes before data collections by an independent investigator. Patients will be allocated
      to either intervention or control group depending on the sequences number revealed by
      principal investigator. all participants in the music group will receive music intervention
      over five weeks. Each participant receives music intervention 30 mins per session (2 pm or 4
      pm), three days in a week according to their schedule. Music intervention will be conducted
      at a quiet environment (i.e., nursing lounge) in the hospital. Four types of music protocols
      based on different rhythm or tones will provide to them, such as classical, slow music,
      traditional, and Christian song, before the session. Participants will listen to the songs
      selected and be given mp3 and earpiece for delivering the intervention. During each music
      session, individual will be advised to close his/her eyes and relaxed and only think of a
      happy memory. Participant in the waiting-list control group will be asked to maintain their
      daily routine and they will receive music intervention after the completion of the study.

    <masking>Single (Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>The participants and treatment provider are aware of group assignment due to the nature of biobehavioral intervention. A single-blinded design will be adopted because outcome assessors will be blinded to the group allocation and interventions employed in the two groups. The outcome assessors will not be allowed to disclose participant grouping or to discuss the details of participants. The researcher will not discuss participant-related research data with the outcome assessors.</masking_description>

    <measure>Burnout</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Burnout will be measured using Maslach Burnout Inventory questionnaire scale, 22 items subscales of the 3 domain show high consistency with Cronbach's α coefficient values of 0.837, 0.869, and 0.881 and test-retest reliability was high ( p&lt;0.001 ). At baseline, we will collect data regarding burnout level, depression, anxiety, stress and demographic characteristic ( i.e, age, gender, marital status, and having children ect. ) that have been demonstrated to be associated with nurse burnout. The outcome indicators will be collected at 5 weeks after the completion of the intervention. Respondents in the waiting-list control group will complete self-report measures at the same time points as those in the music intervention group.</description>

    <description>They will be measured using a self-reported questionnaire, the 21-item Depression Anxiety Stress Score scale (DASS). It assesses the autonomic arousal, skeletal muscle effects, situational anxiety and subjective experience of anxious for anxiety scale, depression scale assesses dysphoria, hopelessness, devaluation of life, self-deprecation, lack of interest/involvement, anhedonia, and inertia, and stress scale assesses difficulty relaxing, nervous arousal, and being easily upset/agitated, irritable and impatient. Subjects are asked to use 4-point scale from 0 'do not apply to me at all' to 3 'apply to me very much' severity/frequency to rate the extent to which they have experienced each state over the past week, DASS score are calculated by summing the scores for the relevant items and 11 score or higher indicates probable presence of greater mood disorder. The subdomain score of 28 and above indicates extremely severe of depression level; the score of 20 and above reflects extremely</description>
