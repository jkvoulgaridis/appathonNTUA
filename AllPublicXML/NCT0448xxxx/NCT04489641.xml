  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present work aims to develop a randomized clinical trial with a sample of 84 patients
      diagnosed with anxiety and depression in primary care. All participants are tested by several
      self-reports related to emotional disorders in a repeated measures design, pre and post
      treatment. It is our aim this study will demonstrate that brief psychological treatments
      should be prioritized over pharmacological treatment in Primary Care. In addition, emotional
      regulation will be assessed and examined as a key factor in the clinical improvement.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Generalised Anxiety Disorder Assessment (GAD-7)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The GAD-7 score is calculated by assigning scores of 0, 1, 2, and 3, to the response categories of 'not at all', 'several days', 'more than half the days', and 'nearly every day', respectively, and adding together the scores for the seven questions. Scores of 5, 10, and 15 are taken as the cut-off points for mild, moderate and severe anxiety, respectively. When used as a screening tool, further evaluation is recommended when the score is 10 or greater. Using the threshold score of 10, the GAD-7 has a sensitivity of 89% and a specificity of 82% for GAD.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) is a commonly used measure of trait and state anxiety (Spielberger et al., 1983). It can be used in clinical settings to diagnose anxiety and to distinguish it from depressive syndromes. It also is often used in research as an indicator of caregiver distress AnxietyForm Y, its most popular version, has 20 items for assessing trait anxiety and 20 for state anxiety. All items are rated on a 4-point scale (e.g., from &quot;Almost Never&quot; to &quot;Almost Always&quot;). Higher scores indicate greater anxiety. The STAI is appropriate for those who have at least a sixth-grade reading level. Internal consistency coefficients for the scale have ranged from .86 to .95; test-retest reliability coefficients have ranged from .65 to .75 over a 2-month interval (Spielberger et al., 1983).</description>

    <measure>The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) is a self-administered version of the PRIME-MD diagnostic instrument for common mental disorders.The PHQ-9 is the depression module, which scores each of the 9 DSM-IV criteria as &quot;0&quot; (not at all) to &quot;3&quot; (nearly every day).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Beck Depression Inventory-Second Edition (BDI-II)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The BDI-II is a widely used 21-item self-report inventory measuring the severity of depression in adolescents and adults. The BDI-II was revised in 1996 to be more consistent with DSM-IV criteria for depression. For example, individuals are asked to respond to each question based on a two-week time period rather than the one-week timeframe on the BDI. The BDI-II is widely used as an indicator of the severity of depression, but not as a diagnostic tool, and numerous studies provide evidence for its reliability and validity across different populations and cultural groups.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Emotional Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It evaluates the tendency to regulate emotions. It consists of 10 items and participants have to respond according to a 7-points Likert scale. It has two subscales: reappraisal and suppression (six and four items respectively). The reappraisal subscale assesses the ability to change negative emotions while the suppression subscale assesses the tendency to repress and hide negative emotions.</description>
