  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In COVID-19 times, there has been a large increase in number of people working from home;
      with limited places to go, an abrupt change to people's lives and lack of knowledge about the
      dangers of sedentary behaviour (SB), it is important to help workers develop and effortlessly
      incorporate healthy movement routines to optimize daily productivity and health. The combined
      lack of knowledge on literature on SB profiles of full time, home-based workers, effects of
      framing of SB reduction strategies, and strategy preference uncertainty makes for a novel
      study. This will be a 4-week intervention with 3 experimental groups that looks at whether
      telling a full time, home-based office worker to do pre-selected strategies to break up their
      sedentary behaviour (SB) (i.e. sitting) will change their SB profiles compared to either
      letting them select their own strategies (from either a short or long list menu).
      Investigators are looking to see whether having the choice (or not) to choose strategies in
      an unfamiliar health related selection (preference uncertainty) will create greater changes
      in SBs. As well, the researchers are incorporating behavioural economics' choice overload
      concept with length of choice menus in relation to behaviour change and program engagement.
      Workers' work-related SB will be measured by a device at baseline and on the last week of the
      intervention. Workers will be provided with an SB educational video to increase knowledge and
      motivation for change. Any SB changes in relation to productivity, mental wellness, behaviour
      intentions etc. will also be measured.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Regardless of group assignment, participants will receive the same three-minute educational
      video at the beginning (week 1) and halfway through (week 3) the intervention. Each group
      will also receive weekly sedentary behaviour reduction strategies (number varied by group
      allocation) under the themes of &quot;sit less, stand up, and move often&quot;. Participants will be
      asked to &quot;pre-commit&quot; to 3 strategies (that are either pre-selected for participants ('forced
      choice') or selected by participants from a short or long list of options at the beginning of
      each week),and will be reminded of their selection on the Wednesday of each week and will be
      instructed to self-report their sedentary behaviours at the end of each week (Friday).

      An &quot;interested&quot; participant will email research personal with their initial &quot;interest&quot; in
      which the research personnel will respond by asking them for their phone number with the
      letter of information (LOI)/informed consent document attached. From there, a phone call will
      be arranged to go over the document before proceeding with the study. After thoroughly going
      through the LOI and answering any questions or concerns they may have, participants will be
      asked for verbal consent and will be instructed to sign (digitally) the LOI/informed consent
      and send it back to the researcher (via email). Upon received consent, participants will be
      asked for their home address (for ActivPAL4 delivery) and will be told that they will receive
      an email with their unique participant ID and link to the first questionnaire (demographic
      information and secondary outcomes). When the participant receives the link to the first
      questionnaire, the LOI will be the first page for them to review once again.

      Upon completion of the baseline questionnaire, the activPAL4 will be sent by courier (i.e.
      FedEx) and participants will receive another email with detailed instructions of how to apply
      the device [i.e. applied to the mid-thigh using Tegaderm (3M)] along with how to contact
      investigators upon any issues with application. Participants will be instructed to apply the
      device on Sunday evening (if possible) and to wear the device all day for a period of 5
      working days (Monday to Friday). Once participants complete the device measured baseline
      assessment, they will place the device back in the package it came in, and using pre-paid
      postage, the device will be picked up (via courier) and they will then be randomized into one
      of the three experimental conditions preceding the intervention period.

      Intervention Week 1. On day one of the intervention (Monday), participants will receive an
      email containing, 1) a link to watch a 3-minute whiteboard-styled educational video about
      sedentary behaviour (i.e. health consequences, benefits of breaking up or reducing sedentary
      behaviour, sedentary behaviour in relation to productivity and mood etc.) and 2) another link
      that will lead them to a short questionnaire re-assessing knowledge and intentions of
      sedentary behaviour that were assessed in the first questionnaire they did at baseline (using
      Sosci and unique ID code); they will be instructed to fill out this questionnaire AFTER
      watching the video and will serve as a fidelity check. A second email will contain their
      strategies and pre-commitment options; depending on the condition assignment (as described
      earlier) participants will either be presented with a sedentary behaviour strategy menu to
      choose one out of X number of strategies (per three categories) (i.e. short-list or long-list
      condition) or, be instructed in what they will be doing that week (no-choice condition).
      After the strategy selection or instruction, participants will be prompted within the same
      email to pre-commit to three strategies for that week. Wednesday morning, participants will
      receive an email reminding them of their strategies. In the afternoon, on the last day of the
      same workweek (Friday), participants will be prompted (via email) with a link (Soci) to
      self-report their sitting habits (i.e. break frequency and break duration) along with
      accountability to their commitments.

      Intervention Week 2. On the Monday of week 2, strategies will reset as earlier described for
      each condition. For this week, participants will again be prompted within the same email to
      pre-commit to three strategies for that week and will again receive an email Wednesday
      morning reminding them of their chosen strategies. Additionally, they will again be asked to
      self-report their sitting habits (via link sent through email) (i.e. break frequency and
      break duration) along with accountability to their commitments on the last day of the week
      (Friday).

      Intervention Week 3. On the Monday of Week 3, strategies will reset as earlier described for
      each condition. However, for this week, the participants will be reminded of the video they
      watched at the beginning of the intervention and be asked to re-watch the same video. In line
      with the same protocol described in the earlier weeks, pre-commitment, self-reported sitting
      habits and accountability will be measured; along with the reminder email on Wednesday
      morning.

      Intervention Week 4. Week four of the intervention will be the final week. Again, strategies
      will reset for all conditions. Participants again, will wear the activPAL4's (delivered via
      FedEx) for a total of five days (Monday to Friday). This will serve as the follow-up
      objectively (device) measured sedentary behaviour measurement. The participants will receive
      the same pre-commitment and reminder email as previous weeks. This last week, however, the
      Friday questionnaire will include all secondary outcomes that were initially assessed at
      baseline along with a short exit survey asking about participant satisfaction with the
      intervention.

      Follow Up. Follow-up will occur two weeks post-intervention. Participants will recomplete all
      secondary outcomes that were initially assessed at baseline (with exception to the activPAL
      measurements).

    <description>Questions regarding work productivity, concentration and focus will be measured with questions adapted from The Health and Work Questionnaire (HWQ). The HWQ is a multidimensional tool used to measure various aspects of productivity. The HWQ consists of 24 questions, several items being multi-part questions with internal consistency scores ranging from alpha = 0.72 to 0.96. The questions are designed to assess work quality, quantity, and efficiency, as well as impatience, concentration/focus, work satisfaction and non-work satisfaction. For the current study, 15 items were chosen from this questionnaire that were relevant to &quot;home-based&quot; office workers. Items will be assessed with a ten-point response scale, tailored to each question (e.g., &quot;my worst ever&quot; to &quot;my best ever&quot;).</description>

    <description>Responses will be rated using a 7-point Likert scale scored from 1 (completely disagree) to 7 (totally agree). The question stem is as follows, &quot;For you, sitting for work (e.g. using the computer, doing office work, reading, talking on the phone, sitting in meetings, eating) is.... (i.e. pleasant). An attitude score will be computed by summing the five items and dividing by five.</description>

One item will assess injunctive norms (e.g. &quot;It is expected of me that I sit… [for X hours per day&quot;] and two items will assess descriptive norms (e.g. &quot;Most people like me sit... [for X hours per day])&quot;.</description>

The message containing the upcoming week's strategies will state, &quot;Here are three successful previously used strategies that are peer suggested and expert recommended to reduce and break up your sitting that we want you do to this week: A, B, and C.&quot; Strategies will be selected from peer-reviewed articles, and each of the three strategies will have one of three themes: stand up, sit less, and move more. These strategies will change each week (to account for the Choice condition's weekly strategy change up). Participants will be asked to 'pre-commit' to the strategy by e-signing a so-called sitting 'oath' and will be reminded of their 'oath' with a mid-week email reminder. All participants will experience all of the 12 strategies, but will be randomly assigned the combinations, to counterbalance any order or combined effects.</description>
