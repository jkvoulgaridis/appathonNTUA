                  treatment period and for at least 120 days after the last dose of study
                  treatment.

          4. Participant must have recurrent cervical cancer and have a low potential for cure with
             radiation therapy or surgery alone and:

             a. May have received up to 2 prior chemotherapy regimens. Platinum sensitizing agents
             for radiation therapy are considered a chemotherapy regimen.

          5. The participant (or legally acceptable representative if applicable) provides written
             informed consent for the trial, which includes compliance with the requirements and
             restrictions listed in the informed consent form (ICF) and this protocol.

          6. Have measurable disease based on RECIST 1.1. Lesions situated in a previously
             irradiated area are considered measurable if progression has been demonstrated in such
             lesions.

          7. Have provided archival tumor tissue sample or newly obtained core or excisional biopsy
             of a tumor lesion not previously irradiated. Formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE)

             confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required.

          2. Note: in the event that 72 hours have elapsed between the screening pregnancy test and
             the first dose of study treatment, another pregnancy test (urine or serum) must be
             performed and must be negative in order for subject to start receiving study
             medication.

          3. Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti PD L2 agent or with

             previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are radiologically
             stable, i.e. without evidence of progression for at least 4 weeks by repeat imaging
             (note that the repeat imaging should be performed during study screening), clinically
             stable and without requirement of steroid treatment for at least 14 days prior to
             first dose of study intervention.

             Patients with symptomatic uncontrolled brain metastases. A scan to confirm the absence
             of brain metastases is not required. The patient can receive a stable dose of
             corticosteroids before and during the study as long as these were started at least 4
             weeks prior to treatment. Patients with spinal cord compression unless considered to
