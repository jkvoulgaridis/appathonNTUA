  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Listening to breath sounds with the stethoscope/auscultation is used by pulmonary physicians
      in conjunction with pulmonary function, signs and symptoms, oxygen saturation and diagnostic
      testing to admit, follow and discharge patients from hospital. Of these, only auscultation
      routinely ceases upon discharge from Hospital. Healthcare utilization statistics have shown
      that for more than a decade, readmission after discharge for an exacerbation of COPD or
      severe asthma (or chronic heart failure) remains a major problem. The Strados System has been
      designed to extend the range of lung sound recording both geographically and temporally to
      improve the standard of care when access to continuous monitoring has been replaced by
      periodic or no monitoring. The primary purpose of this study is to assess the clinical
      utility of the Strados System in enabling periodic recording and reviewing of breath sounds
      in patients with chronic respiratory diseases, either in the ICU, or in less continuously
      monitored settings, including after inpatient discharge.
