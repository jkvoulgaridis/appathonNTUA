  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of low-level laser treatment (LLLT) on
      the severity of lymphedema, symptom burden, functional status, and quality of life in HNC
      survivors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary aim: To determine the impact of LLLT, as compared to wait-list control, on changes in
      severity of lymphedema.

      Secondary aim: To determine the impact of LLLT, as compared to a wait-list control, on
      lymphedema-related symptom burden (e.g., tightness), functional impairments (e.g., range of
      motion in jaw and neck), and quality of life.
