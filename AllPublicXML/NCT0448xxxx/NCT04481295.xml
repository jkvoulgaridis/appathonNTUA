  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the exercise capacity between high SpO2 (Minimum SpO2
      94-96%) value during pulmonary rehabilitation and low SpO2 (Minimum SpO2 84-86%) value during
      pulmonary rehabilitation for the patients with chronic respiratory failure receiving
      long-term oxygen therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In patients with chronic respiratory failure, pulmonary rehabilitation is recognized as an
      evidence-based treatment in improving exercise capacity, muscle strength, dyspnea, and
      quality of life. However, optimal SpO2 value during pulmonary rehabilitation in patients with
      chronic respiratory failure receiving long-term oxygen therapy is unclear.

      The present study is randomized to compare the effect of exercise capacity between high SpO2
      (Minimum SpO2 94-96%) value during pulmonary rehabilitation and low SpO2 (Minimum SpO2
      84-86%) value during pulmonary rehabilitation for the patients with chronic respiratory
      failure receiving long-term oxygen therapy.

    <intervention_name>High-flow nasal cannula</intervention_name>
    <description>The nasal high flow therapy has enabled high flow oxygen to be derived through nasal cannula. This mode not only allows constant FiO2 during peak inspiratory flow but also confers benefits including a low level of continuous positive airway pressure with increased end-expiratory lung volume and reduced work of breathing, partly through intrinsic positive end-expiration pressure compensation and dead space washout. The inspired gases are warmed and humidified, improving comfort and possibly reducing airway inflammation, leading to improved drainage of respiratory secretions.</description>
