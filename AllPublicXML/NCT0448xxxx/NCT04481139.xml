    <measure>Percentage of Participants with Assessment in Ankylosing Spondylitis (ASAS) 20 response at Week 12.</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>ASAS20 is defined as a &gt;= 20% improvement and an absolute improvement of &gt;= 1 units (on a scale of 0 to 10) from Baseline in at least 3 of the 4 domains (patient's global assessment, back pain, function and inflammation) with no deterioration in the remaining domain (where deterioration is defined as a worsening of &gt;= 20% and a net worsening of &gt;= 1 unit [on a scale of 0 to 10])</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12 and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>BASDAI is a commonly used measure to define disease activity levels in axSpA patients. It consists of 6 questions on a 0 through 10 numeric rating scale (NRS) (0 being no problem and 10 being the worst problem) pertaining to the 5 major symptoms of AS: Fatigue, Spinal pain, Joint pain/swelling, Areas of localized tenderness, Morning stiffness duration, and Morning stiffness severity.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI) at Week 12 and Week 24.</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12 and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The BASFI is a validated patient reported outcome (PRO) instrument for use in the AS patient population. It consists of 10 items measured on a 0 to 10 NRS, which assesses the ability to perform activities known to be problematic to AS patients such as dressing, bending, reaching, turning, and climbing steps. The total scores range from 0 to 10.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Metrology Index (BASMI) at Week 12 and Week 24.</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12 and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The BASMI will be conducted at the visits specified to evaluate spinal mobility in a participan.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in Short-Form-36-Health Survey (SF-36) at Week 12 and Week 24.</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12 and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>SF-36 is a standardized survey evaluating 8 aspects of functional health and wellbeing: physical and social functioning, physical and emotional role limitations, bodily pain, general health, vitality, mental health. The score for a section is an average of the individual question scores, which are scaled 0-100 (0=no functioning, 100=highest level of functioning). Missing data at Week 12 were imputed by LOCF if data at an early visit (discontinuation visit) were available.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in Ankylosing Spondylitis Quality of Life (ASQoL) at Week 12 and Week 24.</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12 and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The ASQoL is an 18-item axSpA-specific Quality of Life (QoL) PRO measure validated in the AS patient population. Concepts measured include activities of daily life, emotional functioning, pain, fatigue, and sleep problems. Each item on ASQoL is given a score of &quot;1&quot; or &quot;0,&quot; where a score of &quot;1&quot; is given when an item is affirmed indicating adverse QoL. Total scores can range from 0 (good QoL) to 18 (poor QoL).</description>
