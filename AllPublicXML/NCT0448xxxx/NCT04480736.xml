        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy on the basis of physical examination, medical history, and vital signs
             performed at screening. If there are abnormalities, the participant may be included
             only if the investigator judges the abnormalities to be not clinically relevant. This
             determination must be recorded in the participant's source documents and initialed and
             dated by the investigator

          -  Must pass the comprehension test (i.e., obtain a passing score of greater than or
             equal to (&gt;=) 75 percent (%), with up to 3 attempts in total) indicating that he or
             she understands the purpose, procedures, and potential risks and benefits of the
             study, after reading the informed consent and after the investigator or designee has
             provided detailed information on the study and answered the potential participant's
             questions

          -  Must have a blood pressure (after the participant is supine for &gt;=5 minutes) between
             90 and 140 millimeters of Mercury (mmHg) systolic, extremes included, and less than or
             equal to (&lt;=)90 mmHg diastolic at screening. Two repeat measurements are allowed in
             the absence of any other concerning health screening issues

          -  Must have a Body mass index (BMI) (weight in kilogram divided by the square of height
             in meters) between 18.0 and 30.0 kilogram per meter square (kg/m^2), extremes
             included, and a body weight of &gt;=50.0 kg at screening

          -  All women of childbearing potential must have a negative highly sensitive serum
             (beta-human chorionic gonadotropin) pregnancy test at screening

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known allergies, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to JNJ-64281802 or its excipients,
             to a previous vaccination, or to specific medications/animals for which antigens may
             be in the dengue virus (DENV)-1 challenge strain preparations, including shellfish,
             fetal bovine serum, L-glutamine, neomycin, and streptomycin

          -  Any condition for which, in the opinion of the investigator, participation would not
             be in the best interest of the participant (example, compromise the well-being) or
             that could prevent, limit, or confound the protocol-specified assessments

          -  Received an investigational intervention (including investigational vaccines) or used
             an invasive investigational medical device within 6 months before first dose of study
             drug, or is currently enrolled in an investigational study, or is planning to be
             enrolled in an investigational study within 90 days after last dose of study drug

          -  Pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant during the study or within 90
             days after last dose of study drug

          -  Plans to father a child during the study or within 90 days after last dose of study
