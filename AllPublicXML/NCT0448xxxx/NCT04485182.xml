      Underwater massage is the more modern variety of massages otherwise known as tangentor, where
      the temperature of the water of the treatment tub and the mechanical effect of the water jet
      is utilised. It is typical of chronic low back pain that, after the first painful episode, is
      repeated at 44-78% of patients.

      Our goals are the followings:

        1. Is the beneficial effect of a Underwater massage therapy addition to a complex
           physiotherapy comparable to a control group with respect to clinical parameters?

        2. How much does the quality of life change in an initial state and how much is it in
           comparison with the control group?

      Informed consent was obtained from all participants. We use two groups to investigate the
      effects of the tangentor on the low back pain.

      The patients presenting at the rheumatology inpatient clinics were enrolled without into the
      treatment and control groups.

      Patients receiving Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation + underwater massage + spine
      gymnastics

      In the controll group the Patients receiving Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation +
      spine gymnastics

      Underwater jet massage (Tangentor) would be performed in a tub developed for this purpose,
      where the water temperature: 33-35 ° C. The treatments lasting from 15 atm and 15 cm for 15
      minutes.

      The water temperature is precisely measured by a built-in thermometer. Pressure is controlled
      by a manometer.

      They take a minimum of 10 treatments for approx. under 2 weeks.

      The back massage position is, that the patient lying on their side, hip and knees are
      slightly bent and the head and neck rest on a support.

      After the massage the client should rest for about 30minutes.

      Patients participated in two visits, for the first time before the study, right after the
      therapy treatments.

      During the study, all participants received the usual or necessary medications. On a Visual
      Analogue Scale (VAS) patients indicated degree of pain on a scale from 0 to 100 mm for the
      past week. VAS scores were expressed in millimetres (zero point—no pain; endpoint—intolerable
      pain). Patients recorded on the VAS scale the level of low back pain at rest as well as
      during activity. Functional disability was assessed by using the Oswestry Disability Index
      (ODI).

      Furthermore, there was a questionnaire on the quality of life, known as the EuroQol Five
      Dimensions Questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L).

        Enrollment criteria were as follows: outpatients aged 18-85 with non-specific low back pain
        that persists for at least 12 weeks, showing degenerative symptoms and suffering from
        moderately reduced mobility. Patient's pain intensity during activity should have been
        minimum 30mm on Visual Analogue Scale (0-100 mm VAS).

        Written information on the methodology and process they would be undergoing was provided to
        each participant, and an informed consent form was subsequently signed before the study.
