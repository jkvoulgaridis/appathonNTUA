  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of assisted electromagnetic navigation
      in percutaneous echo-guided sclerotherapy of slow-flow vascular malformations. Feasibility
      will be defined in terms of the percentage of patients for whom the procedure is successful.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary interventional treatment of low flow vascular anomalies includes ultrasound guided
      foam sclerotherapy. Each procedure involves a percutaneous needle insertion. However,
      procedures remain complicated to obtain the right trajectory in order to inject the foam at
      the center of the abnormality. Electromagnetic navigation system tracks the operator's
      needle, meaning the position and progression of the needle is visualized in 3D real time on
      the ultrasound probe interface.

      The present trial evaluate the feasibility of the electromagnetic navigation system during
      the needle insertion and the improvement of needle placement accuracy.
