    <textblock>
      The term axial spondyloarthritis (AksSpA) describes a group of chronic inflammatory diseases
      that characterized with spinal involvement. AxSpa is one of the most common rheumatic
      diseases and chronic pain and morning stiffness are the main complaints of these patients.
      Central sensitization is defined as increased response to normal or sub-threshold stimuli of
      central nervous system and its close relationship with many rheumatological diseases has been
      demonstrated in several studies. Pain in AksSpA patients is generally considered as a result
      of increased inflammatory burden and structural changes, However, failure to adequate
      analgesia in every patient whose inflammation is suppressed with anti-inflammatory treatment
      suggests new pain mechanisms. Central sensitization (CS) is one of these mechanisms and its
      recognition is only possible by detailed evaluation of the patient. There is no method for
      the diagnosis of central sensitization is accepted as a gold standard. clinical scales and
      quantitative sensory testing (QST) widely is used for this purpose widely. The most commomly
      used QST types incude pressure pain threshold (PPT), temporal summation (TS) and conditioned
      pain modulation (CPM). The well-known scale used for the evaluation of central sensitization
      is the Central Sensitization Inventory , developed by Mayer et.al in 2011 for detect central
      sensitization in chronic pain patients. The aim of this study is to evaluate the frequency of
      central sensitization (CS) in patients with axial spondyloarthritis (AxSpA) by means of
      clinical scales and quantitative sensory testing (QST), to examine related comorbidities and
      the parameters associated with the development of sensitization in these patients.

      The term axial spondyloarthritis (AksSpA) describes a group of chronic inflammatory diseases
      that characterized with spinal involvement. AxSpa is one of the most common rheumatic
      diseases and chronic pain and morning stiffness are the main complaints of these patients.
      Central sensitization (CS) is defined as increased response to normal or sub-threshold
      stimuli of central nervous system and its close relationship with many rheumatological
      diseases has been demonstrated in several studies. However, data associated with central
      sensitization in AxSpa patients is very limited. The quantitative sensory testing (QST) is
      commonly used for detection hyperalgesia and allodynia those are accepted main findings in
      sensitized patients. The most commomly used QST types incude pressure pain threshold (PPT),
      temporal summation (TS) and conditioned pain modulation (CPM).Pressure pain threshold
      measurement is frequently used to show local / generalized sensitivity increase in patients
      who develop pain sensitization. For this purpose, the pain response of superficial or deep
      tissue can be evaluated through mechanical device called algometer. The algometer probe was
      placed vertically in the each selected point and pressure was increased until the participant
      reporting pressure became painful. The first pressure value at which pain is felt is
      considered the PPT of that point. TS is defined as a progressive increase in pain response
      with repetetive painful stimuli. This condition is also known as wind-up phenomenon and play
      a role to development CS. CPM, known as one of the main mechanisms of endogenous analgesia,
      is based on the principle that pain perception can be reduced with painful stimulus applied
      to different areas according to the &quot;pain inhibits pain&quot; model. In the CPM testing, it is
      aimed to investigate the modulator effect of two different painful stimuli on each other. The
      diagnosis of CS can be made with QST or with Central Sensitization Inventory (CSI). The aim
      of this study is to evaluate the frequency of central sensitization (CS) in patients with
      axial spondyloarthritis (AxSpA) by means of clinical scales and quantitative sensory testing
      (QST), to examine related comorbidities and the parameters associated with the development of
      sensitization in these patients. The patients with AxSpa and healthy controls will be
      included in this study. QST which consists of pressure pain threshold (PPT), temporal
      summation (TS) and conditioned pain modulation (CPM) will be applied to the patient and
      control groups. Disease activity (BASDAI), functional status (ASQoL, ILBPDI), sleep quality
      (PSQI), pain (VAS pain), depression (BDI) and fatique (FSS) will be assessed. Fibromyalgia
      (FIRST) and other comorbidities will be investigated. Patients will be divided as the ones
      with and without CS according to the central sensitization inventory (CSI) and the results
      will be compared. After data collection, analysis will be performed with the appropriate
      statistical method

    <description>25 somatic and psychosocial symptoms, which are frequently found in patients with central sensitization in part A, are questioned. In part B, the presence of diseases whose relationship with central sensitization is well defined is questioned in the patient without participating in scoring. Central sensitization is assumed in patients who score 40 or more over 100 points.</description>

    <description>The spinal hyperalgesia will be evaluated from C3 and C7 (cervical); T6 and T2 (thoracic); L3 and L5 (lumbar) levels. The PPT assessments of these levels were performed over the spinous process and 2 cm right and left side of the corresponding spinous process.

    <description>TS scores will be evaluated over the trapezius muscle, sacroiliac joints, C7, T6, and L3 spine. TS scores will be calculated for each spine as the sum of three values which measured over the spinous process and 2 cm right and left side of corresponding level. In the evaluation of TS, a pressure as much the PPT value of each point will be applied with pain pressure algometer ten times with a 1-second interstimulus interval.

After that the right hand of the patient will be immersed in 70C water for 20 seconds to create a conditioning stimulus. Second stimulus with the same intensity of first one was applied to trapeizus after the conditioning stimulus and patients asked to rate their pain.

After that the right hand of the patient will be immersed in 70C water for 20 seconds to create a conditioning stimulus. Second test stimulus with the same intensity of first one will be applied to trapezius after the conditioning stimulus and patients will be asked to rate their pain. If the patients cannot hold their hand in the water for 20 seconds, the test stimulus will be applied immediately after the patients removed their hands out of water.
