  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and collect data on the initial
      effectiveness of a 1.1mm flexible single-use cryoprobe with oversheath used for
      transbronchial lung biopsy via a bronchoscopic approach.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A smaller (1.1mm), flexible, single-use cryoprobe with an oversheath has been developed that
      can be used for transbronchial biopsies. This device has the potential to gather larger and
      higher quality tissue samples than the standard method using forceps, and with potentially
      fewer complications than older, larger versions of the cryoprobe.

      This study does not involve randomization or assigning different patients to different
      procedures to compare. Everyone who enrolls in this study will undergo a standard of care
      bronchoscopy with a transbronchial biopsy using the 1.1mm sheath cryoprobe. The only
      difference from the standard of care approach is that the physician performing the
      transbronchial biopsy will use the 1.1mm sheath cryoprobe rather than forceps or another
      currently available larger cryoprobe.

      Patients enrolled in this study will have data collected by research staff for up to 30 days
      after the bronchoscopic biopsy procedure is performed. This 30-day follow-up period is the
      standard of care following bronchoscopic biopsy procedures.

    <description>The proportion of participants enrolled that underwent a device related Serious Adverse Events (SAEs).

    <description>The proportion of participants enrolled that underwent a device related Minor Adverse Event (AE).

    <description>Grade 0: Does not contain alveolar structures and can therefore not be assessed
Grade 1: Very poor specimen quality; not possible to assess the relevant morphologic and histologic features
Grade 2: Poor specimen quality; assessment of relevant morphologic and histologic structures and features is severely compromised and not possible
Grade 3: High limitations in specimen quality; assessment is severely compromised but limited evaluation is possible
Grade 4: Moderate limitations in specimen quality; assessment is moderately compromised but evaluation is possible
Grade 5: Low limitations in specimen quality; assessment is somewhat compromised but possible
Grade 6: The specimen allows for complete and unrestricted assessment of all relevant morphologic and histologic structures and features</description>

    <measure>Diagnostic Yield (%)</measure>
    <time_frame>During the procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Diagnostic yield is defined as proportion of patients for which cryobiopsy led to a diagnosis. Diagnostic yield will be determined from the results of cryobiopsy specimen only. A biopsy that results in a specific diagnosis, either malignant or benign (granuloma, inflammation, fibrosis, infection) will be assumed to be a true positive. Atypia, minimal inflammation or lung parenchyma without pathologic findings on final pathology reads are considered non-diagnostic.</description>
