  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized trial of protocolized diuretic therapy compared to structured usual care
      in ED patients with AHF. Participants will be recruited following an initial standard
      evaluation in the ED and randomized in a 1:1 fashion to structured usual care or protocolized
      diuretic therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A standardized protocol driven treatment pathway for hospitalized patients started in the
      first few hours of ED evaluation and utilizing objective measures of diuretic response is
      needed. The investigators believe this would maximize diuretic efficiency, facilitate quicker
      resolution of congestion, avoid WHF and prolonged LOS, and reduce AHF readmissions. Propr
      data suggests low urine sodium predicts length of stay and outcomes after initial diuretic
      dosing in the outpatient and inpatient setting. Further, use of the pathway using spot urine
      sodium to titrate subsequent loop diuretic doses and maximize response in inpatients with AHF
      has shown compelling improvements in congestion and weight loss. However, a randomized trial
      is necessary to determine if initiating this protocol ,started in the ED, will improve AHF
      outcomes relative to structured usual care. Specifically, the investigators hypothesize use
      of spot urine guided diuretic therapy will: 1) result in significant improvement in global
      clinical status at 5 days relative to structured usual care, and 2) result in significant
      improvement in congestion at 5 days and in global rank at 30 days relative to structured
      usual care. Early protocolized treatment of patients with AHF will more rapidly improve
      dyspnea, avoid development of in-hospital WHF, result in greater decongestion at hospital
      discharge, and therefore prevent HF-related readmissions and CV death.

    <description>Patients will have a spot urine sodium and urine creatinine obtained. The urine and creatinine results will be input into the diuretic calculator and the diuretic dose will be chosen based on daily goals for urine output and net negative fluid balance. Performed 3 times per day, diuretic dosing will be individualized based on the proportion of 24-hour diuresis achieved since the prior IV diuretic dose. Every 24 hours new goals for urine output and net negative fluid balance are established based on the study and treatment team's assessment of residual congestion until protocol completion.</description>

    <description>Patients will be placed on guideline-based diuretic dosing consistent with usual practice. The initial dose will be two times their home dose and will be subsequently adjusted by the treating team based on renal function and symptom severity. The treating team can increase or decrease the frequency and dose of diuretic based on urine output and clinical assessment. Patients in this arm also have urine collected 3 times per day by the bedside nurse to mirror the intervention arm.</description>
