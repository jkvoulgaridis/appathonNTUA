  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breath holding spells (BHS) are common non-epileptic paroxysmal behavioral involuntary
      episodes occurring in up to 5.9% of healthy children. The attacks occur in early childhood
      (0.5-3 years) but are self-limited by school age (4-5 years old) (90%). Classically, BHS were
      classified as cyanotic (blue), pallid (pale) and mixed based on the color change of the child
      during the spell. In general, cyanotic spells have been classically described in a toddler
      with excessive temper tantrums [stubborn, easily frustration or annoyed. The mechanisms of
      BHS are controversial. The most suggested cause of BHS is instability of the autonomic
      nervous system, inhibition of respiratory effort and cyanosis in cyanotic BHS and bradycardia
      or a brief asystole and cerebral hypoperfusion in pallid BHS. Iron deficiency anemia (IDA)
      has been widely regarded as a risk factor for BHS in nearly 50% of children due to reduced
      brain oxygenation [4]. It is generally agreed that the long-term prognosis is considered good
      [1]. There is no definite therapy for BHS. In children with low frequency spells, parental
      reassurance are just enough; however, high frequency spells may result in anxiety to the
      parents or fear from sudden death of the child or development of mental subnormality.
      Treatment of iron has been reported to result in reduction of the frequency of spells or its
      stoppage. Some reported improvement of BHS with piracetam [a nootropic drug known to increase
      brain oxygenation]. We did not find systematized published reports evaluating the
      effectiveness of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in reduction of spells frequency of cyanotic BHS
      or their stoppage.

          2. Children with parents who were wishing to provide treatment to their children.

          3. Failure of alternatives modalities of treatment (e.g. iron supplements, piracetam,
             non-specific vitamins, etc) (tried for ≥ 3 months) to reduce the frequency of spells
             or stop them.

          4. Follow-up for 6 months after starting treatment with valproic acid.

        Exclusion criteria:
