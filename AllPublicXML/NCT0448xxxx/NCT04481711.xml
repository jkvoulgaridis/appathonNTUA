  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Knee osteoarthritis is a common disease that causes pain and loss of function. Total Knee
      Arthroplasty (TKA) is a frequently used surgical method in the treatment of severe knee
      osteoarthritis. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of TKA on IL-6, TNF-α and
      IL-1β cytokine levels, pain intensity at rest and walking, knee joint valgity
      angle,malaligment, functional status and knee joint position sense.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twenty-nine patients (female/male: 24/5) with grade 4 osteoarthritis were included in the TKA
      group (study group) and 22 patients (female/male:13/9) with &lt;grade 4 osteoarthritis were
      included in the control group. Systemic venous blood samples of the patients were taken to
      evaluate the cytokine level (IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1). The Visual Analogue Scale was used to assess
      pain intensity, and the WOMAC (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis
      Index) score was used to evaluate the functional status. Valgity and malaligment measurements
      were calculated using antero-posterior X ray Digital goniometer was used to evaluate the knee
      joint position sense (at 35, 55 and 70 degrees knee flexion angles). Measurements were taken
      once from patients in the control group, and twice in pre-op and post-op sixth weeks from
      study group.

    <description>Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most common chronic peripheral joint diseases increasing among the aging population.Pathogenesis is not fully known.One of the most common risk factors and causes are loss of pain and function. Knee joint osteoarthritis adversly affects the person's life quality. Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) is a surgical approach to restore tibiofemoral joint alignment, especially in the severe level of knee OA.</description>
