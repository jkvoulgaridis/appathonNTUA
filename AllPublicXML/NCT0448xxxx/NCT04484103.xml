  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) can detect ISUP ≥2 prostate cancer with high
      sensitivity. Adding biopsies targeting suspicious lesions seen on mpMRI to the classical
      'systematic biopsies' (that sample the gland in a blinded way) improves the detection of ISUP
      ≥2 cancers. As a result, it is now recommended to perform a prostate mpMRI before biopsy and
      to combine targeted and systematic biopsy.

      However, mpMRI suffers from a lack of specificity. In a recent meta-analysis, the pooled
      sensitivity and specificity of prostate mpMRI for detecting ISUP ≥2 cancers were 0.91 (95%
      confidence interval, 0.83-0.95) and 0.37 (95% confidence interval, 0.29-0.46) respectively.
      Thus, accurate triage of patients suitable for biopsy might not be possible using mpMRI
      findings alone.

      The Rotterdam Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator (RPCRC) combines mpMRI results (Prostate
      Imaging-Reporting And Database System score) and basic clinical and biochemical data to
      predict the results of prostate biopsy. If validated, this tool could help selecting patients
      for prostate biopsy.

      In this study, the investigators propose to retrospectively use the data of the prospective
      multicentric MRI-FIRST trial (NCT0285379) to perform an external validation of the RPCRC.

      In addition, the PCaRisk study has two secondary objectives:

        -  To confirm that Prostate Specific Antigen density (i.e. PSA level divided by prostate
           volume) can stratify the risk of ISUP ≥2 cancer in patients with negative (PI-RADS 1-2)
           or inconclusive (PI-RADS 3) mpMRI, as suggested by recent literature

        -  To perform a preliminary evaluation of a lobe-specific risk calculator developed by our
           group and combining mpMRI results and clinical and biochemical data to predict the risk
           of ISUP ≥2 cancer at the lobe level.

    <intervention_name>Assessment of the diagnostic performance of the PI-RADS score (as a stand-alone) and of the RPCRC for predicting the presence of ISUP ≥2 prostate cancer at subsequent biopsy in 251 patients.</intervention_name>
    <description>The following features will be retrieved from the CRFs of the patients included in the MRI-FIRST trial: age, DRE findings, PSA level, prostate volume, maximal PI-RADS score; the history of biopsy will be set to a default value of &quot;none&quot; since all patients included in the MRI-FIRST trial were biopsy naïve.
Then, the RPCRC will be used to calculate two different risks: the risk of &quot;detectable prostate cancer&quot; and of &quot;significant prostate cancer&quot; (ISUP ≥2) at subsequent biopsy.
The PI-RADS score (as a stand-alone) and the risks predicted by the RPCC will be compared to the results of the prostate biopsy performed during the MRI-FIRST trial.
Throughout the study, the version 2 of the PI-RADS score will be used.</description>
