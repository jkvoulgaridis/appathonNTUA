  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized study, which anticipatedly recruited 60 patients in the
      outpatient department who need hemorrhoidectomy from January 2019 to December 2019. After
      obtaining those patients' consent in the clinic, they were randomly assigned to two groups at
      a 1:1 ratio using a computer-generated list of random numbers (Microsoft Excel). One group
      received Botulinum toxin injection during the outpatient clinic one week before the
      operation(experimental group, EG), and the other group received injection during the
      operation(control group, CG). The two groups were compared for the influence of postoperative
      pain control and wound healing rate.
