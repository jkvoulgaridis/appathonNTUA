  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The joint ESC/EAS guidelines for the management of dyslipidaemias recommend, for patients at
      low/moderate CV risk with raised LDL-C, a set of measures collectively defined as &quot;lifestyle
      interventions&quot;, with use of drugs only if the LDL-C levels cannot be controlled with such
      lifestyle interventions. &quot;Lifestyle interventions&quot; also includes food supplements. The reason
      is the following: a simple &quot;dietary advice&quot; has been shown (Cochrane review and
      meta-analysis, Rees et al, 2013) to achieve a modest reduction of total-C and LDL-C. The
      review reports: Dietary advice reduced total serum cholesterol by 0.15 mmol/L (95% CI 0.06 to
      0.23) and LDL cholesterol by 0.16 mmol/L (95% CI 0.08 to 0.24) after 3 to 24 months.&quot; An
      average reduction of LDL-C by 0.16 mmol/L (6.2 mg/dL) is definitely insufficient to control
      the level of LDL-C in those subjects. Therefore, those subjects would lose motivation to keep
      dieting. In this context, use of supplements would significantly amplify the result of diet.

      A significant proportion of ischemic cardiovascular events are believed to be supported by
      the coexistence of traditional cardiovascular risk factors such as diabetes, hypertension,
      dyslipidemia, smoking, and others. The aggregation of these factors is accompanied by a
      significant increase in the risk of cardiovascular events.

      Observational studies shown the existence of a relationship between cholesterolemia and
      coronary heart disease, clearly showing that subjects with even modestly increased total
      cholesterol values over time develop both fatal and non-fatal vascular events with a higher
      frequency compared to subjects with similar characteristics, but with lower basal values of
      cholesterol.

      Numerous controlled intervention studies, on the other hand, have shown that there is a close
      correlation between cholesterol reduction and cardiovascular risk; in fact, reductions in the
      plasma concentration of total and LDL-C, obtained through lifestyle modification or specific
      drugs, result in reductions in the incidence of major coronary events. The effectiveness of
      these interventions has been demonstrated both in subjects in primary prevention and in
      patients in secondary prevention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) has defined in the ATP III report the
      target values of LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) to be reached with interventions on food and / or
      pharmacological habits to perform an effective cardiovascular prevention.

      Although the atherogenic action of hypercholesterolemia is largely attributable to a direct
      damage action on the vascular endothelium, recent studies suggest that the activation of a
      low-grade systemic pro-inflammatory state, typical of the patient with cardiovascular risk
      factors, in turn would play a role in the determinism of endothelial damage and atheroma
      degeneration of the arteries. It is believed that the systemic inflammation, documented by
      the determination of some humoral signs of inflammation (e.g. C-reactive protein,
      interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha), may contribute to increase of cardiovascular
      risk; it also seems that elevated plasma levels of the aforementioned markers can exert a
      synergistic pro-atherogenic action with the various cardiovascular risk factors.

      The inflammatory state can modulate the atherosclerotic process at various levels,
      determining endothelial activation, promoting leukocyte chemotaxis in the sub-intimal space
      of the arterial wall and therefore the formation of an atheromatous plaque rich in
      inflammatory cells; the latter represents the lesion responsible for the vast majority of the
      coronary and cerebrovascular events observed in patients with cardiovascular risk factors.

      C-reactive protein (hsCRP) has been identified as an indicator of systemic inflammation and a
      predictor of cardiovascular risk. In the AFCAPS / TexCAPS study, subjects with normal LDL-C
      levels and low levels of HDL-C were shown to encounter a greater number of coronary ischemic
      events as baseline hsCRP levels increased. On the contrary, in the Justification for the Use
      of statins in Prevention-an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER), the
      treatment with rosuvastatin in subjects with high hsCRP was associated with a significant
      reduction of CV events even in patients with low LDL-C level.
