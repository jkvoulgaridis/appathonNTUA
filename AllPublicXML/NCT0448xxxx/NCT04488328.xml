      Objectives; This study was conducted to investigate the effect of pulsed magnetic therapy and
      aerobic exercise on post thyroidectomy osteoporosis.

      Methods; Forty-five female patients, age ranged from 40 to 50 years old with osteoporotic
      changes in hip and pelvic region post thyroidectomy, were included in this study. They were
      selected from Endocrinology private clinics. They were assigned randomly into three groups,
      equal in number. Magnetic Therapy Group (group A); patients received the routine medical
      treatment (Bisphosphonates, Calcium, and Vitamin D) in addition to pulsed magnetic therapy on
      the pelvic region for 12 weeks (3 sessions/ week). Exercise group(group B); patients received
      the routine medical treatment in addition to moderate-intensity aerobic exercise for 12 weeks
      (3 sessions/week). Combined Magnetic Therapy and Exercise Therapy group (group C): patients
      received the routine medical treatment in addition to pulsed magnetic therapy and
      moderate-intensity aerobic exercise for 12 weeks. Evaluation of the three groups was
      performed at baseline and after 12 weeks of treatment by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry
      (DEXA).
