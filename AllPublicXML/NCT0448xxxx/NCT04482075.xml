  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The association between pressure pain threshold and different aspects of low back pain has
      garnered attention over the years. However, since most of such studies in the past employed
      cross sectional designs, a longitudinal study design with follow-up measurements is required
      to further investigate this relationship. Studying this relationship will not only offer
      insights into the phenomenon of pain but may also bring us one step closer to achieving the
      seemingly insurmountable goal of objectively measuring back pain and its different
      dimensions.

      This study is aimed to investigate the relationship of pressure pain threshold (PPT) with
      pain intensity, pain affect and disability in patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP).
      Patients with chronic low back pain shall be the target population and shall be recruited
      through referrals from medical Out Patients Department of Institute of Physical Medicine &amp;
      Rehabilitation, Dow University of Health Sciences and Department of Rehabilitation Medicine
      PNS-Shifa Hospital, Karachi, Pakistan after initial screening in accordance with the
      inclusion and exclusion criteria. Screened patients shall then be briefed about the research
      project. After explaining the study objectives, procedures, potential benefits and
      discomforts, written informed consent shall be obtained from the patients. Only upon their
      agreement shall they become study participants and undergo assessments. The study
      participants shall receive handouts to document Depression and Anxiety, Pain Intensity, Pain
      Affect, and Disability. Pressure pain threshold (PPT) shall be measured using a manual
      Algometer. These measurements shall be followed by a session of physiotherapy treatment,
      after which Pain Intensity, Pain Affect, and Disability shall be recorded again.

    <measure>Pressure threshold meter</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Its a type of force gauge which consists of a rubber-tipped plunger with a surface area of usually 1cm square, connected to the force gauge (body) via a metal rod. The force gauge is usually calibrated in Newtons or Kilograms per cm2 with a range of up to 10 kgs. The exerted pressure on the plunger is transmitted to the gauge through the metal rod, which in turn moves the indicator needle in the clockwise direction with a magnitude corresponding to the force applied. The indicator needle remains in this position until the zeroing knob is pressed, which brings the needle back to its starting position. This allows the examiner to record the last reading of the pressure applied after removing the device from the body.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analogue scale (VAS) - pain intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Visual Analogue scale furnished with specific anchors to measure pain intensity. It is a continuous scale that is considered as a unidimensional measure of the pain experience. It consists of a 100 mm straight line, anchored by descriptors such as 'no pain at all' (0mm) and 'worst pain imaginable' (100mm) at both extremes. The respondent marks the line which corresponds to the current state of pain. Scoring is done with the help of a ruler and the whole process takes about a minute to complete. VAS demonstrates ratio-scale properties and it can be adapted to assess dimensions other than intensity such as unpleasantness (affective dimension) associated with pain.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analogue scale (VAS) - pain affect</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Visual analogue scale fine-tuned to measure pain affect with specific anchors. In general, the same technique used for assessing the pain intensity may be used to assess the pain affect. It consists of a 100 mm straight line, anchored by descriptors such as ''not bad at all'' (0mm) and ''the most unpleasant feeling possible for me'' (100mm) at both extremes. The respondent marks the line which corresponds to the current state of pain. Scoring is done with the help of a ruler and the whole process takes about a minute to complete.</description>

    <measure>Disability Rating Index (DRI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This article focuses on the Disability Rating Index (DRI), a patient-reported outcome measure developed by Salén et al. in 1994, with the aim of measuring the physical disability of respondents within a clinical setting. The DRI evaluates a respondent's disability by assessing activity and participation limitations. It covers 12 non-specific activities of daily life, each one self-rated on a visual analogue scale of 0-100 mm, providing a score of 0-100 for each activity, where 0 represents no difficulty in performing the specific task and 100 indicates an inability to perform the task at all.</description>

    <description>It's a four-level questionnaire to assess leisure-time physical activity (PA). It is anchored by descriptors such as &quot;physically inactive&quot; (0) and &quot;regular hard physical training for competitive sports&quot; (4).</description>

    <measure>Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This is a set of three self-report scales designed to measure the emotional states of depression, anxiety &amp; stress. The minimum score lies between 0 - 3 (normal) and the maximum score 14 and above (Extremely Severe). For Anxiety 0 - 3 (normal) and the maximum score 10 and above (Extremely Severe) and For Stress 0 - 7 (normal) and the maximum score 17 and above (Extremely Severe).</description>
