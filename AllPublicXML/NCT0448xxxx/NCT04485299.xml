      Aim of the study will be conducted to compare the efficacy of bifluoride (NaF and CaF) versus
      conventional fluoride varnish (Sodium Flouride) in the management of hypersensitivity of
      exposed cervical area in adult patients over 2 month

    <description>Bifluorid 10 (NaF and CaF) lead to reduce the dentin hypersensitivity, the sodium fluoride (NaF) dissociates and releases F ions, that diffuse through the tubules and then precipitates as calcium fluoride as a consequence of the high of calcium content in saliva and dentinal fluid ,The calcium fluoride (CaF) present in the varnish composition diffuses into the tubules and block the canal with a semi-permanent protective layer.The calcium fluoride is added to block the dentin tubules mechanically, by the combination with the calcium fluoride resulted from the sodium fluoride reaction to the calcium of dentin.</description>

    <description>Topical application of varnish fluoride (sodium fluoride NaF) effect on exposed dentine as a desensitizing agent, the varnish fluoride process is caused by the reaction between NaF and calcium ions resulting in calcium fluoride crystals being deposited on the openings of the dentinal tubules that decrease pain.</description>
