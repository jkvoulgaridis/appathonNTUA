  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 1 study is being conducted to evaluate the effect of severe renal impairment on
      the PK, safety and tolerability of Aztreonam-Avibactam. Results from this study along with
      previous renal impairment data from each of the Aztreonam-Avibactam components will be used
      to confirm the proposed dosing adjustment in severe renal impairment which was based on
      modelling/simulation.

             effective method(s) of contraception

          -  Stable renal function defined as &lt;/=25% difference between 2 measurements of eGFR
             obtained on 2 separate occasions during the screening period that are at least 72
             hours but no more than 14 days apart Specific Requirements for Healthy Subjects with
             Normal Renal Function

          -  Normal renal function (eGFR&gt;/= 80 mL/min) at Screening based on the Day -2 value,
             using the MDRD formula adjusting for BSA

             function Specific Requirements for Subjects with Severe Renal Impairment

          -  Good general health commensurate with the population with chronic kidney disease.
