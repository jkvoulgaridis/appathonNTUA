  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Drug coated balloon (DCB) is a relatively new technology which allows the treatment of
      coronary artery disease without permanent implantation of a metallic scaffold (stent) in the
      coronary artery. It is recommended by international guidelines for the treatment of in-stent
      restenosis (i.e. when a previously implanted stent in the coronary artery develops narrowings
      again). Data on patient outcomes of patients treated with DCB for de novo coronary artery
      disease (narrowings in artery supplying blood to the heart that has not been previously
      treated with a stent) are limited to relatively small studies. In our institution, DCBs have
      been used over the last 10 years and we have developed a large clinical database. We intend
      to compare the outcomes of all our patients treated clinically with DCB vs patients treated
      with drug eluting stent (DES). We will, incorporate all patients presenting either with
      myocardial infarction (heart attack) or stable angina. Our main outcomes will be: Primary 1)
      mortality Secondary 1) cardiac mortality 2) cardiac rehospitalisation3) composite of cardiac
      mortality and cardiac rehospitalisation

    <description>An MI is defined as per MINAP definition (a hospital diagnosis reported as a troponin positive MI). A TVR is defined as any repeat percutaneous intervention or surgical bypass of any segment of the target vessel. The latter is defined as the entire major coronary vessel proximal and distal to the target lesion, including upstream and downstream branches and the target lesion itself.
Acute vessel closure is defined as an event where a patient had to be taken back to cardiac catheterisation lab and require repeat angioplasty (during the same hospital stay) for a complete or partial occlusion of the artery due to a dissection.
A TLR is defined as any repeat percutaneous intervention of the target lesion or bypass surgery of the target vessel performed for restenosis or other complication of the target lesion. The target lesion is defined as the treated segment from 5 mm proximal and 5 mm distal to the treated lesion (by visual assessment).</description>
