  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Orthotic therapy or exercise therapy is the standard conservative treatment for flexible flat
      foot. Little is known about the effectiveness of their interaction on managing flatfoot.

      The study aims to evaluate the effect of insoles and short foot exercise on the height and
      area of the medial longitudinal arch of flexible flatfoot participants as well as the force
      and pressure.

      Study design: A parallel, active-control study design was used to conduct a single-blinded
      randomized controlled trial.

      Method: The toe rising test, the &quot;too many toes&quot; sign, and the navicular drop test was used
      to select 30 participants with flexible flatfoot. Participants was randomly assigned either
      to an experimental group (n = 15) or a control group (n = 15). The experimental group
      received short foot exercises (SFE) and insoles, and the control group received only insoles.
      SFE was implemented 30 times for a duration of three minutes each day over the course of six
      weeks. The exercise progressed from sitting to standing and finally to one leg stance
      position within every two weeks. The participants wore shoes containing orthotic insoles for
      eight hours per day for six weeks. The EMED-x system was used to measure plantar pressure
      distribution (force, area, and pressure) at baseline and at two-week intervals throughout the
      six-week intervention. The Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS) was used to evaluate
      restriction in participants' functional abilities, and the navicular drop test (NDT) was used
      to assess the medial longitudinal arch (MLA) height. Both variables were measured at baseline
      and at the sixth week.

      Statistics: Mixed-effects ANOVA was used to test for significant interactions between the two
      groups across time and within-subject observations of the outcomes.

    <description>The Lower extremities functional scale was used to evaluate restriction in participants' functional abilities, The score ranges from 0 to 80, and if it is higher indicating less functional restrictions. The navicular drop test was used to assess the medial longitudinal arch (MLA) height, A positive result for the navicular drop test is an arch height more than or equal to 10 mm. Both variables were measured at baseline and at the sixth week.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Females and males aged between 18 and 36

          -  Bilateral symptomatic flexible flatfoot, with symptoms including foot pain and lower
             limb fatigue

          -  Participants must show positive physical examination findings, including a positive
             result for the &quot;too many toes&quot; sign, the navicular drop test, and the foot toe raising
             test (Carr et al., 2016). A positive result for the &quot;too many toes&quot; sign occurs when
             more toes can be seen on the lateral side of each foot due to external rotation and
             abduction of the feet, and the positive result for the toe rising test is the
             reconstruction of the medial longitudinal arch secondary to the tightness of the
             plantar fascia (Carr et al., 2016). A positive result for the navicular drop test is
             an arch height more than or equal to 10 mm(Aenumulapalli et al., 2017)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  An anatomical discrepancy in leg length

          -  Pathologic or neurologic disorders of the feet

          -  A history of traumatic foot injury or surgery within the last six months

          -  History of wearing foot orthoses within the past two years
