  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Restylane® Skinboosters™ Vital (SBV) is a smooth formulation without particles, which helps
      it distribute evenly and smoothly under the skin to aid in rejuvenation. This feature makes
      RSV particularly well suited for more superficial injections, such as at the level of the
      dermis.

      SBV smooths fine lines and wrinkles and is intended to improve skin smoothness and
      appearance, as well as the elasticity and hydration of the skin in the face and dorsal hands.
      However, many clinicians have used SBV in other regions of the body. Given these attributes,
      SBV are particularly well suited for photo aged skin. A region that is susceptible to
      photo-ageing and may therefore benefit from the use of SBV is the décolletage. Photodamaged
      skin of the chest is characterized by atrophy, skin laxity, fine lines and wrinkles,
      dehydration and tactile roughness. Therefore, SBV may help to improve these signs of aging in
      the décolletage region.

      Study Aim: To investigate the effectiveness and tolerability of SBV for rejuvenation of the
      décolletage region.
