  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rh negative blood group is a rare blood group in China, as it only accounts for 0.3-0.4
      percent of the Han population. Therefore, low inventory is often found in blood collection
      and supply agencies in many regions in China. On July 22, 2020 blood stockpile of O-negative
      and A-negative in Guangzhou Blood Center reached the warning line, and we took measures for
      emergency recruitment. O-negative and A-negative blood donors whose last donation dates were
      between January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2019 were identified and randomly assigned to four
      groups. Three different recruitment text messages were send three groups. We observed the
      re-donation rates among four groups within one week.
