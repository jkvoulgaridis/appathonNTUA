  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 3-part, first-in-human study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and
      pharmacokinetics of escalating doses of XNW4107 given as intravenous (IV) infusion in healthy
      male subjects. In part 1, subjects will receive a single dose of XNW4107. In part 2, subjects
      will receive XNW4107 for 7 days. In Part 3, subjects will receive XNW4107 in combination with
      imipenem/cilastatin for 14 days.
