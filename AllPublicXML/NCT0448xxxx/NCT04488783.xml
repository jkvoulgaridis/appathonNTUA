  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glioblastoma (GB) is the most common and aggressive type of primary malignant brain tumor in
      adults. Despite advances in surgical resection, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, prognosis
      remains very poor. Temozolomide (TMZ) as an alkylating agent has become part of GBM
      management but it has contributed only marginally to prolongation of life in GBM patients.
      Our aim is to evaluate the therapeutic potential of the trace element zinc to facilitate
      temozolomide tumor cell toxicity in GBM. P53 gene is inactive/mutant in most of these
      patients which may affect the resistance to apoptosis of tumor cells by chemotherapy. Zinc
      (Zn) has a crucial role in the biology of p53, in that p53 binds to DNA through a
      structurally complex domain stabilized by zinc atom. We have shown that the cytotoxic
      activity of TMZ is substantially increased with the addition of zinc in vitro with GBM cell
      lines as well as in vivo, with intracranial GBM xenografts. Numerous studies of zinc in
      animal models and in human subjects support its use in the treatment and possibly the
      prevention of cancer. Zinc has been consumed by the public as an essential mineral (and thus
      is category A drug) in concentrations which allows this effect with Temozolomide. Vitamin C
      could add to this by priming the immune system for lymphocyte- linked cancer killing. The
      vitamin c increases the number of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and enhances the activation
      of the immune system.We propose a single arm phase II clinical trial in 30 newly diagnosed
      GBM patients who will be treated with the standard chemo-radiotherapy with the addition of
      zinc and vitamin C.

      We propose a single arm phase II clinical trial in 30 newly diagnosed GBM patients who will
      be treated with the standard chemo-radiotherapy with the addition of daily zinc. We will
      follow the toxicity, Progression free survival and overall survival of this group of
      patients. We hope to demonstrate the anti-tumor activity of zinc that will enhance the
      activity of temozolomide chemotherapy in adult glioblastoma patients. We will also follow the
      safety and monitor quality of life during treatment. In this study, we will compare results
      of patients receiving zinc to historical patient data. We will review patient portfolios with
      GB tumors that received treatment as the subjects in this study in the last five years before
      the study began. Collecting the data and separating the identified data from the file in a
      way that cannot be retrieved in any way will be done by a staff member from Dr Ruty Shai's
      laboratory who is authorized to open medical files. We will adjust the age and number of
      patients in each gender. Data collected: date of birth, age of disease development, gender,
      data after receiving treatment: Progression free survival and overall survival of this group
      of patients, side effects, and quality of life.
