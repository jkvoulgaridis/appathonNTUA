    <textblock>
      Primary aim of this study is to evaluate postural equilibrium and risk of falls during
      pregnancy by comparing static postural stability between pregnant and non-pregnant control
      women. Secondary aim is to find out predisposing factors of falling during pregnancy using by
      validated questionnaires focused on exercise activities and self-evaluation of postural
      stability. The investigators also determine level of vitamin D in the blood.

    <textblock>
      Several hormonal, anatomical and physiological changes occur in the female body during
      pregnancy. These changes caused by pregnancy include significant weight gain, increased
      ligamentous laxity and spinal lordosis, decreased neuromuscular control and abdominal muscle
      strength, altered biomechanics and an anterior shift in the location of the centre of mass.
      These alteration of pregnant woman body can lead to balance problems.

      Falls during pregnancy are very common. Pregnant women especially in advanced stage of
      pregnancy are at higher risk of falling compared to non-pregnant women. Falls during
      pregnancy may cause maternal injuries such as bone fractures, joint sprains, muscle strains,
      head injury, rupture of internal organs, abruptio placentae, rupture of the uterus and
      membranes and occasionally maternal death or intrauterine fetal demise. Pregnant women are
      hospitalized due to a fall 2,3 times more than non-pregnant reproductive-aged women.

      There is few evidence in a literature about postural stability but not about risk factors,
      that caused stability disorders. By determination of risk factors, the investigators can
      reduce number of falls in pregnancy.
