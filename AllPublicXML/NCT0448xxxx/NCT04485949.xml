    <measure>Change From Baseline in Participant-reported Quality of Life (QoL) Questionnaires Based on European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Lif questionnaire (QLQ) -C30 Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 36</time_frame>
    <description>EORTC QLQ-C30 contains 30 items across 5 functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), 9 symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain, dyspnea, sleep disturbance, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties) and a global health status/QOL scale. EORTC QLQ-C30 contains 28 questions (4-point scale where 1=Not at all [best] to 4=Very Much [worst]) and 2 questions (7-point scale where 1=Very poor [worst] to 7= Excellent [best]). Raw scores are converted into scale scores ranging from 0 to 100. For the functional scales and the global health status/QOL scale, higher scores represent better QOL; for the symptom scales, lower scores represent better QOL.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Participant-reported QoL Questionnaires Based on EORTC QLQ Brain Module (EORTC QLQ-BN20) Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 36</time_frame>
    <description>The QLQ-BN20 is a questionnaire specifically designed as the QLQ-C30 supplement for the evaluation of quality of life in brain tumor participants. It includes 4 multi-item sub-scales: future uncertainty, visual disorder, motor dysfunction, communication deficits, and 7 single-item scales: headaches, seizures, drowsiness, itchy skin, hair loss, weakness of legs, and bladder control. All items are rated on a 4-point Likert-type scale ('1=not at all', '2=a little', '3=quite a bit' and '4=very much'), and are linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale, with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 36</time_frame>
    <description>The MMSE is an instrument used to assess a participant's global cognitive function. The MMSE assesses orientation to time and place, immediate and delayed recall of words, attention and calculation, language (naming, comprehension and repetition), and spatial ability (copying a figure). The range for MMSE total Score is 0 to 30, with a higher score indicating better cognitive performance.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Definitive Deterioration Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline until KPS deterioration (up to 36 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Time to KPS deterioration was defined as the time from screening to the first date of deterioration of the KPS score. Deterioration of KPS is defined as a stable or increasing steroid dose-dependent stabilization of a KPS score of &lt;70 over 2 consecutive visits no more than 2 months apart. KPS is an 11-level score which ranges between 0 (death) to 100 (complete healthy status); a higher score represents a higher ability to perform daily tasks.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months or until the last progression visit, whichever comes first</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. AEs will be graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 5.0 from mild (Grade 1) to death (Grade 5). SAE is an AE or adverse reaction which is considered serious if it results in any of the following outcomes: death, life-threatening AE, require hospitalizations or prolongation of hospitalizations, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect and is a medically important event.</description>
