      A single arm study evaluating the continued efficacy, safety and tolerability of ofatumumab
      in patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis who are transitioning from aCD20 mAb therapy
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm multi-center, study in approximately 100 participants with relapsing
      multiple sclerosis who were previously treated with aCD20 mAb therapy. Eligible participants
      will receive open label ofatumumab 20 mg subcutaneous every 4 weeks for 12 months following
      initial loading regimen of 20 milligrams subcutaneous doses on Days 1, 7 and 14. Assessments
      will include but are not limited to Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) assessed for quality by
      central reading center, multiple Patient Reported Outcome measurements and safety
      assessments..Participants that do not continue onto commercial ofatumumab or another therapy
      within one month of the End of Study Visit must continue into the safety Follow Up phase,
      consisting of every 3 month visits including B cell monitoring until they are able to start
      on commercial ofatumumab or switch to another therapy or until their B cells are repleted
      defined as a B cell concentration greater than the individual participant's baseline value or
      greater than the lower limit of normal. All participants will have a safety follow-up phone
      call at 30 days post study.

    <description>The Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM-9) will be used to evaluate the participants' satisfaction with Ofatumumab. The TSQM-9 is a psychometrically sound and valid participant reported outcome to measure participants' satisfaction with medication and a good predictor of adherence across different types of medication and participant population. The TSQM-9 is a 9 item questionnaire having a global satisfaction score ranging from 0-100. The questionnaire consists of 3 domains: satisfaction, convenience and effectiveness (3 items each). The domain scores range from 0 to 100 with higher scores representing higher satisfaction on that domain.</description>

             tuberculosis, even if previously treated).

             Testing for syphilis and tuberculosis will be done at Screening. Testing must be done
             by the central lab (for syphilis e.g. by positive rapid plasma reagin (RPR); for
             tuberculosis testing, QuantiFERONÂ®-TB Gold test to assess participant's eligibility at

               -  anti-HBs negative and Anti-HBc positive

               -  anti-HC IgG (if positive IgG, HCV-RNA PCR will be performed and if negative,
                  participant can be enrolled)

               -  anti-HE IgM (if positive IgG and/or IgM, perform HE-RNA PCR and if negative,
                  participant can be enrolled) NOTE: If the Investigator suspects false positive
                  hepatitis serology results, such as an antibody pattern indicating acute
                  hepatitis infection but no corresponding elevated liver enzymes and no signs or
                  symptoms of liver disease, an infectious disease expert may be consulted. If the
                  infectious disease expert finds no evidence of acute or chronic hepatitis
                  infection and considers the serology results false positive and not clinically
                  relevant, the Investigator must document (in source data and as a comment in the
                  eCRF) that the serology results are considered false positive and may then enroll
                  the participant.

             first study drug administration
