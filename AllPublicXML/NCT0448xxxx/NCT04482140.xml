      Single arm study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Genta-Foil resorb® for the prevention
      of tissue adhesions

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is primarily to collect clinical follow up data on the performance
      and safety of the device, as CE marking was based on equivalence. The data and conclusions
      obtained from this study will be used to provide clinical evidence for the clinical
      evaluation process.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Restoration of hand mobility</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 30 days post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Restoration of hand mobility will be assessed using Tendon Total Active Motion (TAM). Restriction of TAM post-surgery is indicative of tissue adhesions, therefore this measure (when compared with the unaffected contralateral finger(s)) will demonstrate presence / absence of of tissue adhesions.</description>

    <measure>Wound closure without complications (number of patients without complications)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 30 days post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Surgical wound will be assessed by the investigator for dehiscence. Wound dehiscence will be classified as any separation of the apposed edges of the surgical wound (epidermis, dermis or subcutaneous layers).</description>

    <arm_group_label>Genta-Foil resorb</arm_group_label>
    <description>Genta-Foil resorb® is a transparent collagen foil that forms a temporary barrier between the functional structures during the critical phase of wound healing. As a result, the ability of the tissue layers to slide against each other is retained. The absorbability of equine collagen means the foil can be left in place and does not require removal. The addition of the antibiotic Gentamicin is for self-protection since collagen implants are prone to bacterial contamination.</description>
