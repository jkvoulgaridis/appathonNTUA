  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to describe the safety profile of fingolimod in the Taiwanese
      multiple sclerosis population. This study aims to collect the safety data in patients newly
      initiated on fingolimod for one year.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 12-month, prospective, interventional, multi-center study to monitor safety in
      adult patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) in Taiwan who based on
      local practice are newly starting fingolimod at the time of study entry.

      Thirty-four patients will be included in this study in line with the study inclusion and
      exclusion criteria. After entering this study, the participants will continue to be treated
      for MS based on local practice. The patient will be taking fingolimod 0.5mg per day.
      Protocol-mandated procedures and visits for safety data collection will be conducted in
      addition to the required examinations according to the clinical practice.

      If a patient experienced an interruption of fingolimod treatment that requires a
      re-evaluation of FDO, the patient will be discontinued from the study. If the treatment
      interruption does not require a FDO when re-starting fingolimod, the patient can continue to
      participate in this study.

    <time_frame>Baseline up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The adverse events of special interest (AESI) include macular edema, abnormal liver function(ALT, AST or GGT &gt; 5x upper normal limit), and severe lymphocytopenia(lymphocyte &lt; 200 cells/μL).</description>

    <measure>Annualized relapse reate (ARR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The ARR will be calculated as total number of relapses experienced divided by total number of days of follow-up, and the ratio multiplied by 365. For patients withdraw from the study or switch to an alternative MS therapy prior to 12 month, the total number of days in study is defined as the number of days from baseline to the last date in study.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline of Pulse (beats/min)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Pulse (beats/min - bpm) data will be summarized as descriptive statistics for change from baseline value (both for the period 6-hours post first dose and for further visit assessments). The frequency and percentage of notable vital sign abnormalities will be summarized. Notable criteria for pulse is &gt; 120bpm or Increase of ≥15 bpm from baseline Or &lt; 50bpm or Decrease of ≥15 bpm from baseline</description>

    <description>Blood pressure(BP)(mmHg) data will be summarized as descriptive statistics for change from baseline value (both for the period 6-hours post first dose and for further visit assessments). The frequency and percentage of notable vital sign abnormalities will be summarized. Notable criteria for systolic BP is ≥160 mm Hg or Increase of ≥20 mm Hg from baseline Or ≤ 90 mm Hg or Decrease of ≥ 20 mm Hg from baseline. Notable criteria for diastolic BP is ≥ 100 mmHg or Increase of ≥ 15 mm Hg from baseline Or ≤ 50 mmHg or Decrease of ≥ 15 mm Hg from baseline.</description>
