  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A phase I trial to determine the safety of delivering three sequentially shorter RT schedules
      (20, 16, and 12 fractions) of HypoFx pelvic nodal RT in combination with a HypoFx,
      simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) to the prostate that have been designed to incrementally
      increased the biological equivalent dose (BED) to prostate cancer, while maintaining a
      constant BED to normal tissue toxicity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Outcomes for patients with unfavorable intermediate-risk and high-risk prostate cancer (PC)
      have been historically poor and are now known to require multimodality treatment. A standard
      non-surgical treatment option for patients with localized, intermediate and high-risk PC is
      radiation therapy (RT) in combination with short- or long-term androgen deprivation therapy
      (ADT).

      The benefit of pelvic nodal RT in this setting is unclear, previous studies have been
      equivocal. There is a growing body of evidence to demonstrate that use of hypofractionated
      (HypoFx) RT may be a safe method for increasing the dose of RT, while also decreasing normal
      tissue toxicity.

    <intervention_model_description>A modified 3+3 study design will be employed to determine the dose-fractionation schedule that results in less than 33% dose limiting toxicity. One de-escalation will be allowed if the initial dose-fractionation schedule results in too high a frequency of dose limiting toxicities. A total of 6 patients will be treated following the dose-fractionation schedule that is recommended for further study.</intervention_model_description>
