    <textblock>
      This is a open-labeled, single-arm, Investigator-initiated clinical trial of camrelizumab (an
      anti-PD-1 antibody) in combination with radiotherapy in patients with early triple-negative
      breast cancer. We will enroll 60 subjects. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of camrelizumab combined with radiotherapy in the treatment of early TNBC。

             problems, etc., the investigator judged that the patient was not suitable for
