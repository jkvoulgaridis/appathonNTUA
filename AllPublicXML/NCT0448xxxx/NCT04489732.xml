  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, non-randomized, Phase I dose escalation study to assess the safety
      and tolerability of a single dose of autologous, bone marrow-derived, interferon
      gamma-stimulated Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) injected into the submandibular glands of
      patients with radiation-induced xerostomia (dry mouth) following treatment for head and neck
      cancer (HNC).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following enrollment in the study, patients with radiation-induced xerostomia will undergo
      bone marrow aspirate in order to obtain autologous MSCs. In a Current Good Manufacturing
      Practices (cGMP)-compliant cell manufacturing facility, the bone-marrow derived MSCs will be
      stimulated with interferon gamma and increased in number (i.e., expanded) prior to
      cryopreservation. After thawing and recovery in culture, a single dose of MSCs will be
      injected into the submandibular glands under local anesthesia. The safety and tolerability of
      MSC injection will be assessed and changes in quality of life and production of saliva will
      also be evaluated.
