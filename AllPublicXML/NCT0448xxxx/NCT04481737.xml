  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adults with serious mental illness (SMI) are disproportionately affected by medical
      comorbidity, earlier onset of disease, and 10 to 25 years reduced life expectancy compared to
      the general population. These high rates of morbidity and early mortality are associated with
      inadequately managed medical and psychiatric illnesses. A recent systematic review found nine
      effective self-management interventions that address medical and psychiatric illnesses in
      adults with SMI. However, there has been limited adoption of these interventions due to both
      provider and consumer-based factors. Provider-based barriers consist of the lack of an
      adequate workforce with the capacity, time, and knowledge of effective approaches to
      self-management support for adults with SMI and chronic health conditions. Consumer-based
      barriers associated with limited participation in self-management programs include lack of
      access, engagement, and ongoing community-based support for persons with SMI. Peer support
      specialists have the potential to address these barriers as they comprise one of the fastest
      growing sectors of the mental health workforce, have &quot;lived experience&quot; in self-management
      practices, and offer access to support in the community. However, challenges need to be
      resolved for peers to be effective providers of evidence-based interventions. For example,
      peers are frequently trained to provide &quot;peer support&quot; described as &quot;giving and receiving
      help founded on key principles of respect, shared responsibility, and mutual agreement of
      what is helpful&quot;. Peer support has been associated with increased sense of control, ability
      to make changes, and decreased psychiatric symptoms. Despite benefits, peer support does not
      adhere to evidence-based practices for psychiatric and medical self-management and does not
      follow protocols that ensure fidelity and systematically monitor outcomes. The investigators
      hypothesize that mobile technology has the potential to overcome these limitations of peer
      support by providing real-time guidance in fidelity adherent delivery of a peer-delivered,
      technology-assisted evidence-based self-management intervention (PDTA-IIMR). The investigator
      will build the necessary expertise to pursue a career developing and testing novel approaches
      to peer-delivered evidence-based self-management interventions. Training will include:
      development of peer-delivered interventions; development and design of mobile
      health-supported interventions; and intervention clinical trials research. Concurrently, this
      study includes refinement of the intervention protocol with input from peers and consumers
      and conducting a pilot study evaluating the feasibility and potential effectiveness of
      PDTA-IIMR compared to routine peer support for N=6 peers and N=40 adults with SMI and chronic
      health conditions. Outcomes include feasibility, medical and psychiatric self-management
      skills, functional ability, and mortality risk factors and examine self-efficacy and social
      support as mechanisms on outcomes.
