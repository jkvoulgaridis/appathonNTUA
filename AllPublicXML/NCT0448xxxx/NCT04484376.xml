  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Invasive fungal disease in the critically ill patient is a serious complication that
      increases hospitalization times, morbidity and mortality, and healthcare costs.

      Our team proposes a retrospective observational study of patients from the resuscitation unit
      of the Hospital la Fe who during the years 2016-2019 presented invasive candidiasis. We
      intend to detect if there are possible specific risk factors that favor the development of
      invasive candidiasis in colonized patients and if these associated risk factors could be
      considered as 'triggers' or alerts for the implementation of specific care in these patients.

      To do this, we intend to study the blood samples taken from our patients, taking into account
      different types of perioperative variables from them, which will be statistically analyzed,
      so that evidence-based inferences can be drawn to demonstrate our hypothesis.

      Our hypothesis is that there are factors predisposing to the development of invasive fungal
      disease, invasive candidiasis, and that the detection of these factors may allow detecting
      the population at risk and implementing both pharmacological measures and general strategies
      to reduce the mortality of fungal infection.

      Primary objective: The objective of our study is to determine the risk factors for mortality
      in the invasive fungal disease, including the species of candida that causes this disease.

      Secondary objectives:

      Determination of predictors of mortality in invasive fungal disease Prepare and validate a
      score in our environment that allows discriminating those patients with a high risk of
      mortality.

      To analyze the pharmacological management that has been carried out in patients who develop
      candidemia due to auris.

      Detect hospital stays of both population groups, in terms of health management.

      Type of study: observational, longitudinal, and retrospective study of cases and controls of
      a selected exposed population that developed the disease over time or not.
