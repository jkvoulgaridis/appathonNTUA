  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is intended to investigate the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and
      pharmacodynamics (PD) of AZD2693, following subcutaneous (SC) administration of multiple
      ascending doses in patients with Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) with fibrosis Stage 1
      to 3 and homozygous for the PNPLA3 148M risk allele.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a double blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, multi-centre study in
      participants with definitive NASH (NASH activity score [NAS] ≥4 diagnosed by biopsy, and a
      fibrosis grade of F1 to F3) and homozygous for the PNPLA3 148M risk allele.

      The study will comprise of:

        1. A Screening Period with a maximum of 90 days.

        2. An 8-week dosing period during which participants will be resident of the study site for
           Dose 1 and Dose 3. Dose 1 will have participants reside at the study site from the day
           prior to study intervention administration (Day -1) until at least 2 days after study
           intervention administration with discharge on Day 3. Dose 2 will be administered at the
           study site on Day 29 with no overnight stay. Dose 3 will have participants reside at the
           study site from the day prior to study intervention administration (Day 56) until at
           least 2 days after study intervention administration with discharge on Day 59. Dose 1
           and Dose 3 dosing will be delivered after a 10 hour fast.

        3. Each participant will be followed for 15 weeks post last dose (approximately 5× t½; t½
           is estimated to approximately 22 days); however, the length of follow-up may be
           shortened or extended if the actual , t½ is considerably shorter or longer than
           predicted.

      The study will be performed at approximately 10 to 15 study sites in the United States (US).
      Up to 60 male and female participants of non-childbearing potential will be randomised into
      the first 3 cohorts of this study in order to achieve 52 evaluable participants.

             of F1, F2, or F3 according to the NASH clinical research network (NASH CRN) staging

          -  History of major bleed or high-risk of bleeding diathesis.

          -  Changes to any concomitant medication (initiation, dose change, or cessation) that may
             impact the study readouts (as judged by the investigator) within 1 month prior to the
