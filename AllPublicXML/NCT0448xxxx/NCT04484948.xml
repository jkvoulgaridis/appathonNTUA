      This study aims to evaluate the utility of breath-holding test as a marker of pulmonary
      disease severity in patients with systemic sclerosis.

    <textblock>
      Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a chronic autoimmune disease of unknown etiology with high
      morbidity and mortality. SSc manifests by fibrosis of skin and internal organs. Although the
      underlying mechanisms are still subject to investigation, endothelial dysfunction and
      abnormal immune response are thought to contribute to vascular dysfunction and fibrosis in
      SSc.

      Pulmonary involvement, such as pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and interstitial lung
      disease (ILD) is a major cause of death in SSc. Although the 6MWT is generally used for
      evaluating PAH and ILD, the utility in SSc is undetermined. Several investigators have found
      weak or moderate correlations of 6MWT in pulmonary involvement in SSc. The 6MWT is influenced
      by the status of all organ systems involved in exercise (pulmonary, cardiac, peripheral
      vascular, neuromuscular unit and muscle metabolism) as well as by specifics of test
      conditions. There is a pressing need for new, practical method which corroborates the current
      6MWT for the evaluation of pulmonary disease severity in SSc.

      Breath-holding test (BHT) is one of the most useful methods for assessing the sensitivity of
      peripheral chemoreflex. Recent studies have demonstrated that BHT was correlated to pulmonary
      function test. BHT can be safely conducted and doctors handle a medical emergency during test
      easily as well. Therefore, this study evaluates the utility of BHT as surrogate marker of
      pulmonary involvement in patients with SSc.

    <intervention_name>Questionnaire for dyspnea, breath-holding test, and 6 minute walk test</intervention_name>
    <description>Participants will perform the questionnaires (the Borg scale, and scleroderma health assessment questionnaire (SHAQ)).
Breath-holding test and 6 min walking test will be performed in the randomized way for each participant.
For breath-holding test, the participants will be told to sit comfortably on a chair, and breath normally. After 1 minute, they were required to make a maximum expiration followed by a maximum inspiration and to hold the breath as long as possible at maximum inspiratory level. This procedure was repeated three times, with 5-minute intervals between the tests.
Six minute walking test will be performed according to the American Thoracic Society guidelines.
Information on chest x-ray, echocardiography, and pulmonary function test (FVC%, DLCO%) will be obtained from the medical record if the data was obtained within 3 months. If not, the tests will be performed.</description>
