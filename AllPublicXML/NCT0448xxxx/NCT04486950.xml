  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the overall safety and tolerability of a single
      intravenous infusion of TAK-951 administered with at least 2 different infusion rates (rapid
      and slow) at the same dose level in healthy participants.

      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-951. The study will evaluate the safety,
      tolerability and PK of TAK-951 in healthy participants.

      The study will enroll approximately 40 healthy participants. Each cohort will have 8
      participants to be randomized and a minimum of 3 cohorts will be evaluated. Participants will
      be randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to receive TAK-951 or placebo in a 6:2
      ratio in one of the following 3 cohorts, which will remain undisclosed to the participant and
      study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need):

        -  Cohort 1 (Low Dose): TAK-951 20 mcg Infusion Over 60 Minutes

        -  Cohort 2 (High Dose): TAK-951 TBD Infusion Over 60 Minutes

        -  Cohort 3 (High Dose): TAK-951 TBD Infusion for &lt;60 Minutes

      Sentinel dosing will be done in first 2 participants in each cohort. The dosing in rest of
      the cohort will done if there are no significant safety or tolerability concerns. Additional
      2 cohorts may be added in study to evaluate additional intravenous dosing regimen after
      analysis of first 3 cohorts. Dosing of the subsequent cohort will be based on the analysis of
      the previous cohort's data.

      This single-center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to
      participate in this study is up to 57 days. All participants will return to clinic after 14
      and 28 days after the last visit to the clinic for a follow-up assessment.
