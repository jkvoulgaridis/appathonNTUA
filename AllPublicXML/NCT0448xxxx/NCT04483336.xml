  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the effect of virtual reality (VR) distraction on anxiety and pain during buccal
      infiltration anesthesia (BIA) in pediatric patients.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Design and Participants: This randomized clinical trial was conducted including healthy, and
      cooperative 6-12-year-old children, with no known allergy and/or sensitivity to local
      anesthesia who are currently in need of nonemergency dental treatment under local anesthetic
      infiltration by one of the postgraduate or interns at the pediatric dentistry students, were
      eligible for the study. Patients with history of epilepsy and anxiety disorder were excluded
      from the study

      Methods and Material: In the test group, subjects received BIA while being distracted using
      VR goggles; in the control group, subjects watched a cartoon video on a regular screen.
      Subjects' heart rate (HR) was measured at baseline and at four different timepoints during
      BIA administration to assess anxiety. The face, legs, activity, cry, consolability (FLACC)
      Behavioral Pain Assessment Scale was scored by two calibrated investigators to assess pain.
      After BIA, subjects rated their pain using the Arabic version of Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating
      Scale.

    <masking>Single (Investigator)</masking>
    <masking_description>During the local anesthesia by the care provider, subjects in the test group had to wear VR goggles while control subjects watched a cartoon video on a TV screen. The pain and anxiety outcomes were assessed during the local anesthesia administration. Due to the nature of the study, it was not possible to mask the participants, care provider, or the outcome assessor. The investigator who statistically analyzed the data but was not involved in the dental procedures was masked to the group allocation.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Dental Pain measured using the Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after the local anesthesia administration, subjects were put in an upright position and asked to rate their pain using a validated Arabic version of Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale.</time_frame>
    <description>Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale is a six point scale (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10) where higher scores indicate worse pain.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Dental Pain and Behavior measured using Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability (FLACC ) Behavioral Pain Assessment Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Throughout the procedure of local anesthesia administration (which is approximately 8 minutes long), FLACC Scale was recorded by two trained and calibrated investigators independently.</time_frame>
    <description>Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability (FLACC ) Behavioral Pain Assessment Scale scores range from 0 to 10 where higher scores indicate more severe pain and discomfort.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Heart Rate(HR)</measure>
    <time_frame>HR was recorded 5 times: 1) once subject is on the dental chair; 2) video on (about 3 min later); 3) topical anesthesia (about 2 min later); 4) needle insertion (about 2 min later); 5) immediately after local anesthesia is complete (about 1 min later).</time_frame>
