  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A significant number of patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) and non-small cell
      lung cancer (NSCLC) are not cured with available treatments and will eventually relapse.
      After relapse treatment options are limited. Preclinical in vitro studies have demonstrated a
      synergism of immunotherapy with PD(L)1-targeting monoclonal antibodies and gemcitabine and
      ongoing clinical studies showed encouraging results.

      The main objective of this trial is to determine the efficacy of chemotherapy (gemcitabine)
      combined with immunotherapy (atezolizumab) in patients with progressive NSCLC and MPM.

      The trial treatments will be continued for max. 2 years or until discontinuation criteria are
      met. The follow-up phase will last up to 5 years from treatment start.

      The trial combines two (Gemcitabine and Atezolizumab). Gemcitabine, alone or in combination
      regimens is a standard of care for several solid tumors, such as advanced or metastatic
      NSCLC. It is also used in an off-label setting for pre-treated MPM or naïve MPM in
      combination with platin-chemotherapy.

      Atezolizumab is approved in the United States, European Union and in Switzerland for the
      treatment of NSCLC, urothelial carcinoma, small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and triple-negative
      breast cancer (TNBC) patients.

      A significant number of patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) and non-small cell
      lung cancer (NSCLC) are not cured with available treatments and will eventually relapse.
      After relapse treatment options are limited. Preclinical in vitro studies have demonstrated a
      synergism of immunotherapy with PD(L)1-targeting monoclonal antibodies and gemcitabine
      administered in different tumors models and ongoing clinical studies showed encouraging
      results. This may represent a safe and effective therapy for patients who relapsed or did not
      respond to standard therapies.

      Patients will be treated with gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2 i.v. on day 1 and day 8 of each cycle,
      (every 3 weeks) and with atezolizumab (1200 mg i.v. on day 1 of each cycle, (every 3 weeks).
      The trial treatments will be continued for max. 2 years or until discontinuation criteria are
      met. The follow-up phase will last up to 5 years from treatment start.

      The main objective of this trial is to determine the efficacy of chemotherapy (gemcitabine)
      combined with immunotherapy (atezolizumab) in patients with progressive NSCLC and MPM.
