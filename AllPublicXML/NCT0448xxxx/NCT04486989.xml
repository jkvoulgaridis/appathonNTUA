  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Teachers are a population at high risk for voice disorders given their occupational demands.
      In a teaching career, a common debilitating symptom among all vocal symptoms experienced is -
      vocal fatigue, impacting teachers' occupational performance and increasing health care costs.
      It is therefore essential to identify potential treatment options to alleviate the symptom of
      vocal fatigue. The purpose of this study is to utilize a body-system level cardiovascular
      training protocol in comparison to traditional voice production training to alleviate the
      symptoms of vocal fatigue.
