  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently, kinesiology tape is a common intervention in clinic and sport. According to the
      theory mentioned by the founder (Dr. Kenzo Kase), the elasticity of kinesiology tape has
      different effects from different taping skill. For muscle and fascia, taping could promote or
      inhibit contraction of muscle. For skeletal system, the intervention could correct posture
      and improve movement pattern through limiting joint mobility. For swelling, it may increase
      circulation of lymph during acute stage. However, whether these theories are feasible are
      still controversial in most studies.

      The differences between results may be related to the high heterogeneity of taping method and
      outcome measures. On the other hand, there are lack of studies with high quality. The
      differences of taping method and skill should be considered for investigating the effect of
      kinesiology tape. And the performance of muscle contraction should be assessed by accurate
      instruments.

      Double-blind and crossover study design will be used in this study. The taping method is
      divided into 4 types: Tradition (from origin to insertion), Cross, New (from insertion to
      origin) and Control (non-taping). The order of types will be assigned to subjects randomly.
      The 4 types of taping will be applied in 2 days that one week apart. Ultimate physical
      rehabilitation system (Pris RS, BTE, USA) will be used to access the differences of muscle
      strength and muscular endurance between different taping skills. The aims are to investigate
      the effect of the different method of kinesiology tape on performance of fatigued biceps
      brachii.
