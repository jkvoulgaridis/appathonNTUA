  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The comfort and fit of the residual limb within a prosthetic socket are of primary concern
      for many amputees. The residual limb is typically covered by non-breathable and non-
      thermally conductive materials that can create a warm and ultimately moist environment.

      To address this, Liberating Technologies, Inc. (LTI) and Vivonics, Inc. have developed a
      thermo-electric cooling (TEC)-based module called the Intrasocket Cooling Element (ICE), that
      can be embedded into the prosthesis in order to cool the residual limb. A technology that can
      provide thermal control while retaining adequate suspension, weight and other prosthetic
      characteristics would benefit many prosthesis wearers.

      The comfort and fit of the residual limb within a prosthetic socket are of primary concern
      for many amputees. The residual limb is typically covered by non-breathable and non-
      thermally conductive materials that can create a warm and ultimately moist environment.
      Studies found increases in socket temperature after the prosthesis was donned (0.8 degrees C)
      and after 30 minutes of walking (2.5 degrees C). Temperatures were found to remain elevated
      long after activity cessation and even a rest period of double the duration of the preceding
      activity period is insufficient to return the limb to its initial temperature. A study
      suggested that a modest temperature increase of only 2 degrees C may be responsible for
      reports of thermal discomfort by amputees. Therefore, a small amount of activity can cause
      the socket temperature to elevate and remain at an uncomfortable level for an extended period
      of time, which can lead to decreased wear times. In summary, an uncomfortable socket/residual
      limb interface decreases prosthesis use among amputees who want to remain active in their
      lives.

      To address this, Liberating Technologies, Inc. (LTI) and Vivonics, Inc. have developed a
      thermo-electric cooling (TEC)-based module called the Intrasocket Cooling Element (ICE), that
      can be embedded into the prosthesis in order to cool the residual limb. A technology that can
      provide thermal control while retaining adequate suspension, weight and other prosthetic
      characteristics would benefit many prosthesis wearers.

      This study will focus on investigating the efficacy of this novel socket cooling technology.

      The rationale for this study is to determine how well the new technology can cool the
      residual limb not only in a controlled laboratory environment, but also in a home environment
      where the device would ultimately be utilized.

      The primary objective of this study is to measure the effects of cooling the residual limb on
      quality of life (QoL) and functional outcomes. Cooling the residual limb inside the
      prosthetic socket would result in less sweating and greater comfort while wearing the
      prosthesis, and ultimately greater function and better quality of life as measured by
      standard functional and QoL outcome measures.

      A two group, prospective, double-blinded, block randomized, crossover study design will be
      implemented. Research participants will be consented and have baseline activity and socket
      temperature data collected from their usual prosthesis during normal use (4 weeks). The ICE
      system will be integrated into a custom, experimental socket for each subject. Two versions
      of the cooling module will be created: (1) a fully-functional, active ICE cooling module (the
      so called &quot;ON&quot;, or experimental, condition), and (2) a placebo ICE module with the TEC unit
      replaced with an insulating material layer between the fan and the heat spreader such that
      even when the system is turned on, minimal heat transfer occurs (the control, or &quot;OFF&quot;
      condition). An ICE module with a heat spreader will be embedded into the socket and the fan
      will continue to run whether or not active cooling is engaged for both test conditions;
      however, no heat will be able to be transferred through the insulating layer in the OFF
      condition. The TEC inside the ICE unit will not be visible once assembled and the modules
      will be assembled independently; therefore, both the subject and the tester will be blinded
      to the condition being tested for both the in-lab and at-home testing. A serial number will
      be used to identify the assembled units and the master key stored separately.

      The participants will be divided into two groups and the order of the experimental conditions
      will be randomized. Each condition will be tested for 4 weeks. In-lab testing and functional
      measures will be assessed between testing periods as additional assessments of efficacy of
      the device. Testing will consist of 4 test site visits, as well as 1-2 visits to create and
      align the experimental socket. The entire study will continue for 3 months.

      Lower limb prosthesis users will be recruited for the study and consented with an approved
      protocol. Research participants will represent a convenience sample and will reflect the
      local population of both above-knee (AK) and below-knee (BK) amputees of various K-levels
      using a variety of suspension types who could benefit from temperature control within the
      socket.

      A maximum of 20 subjects will be recruited for this study. This is increased from the target
      16 subjects to account for any drop-outs, etc.

    <time_frame>4 hours</time_frame>
    <description>This will be tested only during in-lab visits. An intervention of the experimental socket with the ICE cooling unit should yield at least a 2 degree Celsius decrease in temperature compared with no intervention. This will be tested in-lab with 6 thermocouples taped to the residual limb while the subject is sitting and walking on a treadmill.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>User Satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>Entire study period (~3 months)</time_frame>
    <description>A custom survey regarding user satisfaction will be completed for all 3 conditions of the study (baseline, ICE unit, SHAM unit). This custom questionnaire uses a 5 point Likert scale (1-5) and will be used to rate different aspects of each condition.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Moisture Generation</measure>
    <time_frame>4 hours</time_frame>
    <description>This will be tested only during in-lab visits. After the subject has completed a condition of sitting and walking, the subject will remove their socket and liner. Immediately after removal, the inside of the liner will be wiped down by an absorbing material (pad) and placed on a high precision scale to document any weight added to materials (pad, gloves) due to sweat absorption. This is measured in grams.</description>

    <measure>Socket Comfort</measure>
    <time_frame>Entire study period (~3 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Over the course of the entire study, a log book will be kept by the subject to document if they feel the condition is better or worse than their usual non-cooling socket and liner. The data will be qualitative. The subject will discuss if they felt their socket cool down, if they were able to do any activities their normal socket wouldn't have allowed them to complete, if the experimental socket allowed more suspension during high-intensity activities than their usual socket, as well as anything else they would like to note so the investigators have a better understanding of their experience.</description>

    <measure>Prosthesis Evaluation Questionnaire (PEQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Entire study period (~3 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The version of the PEQ which will be administered consists of 22 questions in 6 categories. Each PEQ question is normally administered on a VAS (0-100), but was instead placed on a Likert scale from 1-5.. The decision was made to convert the questionnaire results back to the VAS Scale range (1=0, 2=25, 3=50, 4=75, 5=100).</description>

    <measure>Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Entire study period (~3 months)</time_frame>
    <description>PROMIS Short form 4a and 8a were selected to help evaluate the subject's activities and social roles. Short form 4a focuses on &quot;Satisfaction with Social Roles and Activities&quot;. Short form 8a focuses on the Subjects &quot;Ability to Participate in Social Roles and Activities&quot;. The questions are answered on a scale from 1-5 and add up to a sum &quot;raw-score&quot; which correlates to a T-score and standard error.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Modified Dermatology Life Quality Index (mDLQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Entire study period (~3 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The Dermatology Life Quality Index is a simple questionnaire designed to measure the health-related quality of life of adult patients suffering from various skin diseases. A modified version of the questionnaire was created to be more directly applicable to persons with amputation. The modified survey can have a score from 0 to 27, with lower numbers indicating a better outcome. Scores on the unmodified DLQI of 0-1 indicate no affect at all from a skin condition on a patient's life. Score ranges of 2-5, 6-10, 11-20 and 21-30 are considered to have 'small,' 'moderate,' 'very large,' and 'extremely large' effects on a patient's life, respectively.</description>
