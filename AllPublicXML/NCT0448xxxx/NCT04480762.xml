  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SHR-1703 is a monoclonal antibody under development for severe asthma. This study is the
      first study in Healthy subjects. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a single dose SHR-1703 administered
      subcutaneously in Chinese healthy subjects.

    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted at 1 study center in China. Approximately 42 healthy Chinese
      male and female subjects, aged 18 to 55 inclusive, will be randomized to receive a single SC
      administration of SHR-1703: Treatment 1, Treatment 2, Treatment 3, Treatment 4 and Treatment
      5. Each subject will participate in only 1 treatment group. The total length of the study for
      each subject is up to 190 days (28 days of screening and 155+/- 7 days of further study
      visits).
