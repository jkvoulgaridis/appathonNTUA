    <description>The intervention will consist of 2 sessions of 30 minutes each, based on the use of a virtual reality headset with the AQUA® application.
The 1st session will take place on the day of the surgical intervention, upon arrival in hospital, after reception in the room.
The 2nd session will take place the same day, post-operatively, once the awakening is satisfactory (within 3 to 6 hours after the intervention)</description>
