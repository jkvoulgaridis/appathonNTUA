  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of the safety and efficacy of DS-1062a in subjects with advanced or
      metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with known actionable genomic alterations.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 doses of DS-1062a.
      Randomization will be stratified by NSCLC genomic alteration type. The study will be divided
      into 3 periods: Screening Period, Treatment Period, and Follow-up Period.
