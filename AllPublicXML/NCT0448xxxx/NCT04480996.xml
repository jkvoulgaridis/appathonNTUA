  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Drugs responsible for cognitive and psychomotor side effects may lead to impaired driving
      skills and road traffic accidents. This study investigates reports of road traffic accident
      for different class of drugs responsible for cognitive and psychomotor sides effects
      (pyschotropic agents, neurotropic agents, antineoplasic agents) in the World Health
      Organization's (WHO) global database of individual safety case reports (VigiBase).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Some medications are responsible of a wide range of cognitive and psychomotor side effects
      that may make it unsafe to drive and lead to risks of road accidents .The investigators use
      VigiBase, the World Health Organization (WHO) database of individual safety case reports, to
      identify cases of road traffic accidents following treatment with different class of drugs
      responsible for pyschomotor sides effects.
