      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of filgotinib versus placebo on
      signs and symptoms of active ankylosing spondylitis (AS), evaluated by Assessment of
      SpondyloArthritis international Society 40% improvement (ASAS40) response at Week 16 in

    <description>The ASAS HI is a 17-item patient-reported outcome measure to assess the impact of interventions for spondyloarthritis (SpA), including axial SpA. Each item consists of a question with a binary response of either &quot;I agree&quot; (scored as 1) or &quot;I do not agree&quot; (scored as 0). The scoring is performed by summing the number of &quot;yes&quot; answers. The total sum of the ASAS HI ranges 0-17, with a lower score indicating a better health status.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Physical Component Summary (PCS) Score of the 36-Item Short-Form Survey (SF-36) Version 2</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 Version 2 is a health-related survey that assesses participant's quality of life and consists of 36 questions covering 8 health domains: physical functioning, bodily pain, role limitations due to physical problems and emotional problems, general health perceptions, mental health, social functioning, vitality, and 2 component scores (Mental Component Summary (MCS) score and PCS). MCS consists of social functioning, vitality, mental health, and role-emotional. PCS consists of physical functioning, bodily pain, role-physical, and general health perceptions.

    <time_frame>Baseline and up to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The FACIT-Fatigue measures an individual's level of fatigue during their usual daily activities during the past week. It consists of 13 questions on a 5-point Likert scale, with 0 indicating &quot;not at all&quot; and 4 indicating &quot;very much&quot;. Negatively stated items are reversed and the total score ranges 0-52. Low scores indicate more severe fatigue than high scores.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Work Productivity and Activity Impairment for Ankylosing Spondylitis (WPAI-AS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The WPAI-AS is a questionnaire developed to measure impairments in work activities in participants with AS. The questionnaire consists of 6 questions (currently employed, work time missed due to AS, work time missed due to other reasons, hours actually worked, degree AS affected productivity while working [0-10 NRS; with 0 indicating no effect and 10 indicating AS completely prevented the participant from working], and degree AS affected productivity in regular unpaid activities [0-10 NRS; with 0 indicating no effect and 10 indicating AS completely prevented the participant's daily activities]). The recall period for questions 2 through 6 is 7 days.
Four main outcomes (expressed in percentages) can be obtained from the WPAI-AS: percentage of work time missed due to AS, percentage of impairment due to AS, percentage of overall work impairment due to AS, and percentage of activity impairment due to AS. Higher numbers indicate greater impairment and less productivity.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in EuroQol 5 Dimensions 5 Levels (EQ-5D-5L)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L is a standard measure of health-related quality of life. The tool consists of the EQ-5D-5L descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (VAS). The descriptive part comprises 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression). Each of these 5 dimensions has 5 levels (no problem, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems). Results for each of the 5 dimensions are combined into a 5-digit number to describe the participant's health state. The VAS records the participant's health on a 0-100 mm VAS scale, with 0 indicating &quot;the worst health you can imagine&quot; and 100 indicating &quot;the best health you can imagine.&quot; Higher scores of EQ VAS indicate better health.</description>
