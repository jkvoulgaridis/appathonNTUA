  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Objectives of Medical Research:

      Separation of LDL and HDL from blood samples of patients with high LDL and / or low HDL who
      have developed atherosclerotic disease with similar patients who have no evidence of
      atherosclerosis.

      Lipidomics and proteomics will examine whether there is a difference in lipid and protein
      composition and lipoprotein composition. If there are any changes in expression level or the
      composition of proteins or metabolites that make up lipoproteins, we will try to figure out
      the mechanism responsible for these changes and their role in the metabolic process. we will
      seek therapeutic measures through which these mechanisms can be inhibited and thus inhibit
      the development of sclerosis or even retraction.

      Participants:

      Participants who are found suitable during their visit to the Lipid Institute Clinic or
      during hospitalization at the Sheba Medical Center will receive an explanation of the study,
      will be asked to sign a consent form.

      A medical history will be taken, the participant will be asked to fill out a nutrition
      questionnaire (FFQ) and a 5 cc blood sample will be taken from each patient

    <description>Lipoproteins would be analyzed by lipidomic and proteomic profiling using chromatography and mass-spectrometry. Concentrations of specific lipids and proteins will be quantified as micrograms per deciliter or as area under the curve. We will look for significant differences in these values between the different study groups using updated software tools specifically designed for mass spectrometry data analysis.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy participants with LDL levels less than 130 mg / dl without evidence of
             atherosclerosis or wall thickening of the carotid artery according to an ultrasound
             imaging of the carotid artery at the Lipid Institute and unknown for atherosclerosis
             or cardiovascular disease in the background.

          -  Participants with LDL levels above 160 mg / dl, with no evidence of atherosclerosis or
             wall thickening of the carotid artery according to an ultrasound - IMT of the carotid
             arteries performed at the Lipid Institute and unknown for atherosclerosis or
             cardiovascular disease in the background.

          -  Participants with LDL levels above 160 mg / dl, where evidence of atherosclerosis or
             wall thickening of the arteries can be found by ultrasound imaging of the carotid
             artery that is performed at the Lipid Institute or known for atherosclerosis or
             cardiovascular disease in the background.

        Exclusion Criteria:
