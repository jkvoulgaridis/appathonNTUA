  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of vision loss in adults. Abnormal
      blood vessels grow under the macula at the back of the eye, and also leak blood and fluid,
      which damages and scars the macula, affecting vision. The current standard of care for
      patients with neovascular (exudative / wet) AMD is anti-vascular endothelial growth factor
      (anti-VEGF) therapy, which prevents or slows down the growth of the abnormal blood vessels.
      SCD411 is being developed as a biosimilar to the reference product Eylea® (aflibercept), an
      anti-VEGF drug. The study aims to prove equivalence of SCD411 to Eylea in adults with wet
      AMD, and will look at safety, tolerance, effectiveness, immune response and the movement of
      the drug through the body.
