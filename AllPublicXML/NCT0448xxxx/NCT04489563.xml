  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A mix-method cross-sectional feasibility study performed in five aged care institutes in
      Flanders, Belgium. A convenience sample of 48 aged persons was recruited and 12 supervisors
      (i.e. occupational therapy students and therapists).

      Aged persons received a 20-30 minutes test with a technology-based system, i.e. intelligent
      Activity-based Client-centred Training system (i-ACT). The i-ACT consists of the Microsoft
      Kinect and adapted software in which movements can be recorded and training parameters can be
      set by supervisors.

      During and after the test, the thinking aloud method was used. After the test, the Intrinsic
      Motivation Inventory, the System Usability Scale, and the Credibility/Expectancy
      Questionnaire were administered in the aged persons.

    <intervention_model_description>A group of aged persons and their supervisors in day care facilities or nursing homes participated in this study to investigate the feasibility of the i-ACT system for use to engage and motivate aged persons in institutional facilities to perform physical activity. The aged persons received a 20-30 minutes test period with the self-developed programme of the i-ACT (based on hard- and software of the Microsoft Kinect). During and after the test, the feedback of the participants was noted by the supervisor (using the thinking aloud method). After the test, 3 questionnaires were conducted, i.e. the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI), System Usability Scale (SUS), and Credibility/Expectancy Questionnaire (CEQ).
The feedback from the supervisors was also noted as part of the thinking aloud method to gather as much information as needed to adapt the prototype of the i-ACT system towards the wishes and needs from aged persons.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Using the System Usability Scale to explore the usability of i-ACT in aged persons. The System Usability Scale consists of a 10 item questionnaire with five response options for respondents; from Strongly agree to Strongly disagree. The items scores are converted into a score from 0 (negative) to 100 (positive). A score of 72.5 or higher is considered good and above 85.0 is excellent.</description>

    <description>Using the Credibility/Expectancy Questionnaire to research the credibility and expectancy of aged persons when using the i-ACT for physical activity. It is one test that consists of 2 subscales, i.e. credibility and expectancy, and scores range from 1 (totally not) to 9 (totally yes) and percentages. The percentages are converted to scores on a scale of 1 to 9/ The maximum score on each subscale is 27. A score of 13.5 is considered neutral, everything above 13.5 is positive while everything under 13.5 is considered negative.</description>
