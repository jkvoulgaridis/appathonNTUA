  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A successful implant surgery primarily relies on a prudent evaluation of oral anatomy and
      meticulous treatment planning. Additionally, of paramount importance that dictates the types
      of procedures, material selection and ultimately success of implant surgery is the quality
      and quantity of the edentulous ridge. Ultrasound imaging (US), another cross-sectional
      imaging modality, has been extensively used in the medical diagnostics field. The ability of
      ultrasound to image soft tissue-bone interface makes it particularly promising for studying
      bone ridge width and crestal bone topography. Therefore, this retrospective human study aimed
      to compare bone width measurements between US and CBCT. This study also investigated the
      possible correlation between the crestal bone surface quality imaged by US and CBCT.
