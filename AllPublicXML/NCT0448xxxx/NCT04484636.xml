    <textblock>
      PLATON (Platform for Analyzing Targetable Mutations) is a prospective, multicentre,
      observational cohort study with biobanking. In a first approach PLATON's pilot-study assesses
      genomic profiling in gastrointestinal cancer therapy and the frequencies of targetable
      mutations including Tumor Mutational Burden (TMB) and Microsatellite Instability Status
      (MSI), performing Next-generation deep sequencing (NGS) using the Foundation Medicine assays
      on tumor specimen and EDTA-whole blood samples. The Study Protocol does not define any
      further medical intervention or evaluate the efficacy or safety of the treatment decision
      made by the investigator. Another important objective of PLATON's pilot project is to
      evaluate whether and how many patients are treated based on their genomic profiles.

      PLATON (Platform for Analyzing Targetable Mutations) is designed to improve personalized
      therapy for patients in different cancer entities, such as in hepatocellular cancer (HCC),
      intra- and extrahepatic cholangiocellular carcinoma (CCA), gallbladder carcinoma (GBCA),
      pancreatic cancer (PanCa) and esophagogastric cancer (EC/GC), and elevate the treatment
      guidance within its framework. The key to understand the mechanisms in initiation,
      progression and response to treatment of cancer is the data integration of genetic mutational
      signatures with medical and physiological data of diseased cohorts.

      PLATON is a prospective, multicentre, observational cohort study with biobanking and does not
      define any medical intervention or evaluate the efficacy or safety of the treatment decision
      made by the investigator.In a first approach PLATON's pilot-study assess genomic profiling in
      gastrointestinal cancer therapy and the frequencies of targetable mutations including Tumor
      Mutational Burden (TMB) and Microsatellite Instability Status (MSI), performing

      and EDTA-whole blood samples. Another important objective of PLATON's pilot project is to
      evaluate whether and how many patients are treated based on their genomic profiles.

      The pilot-study starts with the national-wide enrolment of 200 participants of both sexes and
      ages over 18 at 40 german study sites. The long-term vision is to enable cancer patients to
      receive the best available, scientifically founded, biomarker-based care, tailored to his or
      her individual needs

    <description>FoundationOne CDx is a FDA-approved broad companion diagnostic (CDx) that is clinically and analytically validated for solid tumors. The test is designed to provide physicians with clinically actionable information — both to consider appropriate therapies for patients and understand results with evidence of resistance — based on the individual genomic profile of each patient's cancer. Every test result includes microsatellite instability (MSI) and tumor mutational burden (TMB) to help inform immunotherapy decisions. FoundationOne®Liquid is a liquid biopsy test for solid tumors that analyzes circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in blood.</description>
