      This is a phase II study using the Bayesian platform design. There are three clinical stage
      groups of localized pancreatic cancer: resectable, borderline resectable, and locally
      advanced disease. Each stage group will have a defined standard of care chemotherapy regimen
      for a control arm, serving as a basis of comparison. Each group may have one or more
      experimental arms. Experimental arms may be added to the platform over time, and the effects
      of the experimental treatments will be tested against the controls for each group.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate major pathological response rate. (Resectable and borderline resectable groups
      [treatment naive or previously treated]) II. To estimate 6-month disease control rate.
      (Locally advanced groups [treatment naive or previously treated])

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To measure progression free survival and overall survival. (Resectable and borderline
      resectable groups [treatment naive or previously treated]) II. To measure progression free
      survival and overall survival. (Locally advanced groups [treatment naive or previously
      treated])

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To benchmark tissue acquisition protocols for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic
      acid (RNA) analysis in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).

      II. To demonstrate concordance of cell free DNA detected mutations to those detected in the
      tumor-derived DNA in PDAC.

      III. To demonstrate response through exosome and circulating tumor DNA. IV. To demonstrate
      response through the quantification of the immune activation by analyzing T and B cells,
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and tissue biopsies.

      V. To derive organoids from human PDAC and measure drug response in vitro. VI. To analyze the
      tumor microenvironment through immunohistochemistry (IHC) and hypoxia staining.

      VII. To associate prognosis of patients with baseline and follow-up quantitative computed
      tomography (CT) image based analysis.

      VIII. To associate clinical and pathological outcomes of patients with changes in radiomic
      measurements.

      IX. To correlate quality of life for patients on standard and experimental therapies with
      laboratory, radiological, pathological, and clinical characteristics.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 6 arms.

      ARM I (Treatment-naive resectable PDAC): Patients receive fluorouracil, irinotecan,
      leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (mFOLFIRINOX) for 3 months before and after surgery in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II (Previously-treated resectable PDAC): Patients receive gemcitabine, gemcitabine and
      nab-paclitaxel, gemcitabine and cisplatin, or FOLFIRINOX for up to 4 months in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM III (Treatment-naive borderline resectable PDAC): Patients receive FOLFIRINOX for 4-6
      months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients may then
      undergo radiation therapy at the discretion of medical doctors.

      ARM IV (Previously-treated borderline resectable PDAC): Patients receive gemcitabine,
      gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel, gemcitabine and cisplatin, or FOLFIRINOX for 6 months in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients may then undergo radiation
      therapy at the discretion of medical doctors.

      ARM V (Treatment-naive locally advanced PDAC): Patients receive FOLFIRINOX for 4-6 months in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients may then undergo
      radiation therapy at the discretion of medical doctors.

      ARM VI (Previously-treated locally advanced PDAC): Patients receive gemcitabine, gemcitabine
      and nab-paclitaxel, gemcitabine and cisplatin, or FOLFIRINOX for 6 months in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients may then undergo radiation therapy at
      the discretion of medical doctors.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 16 weeks.
