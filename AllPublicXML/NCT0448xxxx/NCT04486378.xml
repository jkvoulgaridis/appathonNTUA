          -  Patients who had major surgery (e.g., surgery requiring general anesthesia) within 4
             weeks before screening, or will not have fully recovered from surgery, or have surgery
             planned during the time the patient are expected to participate in the trial.

          -  Patients with active hepatitis B or C.
