  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After recruitment, 20 male patients will be assigned 1:1 to either age-matched control (G1:
      sham) or age-matched intervention (G2: pelvic magnetic stimulation; TPMS) groups using
      computer-generated process, and baseline parameters will be established. All patients will be
      instructed by the investigators to perform standard of care pelvic floor exercise for the
      duration of the study. In addition, G2 patients will receive TPMS, while G1 patients will
      undergo sham treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will use a custom TPMS device that targets pelvic muscles. The
      investigators will apply low amplitude (5%) TPMS to improve blood flow, then high amplitude
      (30-50%) to strengthen pelvic muscles. The treatment regimen will involve two 20-minute
      sessions/visit and 2 -visits per week for 12-weeks (final monitoring at 24 weeks). TPMS will
      be administered by a trained clinical coordinator under the supervision of a urologist.
      Symptom scores and hemodynamic changes will be evaluated monthly. MRI for assessing muscle
      thickness will be performed in the beginning (before TPMS) and at the end (after TPMS) of the
      study. The investigators will assess functional improvements using symptom scores.
      Morphological changes will be determined by MRI.

    <measure>Improvements in sexual function change</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and at 4, 8, 12, 13 and 24 weeks 24-weeks post therapy</time_frame>
    <description>Primary outcome measure will be to determine improvements in male sexual (erectile) function after magnetic stimulation therapy.
The objective measure for erectile function will be the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF), a validated, 5-item symptom-subjective score. These five items focus on male erectile function. Response options are based on rating scales from 1 to 5 and the responses are added to form a total IIEF-5 score from 5 to 25. Lower scores indicate poor sexual function and higher scores after therapy will indicate improvement.</description>

    <measure>Change in number of pads used as a measure of Improvements in continence function</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and at 4, 8, 12, 13 and 24 weeks 24-weeks post therapy</time_frame>
    <description>The first objective measure for urinary incontinence (UI) change will be the number of pads used in 24-hours as an index of urine leakage. Higher number of pad use will indicate severe UI and lower number pad use after therapy will indicate improvement.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Improvements in penile blood flow change</measure>
    <time_frame>Penile blood flow (mm/sec) will be measured at baseline and at 4, 8, 12, 13 and 24 weeks post- treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>Penile blood flow will be measured as peak systolic velocity (mm/sec) using laser Doppler method.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Improvements in pelvic muscle thickness change</measure>
    <time_frame>Muscle thickness (mm) will be measured at baseline and at 13 weeks post- treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>Muscle thickness (mm) will be measured by anatomical MRI and quantified using imaging software such as Amira.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Pad weight as a measure of Improvements in continence function</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and at 4, 8, 12, 13 and 24 weeks 24-weeks post therapy</time_frame>
    <description>The second objective measure for urinary incontinence (UI) change will be the total weight of the pads used in 24-hours as an index of urine leakage. Higher number of pad weight will indicate severe UI and lower number pad use after therapy will indicate improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in urinary symptom score as a measure of Improvements in continence function</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and at 4, 8, 12, 13 and 24 weeks 24-weeks post therapy</time_frame>
    <description>The third objective measure for urinary incontinence (UI) change will be the change in urinary symptom scores. We will also use International Consultation of Incontinence Questionnaire (ICIQ)-symptom score (scores range: 0-21), a score which assesses the symptoms and effect of UI on quality of life. Higher scores will indicate severe UI and lower scores after therapy will indicate improvement.</description>
