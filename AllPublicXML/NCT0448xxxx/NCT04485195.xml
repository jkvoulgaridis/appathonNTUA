  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective is to compare IV vernakalant to IV procainamide for the ED management of acute
      AF patients. If vernakalant proves to be more effective, faster, and safer than IV
      procainamide, this will give clinicians an important alternative for pharmacological
      cardioversion of acute AF. The investigators propose a pragmatic comparative effectiveness
      trial entailing an open label, randomized controlled trial at 12 large Canadian EDs. Study
      subjects will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms: 1) Patients will receive an initial
      infusion of 3mg/kg of IV vernakalant over 10 minutes, followed by a second dose of 2mg/kg
      over 10 minutes, if necessary, or 2) Patients will receive a continuous infusion of 15mg/kg
      of IV procainamide over 60 minutes. The primary aim will be to compare conversion to normal
      sinus rhythm between the two drugs. The investigators will include stable patients presenting
      with an episode of acute AF of at least 3 hours duration, where symptoms require urgent
      management and where immediate cardioversion is a reasonable option. Using the integrated
      consent model, research assistants will obtain verbal consent from eligible patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        The investigators will include stable (see below) patients presenting with an episode of
        acute AF of at least 3 hours duration, where symptoms require urgent management and where
        immediate cardioversion is a reasonable option because they:

          -  present within 12 hours of onset if they have 2 or more CHADS-65 criteria, unless they
             can be cleared by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) or cardiac CT scan;

          -  present within 48 hours of onset if they have 0 or 1 CHADS-65 criteria, unless they
             can be cleared by TEE or cardiac CT scan;

          -  present within 7 days of onset and have been adequately anticoagulated for &gt; 4 weeks
             (warfarin and INR &gt; 2.0 or novel oral anticoagulants [dabigatran, rivaroxaban,
             edoxaban, and apixaban]), unless they can be cleared by TEE or cardiac CT scan.

        Of note, we will not exclude patients with prior episodes of acute AF. Patients will only
        be enrolled if the attending physician is confident about time of onset, based upon the
        patient's symptoms. Physicians are well aware of the importance of this determination and
        will not attempt to cardiovert patients otherwise.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The investigators will exclude patients who have any of the reasons listed below.

          1. Appropriateness:

               -  unable to understand the study and integrated consent;

               -  have permanent (chronic) AF;

               -  increased risk of stroke because onset not clearly &lt;48 hours and not
                  anticoagulated (or abnormal TEE or cardiac CT scan); or do not meet the inclusion
                  criteria a, b, or c;

               -  deemed unstable and require immediate cardioversion: i) systolic blood pressure

                  iii) acute coronary syndrome - chest pain and acute ischemic changes on ECG; or

               -  or acquired long QT syndrome; or ECG shows QTc &gt;460ms (when heart rate &gt;100
                  measured by the Fridericia formula);

               -  has severe bradycardia (heart rate &lt; 55 bpm), sinus node dysfunction, or second
                  or third degree atrioventricular heart block, in the absence of an in situ
                  properly functioning pacemaker; or, has Brugada syndrome (genetic disease with
                  increased risk of sudden cardiac death);

               -  has received an intravenous antiarrhythmic drug Class I, e.g. procainamide, or
                  Class Ill, e.g. amiodarone or ibutilide, within the prior 4 hours; or currently
                  takes oral class I or III antiarrhythmic drugs other than amiodarone (last dose &lt;
                  5 half-lives before enrollment);

               -  has received an IV beta-blocker within the 2 hours prior

               -  has hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the ingredients of
                  either drug;

               -  has advanced or end-stage liver disease; or

               -  is breast feeding or pregnant (safety not established).
