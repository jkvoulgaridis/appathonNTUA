  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective is to assess binocular distance-corrected near (40 cm) visual acuity of
      patients after uneventful cataract surgery with bilateral implantation of the AcrySof® Vivity
      Intraocular lens (IOL) when the non-dominant eye is targeted for slight myopia.

      This study is a single-arm unmasked clinical evaluation study of binocular distance-corrected
      near (40 cm) visual acuity, when the non-dominant eye is targeted for slight myopia, after
      successful bilateral cataract surgery. Subjects will be assessed pre-operatively, operatively
      and at 1 day, 1 month and 3 months post-operatively. Clinical evaluations will include
      administration of a visual disturbance questionnaire (QUVID), patient-reported spectacle
      independence questionnaire (PRSIQ), and a satisfaction questionnaire (IOLSAT), as well as
      measurement of bilateral visual acuity and manifest refraction.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  • Presenting for uncomplicated bilateral cataract surgery and have an interest in
             spectacle independence using an EDF IOL

               -  Meet the requirements for on-label implantation of the EDF IOL

               -  Gender: Males and Females.

               -  Have good ocular health, with no pathology that compromises visual acuity
                  (outside of residual refractive error and cataract)

               -  Have regular corneal astigmatism with a magnitude that can be treated with a
                  non-toric IOL or toric IOL.

               -  Have 20/32 (0.2 logMAR) or better potential acuity in both eyes

          -  • Irregular astigmatism (e.g. keratoconus)

               -  Corneal pathology (e.g. scar, dystrophy, pterygium, severe dry eye)

               -  Monocular status (e.g. amblyopia)

               -  Previous radial keratotomy, corneal refractive surgery or other corneal surgery
                  (e.g. corneal transplant, DSAEK, lamellar keratoplasty)

               -  Previous anterior or posterior chamber surgery (e.g., vitrectomy, laser
                  iridotomy)

               -  Diabetic retinopathy

               -  Macular pathology (e.g. ARMD, ERM)

               -  History of retinal detachment

               -  Subjects who have an unstable acute or chronic disease or illness that would
                  confound the results of this investigation (e.g., immunocompromised, connective
                  tissue disease, clinically significant atopic disease, diabetes, and any other
                  such disease or illness), that are known to affect postoperative visual acuity.

               -  Participation in any investigational drug or device trial within the previous 30
                  days prior to the start date of this trial (or currently participating).
