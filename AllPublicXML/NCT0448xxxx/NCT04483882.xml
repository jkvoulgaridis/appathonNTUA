  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is an evaluation of a tactile labeling strategy developed in the
      Ophthalmology Clinical Research Center at University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) in
      collaboration with the UTMB Maker Space to improve low vision patients capability to identify
      their topical ophthalmic drop treatments and the frequency with which they should be
      administered. The labeling strategy includes protrusions as frequency markers and shapes to
      differentiate between treatments of similar frequency prescription.

      The purpose of this study is an evaluation of a tactile labeling strategy developed in the
      Ophthalmology Clinical Research Center at University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) in
      collaboration with the UTMB Maker Space to improve low vision patients capability to identify
      their topical ophthalmic drop treatments and the frequency with which they should be
      administered. The labeling strategy includes protrusions as frequency markers and shapes to
      differentiate between treatments of similar frequency prescription.

      The first aim is to evaluate the patient capability to identify the number of protrusions and
      therefore the frequency of administration prescribed. This should be completed in a timeframe
      that is not frustrating or problematic to the patient in practice.

      The second aim is to evaluate the patient ability to differentiate between drugs with similar
      frequencies based on a shape on the frequency protrusions in a tactile manner. This also
      should be completed in a timeframe that is not over burdensome or frustrating to the patient.
      The protocol is designed to evaluate this tactile labeling design in the population it is
      designed to support.

    <description>The tactile labeling proposed in this protocol is rigid labeling. A ring-clip has an inner diameter of 12.5cm, an outer diameter of 16 cm, and a height of 1.5 cm. The ring is cut at 2 cm to form a semi-circle allowing it to be clipped onto the bottleneck. The ring clip fits most if not all prescription eye drop bottles. The individual protrusions with shapes at the end can be cut off by the pharmacist to match the frequency of administration prescribed.</description>
