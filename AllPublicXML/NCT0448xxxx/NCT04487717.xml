      1. Background According to Global Cancer Statistics of International Agency for Research on
           Cancer under World Health Organization, stomach cancer is the fifth most common cancer
           as there were over 1 milliion new cases in 2018 and the third leading cause of cancer
           death by 783,000 people are estimated to die of stomach cancer. In Korea gastric cancer
           is the most frequent cancer in 13.3% of all cancer cases by the report of Korea Central
           Cancer Registry in 2018. Since 2010, adjuvant chemotherapy with advanced gastric cancer
           stage 2 and stage 3 patients following gasterectomy has become a stardard treatment
           through clinical validation of increasing the patient's survival rate. However, even in
           the second and third stages of the same stomach cancer, the biological properties may be
           different.

        2. Purpose The nProfiler® 1 Stomach Cancer Assay is a molecular diagnostic test to predict
           the prognosis for patients with stage Ⅱ-Ⅲ advanced gastric cancer. This study will
           evaluate the clinical utility of nProfiler® 1 Stomach Cancer Assay by recruiting
           subjects from multi centers and observing the 5-year survival rates of Low risk,
           Intermediate risk, High risk according to gastric cancer prognostic molecular diagnostic
           test.

        3. Study Procedure

             -  Obtaining of informed consent form

                  -  Review of provider's eligibility/ Sample preparation and delivery

                       -  Sample criteria evaluation

                            -  Subject enrollment ⑤ Gastric cancer prognostic prediction molecular
                               diagnostic test ⑥ Prognostic group result report ⑦ 5-yr suvival
                               follow-up ⑧ Statistical analysis

        4. Outcome Measures

      The following efficacy outcome measures will be assessed:

        1. Primary efficacy outcome measure

           :High risk and low risk group's 5-yr Overall Survival(OS) rate

        2. Secondary efficacy outcome measure

             -  High risk and Low risk group's 3-yr Disease Free Survival(DFS) rate

             -  Intermediate risk group's 5-yr Os and 3-yr DFS rate

             -  Subgroup analysis : Adjuvant chemotherapy benefit of Low risk (5-yr OS rate, 3 yr
                DFS rate)
