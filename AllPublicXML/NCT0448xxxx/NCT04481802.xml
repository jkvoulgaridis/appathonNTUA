  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiation dermatitis (RD) is one of the most common side effects of Radiation therapy (RT)
      and 95% of patients receiving RT may experience some form of radiation dermatitis.

      A wide variety of topical, oral, and intravenous agents are used to prevent/treat Radiation
      dermatitis but currently there is no gold standard in the prevention and management of this
      condition and no treatment can be explicitly recommended.

      RadiaAce Gel is a wound dressing Hydrogel (Acemannan Hydrogel) for the management of RD which
      provides optimal moist wound environment necessary to the healing process.

      Based on its composition as well as the supporting data on safety and performance of the
      functional ingredient Acemannan in wound healing, RadiaAce may well be suited to complement
      the prevention and therapy of radiation dermatitis.

      The primary aim of the study is to evaluate the safety and performance of RadiaAce as compare
      to Biafine in reducing the proportion of breast cancer patients that experience grade 2 or
      higher RD as measured by the RTOG scoring system

    <description>RadiaAce Gel is a clear, non-oily Hydrogel wound dressing for the management of Radiation Dermatitis which provides optimal moist wound environment necessary to the healing process. RadiaAce gel contains Acemannan, a high molecular polysaccharide obtained from the inner gel of Aloe Vera leaves and it is considered the main functional component of Aloe vera (Sahu et al. 2013).</description>
