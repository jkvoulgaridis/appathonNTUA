  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective，multi-center，open-label, controlled study will evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of targeted drug in combination with CHOP in treatment of newly diagnosed peripheral
      T-cell lymphoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL）is a distinct and heterogeneous histopathologic subtype of
      non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), accounting for ~10%. Patients with PTCL still have poor treatment
      response and prognosis under conventional CHOP regimen. There is no standard of care for
      those patients. Targeted drugs are warranted in this group of patients to improve survival.
      This prospective，multi-center，open-label, controlled study will evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of targeted drug in combination with CHOP in treatment of newly diagnosed peripheral
      T-cell lymphoma.

    <description>An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events.</description>
