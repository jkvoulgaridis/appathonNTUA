  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We are using a community-based participatory research (CBPR) model to develop a lifestyle
      intervention targeting weight loss that is specifically tailored to women in perimenopause
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a participatory research study which will enroll women (n of up to 56) with
      experience of menopause to help identify preferred strategies (modalities) for weight loss,
      which will combine calorie (dietary) restriction and exercise tactics.

      Aim 1: Explore attitudes and perceptions about weight gain during the menopause transition,
      and identify weight loss strategies from the patient (peer) perspective.

      - We will apply these learnings: 1) to understand barriers for weight management during
      menopause; 2) to establish strategies to guide retention; 3) to finalize the intervention
      structure, including feedback on the frequency and duration of the study visits; and 4) to
      gather feedback on menopause-specific education resources set to be provided throughout the
      intervention.

      Aim 2: Engage the Community Advisory Board (CAB) of the Louisiana Clinical and Translational
      Center (LA CaTS) to understand scalability and community-based implementation of an
      intervention tailored for women in perimenopause.

      - We will then utilize the Louisiana Clinical &amp; Translational Science Center (LA CaTS)
      Community Advisory Board (CAB) to help us tailor a lifestyle intervention in perimenopausal
      women with emphasis on scalability and community-based implementation using learnings
      obtained from the focus groups.
