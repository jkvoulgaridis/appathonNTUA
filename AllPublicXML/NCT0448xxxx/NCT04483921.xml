  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine race differences in total energy expenditure and respiratory quotient
      (RQ) during and after exercise, compared to a sedentary control condition, in adolescent
      girls who are classified as overweight. In addition, subjective appetite will be measured
      throughout the assessment periods.

      Aim 1: Measure 24-hour energy expenditure and its components (resting, activity, and sleep
      energy expenditure) and compare differences between African-American and White girls.

      Hypothesis: Total, resting, and sleep energy expenditure will be lower in African-American
      relative to White girls. Activity energy expenditure will be equivalent per the study design.

      Aim 2: Measure and compare substrate oxidation and associations with appetite (i.e., hunger,
      desire to eat) in the context of energy balance between African-American and White girls.

      Hypothesis: African-American girls will have a higher RQ at rest, during exercise, and
      following exercise, and RQ will be positively associated with subjective appetite ratings.
