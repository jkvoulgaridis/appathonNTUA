    <description>All participants will be in the Resilient Living Program arm. Study participation involves participating in a 12-week stress management and resilience training program. This will involve four virtual sessions (video or phone) and answering questions about their health, well-being, and quality of life. There will also be online modules to watch and an accompanying journal (with prompts) to keep.</description>

    <description>Participants will be given the journal Resilient Living with Dr. Sood: Building Strength for Difficult Days to use throughout the study. The initial session with one of the investigators will be an introduction and a review of Module 1: Gratitude, and will last 30-60min. Three follow-up sessions will occur approximately every two weeks and the participants should view the videos before those virtual meetings (Session 2 will review Module II: Mindful Presence; Session 3 will review Module III: Kindness; Session 4 will review Module IV: Resilient Mindset). The videos will take approximately 30 minutes each to review and virtual sessions will each take 30-60 minutes.</description>
