    <textblock>
      The main objective of this randomized trial comparing vision therapy to observation is to
      determine the short-term effectiveness of vision therapy on distance intermittent exotropia
      control. The results will help determine whether to proceed to a full-scale, long-term
      randomized trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vision therapy (VT) is a commonly prescribed treatment for children with intermittent
      exotropia (IXT). The effectiveness of VT as a treatment modality for children with IXT is
      unknown because previous studies have largely limited observational or retrospective case
      series without comparison groups. The objective of this multi-centered pilot randomized trial
      of VT for IXT compared to observation is to 1) determine the short-term effectiveness of VT
      on distance intermittent exotropia and 2) determine the feasibility of recruitment and
      retention of children aged 8 to 16 years old with IXT to participate in a randomized trial of
      20 weeks of in-office VT. The results of this trial will provide the needed information to
      plan and conduct a large-scale randomized trial to determine short-term and long-term
      effectiveness of VT for IXT in children, with the full-scale randomized trial helping to fill
      in the gaps in scientific knowledge concerning VT as a treatment for IXT.

    <measure>Mean Distance Control Score</measure>
    <time_frame>21 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The primary analysis will be an intent-to-treat comparison of mean distance control score, determine by the intermittent exotropia office control scale, at outcome using an analysis of covariance model, which will adjust for baseline distance control. The intermittent exotropia office control scale grades the control on a scale of 0 (best control; phoria) to 5 (worst control; constant exotropia).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>No Spontaneous Tropia</measure>
    <time_frame>21 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of participants with no spontaneous tropia at outcome will be compared between treatment groups.No spontaneous tropia is defined as control score of 2 or less on all three assessments of control at distance and near and no exotropia lasting more than 5 seconds throughout the examination.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Distance Control</measure>
    <time_frame>21 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of participants with &gt;= 1 point change in control and &gt;= 2 points change in control will be compared between treatment groups.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Vergence and Accommodative Measures</measure>
    <time_frame>21 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The near point of convergence, positive and negative fusional vergence ranges at distance and near, vergence facility, accommodative amplitude, and accommodative facility at outcome will be compared between treatment groups adjusting for the corresponding baseline value. The analysis will be completed separately for each vergence and accommodative measures.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Suppression Status</measure>
    <time_frame>21 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Suppression status will be compared at outcome between treatment groups, adjusting for baseline suppression status. Suppression status when the participant's eyes are in tropic position will be assessed using the suppression scale ranging from 0 (negligible suppression) to 4 (dense suppression).</description>
