        The eligible population will include pregnant women of any age and their offspring(s)
        residing in the US and its Territories whose Dengvaxia pregnancy exposure is reported to

        included in the registry:

          -  Sufficient evidence to confirm the case qualifies as &quot;exposed during pregnancy&quot;;

          -  Vaccine name (brand or generic) is provided (i.e., including manufacturer unknown
             exposures).
