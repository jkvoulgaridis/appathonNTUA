      The purpose of this study is to develop and validate the accuracy and reliability of an
      artificial intelligence(AI) system for bowel preparation quality scoring based of Boston
      Bowel preparation Scoring(BBPS). Then evaluate whether this AI system can help endoscopists
      to improve the quality of colonoscopy in clinical practice.

    <textblock>
      Bowel preparation is one of the most important factors which decide the quality of
      colonoscopy. Adequate bowel preparation is essential to guarantee a clear vision of colonic
      mucosa, complete inspection of entire colon and improves the adenoma detection rates(ADRs).
      Therefore, the quality of bowel preparation should be evaluated accurately and objectively.
      However, current bowel preparation quality scales depend on memories and subjective decision
      of endoscopists. Recently, articifial intelligence system based on deep learning algorithm
      has been used widely in medical fields. But, few studies have been reported to evaluate the
      performance of AI system based on deep learning in bowel preparation quality scoring. This
      study aims to develop and train an AI system to assess bowel preparation quality using the
      BBPS, and validate the AI system to improve the quality of colonoscopy.

    <description>Bowel preparation quality was measured by BBPS. After fully washing or suctioning of colonic contents, three segments including right colon (containing cecum and ascending colon), transvers colon (containing hepatic and splenic flexures) and left colon (containing descending and sigmoid colon) were individually scored from 0 to 3. Point 0 refers to unprepared colon segment with obscured solid stool making mucosa cannot be seen; Point 1 refers to part of mucosa can be seen, but some areas are covered by staining, residual stool, and/or opaque liquid; Point 2 refers to entire mucosa is well-seen; Point 3 refers to clean colon segment without staining, fecal materials or liquids. A sub-score of each colon segment was used, ranging from minimum 0 to maximum 3. The highest score means the excellent bowel preparation. Adequate bowel preparation was defined as a total BBPS≥6 and sub-BBPS≥2 per segment.</description>

    <description>After taking standard bowel preparation regimen, patients receive colonoscopy under the AI system device. During the withdrawal phase, bowel preparation quality is assessed by AI-associated scoring system. The withdrawal time is targeted at least 6min. Every detected polyp will be removed and obtained for pathological assessment.</description>
