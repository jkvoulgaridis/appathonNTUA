  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an active control, randomized study to investigate the safety, tolerability and PK of
      repeat dose administration of long acting CAB 400 mg/mL formulation intramuscular (IM)
      (gluteus medius and vastus lateralis) and subcutaneous (SC) (abdominal) injections in healthy
      adult participants. The study will assess the relative bioavailability of the CAB 400 mg/mL
      formulation administered by IM (vastus lateralis) and SC routes compared to the CAB 400 mg/mL
      administered via IM (gluteus medius) and also compared with historical data of CAB 200 mg/mL
      formulation administered via IM (gluteus medius). This is a two part study and will consist
      of a screening period, a 28-day oral lead-in with CAB 30 mg once daily, a 7 to 14-day washout
      period, an injection phase (up to Week 8 in Part 1 and up to Week 24 in Part 2) and a
      follow-up phase up to Week 52 post last injection.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant must be 18 to 50 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the
             informed consent.

          -  Participants who are overtly healthy as determined by medical evaluation including
             medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and cardiac monitoring.

          -  A participant with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters which is/are not
             specifically listed in the inclusion or exclusion criteria, outside the reference
             range for the population being studied may be included only if the investigator in
             consultation with the Medical Monitor agree and document that the finding is unlikely
             to introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.
             A single repeat of a procedure or lab parameter is allowed to determine eligibility.

          -  Participants who are negative on two consecutive tests for Severe acute respiratory
             syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), performed at Screening and within 5 days of
             admission to the Phase I unit, using an approved molecular test (Polymerase chain
             reaction [PCR]).

          -  Body weight &gt;=40 kilogram (kg) and body mass index (BMI) within the range 18 to 32
             kilogram per square meter (kg/m^2).

          -  Male or female.

          -  Contraceptive use by men or women should be consistent with local regulations
             regarding the methods of contraception for those participating in clinical studies.

          -  A female participant is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant or
             breastfeeding, and at least one of the following conditions applies; a) is not a woman
             of childbearing potential (WOCBP) or is a WOCBP and using a contraceptive method that
             is highly effective, with a failure rate of &lt;1% during the intervention period and
             through follow up period after the last dose of study intervention. The investigator
             should evaluate the effectiveness of the contraceptive method in relationship to the
             first dose of study intervention. b) WOCBP must have a negative highly sensitive
             pregnancy test (urine or serum as required by local regulations) within the 30 days
             before the first dose of study intervention. c) If a urine test cannot be confirmed as
             negative (e.g., an ambiguous result), a serum pregnancy test is required. In such
             cases, the participant must be excluded from participation if the serum pregnancy
             result is positive.

          -  The investigator is responsible for review of medical history, menstrual history, and
             recent sexual activity to decrease the risk for inclusion of a woman with an early
             undetected pregnancy.

          -  Capable of giving signed informed consent which includes compliance with the

          -  Sinus Pauses &gt; 3 seconds.

          -  Any significant arrhythmia which, in the opinion of the Investigator or
