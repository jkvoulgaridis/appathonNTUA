      Dalbavancin is a new lipoglycopeptide approved for the treatment of ABSSSIs (Acute Bacterial
      Skin and Skin-Structure Infections) with activity against Gram-positive pathogens, including
      MRSA. Dalbavancin has unique pharmacokinetics properties, with a terminal half-life of 14.4
      days, permitting a single intravenous dosing. Dalbavancin has shown a favourable efficacy and
      safety profile in patients with ABSSSI in randomized controlled trials. However, information
      regarding daily clinical practice is limited. The main objective of this study is to describe
      the real clinical practice with Dalbavancin in Spain.
