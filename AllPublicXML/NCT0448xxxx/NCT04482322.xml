  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective clinical trial in which 30 patients will receive a brief (5-day or
      14-day) supplementation with 10,000 IU of Vitamin D, prior to receiving aminolevulinic acid
      (ALA)- blue light PDT for the treatment of actinic keratoses (AKs).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2 clinical trial of patients with actinic keratosis (AK) that will examine a
      combination regimen of Vitamin D plus PDT, and compare its efficacy to controls who underwent
      PDT alone in a prior study from the Maytin group (IRB 16-1615). Patients will be enrolled at
      the Cleveland Clinic. Each patient will be matched to patients from the prior study based
      upon baseline calcidiol levels.

    <intervention_model_description>Patients with AK lesions will receive a neoadjuvant (oral Vitamin D) for several days immediately prior to blue light PDT. Lesion clearance will be assessed at 3 months post-PDT. These results will be compared to historical controls, patients in study NCT03319251, who received blue light PDT only.</intervention_model_description>
