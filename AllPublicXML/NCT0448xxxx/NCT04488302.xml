    <textblock>
      Objectives: Although cone‐beam computed tomography (CBCT) is becoming a standard of care in
      implant therapy, concerns have been raised recently about its limitation in imaging
      peri-implant tissues due to artifacts. The aim of present study was to demonstrate the
      complementary role of ultrasound (US), for a comprehensive examination of peri-implant
      tissues in live humans. Material and Methods: Patients with &gt; 1 implant, a CBCT scan, an US
      scan, and clinical photographs taken during the open-bone surgery were included. The crestal
      bone thickness (CBT) and facial bone level (FBL) were measured on both modalities, and direct
      FBL measurements were also made on clinical images. The correlation plots were made to
      evaluate the measurement agreements between the 3 methods.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  the patients had to have ≥ 1 implant with a CBCT scan, US scan, and clinical
             photographs taken during the surgery, e.g. a revision/explantation surgery due to
             peri-implantitis or a 2nd stage uncover surgery.
