    <textblock>
      The purpose of this registry study is to create a database—a collection of information—for
      better understanding young onset colorectal cancer. Colorectal cancer patients are considered
      to have young onset colorectal cancer if they are diagnosed with their cancer before the age
      of 50. Researchers will use the information from this database to learn more about how young
      onset colorectal cancer may be similar to or different from colorectal cancer that is
      diagnosed later in life. Researchers will also use information from the database for current
      and future research on young onset colorectal cancer.

        Potential research subjects will be identified through the Center for Young Onset
        Colorectal Cancer, a member of the patient's treatment team, the principal investigator, or
        research team at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC). All study participants
        will be recruited from patients under the care of consenting professionals. If the
        investigator is a member of the treatment team, s/he will screen their patient's medical
        records for suitable research study participants and discuss the study and their potential
        for enrolling in the research study. Potential subjects contacted by their treating
        physician will be referred to the investigator/research staff of the study.
