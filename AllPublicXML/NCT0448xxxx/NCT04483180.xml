  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Within the SWEET project (EU funded), in Work Package 2 there are two phases, this study
      refers to Phase 1 of the SWEET WP2 project, which will be a coordinated trial across 3
      intervention centres, University of Navarra (UNAV), University of Liverpool (ULIV) and
      University of Copenhagen (UCPH). It will involve an acute intervention in 120 individuals to
      explore initial acceptance, safety and post-prandial effects of 3 S&amp;SE blends delivered in
      beverage format.

      The main endpoints of the SWEET WP2 Phase 1 study will be glycaemic and lipaemic responses;
      eating behavior (subjective appetite, food preference, cravings, reward), and health effects
      (rebound hunger, G.I. side effects and metabolic effects). This phase will be exploratory and
      will not involve any specific primary hypotheses.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This protocol has the overall objective to evaluate the acute (short-term, 1 day) and
      repeated (medium-term, 2 week) effects of combinations of sweeteners and sweetness enhancers
      (S&amp;SEs) on metabolic, sensory and neuro-behavioural processes involved in satiety, consumer
      preference and health, and to explore mechanistic processes, genetic background, safety
      issues and consumer perspectives.

      There are 4 products being tested in 4 different formulations (sucrose-sweetened beverage
      control vs. 3 reformulated beverages with S&amp;SE). Each product will be tested at 3
      intervention sites in double-blind cross-over trials with 40 subjects per site, tested per
      product. Therefore a total of 120 subjects will take part across the 3 intervention sites
      (UNAV, ULIV, UCPH).

      Using identical procedures each trial will consist of 4 Clinical Investigation Days (CIDs)
      scheduled 7-11 days apart for each of the 3 product formulations.

      The total duration of WP2 Phase 2 per site is 6 months, including a minimum of 22 days and a
      maximum of 34 days for each participant.
