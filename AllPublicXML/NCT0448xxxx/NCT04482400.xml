  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of two technology interventions on health
      outcomes (e.g., physical activity, sedentary behavior, physical function, pain) after knee
      replacement at 3 and 6 months after surgery.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two 8 week technology interventions will be examined starting at 4 weeks after knee
      replacement. Both technology interventions will consist of the use of an app and/or website
      and regular calls. Assessments to examine outcomes will be completed before surgery, as well
      as at 3 and 6 months after knee replacement.
