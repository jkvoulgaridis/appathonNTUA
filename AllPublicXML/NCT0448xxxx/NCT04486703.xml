      The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the effect of physical therapy
      rehabilitation program combined with music therapy on pediatric with lower limb burn.
      Methods. A twelve-week randomized controlled study including thirty lower limb pediatric
      burned patients who randomly divided into two groups, Group(A) received physical therapy
      rehabilitation program combined with music therapy in addition to routine medical care while
      Group (B) received physical therapy rehabilitation program without music therapy. Pain was
      assessed by visual analogue scale (VAS) and range of motion (ROM) was assessed by goniometer,
      and gait assessed by GAIT Rite. Assessment was carried before and after treatment
