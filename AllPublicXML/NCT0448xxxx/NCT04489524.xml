  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators tested the feasibility of a culturally and linguistically sensitive smoking
      cessation program with combined counseling and pharmacological components for Chinese smokers
      in New York City; identified factors and techniques that enhance the administration and
      appropriateness of the intervention program; and examined the effectiveness of this program
      on quit attempts, quit rates, and overall smoking reduction.
