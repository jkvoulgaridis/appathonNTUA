  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab combined with
      carboplatin and paclitaxel as first line treatment in participants with recurrent/metastatic
      head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (R/M HNSCC). No statistical hypothesis will be tested
      in this study.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to ~20 months</time_frame>
    <description>ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who have a Complete Response (CR: Disappearance of all target lesions) or a Partial Response (PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Update and Clarification 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) which has been adjusted for this study to include a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ. The percentage of participants who experience a CR or PR as assessed by blinded independent central review based on RECIST 1.1 will be presented.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response (DOR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to ~47 months</time_frame>
    <description>For participants who demonstrate a confirmed Complete Response (CR: Disappearance of all target lesions) or confirmed Partial Response (PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters) per RECIST 1.1, DOR is defined as the time from first documented evidence of CR or PR until disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. RECIST 1.1 has been adjusted for this study to include a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ. The DOR as assessed by blinded independent central review based on RECIST 1.1 will be presented.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to ~47 months</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the time from first dose of study treatment to the first documented progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Per RECIST 1.1, PD is defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered PD. RECIST 1.1 has been adjusted for this study to include a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ. PFS as assessed by blinded independent central review based on RECIST 1.1 will be presented.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to ~47 months</time_frame>
    <description>OS is defined as the time from first dose of study treatment to death due to any cause.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants who Experience an Adverse Event (AE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to ~27 months</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. The percentage of participants who experience an AE will be reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants who Discontinue Study Treatment due to an AE</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to ~24 months</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. The percentage of participants who discontinue study treatment due to an AE will be reported.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive pembrolizumab plus carboplatin plus paclitaxel. Pembrolizumab will be administered via intravenous (IV) infusion at a dose of 200 mg on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle for up to 35 cycles (up to ~2 years). Carboplatin will be administered via IV infusion at area under curve (AUC) 5 mg/mL/minute on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle for up to 6 cycles (up to ~4 months). At investigator's choice, paclitaxel will be administered via IV infusion at a dose of 100 mg/m^2 on Day 1 and Day 8 of each 21-day cycle for up to 6 cycles (up to ~4 months) or at a dose of 175 mg/m^2 on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle for up to 6 cycles (up to ~4 months).</description>
