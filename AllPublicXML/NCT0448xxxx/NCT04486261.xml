    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effects of a high-intensity strength training in patients with
      myositis with the primary outcome being quality of life (SF-36). The study is designed as a
      parallel group randomised controlled trial with an intervention group and a control group.

  <detailed_description>

      Overall aim:

      To investigate the effect of high-intensity strength training on quality of life, muscle
      strength, physical function, and disease activity in patients with myositis

      Study design:

      60 myositis patients will be included in a 16-week high-intensity strength training study.
      Patients will be randomly allocated into 2 groups (strength training and control) in a 1:1
      ratio.

      User involvement:

      Myositis patients will be recruited to a patient advisory board. The advisory board's
      objective is to give patient-oriented project feedback, thus improving the overall research
      project.

      Intervention:

      Three training session per week for 16 weeks. Sessions consists of 3 sets of each exercise
      corresponding to 10 RM. Training progression will be accounted for and training loads will be
      adjusted weekly. The training protocol will be a full-body protocol, i.e. all major muscle
      groups will be engaged during each training session.

      Outcomes:

      The primary outcome is the Physical Component Summary Measure from the quality of life
      questionnaire (SF-36). Secondary outcomes include strength measures, functional tests,
      disease activity measures, questionnaires (e.g. International physical activity
      questionnaire), DEXA whole body scans, blood samples and muscle biopsies.

    <description>The high-intensity strength training protocol will consist of 3 training sessions per week. The first two weeks will be familiarisation training, where each exercise will be performed in three sets of 10 repetitions at an intensity of 15 repetitions maximum (RM). At week three each session will consist of 3 sets of each exercise corresponding to 10 RM, which will be kept for the remaining part of training intervention. The weights for each exercise will be adjusted throughout the intervention period, so the training load will correspond to 10 RM for each exercise in the entire intervention period.</description>
