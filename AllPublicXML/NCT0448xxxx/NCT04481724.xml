  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Weight regain following weight loss is common. In rodent models of obesity and pilot studies
      in humans, increasing membrane arachidonic acid content improves fuel partitioning and
      prevents weight regain. This study aims to understand the effect of gamma-linolenic acid
      (GLA) supplementation on weight loss maintenance in Virta Health patients.

      The primary purpose of this research is to determine if GLA supplementation reduces weight
      regain over 24 months in Virta Health patients.

      The secondary purpose is to determine the effect of GLA supplementation on diabetes-related
      outcomes.
