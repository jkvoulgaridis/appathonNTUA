    <textblock>
      Urinary dysfunctions are widely discussed because they cause problems in social, emotional,

      incontinence. This is a longitudinal study of the type randomized controlled trial. Women
      with urinary incontinence of urgency, effort and effort will be evaluated and treated.
      Frequently asked questions, questions and answers, Quality of Life Questionnaires, Health
      Requirements, ICIQ-SF, ICIQ-OAB, FSFI and evaluation of pelvic, manual and electromyographic
      floor musculature function. As volunteers are drawn in four groups (Group I: Household
      Exercise Sheet / Group II: Ipelvis application / Group III: Household Exercise Sheet + Pelvic
      Physiotherapy / Group IV Ipelvis Application + Pelvic Physiotherapy).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire - Short Form (ICIQ-SF)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 Months</time_frame>
    <description>A tool that assesses the impact of UI on the quality of life and severity of urinary symptoms. The questionnaire is composed of four questions related to frequency, severity of urinary loss and its impact on quality of life. The ICIQ score is the sum of the scores from questions three, four and five and ranges from 0 to 21.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Kings Health Questionnaire (KHQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 Months</time_frame>
    <description>A questionnaire that analyzes the presence of Urinary Incontinence symptoms and their impact on various aspects of individuality in quality of life. The questionnaire is composed of 30 questions subdivided into nine domains. They report, respectively, the general perception of health, the impact of incontinence, role limitations, physical limitations, social limitations, personal relationships, emotions, sleep and energy, and severity measures. To achieve the overall KHQ score, some pre-established calculations were performed, which provided scores for subsequent correlations.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The questionnaire consists of 19 questions, which provide information on five domains of sexual response: desire and subjective stimulation, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction and pain or discomfort. Individual scores are considered by the sum of items that comprise each domain (simple score), which are multiplied by the factor of that domain and can be explored or weighted. A final score (total scores: minimum of 2 and maximum of 36) is the total value of weighted scores for each domain.</description>
