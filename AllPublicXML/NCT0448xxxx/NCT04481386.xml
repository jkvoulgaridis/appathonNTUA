        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female adults, aged 18 years or older at screening.

          2. a) Diagnosis of Diagnosis of Diagnosis of Diagnosis of complex or rhegmatogenous
             retinal detachment, or chronic retinal detachment with failure of gas or silicone oil
             treatment, OR b) Diagnosis of any vitreous haemorrhage that requires vitrectomy
             surgery

          3. BCVA of 20/40 to 20/2000.

          4. Scheduled vitrectomy with vitreous substitute.

          5. Must be able and willing to provide written informed consent, attend all scheduled
             visits and comply with all study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        A participant meeting any of the following criteria was to be excluded from the study:

          1. Any active intraocular or periocular infection or inflammation.

          2. Only one functional eye.

          3. Ocular disorders in the study eye that may confound the interpretation of the study
             results; macular oedema not requiring vitrectomy surgery, choroidal
             neovascularisation.

          4. High refractive error demonstrating &gt;6 diopters of myopia.

          5. Any ophthalmic condition that reduces the clarity of the optical media that interferes
             with ophthalmic examination and adequate imaging (advanced cataract or corneal
             opacities).

          6. Uncontrolled glaucoma defined as intraocular pressure &gt; 30 mmHg on maximal therapy.

          7. Aphakia or absence of the posterior capsule.

          8. Known hypersensitivity to hyaluronic acid or ADH.

          9. Uncontrolled blood pressure defined as systolic value ≥ 160 mmHg or diastolic value
             ≥100 mmHg at screening.

         10. Uncontrolled diabetes defined as glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) &gt; 12%.

         11. Stroke or myocardial infarction within 90 days of baseline.

         12. Severe generalised disease resulting in a life expectancy shorter than 1 year.

         13. Currently pregnant or breastfeeding.

         14. Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of
             becoming pregnant, unless they are using effective methods of contraception during
             dosing of study treatment. Effective contraception methods included:

               -  Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of
                  the participant). Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
                  post-ovulation methods) was not acceptable.

               -  Female sterilisation (surgical bilateral oopthorectomy with or without
                  hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment.
                  In case of oophorectomy alone, this was acceptable only when the reproductive
                  status of the woman was confirmed by follow-up hormone level assessment.

               -  Male sterilisation (at least 6 months prior to screening). For female
                  participants on the study, the vasectomised male partner was to be the sole
                  partner for that participant.

               -  Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or
                  cervical/vault caps).

               -  Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or other
                  forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate&lt;1%),
                  for example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception.

               -  Placement of an intrauterine device or intrauterine system.

               -  In the case of use of oral contraception, women were to be stable on the same
                  pill for a minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment.

               -  The use of an effective contraception method was to continue for 4 months
                  post-vitrectomy and injection of the investigational product, in line with the
                  follow-up period of the study.

               -  Because the experimental investigational product in this study may affect an
                  unborn baby, males participating in this study were not to father a baby while on
                  the study, and for 4 months following the injection of study medication.

               -  Women were considered post-menopausal and not of child-bearing potential if they
                  had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical
                  profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or had surgical
                  bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation, at least
                  six weeks prior to the study. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the
                  reproductive status of the woman was confirmed by follow-up hormone level
                  assessment was she considered to be not of child-bearing potential.

         15. Participation in any study involving an investigational drug or device within the past
             30 days or ongoing participation in a study with an investigational drug or device.

         16. Any clinical evidence that the Investigator felt would place the participant at
             increased risk with the investigational product.
