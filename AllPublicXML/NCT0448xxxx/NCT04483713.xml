  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized study of educational intervention, comparative and prospective about Evidence
      Based Practice (EBP) and its application by clinical nurses in the implementation of EBP
      projects in search of best practice in nursing processes.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Evidence Based Practice (EBP) has become an important issue in nursing. It is considered a
      process consisting of sequential steps. Multiple barriers are found, among them, time
      restriction, lack of personal motivation, professional resistance to research and inadequate
      knowledge. The proposal of this study is to provide Brazilian clinical nurses with tools to
      be used as a guide, with a structured process in stages as a facilitator of the
      implementation of EBP projects in search of best practice in nursing processes, for this the
      investigators will verify the adequacy of authorized translation of the Portuguese version of
      the Johns Hopkins Center for Evidence-Based Practice guide tools and whether these tools are
      facilitators in structuring and describing an EBP project from the perspective of the
      clinical nurse, in addition to verifying whether the EBP project met the requirements of
      preparation from the perspective of the researcher.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Questionnaire to check the suitability of the authorized translation of the portuguese language version of the johns hopkins evidence-based practice guide tools.</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline suitability of the translation of the portuguese language version of the johns hopkins PBE guide tools at immediate post this intervention, an average of 3 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The questionnaire have closed-ended question about the intelligibility of translation for experts, with the possibility of answering yes or no, and an open field for suggestions for changes. In case of inadequacy (which we define as less than four yes answers for the tools), we will make the changes cited by the experts and submit the changed tools to a further expert evaluation.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Questionnaire for the evaluation of the structuring process and description of an evidence-based practice project, from the perspective of the clinical nurse.</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline evaluation of the structuring process and description of an evidence-based practice project, from the perspective of the clinical nurse, at immediate post intervention, through study completion, an average 1 year.</time_frame>
    <description>The instrument has seven questions and one open for comments. The closed questions are related to the description of a clinical question with answer possibilities (very slow; slow; fast; very fast), ease in searching for evidence (challenging; difficult; easy; very easy), understanding of scientific articles (not understandable; partially understandable; understandable; totally understandable), ease in summarizing and classifying the levels of evidence and ease in describing the application of evidence with (challenging; difficult; easy; very easy), elaborating an action plan for disseminating the evidence, in addition to the ease of going through all the phases of a PBE project in relation to the material offered during the workshop (with or without Johns Hopkins tools) with answer possibilities (not helpful; partially helpful; helpful; very helpful), the latter responses are associated with greater ease in the process of structuring and describing an evidence-based practice project.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Compliance verification questionnaire in the exercise of preparing a PBE project, from the researcher's perspective.</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline Compliance verification in the exercise of preparing a PBE project, from the researcher's perspective, at immediate post intervention, through study completion, an average 1 year.</time_frame>
    <description>This tool have five closed questions to verify compliance with the basic requirements and key elements of an EBP project. The closed questions are related to the description of a clinical question with answer possibilities (yes; no), about survey of bibliographic articles with answer possibilities (Sufficient; Partially sufficient; Insufficient), about the classification of evidence according to the level of quality, elaboration of synthesis of the findings relating to the levels of evidence and ability to develop a dissemination plan for the implementation of the PBE project , with answer possibilities ( Yes; Partially; No). The latter answers are associated with a poor conformity in the exercise of structuring and describing an evidence-based practice project from the researcher's perspective.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evidence-Based Practice Questionnaire (EBPQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from de Baseline Evidence-Based Practice at immediate post intervention, through study completion, an average 1 year.</time_frame>
    <description>It is a self-applicable instrument, considered important for assessing the use, opinions and knowledge of nurses about this practice. The instrument assesses attitudes, knowledge and implementation of PBE, uses a Likert-type scale with a score from one, just like never to seven equal to often, in three domains: practice, attitudes and knowledge related to PBE, with higher scores indicating more positive attitudes toward EBP.</description>

    <description>Will receive theoretical and practical training in EBP through a workshop in a structured model with themes related to the introduction to EBP, with the final proposal of a practical class that aims to structure and describe an individual case through an exercise formulated to go through the phases of a project of EBP, to base this exercise we will use a finished and consolidated project, this will be used as a template of the exercise, the description of this exercise is in the programmatic content.</description>

    <description>Will receive the same training as group &quot;Educational Workshop&quot;, plus the presentation and availability of the Johns Hopkins Nursing Evidence-based Practice guide tools to be used in the practice class for the structuring and individual description of the EBP exercise case.

    <intervention_name>Educational Workshop</intervention_name>
    <description>The workshop proposes a review of all stages of EBP which includes approaches to clinical care based on science and the quality of evidence, with the ultimate goal of promoting safe and quality care.
The workshops comprise one for each group with a total workload of six (6) hours divided into two days, lasting three hours each day. The first day will be a theoretical approach and the second day a practical approach.
The workshops with theoretical content and practical classes will be held in rooms of Albert Einstein Hospital.
All participants of both educational strategies will answer the same questionnaires.</description>

It will follow the same molds as the case of group &quot;Educational Workshop&quot; plus the Johns Hopkins Nursing Evidence-based Practice guide tools since the beginning of this practical class, when the participant will receive a description of a problem as a basis for elaborating their clinical question, and thus, move on to the next stage.
The tools will be offered in the case of this group: question development, evidence level and quality guide, research evidence assessment tool, individual evidence tool, evidence synthesis and recommendation tool, action planning tool and tool dissemination.</description>
