  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The carbohydrate periodisation framework is a widely accepted nutritional intervention
      strategy in the field of sports nutrition. However, despite the validity of this approach, it
      is reported that athletes find it difficult to stick to this behaviour and that the support
      required is highly personalised, and as a result time consuming for the coach. Prior research
      has suggested that a digital environment can deliver better personalised dietary
      interventions to better support athletes.

      The overall purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of a mobile (MP app)
      approach against a non-digital (control) approach to improve dietary carbohydrate
      periodisation behaviours in elite athletes over a 12 week period. The study also aims to gain
      wider understanding of the context and implementation of the mobile approach, and how the
      addition of adaptive coach support interventions (Call, MesC, MesP) can further increase the
      effectiveness of the mobile approach.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The non-digital (control) group and mobile group are separately recruited in a 1 : 2 ratio.
      Participants in the non-digital (control) group will receive no intervention from the
      research team for 12 weeks. Participants in the mobile group will receive the menu planner
      app (MP) intervention for 12 weeks.

      For participants receiving MP in the mobile group, a multiple assignment randomized trial
      (SMART) design will be implemented. Participants will be randomized, by teams, to a
      Mobile(static) arm or a Mobile(adaptive) arm using a 1:1 allocation ratio. In the
      Mobile(static) arm, no coach support interventions will be given (participants have the MP
      only for 12 weeks).

      In the Mobile(adaptive) arm, participants will receive coach support interventions
      (Call+MesC, MesC, or MesP) sequentially. Participants will be assessed at week 4 and week 8
      and be categorised as responders (R1 and R2 respectively) and non-responders (NR1 and NR2).
      There will be a maximum of two randomisation points at week 4 and week 8 depending on whether
      they are responders or non-responders.

      Stage 1: Participants will first receive Call+MesC for 4 weeks and will be categorised as
      responder (R1) or non-responders (NR1) at week 4.

      Stage 2a: Non-responders to stage 1 (NR1) will repeat Call+MesC for the next 4 weeks.

      Stage 3a: At week 8, if NR1 participant is a responder (R2), reduce to MesC for another 4
      weeks; if participant is a non-responder (NR2), repeat Call+MesC for another 4 weeks.

      Stage 2b: Responders to stage 1 (R1) will be re-randomised to receive either MesC or MesP for
      the next 4 weeks.

      Stage 3ba: At week 8 for R1 participants receiving MesC, if participant is a responder (R2),
      continue MesC for another 4 weeks; if participant is a non-responder (NR2), go back to
      Call+MesC for another 4 weeks.

      Stage 3bb: At week 8 for R1 participants receiving MesP, if participant is a responder (R2),
      continue MesP for another 4 weeks; if participant is a non-responder (NR2), re-randomise
      participant to receive either MesC or Call+MesC for another 4 weeks.

      All re-randomisations are done at 1:1 allocation ratio.

    <description>A binary success of whether dietary periodisation behaviour has improved in the participant measured by the &quot;periodisation behaviour questionnaire&quot; (in the process of submitting the paper on validation of questionnaire). The scale is 1- does not periodise, 2-periodises energy but not carbohydrate, and 3-periodises both. Higher score indicates better periodisation behaviour. Only score of 3 is considered success.</description>

    <time_frame>At baseline (week 0) and at week 3, 6, 9,12</time_frame>
    <description>The dietary self-efficacy will be assessed using a self-efficacy scale. This questionnaire have been validated in the general population (Stich, Knauper and Tint, 2009). The scale is a 5-point scale from 1 for not confident at all, to 5 for very confident. Higher score indicates higher self-efficacy.</description>

    <description>The beliefs about consequences scale has not yet been validated but has been adapted from previous research on beliefs about capabiilities by Wallin, Boström and Gustavsson (2012). The scale is a 5-point sale from 1- not at all to 5- extremely. Higher scores indicate higher beliefs about consequences.</description>

    <description>The app-based menu planner (MP) given to the participants has an automated carbohydrate periodisation menu planning tool, an educational and motivational nutrition content (infographics, video and text articles), and recipes. Participants using the app will input their training schedule into the app to produce their own menu plans. The behaviour change techniques (BCT) underlying the intervention are goal &amp; planning, feedback &amp; monitoring, shaping knowledge, natural consequences, comparison of behaviour, comparison of outcome, associations, repetitions, reward &amp; threat, regulation and antecedents.
The intermediate assessment of the intervention, is estimated by the adherence to the MP via a tick box system in the app. Participants with more than 60% adherence at end of week 4 and end of week 8 of using the MP are considered responders (R1 and R2 respectively), otherwise they are non-responders (NR1,NR2).</description>
