  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although IVM as a laboratory technology in reproductive medicine has existed for many
      decades, there is a lack of well-designed studies comparing the efficiency and the patient
      satisfaction related to IVM as compared to standard ovarian stimulation for IVF. In view of
      this, and in order to identify unmet needs of fertility specialists with regard to the
      application of IVM, the investigator developed the idea of a worldwide web-based survey
      analysis of fertility specialists' insights and experiences regarding IVM.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The IVM survey will be structured as a series of open questions and multiple-choice
      questions. In most of the questions, a single answer will be required by participants. A
      small number of questions will allow multiple answers. The survey will be web-based.
      Invitations to participate in the survey will be emailed on three occasions to selected
      fertility specialists worldwide who are affiliated to a public or private fertility clinic.
      Clinics will be identified based on whether they have worked with IVM previously but stopped,
      and clinics with appropriate size to offer IVM competence. When no response is obtained from
      selected fertility specialists, e-mails will be sent to affiliated colleagues working at the
      same fertility clinic. When analyzing the survey results, care will be taken to analyse the
      responses per fertility clinic, as responses from different fertility specialists working in
      the same fertility clinic should be avoided. Results will be analysed using a method that
      assigns equal weight per clinic and a method that weights clinic responses based on treatment
      volume (number of IVF cycles).
