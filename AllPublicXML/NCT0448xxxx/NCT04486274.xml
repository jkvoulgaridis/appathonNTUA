  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) with tissue acquisition (TA) is nowadays a well-established
      technique for the sampling of solid lesions pancreatic and non-pancreatic lesions. Actually
      the standard methods to obtain sampling in gastrointestinal (GI) and non-GI solid masses is
      the fine needle aspiration (FNA) performed by endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS). Its
      sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy for malignant cytology are actually reported
      of 85-95%, 95%-98% and 78-95% respectively. These data could be affected by the presence of
      cytopathologist in endoscopy room during the tissue sampling. The rapid on-site evaluation
      (ROSE) has been advocated to significantly increase EUS-FNA accuracy. To overcome this
      problem fine needle biopsy (FNB) for TA to obtain histological specimens was proposed. These
      needles allow as the acquisition of an histological specimen than the cytological one with
      FNA needles. Recently, the need to obtain a histological, instead of a cytological, specimen
      during EUS has become more urgent and necessary due to innovative oncological treatment
      options. An acquired histological specimen could avoid the need of a cytopathologist in the
      endoscopic room, diminishing costs, procedures time, number of passes and reducing the
      additional costs of a possible repeated EUS-FNA, in case of an inconclusive diagnosis.

      With the advent of FNB, the macroscopic on-site evaluation (MOSE) of the specimen by the
      endosonographer was proposed, resulting in a comparable alternative to ROSE.
