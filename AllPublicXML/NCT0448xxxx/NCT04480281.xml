  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Management of postoperative pain in 2020 remains a challenge for anesthesiologists in the
      perioperative period. Lidocaine is an amide local anesthetic, it is one of the oldest
      adjuvant analgesics and is known to possess analgesic, anti-hyperalgesic and
      anti-inflammatory properties. Lidocaine is proven to be as effective as epidural analgesia in
      colorectal surgery.

      However, no study has evaluated the effect of a continuous lidocaine infusion for open lung
      resection in the post-operative period. The present study aims to evaluate the influence of
      IV lidocaine given during and 24 hours after surgery, on pain scores, opioid consumption, and
      possible benefits on patient outcome via the opioid-sparing effect in open thoracic surgery
