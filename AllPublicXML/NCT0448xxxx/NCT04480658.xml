  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Night-time micturition, called nocturia, is a very common problem that unfavourably
      influences sleep- and life-qualities. The International Continence Society (ICS) defines
      nocturia as micturition once or several times during the night. Nocturia is one of the
      cardinal symptoms of overactive bladder (OAB). Persons with nocturia have the intention to
      continue sleep after going to the toilet which does not succeed to the same extent, depending
      on age.

      The natural occurrence of the plant, Bryophyllum pinnatum (BP) which is used in this
      observational study origins from Madagascar as well as in tropical Africa, South America and
      Asia. In the folk medicine of these countries BP is widely used. BP has a calming,
      spasmolytic, anti-inflammatory, pain-relieving, diuretic and cytotoxic effects.

      According to previous preclinical and clinical studies the inhibiting effect of BP on
      overactive bladder was proven. The pharmacological effect of this plant on uterine smooth
      muscle cells, on spontaneous and oxytocin-stimulated contractions, and on detrusor muscle
      cells in an in-vitro model of the pig`s bladder was shown. Smooth muscle relaxation is not
      only required for preventing premature labour but also for symptom's relief of overactive
      bladder (OAB). The flavonoid, aglycons and bufadienolides, are components of the pressed
      juice of the BP leaves that have comparable effects to the standard drug oxybutynin on
      vesical smooth muscle cells.

      Since many year BP is used in obstetrics not only as tocolytics but also as a sedative and
      sleeping pill.

      There are known only few adverse events, such as skin irritation by intravenous application.

      The interest in phytotherapeutical drugs for treatment the chronic diseases is very high and
      Bryophyllum is also frequently used in Switzerland for hyperactive conditions.

      In Switzerland, following the vote on complementary medicine on 17.05.2009, alternative
      treatments will be covered by basic health insurance. Definitive inclusion in the catalogue
      of benefits will be granted if effectiveness, safety and cost-effectiveness can be
      demonstrated.

      The potential and side-effect profile of BP, as well as the social interest in research into
      alternative methods is the background to the implementation of this observational study.

      In the therapeutic concept of the treatment of OAB, antimuscarinic drugs play a central role.
      Antimuscarinics are known to inhibit the contraction of detrusor muscle (smooth muscle cells)
      and block the muscarinic receptor (M2/M3) important for efferent nerve conduction. This
      conventional therapy for OAB can have important adverse effects, notably on the
      gastrointestinal tract with constipation, on the excretory glands in the sense of
      xerostomia/xerophthalmia, on the nerve cells of the brain inhibiting cognitive function and
      in the heart muscle cells accelerating the heart rate. Especially elderly people are affected
      by these undesirable effects. Because of changes in the receptor profile, the effect of
      antimuscarinics and improvement of symptoms might be lowered in elderly people and another
      substance with less side effects would be of great interest. No such adverse effects are
      reported for B. pinnatum. Until now, there are few data for its use in OAB. Efficacy and
      tolerability of B. pinnatum in the treatment of OAB are the major outcome measures of this
      clinical trial.

        -  50 women are included in this observational study, treated with Bryophyllum pinnatum in
           form of the commercially available Bryophyllum tablets into capsules (verum:
           2x2capsules/day). Recruitment time is planned from January, 2018 to January 2022.

        -  Duration of the drug administration is 3 weeks.

        -  Primary endpoint are the reduction of nocturia (measured by filling in a voiding dairy)
           and the change of sleep-quality (measured by using Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index)

        -  secondary endpoints are the improvement of quality of life (measured by using the King's
           Health Questionnaire and the International Consultation on Incontinence Overactive
           Bladder Questionnaire (ICIQ-OAB), two questionnaires, validated for the German language
           and for women with incontinence), increase of the micturition volumes and reduction of
           urge episodes (measured by the patients and recorded in a voiding dairy) and the
           registration of adverse events during the study phase. Ethics committee approval has
           been given.
