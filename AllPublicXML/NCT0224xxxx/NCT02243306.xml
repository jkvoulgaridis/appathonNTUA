  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK1278863 is an orally-active, novel small molecule agent which inhibits hypoxia-inducible
      factor (HIF) prolyl -4- hydroxylases (PHDs) and is in development for the treatment of
      anaemia associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD). As the kidney represents a major site
      of elimination for many drugs and their metabolites, and GSK1278863 will be administered to
      subjects with various stages of renal disease, it is important to characterize the
      pharmacokinetics in this target patient population. The purpose of this study is to
      characterize the pharmacokinetics of GSK1278863 and its metabolites in subjects with end
      stage renal disease (ESRD) undergoing peritoneal dialysis. This will be a repeat-dose,
      open-label, parallel-group study. Approximately 30 subjects with ESRD will be enrolled in two
      cohorts (15 subjects in each cohort) to ensure that 6 subjects on continuous ambulatory
      peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) (cohort 1) and 6 subjects on automated peritoneal dialysis APD
      (cohort 2) complete dosing and critical assessments. GSK1278863 will be administered once
      daily for 14 days. Primary pharmacokinetic assessments will be made on Days 1 and 14.

             mL/daily with a combined weekly (urine and peritoneal dialysis output) Kt/V urea &gt;1.7
             measured at any time within last 3 months.

          -  No history of peritoneal dialysis-associated peritonitis, peritoneal catheter tunnel
             (exit site) infection or leakage for at least 3 months before study.

          -  Meets the following erythropoiesis stimulating agent (ESA) criteria: Is ESA naive
             (i.e., no ESA use within the previous 12 weeks of screening) OR agrees to discontinue
             ESA (if currently using ESA) for at least 7 days prior to first dose of GSK1278863
             until completion of Follow-up visit (If the subject has a scheduled ESA interval which
             is &lt;=7 days, ESA treatment must be discontinued for at least 7 days prior to first
             dose of GSK1278863. If the subject has a scheduled ESA interval which is &gt;7 days, ESA
             treatment must be discontinued for at least the scheduled interval length [e.g., if
             ESA interval is 14 days, then ESA must be discontinued for &gt;=14 days] prior to the
             first dose of GSK1278863)

          -  Has a haemoglobin value: For ESA naïve subjects: &lt;10.0 g/dL (UK site(s) only: &lt;=11.0
             g/dL); For subjects receiving ongoing ESA treatment: &lt;=11.0 g/dL at Screening (UK
             site(s) only: &lt;=12.0 g/dL at Screening).

        OTHER:

          -  Subjects who are &gt;=18 years of age at the time of Screening.

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of: (a) Childbearing potential,
             and agrees to use one of the contraception methods described in the protocol. This
             criterion must be followed from the time of Screening until completion of the
             Follow-up Visit; (b) Non-childbearing potential, defined as pre-menopausal females
             with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12
             months of spontaneous amenorrhea (In questionable cases, a blood sample with
             simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) 23.0-116.3 international units
             (IU)/litre (L) and estradiol &lt;=10 picograms (pg)/mL (or &lt;=37 picomoles [pmol]/L) is
             confirmatory). Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal
             status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception methods described
             in the protocol if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they
             must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal status prior to study
             enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2 months must elapse between the cessation
             of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT.
             Following confirmation of their post-menopausal status, they can resume use of HRT
             during the study without use of a contraceptive method.

        <description>Serial blood samples were collected from participants at indicated time points for Pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis of GSK1278863 and its metabolites (GSK2391220, GSK2487818, GSK2506102, GSK2531398, GSK2531403 and GSK2531401). Geometric mean and geometric coefficient of variation has been presented for all metabolites. NA indicates data is not available. Geometric coefficient of variation could not be calculated for CAPD cohort due to small number of participants.

        <description>Blood samples were collected from participants to evaluate clinical chemistry parameters including glucose, calcium, chloride, CO2, potassium, sodium and urea. Change from Baseline in clinical chemistry parameters at Day 17 are presented. Day-1 was considered as Baseline value. Change from Baseline was calculated as post-randomization values minus Baseline value. Mean and standard deviation are presented. NA indicates data is not available. Standard deviation could not be calculated for CAPD cohort due to small number of participants. Only participants with data available at the specified time point were analyzed.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) and Creatinine Kinase Levels</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected from participants to evaluate clinical chemistry parameters including ALT and creatinine kinase. Change from Baseline in clinical chemistry parameters at Day 3, Day 7, Day 11, Day 14 and Day 17 are presented. Day-1 was considered as Baseline value. Change from Baseline was calculated as post-randomization values minus Baseline value. Mean and standard deviation are presented. NA indicates data is not available. Standard deviation could not be calculated for CAPD cohort due to small number of participants. Only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed (represented by n= X in the category titles).</description>

Geometric mean and geometric coefficient of variation have been presented for all metabolites.

        <description>The observed accumulation ratio was determined to estimate the extent of accumulation for GSK1278863 and metabolites (GSK2391220, GSK2487818, GSK2506102, GSK2531398, GSK2531403 and GSK2531401) after repeat dosing. Accumulation ratio was calculated by using AUC (0-tau) values at Day 1 and Day 14. Analysis was performed using mixed effect model fitted with day (single and repeat dose) as fixed effect and participant as random effect. Mean ratio and 90% confidence intervals have been presented.</description>
