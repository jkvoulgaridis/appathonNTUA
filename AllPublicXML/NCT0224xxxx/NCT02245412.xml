  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this trial were to evaluate the safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) and efficacy of intravenous (IV) ALXN1007 in
      participants with acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) of the lower gastrointestinal (GI)
      tract.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a Phase 2A open-label, non-randomized study to evaluate the safety, tolerability,
      PK/PD, and efficacy of ALXN1007 (a C5a inhibitor) in up to 36 participants with newly
      diagnosed acute GVHD of the lower GI tract. All participants meeting the inclusion and
      exclusion criteria for the study were to receive ALXN1007 over an 8 week treatment period.
      Participants in Cohort 1, the first dosing cohort, were to receive 10 milligrams/kilogram
      (mg/kg) ALXN1007 administered IV once weekly for 8 weeks. Participants in Cohort 2 were to
      receive 20 mg/kg ALXN1007 IV once weekly for 8 weeks. Participants in Cohort 3 were to
      receive 20 mg/kg ALXN1007 IV twice weekly for 8 weeks. All doses of ALXN1007 were to be
      administered as a continuous IV infusion.

    <measure>Overall Acute Graft-Versus-Host Disease (GVHD) Response Rate At Day 28</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>The number of participants with overall acute GVHD response was determined at Day 28. Acute Overall GVHD is defined as improvement from diagnosis in any organ by at least 1 stage, without progression in any other organ, and with no additional therapy being administered. Acute GVHD staging included skin, liver, and GI assessments, which were to be performed using the Modified Keystone Grading Schema. Deaths were considered nonresponders; otherwise last postbaseline values were carried forward for imputation of missing responses. Modified Keystone Grading Schema: Skin - Stages 0 = No Rash, 1 = Rash &lt;25% body surface area (BSA), 2 = 25% to 50% BSA, 3 = &gt;50% BSA, 4 = bullae, desquamation; Lower GI Tract (stool volume over 24 hours) - Stages 0 = &lt;500 mL, 1 = 500 to 1000 mL, 2 = 1001 to 1500 mL, 3 = &gt;1500 mL, 4 = severe abdominal pain +/- ileus, frank blood, or melena; Liver (bilirubin levels) - Stages 0 = ≤2 mg/dL, 1 = 2.1 to 3 mg/dL, 2 = 3.1 to 6 mg/dL, 3 = 6.1 to 15 mg/dL, 4 = &gt;15 mg/dL.</description>

    <measure>Pharmacokinetics (PK): Time To Maximum Observed Concentration In Plasma (Tmax) Of IV ALXN1007</measure>
    <time_frame>Predose up to 72 hours postdose</time_frame>
    <description>The Tmax of ALXN1007 was measured on Treatment Days 1, 28, and 49, from blood samples collected at time points relative to the dosing of ALXN1007. PK assessments were to have been measured from Baseline, Treatment Days 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, and Follow-up Days 86, 180, and Early Termination (ET).
Due to the early termination of the study and the clinical development of the ALXN1007 program, a number of PK analyses were not completed. PK data for the 20 mg/kg ALXN1007 once weekly dosing group and the 20 mg/kg ALXN1007 twice weekly dosing group are not available.</description>

        <title>Overall Acute Graft-Versus-Host Disease (GVHD) Response Rate At Day 28</title>
        <description>The number of participants with overall acute GVHD response was determined at Day 28. Acute Overall GVHD is defined as improvement from diagnosis in any organ by at least 1 stage, without progression in any other organ, and with no additional therapy being administered. Acute GVHD staging included skin, liver, and GI assessments, which were to be performed using the Modified Keystone Grading Schema. Deaths were considered nonresponders; otherwise last postbaseline values were carried forward for imputation of missing responses. Modified Keystone Grading Schema: Skin - Stages 0 = No Rash, 1 = Rash &lt;25% body surface area (BSA), 2 = 25% to 50% BSA, 3 = &gt;50% BSA, 4 = bullae, desquamation; Lower GI Tract (stool volume over 24 hours) - Stages 0 = &lt;500 mL, 1 = 500 to 1000 mL, 2 = 1001 to 1500 mL, 3 = &gt;1500 mL, 4 = severe abdominal pain +/- ileus, frank blood, or melena; Liver (bilirubin levels) - Stages 0 = ≤2 mg/dL, 1 = 2.1 to 3 mg/dL, 2 = 3.1 to 6 mg/dL, 3 = 6.1 to 15 mg/dL, 4 = &gt;15 mg/dL.</description>

        <title>Pharmacokinetics (PK): Time To Maximum Observed Concentration In Plasma (Tmax) Of IV ALXN1007</title>
        <description>The Tmax of ALXN1007 was measured on Treatment Days 1, 28, and 49, from blood samples collected at time points relative to the dosing of ALXN1007. PK assessments were to have been measured from Baseline, Treatment Days 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, and Follow-up Days 86, 180, and Early Termination (ET).
Due to the early termination of the study and the clinical development of the ALXN1007 program, a number of PK analyses were not completed. PK data for the 20 mg/kg ALXN1007 once weekly dosing group and the 20 mg/kg ALXN1007 twice weekly dosing group are not available.</description>

            <title>ALXN1007 20 mg/kg Twice Weekly</title>
            <description>Cohort 3 received 20 mg/kg ALXN1007 IV twice weekly for 8 weeks. For the first 2 participants enrolled, the first ALXN1007 dose was not to be administered on the same day and a safety and tolerability review was to take place after the second (and prior to the third) ALXN1007 dose for each participant. If the ALXN1007 dose was determined to be sufficiently tolerated by the participant, dosing was to continue for that participant. For any other participants enrolled in the dosing cohort, participants were not to proceed to the third ALXN1007 dose prior to the completion of the safety and tolerability review (of the first 2 doses) for the first 2 participants.</description>

          <description>The Tmax of ALXN1007 was measured on Treatment Days 1, 28, and 49, from blood samples collected at time points relative to the dosing of ALXN1007.

Due to the early termination of the study and the clinical development of the ALXN1007 program, a number of PK analyses were not completed. PK data for the 20 mg/kg ALXN1007 once weekly dosing group and the 20 mg/kg ALXN1007 twice weekly dosing group are not available.</description>
