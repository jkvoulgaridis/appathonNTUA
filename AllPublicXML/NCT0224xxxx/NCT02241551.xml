  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized phase II trial. Patients diagnosed with borderline
      resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment arms,
      either mFOLFIRINOX or gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel. After three cycles of treatment in the
      gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel arm and 6 cycles in the mFOLFIRINOX arm, patients will be restaged
      with CT scans and if they remain borderline resectable or have improvement of their disease
      They will then proceed to SBRT followed by surgical resection.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        All patients must meet the following criteria within 28 days of randomization (unless
        otherwise indicated) to be enrolled in the protocol:

          -  Histologically or cytologically proven adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. If the patient
             has mixed tumor with predominant adenocarcinoma pathology, they can be enrolled.

          -  Subjects will be staged according to the 2010 American Joint Committee on Cancer
             (AJCC) staging system with pathologic stage T1-4, N0 being eligible; and have a
             primary tumor of the pancreas (either pancreatic head, neck, uncinate process, or
             body/tail)

          -  The tumor must be deemed as being borderline resectable. Final CT confirmation of
             surgical staging/ eligibility will be at the discretion of the pancreatic surgeon of
             the patient.

          -  Disease is confined to locoregional site as confirmed by the CT and / or diagnostic
             staging laparoscopy to avoid occult peritoneal deposits. Diagnostic laproscopy will be
             only if absolutely required

          -  Measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1) on
             imaging studies CT

          -  Screening Endoscopic ultrasound if done prior to consent but within 6 weeks of
             expected randomization date it may be used.

          -  Karnofsky performance status greater than or equal to 70 or Eastern Cooperative
             Oncology Group (ECOG) performance of 0-2.

          -  Age &gt; 18

          -  If female patient is of child bearing potential, she must have a negative serum
             pregnancy test (βhCG) documented up to 72hrs prior to administration of first study
             drug

             normal (ULN) Total Bilirubin ≤ ULN

          -  Serum Cr within normal limits (WNL)

          -  Coagulation studies with Prothrombin Time and International Normalized Ratio (PT/INR)

             clinically significant by the investigator.

          -  Patient has no evidence of jaundice at the time of enrolment. If stent is required to
             alleviate jaundice, it should be metallic. If patient has a previously placed stent
             and this is plastic, this should be changed to metallic.
