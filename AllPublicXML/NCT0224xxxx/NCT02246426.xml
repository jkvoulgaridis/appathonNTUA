      This study is a multi-site, prospective, parallel arm, double-blind, randomized, controlled
      clinical trial to assess the efficacy of an experimental software program targeting social
      cognitive abilities versus a computer-based software control. Both the study and the software
      being investigated meet the criteria of Non-Significant Risk.

    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of SocialVille, an online
      training program we have recently developed (with support of a Phase I SBIR award) to treat
      the social cognition deficits evident in schizophrenia (DSM-IV ICD-9 Code 295.90).

      SocialVille is a computerized, browser-playable program suite, designed to target information
      processing in the core social cognition domains of deficit in schizophrenia. It can be used
      from any internet-connected computer; through a dedicated clinician portal, the treating
      clinician can register users to treatment, continuously track and monitor their performance,
      and coach users throughout training. The specific aims of the study are:

        1. Specific Aim 1: Evaluate the efficacy of SocialVille as a social cognition treatment in
           individuals with schizophrenia. We will conduct a large-scale, multi-site, double-blind,
           randomized controlled clinical trial of the SocialVille medical device vs. an active
           computer games control, which approximates challenge, computer time and interaction with
           experimenter. This large trial will be conducted at four sites: University of Minnesota
           Medical School (site PI: Dr. Sophia Vinogradov), the Greater Los Angeles VA (Dr. Michael
           Green), Rush University (Dr. Christine Hooker), and University of California, Los
           Angeles (Drs. Joseph Ventura and Keith Nuechterlein). Study participants will complete
           30 hours of training from home. At baseline, mid-way through training and immediately
           following training, we will employ a structured assessment battery with a co-primary SC
           performance measure and a co-primary functional performance measure, as well as
           secondary measures of SC, functional capacity, functional outcome, motivation, and
           quality of life.

        2. Specific Aim 2: Identify specific populations of treatment responders and
           non-responders. We will examine predictors of SC gain based on baseline participant
           demographic, symptom level, computer use, SC, and functional measures, as well as on
           learning rate and plateau performance measures derived over the course of SocialVille
           use to determine if it is possible to identify specific populations that respond very
           well to SocialVille use, or those who are unlikely to respond to SocialVille use.

        3. Specific Aim 3: Evaluate the effects of training on the relatively distinct low vs.
           high-level social cognition constructs. We will separately examine the effects of
           training on the independent SC factors of low level social cue detection and high-level
           inferential process, correlated with clinical symptoms and functional outcome,
           respectively.

    <description>The a priori co-primary social cognitive outcome measure will be a composite score comprised of the following standardized, validated set of assessments:
Penn Emotion Recognition Test (ER40) - A test for visual emotion perception; total percent correct.
Prosody Identification (PROID) - A test for prosody identification; total percent correct.
Penn Facial Memory Test (PFMT) -Immediate recall. A test for immediate recall of faces; total percent correct.
Penn Facial Memory Test (PFMT) - Delayed recall. A test for delayed recall of faces; total percent correct.

    <measure>Change in Performance on the UCSD Performance-based Skills Assessment (Co-Primary Composite Measure)</measure>
    <time_frame>At 6 weeks and At 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The a priori co-primary functional measure will be the functional capacity measure of The UCSD Performance-based Skills Assessment (UPSA) - total correct. Higher scores indicate better performance. We have chosen the UPSA since it is a well-validated measure frequently used in cognitive and SC training studies; In addition, it measures functional capacity, which is expected to be affected by SC change. The UPSA is designed to assess skills in five areas (Household Chores, Communication, Finance, Transportation, and Planning Recreational Activities) that reflect general abilities that are important components of independent living. Test-retest reliability ranged from .63-.80 over follow-up periods up to 36 months in patients with schizophrenia. Among patients, the UPSA performance correlated significantly with severity of negative symptoms and of cognitive impairment but not with that of positive or depressive symptoms.</description>

    <time_frame>At 6 weeks and At 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Between-group magnitude of change in symptomatology utilizing the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) - total score, negative symptoms, positive symptoms. Higher scores are indicative of greater symptomatology. The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) is a medical scale used for measuring symptom severity of patients with schizophrenia. The scale consists of 30 items. Each item is rated on a scale from 1 (symptom not present) to 7 (symptoms extremely severe). Negative subscale consists of 7 items which assesses the negative symptoms with subscale score ranging from 7 to 49, where higher score indicates greater severity.</description>

    <description>Between-group magnitude of change in social functioning utilizing the Social Functioning Scale (SFS). The Social Functioning Scale was constructed specifically to tap areas of social functioning that are crucial to the community maintenance of individuals with schizophrenia. The 7 domains include: social engagement/withdrawal, interpersonal behavior, pro-social activities, recreation, independence-competence, independence-performance, and employment/occupation. The raw scores for each domain are converted to scaled scores, with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15. Higher scores are indicative of greater social functioning.</description>

After each story is read, participants will be asked five questions for: detecting a faux pas, understanding the faux pas, understanding the mental state of the faux pas recipient, understanding the mental state of the person delivering the faux pas and understanding the details but without making inferences about the mental states of the characters in the story. The Faux Pas Test is a Theory of Mind (ToM) measure, which includes 20 short stories, incidents of faux pas (someone mistakenly saying something they shouldn't have). Lower scores indicate poor performance on the task.</description>
