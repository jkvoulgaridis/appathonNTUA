    <textblock>
      In this trial, patients with histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the esophagus or
      esophagogastric junction noneligible for surgery or chemoradiation with curative intent will
      be included. Primary objective is to determine the rate of improvement in dysphagia after
      palliative short course hypofractionated radiotherapy (5 x 4 Gy) followed by chemotherapy
      consisting of oxaliplatin and fluorouracil. The rate of improvement of dysphagia is evaluated
      by a 5 graded dysphagia score, and a positive change of at least 1 score is considered to be
      an improvement.
