  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of linagliptin 5 milligrams once a day
      compared to placebo as as add-on therapy for 24 weeks to stable basal insulin treatment in
      elderly patients, 60 years of age and older, with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and insufficient
      glycaemic control.Stable background therapy of metformin and/or alpha-glucosidase inhibitors
      is also allowed.

      In addition, this trial will assess if linagliptin reduces the risk of hypoglycaemia when
      added to background basal insulin therapy. The treatment duration of this trial (24 weeks)
      will enable assessment of the clinically relevant endpoint of a decrease in glycosylated
      Haemoglobin, a well-accepted measurement of chronic glycaemic control.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) After 24 Weeks of Treatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome has measured difference between HbA1c values from baseline to 24 weeks post treatment. The term 'baseline' refers to the last observation prior to the administration of any randomised study medication. HbA1c is a form of hemoglobin, a blood pigment that carries oxygen, which is bound to glucose. The term HbA1c also refers to glycated hemoglobin. High levels of HbA1c (Normal range is less than 6%) indicate poorer control of diabetes than level in normal range.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Patients Experiencing at Least One Hypoglycaemia Accompanied by a Prespecified Glucose Value.</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Hypoglycaemia accompanied by a prespecified glucose value is defined as any investigator reported hypoglycaemia (event or AE) with a reported blood glucose level of less than 54 milligram/deciLitre (3.0 millimole/Litre) or any investigator reported symptomatic hypoglycaemic AE with a reported blood glucose level of less or equal 70 milligram/deciLitre (3.9millimole/Litre) or any severe hypoglycaemic AE. Severe hypoglycaemia is an event that requires the assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrates or glucagon because the patient is unable to take the substance on his or her own. The confidence intervals mentioned in measure of dispersion are exact 95% confidence interval by Clopper and Pearson. The percentage of patients with at least one hypoglycaemia accompanied by a glucose value less than 54mg/dL alone has also represented separately according American Diabetes Association definition of clinically significant hypoglycaemia.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>This was randomised, double blinded, placebo controlled, parallel study. Total 525 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and insufficient glycaemic control were screened. 302 patients were randomised into two groups. The trial was extended to 52 weeks for Japanese patients. 102 patients were identified and observed for the extended period.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>All patients were screened for eligibility to participate in the trial. Subjects attended specialist sites which would then ensure that they (the subject) met all strictly implemented inclusion/exclusion criteria. Subjects were not to be randomised to trial treatment if any one of the specific entry criteria were violated.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>HbA1c values measured at baseline in percent. HbA1c is a form of hemoglobin, a blood pigment that carries oxygen, which is bound to glucose. The term HbA1c also refers to glycated hemoglobin. High levels of HbA1c (Normal range is less than 6%) indicate poorer control of diabetes than level in normal range.</description>

        <description>This outcome has measured difference between HbA1c values from baseline to 24 weeks post treatment. The term 'baseline' refers to the last observation prior to the administration of any randomised study medication. HbA1c is a form of hemoglobin, a blood pigment that carries oxygen, which is bound to glucose. The term HbA1c also refers to glycated hemoglobin.

        <title>Percentage of Patients Experiencing at Least One Hypoglycaemia Accompanied by a Prespecified Glucose Value.</title>
        <description>Hypoglycaemia accompanied by a prespecified glucose value is defined as any investigator reported hypoglycaemia (event or AE) with a reported blood glucose level of less than 54 milligram/deciLitre (3.0 millimole/Litre) or any investigator reported symptomatic hypoglycaemic AE with a reported blood glucose level of less or equal 70 milligram/deciLitre (3.9millimole/Litre) or any severe hypoglycaemic AE. Severe hypoglycaemia is an event that requires the assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrates or glucagon because the patient is unable to take the substance on his or her own. The confidence intervals mentioned in measure of dispersion are exact 95% confidence interval by Clopper and Pearson. The percentage of patients with at least one hypoglycaemia accompanied by a glucose value less than 54mg/dL alone has also represented separately according American Diabetes Association definition of clinically significant hypoglycaemia.</description>
