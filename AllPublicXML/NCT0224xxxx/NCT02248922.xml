  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study was to evaluate lung clearance index (LCI) by a standardized
      procedure in a well characterized study setting and to assess feasibility of LCI as a more
      sensitive method than forced expiratory volume at 1 second (FEV1) to measure effectiveness of
      antibiotic therapy in patients with CF aged 6 years and older with mild to moderate lung
      disease.

      This study was terminated prematurely. The reason for trial termination was challenge with
      enrollment and patient recruitment. A significant decrease in the eligible patient population
      had been identified as main driver.

    <description>The Lung Clearance Index (LCI), measured by Multiple Breath Washout of a tracer gas reflects the obstruction of airways in the lung. Wash-out was completed by definition at the time point when the inhaled gas concentration declined to 2.5% of its concentration at baseline.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Lung Clearance Index (LCI) After 4 Weeks Following Onset of Study</title>
        <description>The Lung Clearance Index (LCI), measured by Multiple Breath Washout of a tracer gas reflects the obstruction of airways in the lung. Wash-out was completed by definition at the time point when the inhaled gas concentration declined to 2.5% of its concentration at baseline. Washout took longer in patients with more severe disease as gas was trapped in narrowed airways (leading to a higher LCI). A LCI of 7.5 and below is normal.</description>

        <population>Safety Set consisted of All 17 patients (in both arms: TIS and TIP) that entered the study (provided informed consent) and had been exposed to at least one dose of study drug. The efficacy analysis was based on safety set of Tobramycin ALL and not for each separate dosage form arm.</population>
