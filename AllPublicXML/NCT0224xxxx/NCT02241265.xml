  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesis is that there will be improvement in FEV1 in patients with
      severe asthma. This is a retrospective data study that reviews preexisting medical records;
      no patients will be enrolled.

      The investigators plan is to retrospectively evaluate spirometry on patients with severe
      asthma who have undergone bronchial thermoplasty. The procedure will have been done according
      to the recommended protocol of three separate sessions. For each patient all available
      spirometric data obtained before and after thermoplasty will be used. Data will be collected
      from two centers, OU Medical Center and St. Francis Hospital in Tulsa, OK. All procedures
      done at St. Francis have been performed by a single physician and he is providing their
      spirometric data for the investigators study. The following data will be collected for all
      participants undergoing bronchial thermoplasty: Age, height, sex, weight, medical history,
      smoking history, baseline spirometry before and after bronchodilators, post thermoplasty
      spirometry before and after bronchodilators.
