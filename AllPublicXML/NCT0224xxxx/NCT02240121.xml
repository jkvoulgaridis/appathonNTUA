  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to determine the efficacy of rifaximin DR also referred to as
      Extended Intestinal Release (EIR) tablets vs. placebo for the induction of clinical remission
      and endoscopic response following 16 weeks of treatment in participants presenting with
      active moderate Crohn's disease. A key secondary objective is to evaluate clinical and
      endoscopic remission following an additional 36 weeks of treatment.

      RECD3125 is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter, multiregional,
      52-week study to assess the efficacy and safety of rifaximin DR tablets for the induction of
      clinical remission and endoscopic response at 16 weeks followed by clinical and endoscopic
      remission after 52 weeks of continuous therapy in participants with active moderate Crohn's
      disease.

      Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 allocation to rifaximin or placebo at the beginning
      of the treatment period and will maintain treatment assignment throughout the duration of the
      study. Ileocolonoscopy will be performed on all participants at baseline, between Weeks 16
      and 17 (end of the Induction Phase), and following completion of the 36-week Long Term
      Treatment Phase (Week 52).

    <measure>Number of Participants Who Achieved Clinical Symptom Remission (From CDAI Item 1) at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical symptom remission defined by (1) the total number of liquid/very soft stools for the 7 days prior to the Week 16 visit being ≤ 10 (from CDAI Item 1). CDAI score is a weighted, composite index of 8 items (stool frequency, severity of abdominal pain, degree of general well-being, presence or absence of extraintestinal manifestations including fistula, use or non-use of antidiarrheal agents, presence or absence of abdominal mass, hematocrit, and body weight). Scores range from 0 to approximately 600 with higher scores indicating greater disease severity.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Who Achieved Clinical Symptom Remission (From CDAI Item 2) at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical Symptom Remission defined by (2) an abdominal pain (graded from 0 [less severe]-3 [more severe]) rating of ≤ 1 (from CDAI Item 2) on each day for the 7 days prior to the Week 16 visit. CDAI score is a weighted, composite index of 8 items (stool frequency, severity of abdominal pain, degree of general well-being, presence or absence of extraintestinal manifestations including fistula, use or non-use of antidiarrheal agents, presence or absence of abdominal mass, hematocrit, and body weight).

    <measure>Number of Participants With Endoscopic Response Between Week 16 and 17</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 16 to 17</time_frame>
    <description>Endoscopic response defined as a ≥ 3-point decrease in the SES-CD from baseline to the SES-CD score obtained between Week 16 and Week 17. SES-CD scores were calculated from centrally-read digital video of ileocolonoscopies performed at baseline and between Week 16 and Week 17. SES-CD is a validated instrument reflecting an endoscopist's global appraisal of mucosal lesions in Crohn's disease. SES-CD grades lesions by location (5 bowel segments: ileum, right colon, transverse colon, left colon, and rectum) using 4 endoscopic variables: ulcer size, extent of ulcerated surface, extent of affected surface, and presence/type of narrowing. The total SES-CD was calculated as the sum of the 4 variables for the 5 bowel segments: rectum, left colon, transverse colon, right colon, and ileum. Scores range from 0 to 60, with higher scores indicating more severe disease.</description>

          <title>Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's Disease (SES-CD)</title>
          <description>SES-CD is a validated instrument reflecting an endoscopist’s global appraisal of mucosal lesions in Crohn’s disease. SES-CD grades lesions by location (5 bowel segments: ileum, right colon, transverse colon, left colon and rectum) using 4 endoscopic variables: ulcer size, extent of ulcerated surface, extent of affected surface, and presence/type of narrowing. The total SES-CD was calculated as the sum of the 4 variables for the 5 bowel segments: rectum, left colon, transverse colon, right colon, and ileum. Scores range from 0 to 60, with higher scores indicating more severe disease.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Endoscopic Response Between Week 16 and 17</title>
        <description>Endoscopic response defined as a ≥ 3-point decrease in the SES-CD from baseline to the SES-CD score obtained between Week 16 and Week 17. SES-CD scores were calculated from centrally-read digital video of ileocolonoscopies performed at baseline and between Week 16 and Week 17. SES-CD is a validated instrument reflecting an endoscopist's global appraisal of mucosal lesions in Crohn's disease. SES-CD grades lesions by location (5 bowel segments: ileum, right colon, transverse colon, left colon, and rectum) using 4 endoscopic variables: ulcer size, extent of ulcerated surface, extent of affected surface, and presence/type of narrowing. The total SES-CD was calculated as the sum of the 4 variables for the 5 bowel segments: rectum, left colon, transverse colon, right colon, and ileum. Scores range from 0 to 60, with higher scores indicating more severe disease.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With Endoscopic Response at Week 52</title>
          <description>Endoscopic response defined as a ≥ 3-point decrease in the SES-CD from baseline to the SES-CD score obtained at Week 52. SES-CD is a validated instrument reflecting an endoscopist's global appraisal of mucosal lesions in Crohn's disease. SES-CD grades lesions by location (5 bowel segments: ileum, right colon, transverse colon, left colon, and rectum) using 4 endoscopic variables: ulcer size, extent of ulcerated surface, extent of affected surface, and presence/type of narrowing. The total SES-CD was calculated as the sum of the 4 variables for the 5 bowel segments: rectum, left colon, transverse colon, right colon, and ileum. Scores range from 0 to 60, with higher scores indicating more severe disease.</description>

        <description>Clinical remission was defined as a CDAI score of less than 150 points at Week 16. CDAI score is a weighted, composite index of 8 items (stool frequency, severity of abdominal pain, degree of general well-being, presence or absence of extraintestinal manifestations including fistula, use or non-use of antidiarrheal agents, presence or absence of abdominal mass, hematocrit, and body weight). Scores range from 0 to approximately 600 with higher scores indicating greater disease severity.</description>
