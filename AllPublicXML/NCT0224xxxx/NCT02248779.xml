  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to better understand the risk factors and causes of diabetes in
      people who received radiation to the abdomen as children. The investigators hope this
      information will allow them to improve how they screen people at risk for diabetes and how
      they treat patients in the future.

    <description>The following information will be gathered:
A. Height, weight, waist circumference, blood pressure B. Oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT) where in participants will ingest a standard oral glucose load (75 grams) in liquid formulation after an overnight fast. Blood samples for glucose and insulin concentrations will be taken at 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes post-glucose load.
C. Glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), islet cell (ICA-512), and insulin autoantibody (IAA) titers as well as serum adiponectin and hemoglobin A1c.
All enrolled patients will have a discussion with an LTFU doctor regarding the results of testing. Counseling and referral to a specialist will be provided if indicated.</description>
