      This study is designed as a prospective, randomized, double-blind (to subjects and
      examiners), two-arm (ExAblate treated arm vs ExAblate Sham treated control arm) feasibility
      study. All treated subjects will be followed for 12 months.

      Data will be collected to establish the basic safety and clinical efficacy of this type of
      treatment as the basis for later studies that will evaluate the full clinical efficacy.
