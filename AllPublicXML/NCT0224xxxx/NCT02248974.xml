  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to develop a patient-centered decision aid for decision-making
      about end-stage heart failure treatment. This study seeks to create a decision aid that
      presents outcomes, risks, projected experiences, and uncertainties about Left Ventricular
      Assist Device (LVAD) placement to help patients make values-based decisions about placement.
      The investigators propose a mixed methods design involving a literature search of clinical
      evidence, semi-structured patient interviews, and quantitative data from a multi-site trial
      of patients receiving the decision aid compared to patients not receiving the aid.

    <measure>Ottawa Decision Regret Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Month Follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The 'Decision Regret Scale' measures &quot;distress or remorse after a (health care) decision.&quot; In a short introductory statement, respondents should be asked to reflect on a specific past decision, and then asked to indicate the extent to which they agree or disagree with the statements in the regret scale by indicating a number from 1 (Strongly Agree) to 5 (Strongly Disagree) that best indicates their level of agreement. Regret is measured at a point in time when the respondent can reflect on the effects of the decision. Items 2 and 4 should be reverse coded so that, for each item, a higher number will indicate more regret. To help others interpret the score more readily with other scales ranging from 0 to 100, these scores can then be converted to a 0-100 scale by subtracting 1 from each item then multiply by 25. To obtain a final score, the items are summed and averaged. A score of 0 means no regret; a score of 100 means high regret.</description>

    <description>The Preparedness for Decision-Making Scale assesses a patient's perception of how useful a decision aid or other decision support intervention is in preparing the respondent to communicate with their practitioner at a consultation visit and making a health decision (treatment/diagnostic/screening, etc.). Items can be summed and scored (sum the 10 items and divide by 10). B) Scores are converted to a 0-100 scale by: subtracting 1 from the summed score in part a) and multiplying by 25. Higher scores indicate higher perceived level of preparation for decision-making.</description>

    <measure>Shared Decision-Making (SDM-9)</measure>
    <time_frame>1-Week Follow-Up</time_frame>
    <description>A brief patient-report instrument for measuring Shared Decision Making (SDM) in clinical encounters. All question items have a positive valence. Summing up all items leads to a raw total score between 0 and 45. Multiplication of the raw score by 20/9 provides a score forced (transformed) to range from 0 to 100, where 0 indicates the lowest possible level of SDM and 100 indicates the highest extent of SDM. As it is more intuitively interpretable, the authors of the scale encourage the use of the transformed score, which we used.</description>

          <title>LVAD Decision Aid</title>
          <description>Decision aid presented to subjects was developed from patient and clinician feedback to increase patient knowledge on the risks, benefits, misconceptions or mispredictions regarding LVADs to help patients make an informed decision on accepting or declining LVAD placement.
LVAD Decision Aid: Decision aids are interventions or tools designed to facilitate shared decision making and patient participation in health care decisions.
This Decision Aid was designed to discuss treatment options for patients in end-stage heart failure (i.e LVAD PLACEMENT, PALLIATIVE and SUPPORTIVE CARE).</description>

          <description>The standard education processis institution-specific and unstandardized. The education consists of viewing education pamphlets that are created by device manufacturers. The traditional informed consent process may also include viewing and manipulating the actual device and meeting a patient with a device already implanted. Additionally, the LVAD coordinator describes the device and answers any questions LVAD candidates have.</description>

        <title>Ottawa Decision Regret Scale</title>
        <description>The 'Decision Regret Scale' measures &quot;distress or remorse after a (health care) decision.&quot; In a short introductory statement, respondents should be asked to reflect on a specific past decision, and then asked to indicate the extent to which they agree or disagree with the statements in the regret scale by indicating a number from 1 (Strongly Agree) to 5 (Strongly Disagree) that best indicates their level of agreement. Regret is measured at a point in time when the respondent can reflect on the effects of the decision. Items 2 and 4 should be reverse coded so that, for each item, a higher number will indicate more regret. To help others interpret the score more readily with other scales ranging from 0 to 100, these scores can then be converted to a 0-100 scale by subtracting 1 from each item then multiply by 25. To obtain a final score, the items are summed and averaged. A score of 0 means no regret; a score of 100 means high regret.</description>

        <description>The Preparedness for Decision-Making Scale assesses a patient's perception of how useful a decision aid or other decision support intervention is in preparing the respondent to communicate with their practitioner at a consultation visit and making a health decision (treatment/diagnostic/screening, etc.). Items can be summed and scored (sum the 10 items and divide by 10). B) Scores are converted to a 0-100 scale by: subtracting 1 from the summed score in part a) and multiplying by 25. Higher scores indicate higher perceived level of preparation for decision-making.</description>

        <description>A brief patient-report instrument for measuring Shared Decision Making (SDM) in clinical encounters. All question items have a positive valence. Summing up all items leads to a raw total score between 0 and 45. Multiplication of the raw score by 20/9 provides a score forced (transformed) to range from 0 to 100, where 0 indicates the lowest possible level of SDM and 100 indicates the highest extent of SDM. As it is more intuitively interpretable, the authors of the scale encourage the use of the transformed score, which we used.</description>

          <title>Shared Decision-Making (SDM-9)</title>
          <description>A brief patient-report instrument for measuring Shared Decision Making (SDM) in clinical encounters. All question items have a positive valence. Summing up all items leads to a raw total score between 0 and 45. Multiplication of the raw score by 20/9 provides a score forced (transformed) to range from 0 to 100, where 0 indicates the lowest possible level of SDM and 100 indicates the highest extent of SDM. As it is more intuitively interpretable, the authors of the scale encourage the use of the transformed score, which we used.</description>

        <description>Measure of the degree (percentage) of match in patient-reported preferences related to control over treatment decision at Baseline and 1-Month. This data is based on responses to a 1-item questionnaire (i.e. not a scale). Scores are calculated by counting the frequency of matches in patient-reported preferences at two time points. The results are reported as the number of participants with a 1:1 &quot;match&quot; in preferences at both time points.</description>

          <description>This data is based on responses to a 1-item questionnaire (i.e. not a scale). Scores are calculated by counting the frequency of matches in patient-reported preferences at two time points (baseline and 1-month follow-up).</description>
          <population>Analysis only included participants who completed the measure at baseline, minus participants lost to attrition between baseline and 1-month follow-up.</population>

          <title>LVAD Decision Aid</title>
          <description>Decision aid presented to subjects was developed from patient and clinician feedback to increase patient knowledge on the risks, benefits, misconceptions or mispredictions regarding LVADs to help patients make an informed decision on accepting or declining LVAD placement.
LVAD Decision Aid: Decision aids are interventions or tools designed to facilitate shared decision making and patient participation in health care decisions.
This Decision Aid was designed to discuss treatment options for patients in end-stage heart failure (i.e LVAD PLACEMENT, PALLIATIVE and SUPPORTIVE CARE).</description>

          <description>The standard education processis institution-specific and unstandardized. The education consists of viewing education pamphlets that are created by device manufacturers. The traditional informed consent process may also include viewing and manipulating the actual device and meeting a patient with a device already implanted. Additionally, the LVAD coordinator describes the device and answers any questions LVAD candidates have.</description>

      <pi_employee>All Principal Investigators ARE employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>There is NOT an agreement between Principal Investigators and the Sponsor (or its agents) that restricts the PI's rights to discuss or publish trial results after the trial is completed. </restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>No significant limitations to report. One consideration is that because we tested for efficacy at sites with established LVAD programs, results may not be generalizable to other less well-run programs, where effect sizes may be even greater.</limitations_and_caveats>
