    <textblock>
      This is a Prospective study with Randomized patients into either Ultrasound-guided
      Platelets-Rich-Plasma injection and Ultrasound guided Corticosteroid Injection, with 3 months
      and 6 months follow ups after aspiration at our institution. There will be 25 patients in
      each group, including any patient with symptomatic baker's cyst.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of Baker's Cysts are based on its presentation, asymptomatic cysts are
      currently managed conservatively, symptomatic cysts are treated with joint aspiration and
      Corticosteroid injection, which have shown according to literature a decrease of the cyst
      size in approximately two-thirds of patients within 2-7 days but only complete disappearance
      in approximately 7 %. Ultrasound guided cyst aspiration and Corticosteroid injection are also
      used with reduction of cyst's size with recurrence in 6 months of 19%. Surgical options to
      remove the cyst include, Open Resection with a recurrence of 50%, 25% of patients have motion
      limitation recurrence, 37% have wound healing problems or tense swelling of the calf and 75%
      of patients have joint pain lasting more than 2 days. Arthroscopic resection, with no
      recurrence in ultrasound performed 6 and 12 months after procedure, pain lasting more than 3
      days in 28% of patients, mild hematoma in 7% of patients and 7% where converted into an open
      procedure

      There is no study using ultrasound guided aspiration with platelet-rich-plasma injection
      (PRP). The rationale for the use of PRP is the belief that the additional platelets will
      exponentially increase the concentration and release of multiple growth and differentiation
      factors at the injury site to augment the natural healing process9. PRP does not have any
      described negative side effect due to the fact that is being prepared from subject's own
      blood, with no risk of allergy or cross infection, relatively easy for a practiced clinician,
      and reproducible.

    <description>Outcome measure will be determined through the use of the Visual Analogue Score (VAS) and the Rauschning and Lindgren criteria which are used to clinically evaluate the presence of the popliteal cysts, pain, posterior sense of tension in the popliteal fossa and its clinical importance for range of motion reduction. The Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) will be used to assess short and long term outcome of knee related conditions.</description>

    <description>Patients will be asked to stop taking any type of anti-inflammatory medication from 7 days before the procedure to 2 weeks after and fasting for 3 hours before the procedure. At the moment of the procedure, the radiology team will draw 60ml of venous blood from the patient, the blood will be processed with different components of the PRP kit and centrifuged in the SmartPrep PRP machine, to obtain the PRP. The patient is then scanned prone using a linear 14 or 9 megahertz (MHz) transducer. A 20 Gauge spinal needle is usually employed for purposes of aspiration. Sterile saline will be used to confirm needle placement in the cyst in lieu of lidocaine and then inject the PRP by the radiologist.</description>

    <description>Patients will be asked to stop taking any kind of anti-inflammatory medication from 7 days before the procedure to 2 weeks after but fasting in this group won't be required. An ultrasound guided aspiration and triamcinolone (40 mg) diluted with lidocaine without epinephrine and ropivacaine will be used to anesthetize the tissues down to the cyst (including within the cyst for steroid injections). A compression bandage will be placed locally for 7 days. Investigators will monitor any side effect from the injection and treat the patients per standard care - this can include prescription of analgesics.</description>

        <description>Outcome measure will be determined through the use of the Visual Analogue Score (VAS) and the Rauschning and Lindgren criteria which are used to clinically evaluate the presence of the popliteal cysts, pain, posterior sense of tension in the popliteal fossa and its clinical importance for range of motion reduction. The Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) will be used to assess short and long term outcome of knee related conditions.</description>

            <description>Patients will be asked to stop taking any type of anti-inflammatory medication from 7 days before the procedure to 2 weeks after and fasting for 3 hours before the procedure. At the moment of the procedure, the radiology team will draw 60ml of venous blood from the patient, the blood will be processed with different components of the PRP kit and centrifuged in the SmartPrep PRP machine, to obtain the PRP. The patient is then scanned prone using a linear 14 or 9 megahertz (MHz) transducer. A 20 Gauge spinal needle is usually employed for purposes of aspiration. Sterile saline will be used to confirm needle placement in the cyst in lieu of lidocaine and then inject the PRP by the radiologist.

An ultrasound guided aspiration and triamcinolone (40 mg) diluted with lidocaine without epinephrine and ropivacaine will be used to anesthetize the tissues down to the cyst (including within the cyst for steroid injections). A compression bandage will be placed locally for 7 days. Investigators will monitor any side effect from the injection and treat the patients per standard care - this can include prescription of analgesics.
