    <intervention_model_description>All subjects received 18 sessions (3 times per week for 6 weeks) of seated robotic ankle training. Upon analysis, subjects were stratified by average admission gait speed on the 10 Meter Walk Test at comfortable pace, according to clinically established gait speed performance groups: low (&lt;0.4m/sec), moderate (0.4m/sec-0.8m/sec) and high (&gt;0.8m/sec) gait functioning.</intervention_model_description>

        <description>Subjects were stratified based on average admission gait speed on the 10 Meter Walk Test at comfortable pace according to clinically established gait speed performance groups: low (&lt;0.4m/sec), moderate (0.4m/sec-0.8m/sec) and high (&gt;0.8m/sec) functioning. Mean gait speeds on the 10m Walk Test at comfortable pace (m/sec) were then compared across these three groups (low, moderate, and high function) at three timepoints (baseline, discharge (week 6), and 3 month FU (overall week 18)).</description>

          <description>Subjects were stratified based on average admission gait speed on the 10 Meter Walk Test at comfortable pace according to clinically established gait speed performance groups: low (&lt;0.4m/sec), moderate (0.4m/sec-0.8m/sec) and high (&gt;0.8m/sec) functioning. Mean gait speeds on the 10m Walk Test at comfortable pace (m/sec) were then compared across these three groups (low, moderate, and high function) at three timepoints (baseline, discharge (week 6), and 3 month FU (overall week 18)).</description>
