  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our overall objective with this study is firstly to provide a comprehensive assessment of
      intestinal permeability, mucosal barrier function using existing biomarkers and secondly to
      explore novel biomarkers for measuring intestinal permeability in patients with constipation
      predominant Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS-C).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In order to determine the differences in permeability in IBS-C in comparison with healthy
      volunteers, the following will be determined: differences in in vivo small intestinal and
      colonic permeability, differences in small intestinal and colonic mucosal barrier function,
      differences in effects of fecal supernatants on barrier function of T84 monolayers, and
      differences in novel biomarkers for intestinal permeability

    <time_frame>8-24 hr post test-dose administration</time_frame>
    <description>In vivo measurement of intestinal permeability using 13C mannitol &amp; lactulose was used. High performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used to measure concentrations calculated using the overall urine volume excreted in each interval. Concentrations of 13C adjusted for the % of 13C in 12C mannitol (4.98% of 12C mannitol excreted was subtracted from 13C mannitol values; determined by analyzing replicate samples of control urine). All lactulose or 13C mannitol concentrations 8-24hr post-ingestion were used to determine colonic permeability. Lactulose to 13C mannitol excretion ratios, as a measure of dose of saccharide administered, were calculated.</description>

        <description>In vivo measurement of intestinal permeability using 13C mannitol &amp; lactulose was used. High performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used to measure concentrations calculated using the overall urine volume excreted in each interval. Concentrations of 13C adjusted for the % of 13C in 12C mannitol (4.98% of 12C mannitol excreted was subtracted from 13C mannitol values; determined by analyzing replicate samples of control urine). All lactulose or 13C mannitol concentrations 8-24hr post-ingestion were used to determine colonic permeability. Lactulose to 13C mannitol excretion ratios, as a measure of dose of saccharide administered, were calculated.</description>

            <description>Volunteers fasted for eight hours and underwent sedated esophagogastroduodenoscopy. Duodenal impedance measurements were performed using a endoscopically passed catheter that measures electrical impedance of the duodenal epithelium by mucosal contact under direct visualization. A 2 mm diameter catheter was used with two 360° circumferential sensors placed at a separation of 2mm with the end of the distal ring being 1mm away from the catheter tip. The electrodes were connected to an impedance voltage transducer via thin wires, which ran the length of the catheter traversing through the working channel of the upper endoscope. The voltage generated by the transducer was limited to produce 10µA current at a frequency of 2 kHz. Impedance was measured every 90° in duodenal circumference with a decompressed lumen after suctioning of all fluid from the lumen. The catheter was embedded in the mucosa parallel to the two sensors and measurements were taken from a steady baseline for &gt;10s.</description>
