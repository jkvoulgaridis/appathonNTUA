  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 3 study evaluated the efficacy and safety of 1 milligram/kilogram (mg/kg)
      intravenous (IV) infusions of SBC-102 (sebelipase alfa) administered every other week (qow)
      in participants with late onset lysosomal acid lipase deficiency (LAL-D) (cholesteryl ester
      storage disease [CESD]).

      Late-onset LAL-D is an underappreciated cause of cirrhosis, liver failure and dyslipidemia.
      There is currently no standard treatment for LAL-D other than supportive care. Enzyme
      replacement therapy may be a potential new treatment option for LAL-D participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lysosomal acid lipase deficiency (LAL-D) is a genetic disease characterized by abnormal lipid
      accumulation in many parts of the body due to a marked decrease in activity of the enzyme
      lysosomal acid lipase (LAL).

      The LAL-D disease spectrum ranges from a presentation in infants that is rapidly progressive
      to a presentation that occurs in childhood, adolescence, or less frequently, in adulthood in
      which the rate of disease progression is more variable. Irrespective of where a patient is on
      the disease spectrum, LAL-D is associated with significant burden of disease and a shortened
      life expectancy in some patients.

      The non-infantile onset form of the disease, also known as CESD, occurs in both children and
      adults and is an under-appreciated cause of fatty liver with prominent microvesicular
      steatosis, fibrosis, and cirrhosis. Although the natural history of the disease has not been
      well studied, serious complications are frequently described, including early death, liver
      transplantation, or cardiovascular accidents. Other complications include premature
      atherosclerosis (hardening of arteries) associated with high levels of total cholesterol and
      low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, often called the &quot;bad&quot; cholesterol. The levels of
      triglycerides can also be high and the levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol
      (the &quot;good&quot; cholesterol) are typically low.

      In the past, treatments mainly focused on control of the lipid abnormalities through diet and
      the use of lipid-lowering medications, which only address some aspects of the disease, while
      progression to fibrosis and cirrhosis may still occur. In preclinical studies and clinical
      studies in participants with LAL-D, treatment with SBC-102 (sebelipase alfa, Kanuma®) has
      been shown to produce improvements in markers of liver damage and in the lipid abnormalities.
      The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of using SBC-102 to treat LAL-D through
      a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blinded study in children and adults.

      This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study involving 66
      participants evaluated the safety and efficacy of enzyme-replacement therapy with sebelipase
      alfa (administered intravenously at a dose of 1 mg/kg of body weight qow). The study included
      a 20-week placebo-controlled period followed by open-label treatment periods for all
      participants. The primary end-point was normalization of the alanine aminotransferase level.
      Secondary end-points included additional disease-related efficacy and safety assessments.

      Final study results have not been published in a peer-reviewed journal.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>A total of 56 study centers located in 17 countries were initiated in this study. Participants were enrolled and treated at 41 centers in 16 countries, including 35 primary centers where participants initiated treatment and 6 qualified local medical centers where participants who were medically stable were transferred for long-term treatment.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>To assess eligibility, participants were screened for a period of up to 6 weeks prior to enrollment in the study. A total of 86 participants were screened. Six of these participants underwent rescreening (of which 2 were eligible for the study). In total, 66 participants were eligible for the study and 20 participants were screen failures.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Percentage Of Participants Achieving Alanine Aminotransferase Normalization</title>
        <description>Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) normalization was defined as an abnormal baseline value (ALT &gt; the age- and gender-specific upper limit of normal [ULN] provided by the central laboratory performing the assay) that becomes normal (&lt; ULN). Alanine aminotransferase normalization was evaluated at the end of the Double-blind Period (the last double-blind assessment) and at the end of the Open-label Period (last open-label assessment). Baseline for the Open-label Period was defined relative to the first infusion of sebelipase alfa, which occurred at Week 0 for participants in the sebelipase alfa/sebelipase alfa group and Week 22 for participants in the placebo/sebelipase alfa group. The last open-label assessment varied by participant, depending on whether a participant completed treatment through Week 256 or discontinued prior to this timepoint to transition out of clinical study settings.</description>

        <title>Percentage Of Participants Achieving Aspartate Aminotransferase Normalization</title>
        <description>Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) normalization was defined as an abnormal baseline value (AST &gt; the age- and gender-specific ULN provided by the central laboratory performing the assay) that becomes normal (&lt; ULN). AST normalization was evaluated at the end of the Double-blind Period (the last Double-blind assessment) and at the end of the Open-label Period (last open-label assessment).
Baseline for the Open-label Period was defined relative to the first infusion of sebelipase alfa, which occurred at Week 0 for participants in the sebelipase alfa/sebelipase alfa group and Week 22 for participants in the placebo/sebelipase alfa group. The last open-label assessment varied by participant, depending on whether a participant completed treatment through Week 256 or discontinued prior to this timepoint to transition out of clinical study settings.</description>

          <title>Percent Change From Baseline In Liver Fat Content</title>
          <description>Decrease in liver fat content, as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), was evaluated in participants for whom imaging was performed. Baseline for the Open-label Period was defined relative to the first infusion of sebelipase alfa, which occurred at Week 0 for participants in the sebelipase alfa/sebelipase alfa group and Week 22 for participants in the placebo/sebelipase alfa group. The last open-label assessment varied by participant, depending on whether a participant completed treatment through Week 256 or discontinued prior to this timepoint to transition out of clinical study settings.</description>
