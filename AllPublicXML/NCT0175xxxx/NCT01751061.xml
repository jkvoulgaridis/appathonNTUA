    <textblock>
      Deciding about prolonged life support for critically ill patients can be very difficult.
      Therefore, the investigators are doing a study to see if an internet-based decision aid can
      improve the quality of decision making for substitute decision makers of patients who are in
      the intensive care unit (ICU).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The process of making a decision about whether or not to provide prolonged life support is
      seriously deficient among clinicians and the surrogate decision makers for critically ill
      patients. To address this problem, we propose a randomized, controlled trial to determine if
      an innovative web-based decision aid compared to usual care control can improve the quality
      of decision making (defined as clinician-surrogate concordance for prognosis, quality of
      communication, and medical comprehension), reduce surrogates' psychological distress
      (depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress syndrome disorder (PTSD) symptoms), and
      reduce patients' health care costs over 6-month follow up. We will enroll 410 surrogate
      decision makers for 273 patients (expected average of 1.5 surrogates per patient). This study
      has the potential both to improve how clinicians and surrogates interact in intensive care
      units and to increase the likelihood that life support decisions are aligned with patients'
      values.

    <measure>Change in Clinician-surrogate Concordance Scale Score</measure>
    <time_frame>~2-7 days post-randomization</time_frame>
    <description>Concordance is calculated as the absolute value of the difference in prognosis for 1 year patient survival between the surrogate(s) and the clinician (ICU physician), and, therefore, can range from 0 to 100.
We report pre-intervention to post-intervention difference in the CSCS.
The CSCS is calculated as the absolute value of the difference between the surrogate's response and that of either the treating ICU physician (primary outcome) or the nurse (secondary outcome) to the question, &quot;What percent chance do you think [the patient/your loved one] has of being alive 1 year from now if the current treatment plan is continued?&quot; Scores can range from 0 to 100 percentage points, and higher values indicate greater discordance.</description>

    <description>We report here the difference between Interview 1 (baseline) and Interview 4 (6 months post-randomization) for primary surrogate decision makers (not secondary).
HADS scores can range from 0 to 42 points; higher scores=more distress.</description>

Scores can range from 12-48 points, with higher scores=greater patient-centeredness.</description>

        <title>Change in Clinician-surrogate Concordance Scale Score</title>
        <description>Concordance is calculated as the absolute value of the difference in prognosis for 1 year patient survival between the surrogate(s) and the clinician (ICU physician), and, therefore, can range from 0 to 100.
We report pre-intervention to post-intervention difference in the CSCS.
The CSCS is calculated as the absolute value of the difference between the surrogate's response and that of either the treating ICU physician (primary outcome) or the nurse (secondary outcome) to the question, &quot;What percent chance do you think [the patient/your loved one] has of being alive 1 year from now if the current treatment plan is continued?&quot; Scores can range from 0 to 100 percentage points, and higher values indicate greater discordance.</description>
        <time_frame>~2-7 days post-randomization</time_frame>
        <population>Note that the discrepancy between the number of surrogates in these analyses (122 and 127) differs from those enrolled (137 and 138). This is because the CSCS requires complete data at both Interview 1 and Interview 2. Some patients died or regained decisional capacity before Interview 2, leading to loss of surrogates' data.</population>

            <non_inferiority_desc>To test the primary hypothesis, we used a general linear model fit with generalized estimating equations, a linear link, and an exchangeable correlation (PROC GENMOD). Model parameters included indictor variables for intervention, Interview 2, the interaction between intervention and Interview 2, and a 4-level site variable. The mean CSCS between-groups difference, corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI), and p value were derived from the intervention-by-Interview 2 interaction term.</non_inferiority_desc>

        <description>Concordance is calculated as the absolute value of the difference in prognosis for 1 year patient survival between the primary surrogate decision maker and the IUC nurse, and, therefore, can range from 0 to 100.
We report pre-intervention to post-intervention difference in the CSCS.
The CSCS is calculated as the absolute value of the difference between the surrogate's response and that of the nurse to the question, &quot;What percent chance do you think [the patient/your loved one] has of being alive 1 year from now if the current treatment plan is continued?&quot; Scores can range from 0 to 100 percentage points, and higher values indicate greater discordance.</description>

            <groups_desc>To test the hypothesis, we used a general linear model fit with generalized estimating equations, a linear link, and an exchangeable correlation (PROC GENMOD). Model parameters included indictor variables for intervention, Interview 2, the interaction between intervention and Interview 2, and a 4-level site variable. The mean CSCS between-groups difference, corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI), and p value were derived from the intervention-by-Interview 2 interaction term.</groups_desc>
