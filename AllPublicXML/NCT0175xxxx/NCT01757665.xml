  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this trial is to confirm that the modifications to tissue processing, valve
      sterilization and packaging do not raise any new questions of safety and effectiveness in
      subjects who require replacement of their native or prosthetic aortic or mitral valve.
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multicenter, prospective, single arm trial - Up to seven hundred (700) aortic valve
      replacement (AVR) subjects and up to one hundred seventy-five (175) mitral valve replacement
      (MVR) subjects at up to forty (40) clinical sites will be enrolled. The trial will include
      male and female patients, 18 years or older, requiring replacement for a diseased, damaged,
      or malfunctioning native or prosthetic aortic or mitral valve. Patients will be followed and
      assessed after implant for up to 5 years.

    <description>Laboratory Analysis of International Normalized Ratio (INR) on blood drawn from subjects. The INR is a calculation based on results of a prothrombin time (PT). The PT is a blood test that measures the time it takes for the plasma (liquid portion of the blood) to clot. INR results will vary according to a person's age, the medicines they take, and any health problems they may have. In general, the higher the INR number, the longer it takes for the blood to clot. In healthy people an INR of 1.1 or below is considered normal. An INR range of 2.0 to 3.0 is generally an effective therapeutic range for people taking blood thinner medication.</description>

        <description>The rate of implanted subjects that experience structural valve deterioration (SVD) of the trial valve by the time of the post operative day (POD) 390 follow‐up visit. Structural valve deterioration includes dysfunction or deterioration intrinsic to the valve. Examples of SVD includes complications such as wear, fracture, calcification, leaflet tear.</description>

The SVD result combines the aortic and mitral implanted subjects. The study was powered for the combined cohort for this endpoint as there would be too few mitral subjects to report the arms separately.</population>

Valvular regurgitation is evaluated by echocardiography over time. It is assessed on a scale from 0 to 4, where 0 represents no regurgitation and 4 represents severe regurgitation.</description>

        <title>Subject's Amount of Total Valvular Regurgitation Over Time - 11000M</title>
        <description>Mitral valvular regurgitation occurs when the mitral valve in the heart does not close tightly allowing some of the blood that was pumped out of the heart to leak back into it. Mitral valvular regurgitation is evaluated by echocardiography over time. It is assessed on a scale from 0 to 4, where 0 represents no regurgitation and 4 represents severe regurgitation.</description>

        <title>Subject's Amount of Paravalvular Leak Over Time - 11000A</title>
        <description>Paravalvular leak refers to blood flowing through a channel between the implanted artificial valve and the cardiac tissue as a result of inappropriate sealing.
Paravalvular leak is evaluated by echocardiography over time. It is assessed on a scale from minimum of 0 to maximum of 4, where 0 = no leak, 1 = a trace leak, 2 = a mild leak, 3 = a moderate leak, and 4 = a severe leak. Higher numbers on the scale show a worsening outcome.</description>

        <title>Subject's Amount of Paravalvular Leak Over Time - 11000M</title>
        <description>Paravalvular leak refers to blood flowing through a channel between the implanted artificial valve and the cardiac tissue as a result of inappropriate sealing.
Paravalvular leak is evaluated by echocardiography over time. It is assessed on a scale from minimum of 0 to maximum of 4, where 0 = no leak, 1 = a trace leak, 2 = a mild leak, 3 = a moderate leak, and 4 = a severe leak. Higher numbers on the scale show a worsening outcome.</description>

        <description>The New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification system relates symptoms to everyday activities and the patient's quality of life.
Class I. No limitation of physical activity. Ordinary physical activity does not cause undue fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea (shortness of breath).
Class II. Slight limitation of physical activity. Comfortable at rest. Ordinary physical activity results in fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea (shortness of breath).
Class III. Marked limitation of physical activity. Comfortable at rest. Less than ordinary activity causes fatigue, palpitation, or dyspnea.
Class IV. Unable to carry on any physical activity without discomfort. Symptoms of heart failure at rest. If any physical activity is undertaken, discomfort increases.</description>

        <description>The Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form 12 (SF-12) contains two components - the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and the Mental Component Summary (MCS).
The SF-12 Physical Component Summary questionnaire scale ranges from a maximum of 100, which reflects the best health status to a minimum of 0, which reflects the worst health status.
The SF-12 Mental Component Summary scale ranges from a maximum of 100, which reflects the best health status to a minimum of 0, which reflects the worst health status.</description>

        <title>Subject's Average International Normalized Ratio</title>
        <description>Laboratory Analysis of International Normalized Ratio (INR) on blood drawn from subjects. The INR is a calculation based on results of a prothrombin time (PT). The PT is a blood test that measures the time it takes for the plasma (liquid portion of the blood) to clot. INR results will vary according to a person's age, the medicines they take, and any health problems they may have. In general, the higher the INR number, the longer it takes for the blood to clot. In healthy people an INR of 1.1 or below is considered normal. An INR range of 2.0 to 3.0 is generally an effective therapeutic range for people taking blood thinner medication.</description>
