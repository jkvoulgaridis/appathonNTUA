    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline in Urinary Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio (UACR) Across 12 Weeks of Treatment With BMS-813160</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16 (Follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>The presence of albumin in the urine (macroalbuminuria) is a marker of kidney disease. Albumin and creatinine concentrations were obtained from spot urine samples. UACR was calculated as the geometric mean of two first-morning void urine UACR measurements with samples collected on two separate occasions within a 4-day period.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Who Died and With Other (Not Including Serious) Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>From the date of subject's written consent until 30 days post discontinuation of dosing, assessed up to 26 months</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (example, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. An SAE is an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death, initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization, life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying), persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or a congenital anomaly, or a medically important event.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Out-of-Range Electrocardiogram (ECG) Interval</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>12-lead ECGs were performed before and 1 hour after dosing at Weeks 0, 2 and 4. ECGs were recorded after the participant has been supine for at least 5 minutes. The PR interval was defined as the beginning of the P wave to the beginning of the QRS complex, and represents the time taken by electrical impulse to travel from the sinus node through the atrioventricular (AV) node. The QRS complex represented the rapid depolarization of the right and left ventricles. The QT interval was defined as the time from the start of the Q wave to the end of the T wave, and represents the time taken for ventricular depolarization and repolarization. Participants were evaluated for abnormal ECG intervals. Criteria's for abnormality were PR &gt;200, QRS &gt;120, QT &gt;500, QTcF &gt;450, Change From Baseline &gt;30 milliseconds (msec).</description>

    <measure>Trough Observed Plasma Concentration (Ctrough) of BMS-813160</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-dose at Week 2, 4, 8, 12 and 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours post-dose at Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Ctrough is the minimum estimated plasma concentration at steady state.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Area Under The Plasma Concentration-Time Curve From Time Zero to 6 Hours Post-Dose [AUC(0-6 h)]</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours post-dose at Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>AUC(0-6 h) is the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from pre-dose (0 h) to 6 h post-dose.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Renal Clearance (CLr) of BMS-813160</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours post-dose at Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>CLr was calculated by dividing the total amount excreted in the urine from 0 to 6 hours by the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero extrapolated to infinite time. The renal function was classified based on estimated glomerular filtration rate as normal (&gt;=90 mL/min/1.73 m^2), mildly impaired (60-89 mL/min/1.73 m^2), moderately impaired stage 3A (45-59 mL/min/1.73 m^2), and moderately impaired stage 3B (30-44 L/min/1.73 m^2).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dose-Response Relationship Using Change in Baseline Urinary Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio (UACR) Across 12 Weeks of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12</time_frame>
    <description>The presence of albumin in the urine (macroalbuminuria) is a marker of kidney disease. Albumin and creatinine concentrations were obtained from spot urine samples. UACR was calculated as the geometric mean of two first-morning void urine UACR measurements with samples collected on two separate occasions within a 4-day period. The effect of BMS-813160 on urinary albumin excretion as measured by UACR values in participants with diabetic kidney disease after 12 weeks of treatment was assessed. The model included treatment group as a main effect, and the log of baseline UACR values, as well as baseline values of eGFR, blood pressure, blood glucose and lipid levels, as covariates.</description>

        <description>The presence of albumin in the urine (macroalbuminuria) is a marker of kidney disease. Albumin and creatinine concentrations were obtained from spot urine samples. UACR was calculated as the geometric mean of two first-morning void urine UACR measurements with samples collected on two separate occasions within a 4-day period.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Out-of-Range Electrocardiogram (ECG) Interval</title>
        <description>12-lead ECGs were performed before and 1 hour after dosing at Weeks 0, 2 and 4. ECGs were recorded after the participant has been supine for at least 5 minutes. The PR interval was defined as the beginning of the P wave to the beginning of the QRS complex, and represents the time taken by electrical impulse to travel from the sinus node through the atrioventricular (AV) node. The QRS complex represented the rapid depolarization of the right and left ventricles. The QT interval was defined as the time from the start of the Q wave to the end of the T wave, and represents the time taken for ventricular depolarization and repolarization. Participants were evaluated for abnormal ECG intervals. Criteria's for abnormality were PR &gt;200, QRS &gt;120, QT &gt;500, QTcF &gt;450, Change From Baseline &gt;30 milliseconds (msec).</description>

        <description>The presence of albumin in the urine (macroalbuminuria) is a marker of kidney disease. Albumin and creatinine concentrations were obtained from spot urine samples. UACR was calculated as the geometric mean of two first-morning void urine UACR measurements with samples collected on two separate occasions within a 4-day period. The effect of BMS-813160 on urinary albumin excretion as measured by UACR values in participants with diabetic kidney disease after 12 weeks of treatment was assessed. The model included treatment group as a main effect, and the log of baseline UACR values, as well as baseline values of eGFR, blood pressure, blood glucose and lipid levels, as covariates.</description>
