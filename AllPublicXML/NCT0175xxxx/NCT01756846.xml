  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim of this study is to quantify the impact of the use of the HEART risk score on patient
      outcome and on costs in patients with chest pain presenting at the emergency room, as
      compared to not using the score.

    <textblock>
      During 14 months, patients presenting with chest pain to the Emergency Department (ED) of
      participating hospitals will be included in the study. First, all hospitals will apply 'usual
      care' to all patients, i.e. risk assessment and subsequent management without application of
      the HEART score. Then, during a 14 month period, each 1,5 month 1 randomly allocated hospital
      will sequentially start to apply the HEART score in all chest pain patients (intervention
      period); during this intervention period patients with a HEART score 0-3 will not be admitted
      to the hospital (in accordance with the results of our validation studies), and patients with
      a HEART score above 3 will be treated according to current guidelines.

    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Information on quality of life (QoL) and costs was collected in 5 of the 9 hospitals. Costs for health care resource use were calculated based on Dutch guidelines and cost tables for hospitals. Different costs were used for academic and general hospitals, and costs were adjusted for inflation by using the consumer price indices provided by Statistics Netherlands. For each patient the costs were calculated based on the observed number and type of health care resources used and the type of hospital (academic/general). Data on resource use were collected for each patient in the 5 hospitals; no data were missing. QoL was derived from the EQ-5D-3L questionnaire, consisting of 5 questions (dimensions) with 3 answers each, from which QoL scores (utility values, 0-1, the higher the better) can be directly derived. Quality-adjusted life-years (scale 0-100, higher the better) were calculated over a period of 3 months, based on the estimated QoL values at 0 weeks, 2 weeks, and 3 months.</description>

    <measure>Pre-specified Subgroup Analyses</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To assess whether the effectiveness and/or safety of using the HEART (history, ecg, age, risk factors, troponin) score (scale 0-10, with higher scores meaning a higher risk on MACEs) is different between specific patient populations, the following pre-specified subgroup analyses will be performed: Age: below and above 62 years of age (median), Gender: Men vs Women, Diabetics vs non-diabetics, Ethnicity: Caucasian vs. other ethnicity.
RESULTS: None of the pre-specified subgroup analyses of women, elderly patients, and diabetic patients showed a statistically significantly different effect of HEART care with respect to incidence of MACEs. Ethnicity was unfortunately not possible to analyse due to too much missing data.
NB. I am currently not working in the organisation which has the data, and this will not be possible the coming period. Therefore, I cannot provide correct numbers currently on these subgroup analyses, only conclusions. I am sorry for this inconvenience.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients presenting with chest pain to the (cardiac) ED of ten participating Dutch
             hospitals, older than 18 years.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Children (age &lt;18 years) are excluded from study participation. Subjects who are (for
             whatever reason) not able to fill in questionnaires are excluded from study
             participation. Legal incapacity of every patient will be assessed by the attending
             doctor, according to the guidelines of legal incapacity. In case of doubt,
             consultation of the cardiologist (primary local investigator) will be possible.

        <description>Information on quality of life (QoL) and costs was collected in 5 of the 9 hospitals. Costs for health care resource use were calculated based on Dutch guidelines and cost tables for hospitals. Different costs were used for academic and general hospitals, and costs were adjusted for inflation by using the consumer price indices provided by Statistics Netherlands. For each patient the costs were calculated based on the observed number and type of health care resources used and the type of hospital (academic/general). Data on resource use were collected for each patient in the 5 hospitals; no data were missing. QoL was derived from the EQ-5D-3L questionnaire, consisting of 5 questions (dimensions) with 3 answers each, from which QoL scores (utility values, 0-1, the higher the better) can be directly derived. Quality-adjusted life-years (scale 0-100, higher the better) were calculated over a period of 3 months, based on the estimated QoL values at 0 weeks, 2 weeks, and 3 months.</description>

        <title>Pre-specified Subgroup Analyses</title>
        <description>To assess whether the effectiveness and/or safety of using the HEART (history, ecg, age, risk factors, troponin) score (scale 0-10, with higher scores meaning a higher risk on MACEs) is different between specific patient populations, the following pre-specified subgroup analyses will be performed: Age: below and above 62 years of age (median), Gender: Men vs Women, Diabetics vs non-diabetics, Ethnicity: Caucasian vs. other ethnicity.
RESULTS: None of the pre-specified subgroup analyses of women, elderly patients, and diabetic patients showed a statistically significantly different effect of HEART care with respect to incidence of MACEs. Ethnicity was unfortunately not possible to analyse due to too much missing data.
NB. I am currently not working in the organisation which has the data, and this will not be possible the coming period. Therefore, I cannot provide correct numbers currently on these subgroup analyses, only conclusions. I am sorry for this inconvenience.</description>

          <description>HEART care: usual care, complemented by calculation of the HEART score and following the recommended policy.
During 14 months, patients presenting with chest pain to the ED of participating hospitals were included in the study. First, all hospitals applied 'usual care' to all patients, i.e. risk assessment and subsequent management without application of the HEART score. Then, during a 14 month period, each 1,5 month 1 randomly allocated hospital sequentially started to apply the HEART score in all chest pain patients (intervention period); during this intervention period patients with a HEART score 0-3 were advised not be admitted to the hospital, and patients with a HEART score above 3 were advised to be treated according to current guidelines.</description>
