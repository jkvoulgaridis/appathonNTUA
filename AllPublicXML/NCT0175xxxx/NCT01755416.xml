  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypothesis: In type 1 diabetes mellitus, in the setting of a closed loop glucose control
      system: adjunctive therapy with Liraglutide will afford better post-prandial glycemic
      excursions than insulin mono-therapy.

      Specific Aim: To determine if post-prandial glucose excursions are lowered with the addition
      of Liraglutide compared to insulin mono-therapy.

      Study Design: This is a randomized open labeled crossover design trial comparing adjuvant
      Liraglutide and insulin Vs. insulin mono-therapy using the ePID closed-loop system for
      insulin delivery.

      After the screening visit, subjects will be randomized to come for two overnight visits.
      Study A- the subjects will be on the closed loop device with Novolog rapid acting insulin. In
      Study B- in addition to insulin the subjects will take a one time sub cutaneous injection of
      1.2 mg of Victoza before dinner on Day 1. Both visits will last for approximately 30 hours
      and the subjects will be managed by the closed loop device for approximately 25 hours.
