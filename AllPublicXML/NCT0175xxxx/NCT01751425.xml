    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of ruxolitinib and to see how
      well it works in participants with chronic myeloid leukemia with minimal residual disease
      while on therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Ruxolitinib may stop the growth of cancer
      cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the
      combination of ruxolitinib and a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) in patients with chronic
      myeloid leukemia (CML). (Phase I) II. To determine the clinical activity of the combination
      of ruxolitinib and a TKI in patients with CML in complete cytogenetic remission (CCyR) with
      minimal residual disease (MRD). (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the clinical activity of the combination of ruxolitinib and a TKI in patients
      with CML. (Phase I) II. To determine the safety of the combination of ruxolitinib and a TKI
      in patients with CML in CCyR with minimal residual disease. (Phase II) III. Determine the
      overall survival, event-free survival and survival free from transformation to accelerated
      and blast phase. (Phase I and II) IV. Determine the effect of therapy on bone marrow
      progenitors in clonogenic assays. (Phase I and II) V. Investigate the effect of therapy on
      molecular responses as assessed by genomic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) polymerase chain
      reaction (PCR). (Phase I and II) VI. Determine the effect of therapy on TKI-resistant
      quiescent leukemic Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)+ stem cells (CFSEmax/CD34+) by flow
      cytometric evaluation of activated Crkl and Jak2. (Phase I and II) VII. Assess the effect of
      therapy on self-renewal and/or survival of leukemic stem cells by fluorescence in situ
      hybridization (FISH) analysis on colonies. (Phase I and II) VIII. Assess ruxolitinib
      pharmacokinetics (PK) in preselected time intervals during co-administration of this agent
      with TKIs. (Phase I and II)

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of ruxolitinib followed by a phase II
      study.

      Participants receive commercially available TKIs (imatinib mesylate, nilotinib, or dasatinib)
      as they had been receiving during the last 6 months and ruxolitinib orally (PO) twice daily
      (BID). Courses repeat every 28 days for 2 years in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up for 30 days.

             following criteria: Patient has never achieved a major molecular response (MMR, as
             defined by a BCR-ABL/ABL =&lt; 0.1% in the international scale (currently equivalent to
             0.28 in the MD Anderson Cancer Center [MDACC] molecular diagnostic laboratory), and
             transcript levels have shown in at least 2 consecutive measures separated by at least
             1 month to have increased by any value; or achieved a major molecular response which
             has been lost, with an interim increase in transcript levels by at least one-log,
             confirmed in two consecutive analyses separated by at least 1 month; or patient has
             received therapy for at least 2 years &amp; lacks a sustained major molecular response; or
             patient has received therapy for at least 5 years and lacks a sustained complete
             molecular response (CMR, defined as transcript levels still detectable in the MDACC
             molecular diagnostic laboratory).

          -  Patients must not have had a known interruption of TKI therapy of greater than 21
             consecutive days or for a total of 6 weeks in the 6 months prior to enrollment.

          -  Patients must be able to understand and sign an informed consent indicating that they
             are aware of the investigational nature of this study in keeping with the
             institutional policies.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =&lt; 2.
