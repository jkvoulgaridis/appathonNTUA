  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to look at the effectiveness of giving patients who have been
      newly diagnosed with untreated early stage primary myelofibrosis (PMF) a study drug called
      PEGINTRON (also known as pegylated interferon alfa 2b). This intervention will be compared to
      the widely employed &quot;watch and wait&quot; (best supportive care) approach for early stage PMF, in
      which patients are followed closely and treatment initiated only if the disease progresses.
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be randomized into one of the study groups: one in which subjects get treated
      with PEGINTRON and the other in which subjects are closely followed and get best supportive
      care until disease progression (the presently accepted standard approach for early disease).
      Subjects on the observation arm will be carefully monitored for clinical or laboratory
      progression of disease during scheduled study visits. However, they will not be treated with
      an active drug like Interferon alfa or others such as Hydroxyurea, Revlimid, Thalidomide,
      Pomalidomide, and the newly approved JAK2 (Janus Kinase 2) inhibitor Ruxolitinib (Jakafi). If
      their disease progresses, they will be eligible for cross-over into the treatment arm with
      PEGINTRON. Subjects randomized to the treatment arm will receive PEGINTRON once weekly.

    <measure>Progression Free Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 21</time_frame>
    <description>Progression free survival is the measure of subject survival in the absence of disease progression. Disease progression is defined as progression to the next higher International Working Group-Myeloproliferative Neoplasms Research and Treatment (IWG-MRT) Dynamic International Prognostic Scoring System (DIPSS) stage from diagnosis. The IWG-MRT DIPSS stratifies primary myelofibrosis (PMF) into four risk categories (low, intermediate 1, intermediate 2, and high risk), based on 5 clinical factors; Age&gt;65, Hemoglobin &lt;10gm/dL, white blood cell (WBC)&gt;25,000/uL, peripheral blasts&gt;1%, and constitutional symptoms.
Progression free survival will be assessed at 21 weeks from time of study entry.</description>

        myelofibrosis as defined by World Health Organization (WHO) diagnostic criteria as follows:

        WHO diagnostic criteria for PMF Proposed Criteria for PMF Major Criteria

          1. Presence of megakaryocyte proliferation and atypia, usually accompanied by either
             reticulin and/or collagen fibrosis, or, in the absence of significant reticulin
             fibrosis, the megakaryocyte changes must be accompanied by an increased bone marrow
             cellularity characterized by granulocytic proliferation and often decreased
             erythropoiesis (ie. prefibrotic cellular-phase disease)

          2. Not meeting WHO criteria for Polycythemia Vera (PV), Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML),
             Myledysplastic Syndrome (MDS), or other myeloid neoplasm

             absence of a clonal marker, no evidence of bone marrow fibrosis due to underlying
             inflammatory or other neoplastic disease

        Minor Criteria

                  must show some active hematopoiesis with a cellularity of at least 15%,

                  therapeutic dose are unknown. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential
                  and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of
                  birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study
                  participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while
                  participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician
                  immediately.

               -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent
                  document.

        Exclusion Criteria

             Working Group (IWG) risk stratification of primary myelofibrosis in the dynamic
             international prognostic scoring system (DIPSS) and/or bone marrow biopsy showing less
             than 15% cellularity in the presence +2 or more reticulin fibrosis (by Manoharan

             requirements.

          -  Pregnant and lactating women are excluded from the study because the risks to an
             unborn fetus or potential risks in nursing infants are unknown.

        <title>Progression Free Survival</title>
        <description>Progression free survival is the measure of subject survival in the absence of disease progression. Disease progression is defined as progression to the next higher International Working Group-Myeloproliferative Neoplasms Research and Treatment (IWG-MRT) Dynamic International Prognostic Scoring System (DIPSS) stage from diagnosis. The IWG-MRT DIPSS stratifies primary myelofibrosis (PMF) into four risk categories (low, intermediate 1, intermediate 2, and high risk), based on 5 clinical factors; Age&gt;65, Hemoglobin &lt;10gm/dL, white blood cell (WBC)&gt;25,000/uL, peripheral blasts&gt;1%, and constitutional symptoms.
Progression free survival will be assessed at 21 weeks from time of study entry.</description>
