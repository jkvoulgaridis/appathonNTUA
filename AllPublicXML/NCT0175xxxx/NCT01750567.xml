    <textblock>
      Metformin is an antidiabetic drug which is an inexpensive and generally well tolerated
      medication. More recently metformin has been shown to act against carcinomas by two
      mechanisms: 1) an indirect, insulin‐dependent mechanism which sensitizes tissues to insulin,
      inhibits hepatic gluconeogenesis, and stimulates uptake of glucose in muscle, thereby
      reducing fasting blood glucose and circulating levels of insulin, lowering the pro survival
      activity of the insulin/INSR axis, and 2) a direct, insulin‐independent mechanism which
      activates the AMP‐activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway and leads to inhibition of the mTOR
      pathway. Given the investigators preliminary published data on insulin and mTOR inhibition[1]
      metformin is an attractive candidate for a pilot clinical trial in CLL patients.

    <measure>Time to treatment failure</measure>
    <time_frame>Until the patient meets failure criteria and stops Metformin; up to 6 months after start of metformin therapy and yearly thereafter.</time_frame>
    <description>While patients are on metformin therapy, time to treatment failure will be defined as one or all of the following criteria:
ALC &gt; 5000 on 3 occasions after start of metformin treatment and increasing by 25% or more on each occasion, which will be measured every 3 months.
An increase of Rai Stage (0-3) by one stage.
An increase in any lymph node by &gt;50% as assessed by either physical exam (all patients) or CT scanning (only if ordered as part of routine clinical management).
Worsening cytopenias (Hemoglobin &lt;11 g/dl) associated with a bone marrow biopsy result indicating advanced stage CLL (packed CLL marrow).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to first therapy (TTFT) in previously untreated 11q CLL subsets only.</measure>
    <time_frame>from time of diagnosis to time of first treatment with anti‐neoplastic chemotherapy.</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate TTFT in untreated patients, the product‐limit method of Kaplan and Meier will be used similarly to the primary endpoint. The main difference between this endpoint and the primary endpoint is that TTFT will be defined from the date of CLL diagnosis for untreated delq11 patients</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in the rate of increase of absolute lymphocyte count while on metformin therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>Until the patient meets failure criteria and stops Metformin</time_frame>
    <description>Longitudinal lymphocyte counts will be modeled using mixed models methodology, whereby both fixed effects (dose of metformin) and random effects (intercept - starting lymphocyte count) can be modeled.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in size of clinically appreciated lymphadenopathy in cm and splenomegaly while on metformin therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 3 months after completing metformin therapy</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of patients that begin metformin therapy with these conditions will be summarized, along with the proportions at study defined clinical assessment points during therapy. No statistical models will be employed, but proportions and 95% exact binomial confidence intervals will be reported for descriptive purposes.</description>

The dose can be escalated to 500 mg twice a day after one week, and further escalated to the final dose of 1000 mg twice a day in week 3 if the medication is tolerated without adverse side effects (refer to holding parameters described in section 9.3.3). All doses should be administered with food to decrease gastrointestinal upset.</description>
