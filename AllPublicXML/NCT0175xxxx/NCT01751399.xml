      The primary purpose of this study is to help answer the following research questions:

        -  To evaluate how much of the study drug (LY2605541) is in the blood of participants with
           varying degrees of liver impairment compared to those with normal liver function

        -  To assess the safety of LY2605541 and any side effects that might be associated with it
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is conducted in 4 groups, based on the Child-Pugh classification of hepatic
      impairment as follows:

      Group 1: Participants with normal hepatic function (Control); Group 2: Participants with mild
      hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A); Group 3: Participants with moderate hepatic
      impairment (Child-Pugh class B); and Group 4: Participants with severe hepatic impairment
      (Child-Pugh class C).
