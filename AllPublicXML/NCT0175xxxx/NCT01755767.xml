  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if tivantinib (ARQ 197) is effective in treating
      patients with MET diagnostic-high hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer) who have already
      been treated once with another therapy.

      Expression of c-Met in tumors correlates with aggressive hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
      features. Overexpression of the receptor in tumor samples or high level of blood HGF in
      subjects is related to higher recurrence rate after surgery for HCC, while high c-Met
      expression correlates with shorter survival in HCC subjects. In summary, c-Met holds an
      important prognostic role in the natural history of HCC. This Phase 3 study in MET
      Diagnostic-High inoperable HCC subjects has been designed based on the results from the
      randomized, controlled Phase 2 study conducted by ArQule, Inc. with tivantinib versus placebo
      in subjects with MET Diagnostic-High inoperable HCC who have failed one prior systemic
      therapy, mentioned above. The purpose of this study is to confirm the efficacy of tivantinib
      in MET Diagnostic-High HCC subjects who were previously treated with one systemic therapy,
      and to further evaluate the safety profile of the experimental drug in this subject
      population.
