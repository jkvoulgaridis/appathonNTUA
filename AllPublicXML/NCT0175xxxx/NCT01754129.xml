  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter, post marketing observational study (PMOS) was designed to evaluate the
      long-term effectiveness of levodopa/carbidopa intestinal gel (DUODOPA) on motor fluctuations
      (duration of OFF periods) in participants with advanced levodopa-responsive Parkinson's
      disease (PD) and severe motor fluctuations and hyper-/dyskinesia (involuntary movements).
      Secondary objectives of this study were to assess the participants' quality of life; to
      assess the long-term safety of DUODOPA; to assess disability, cognitive function, and
      non-professional caregiver burden; and to assess the economic and social impact of family
      caregiver assistance.

    <textblock>
      Male or female participants ages 18 years of age who were already on DUODOPA treatment and
      had concluded the naso-intestinal phase were included in this study. DUODOPA was administered
      via a portable pump directly into the proximal small intestine via a percutaneous endoscopic
      transgastric jejunostomy (PEG-J) tube. There were 3 planned visits during the study:
      enrollment (Visit 1), 1 year (Visit 2), and 2 years (Visit 3).

    <measure>Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) IV (Complications of Therapy) Item 39 (Proportion of Waking Day Spent in &quot;Off&quot;) Score: Mean Change From Baseline to the Last Available Follow up</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline/Visit 1 and Visit 2 (Year 1) or Visit 3 (Year 2)</time_frame>
    <description>Section B of the UPDRS IV questionnaire consists of 4 individual items that assess the degree of clinical fluctuations. Item 39 is the percentage of &quot;off&quot; times (when PD symptoms are not adequately controlled by the drug) during the waking day. The Item 39 score ranges from 0 (None), 1 (1- 25% of the waking day), 2 (26 - 50% of the waking day), 3 (51 - 75% of the waking day), and 4 (76 - 100% of the waking day). The mean change from baseline was calculated as the score at the last available follow up visit minus the score at baseline/Visit 1. Negative change from baseline for &quot;off&quot; time indicates improvement.</description>

    <measure>Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) IV (Complications of Therapy) Part A+B Score: Mean Change From Baseline to Visits 2 and 3</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline/Visit 1, Visit 2 (Year 1), and Visit 3 (Year 2)</time_frame>
    <description>The UPDRS is an Investigator-used rating tool to follow the course of Parkinson's disease. Scores for dyskinesias, early-morning dystonia, and clinical fluctuations (&quot;off&quot; times when PD symptoms are not adequately controlled by the drug) were assessed by the sum of the Part A+B items, questions 32-39. Questions 32-34 and 39 are measured on a 5-point scale (0-4), with 0 being no disease and 4 representing severe disease. Higher scores indicate a greater duration of dyskinesia (Q32), disability (Q33), and pain (Q34), and proportion of the waking day spent in &quot;off&quot; (Q39). Questions 35-38 are scored on a binary scale where 0= no and 1=yes, with higher scores indicating a higher incidence of early morning dystonia, and a higher degree of clinical fluctuations. The total score ranges from 0 (normal) to 20 (severe disease). Negative changes from baseline indicate improvement.</description>

    <measure>Change in Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale on Mentation, Behavior and Mood (UPDRS I) and Activities of Daily Living (UPDRS II) During On and Off Phases</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline/Visit 1, Visit 2 (Year 1), and Visit 3 (Year 2)</time_frame>
    <description>The UPDRS is an Investigator-used rating tool to follow the course of Parkinson's disease. The Part I Score is the sum of the answers to the 4 questions that comprise Part I, each of which are measured on a 5-point scale (0-4). The Part I score ranges from 0 to 16 and higher scores are associated with more disability. The Part II score is the sum of the answers to the 13 questions that comprise Part II, each of which are measured on a 5-point scale (0-4). The Part II score ranges from 0-52 and higher scores are associated with more disability. Scores for both &quot;On&quot; time (when PD symptoms are well-controlled by the drug) and &quot;Off&quot; time (when PD symptoms are not adequately controlled by the drug) are presented. Negative changes from baseline indicate improvement.</description>

        <title>Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) IV (Complications of Therapy) Item 39 (Proportion of Waking Day Spent in &quot;Off&quot;) Score: Mean Change From Baseline to the Last Available Follow up</title>
        <description>Section B of the UPDRS IV questionnaire consists of 4 individual items that assess the degree of clinical fluctuations. Item 39 is the percentage of &quot;off&quot; times (when PD symptoms are not adequately controlled by the drug) during the waking day. The Item 39 score ranges from 0 (None), 1 (1- 25% of the waking day), 2 (26 - 50% of the waking day), 3 (51 - 75% of the waking day), and 4 (76 - 100% of the waking day). The mean change from baseline was calculated as the score at the last available follow up visit minus the score at baseline/Visit 1. Negative change from baseline for &quot;off&quot; time indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) IV (Complications of Therapy) Part A+B Score: Mean Change From Baseline to Visits 2 and 3</title>
        <description>The UPDRS is an Investigator-used rating tool to follow the course of Parkinson's disease. Scores for dyskinesias, early-morning dystonia, and clinical fluctuations (&quot;off&quot; times when PD symptoms are not adequately controlled by the drug) were assessed by the sum of the Part A+B items, questions 32-39. Questions 32-34 and 39 are measured on a 5-point scale (0-4), with 0 being no disease and 4 representing severe disease. Higher scores indicate a greater duration of dyskinesia (Q32), disability (Q33), and pain (Q34), and proportion of the waking day spent in &quot;off&quot; (Q39). Questions 35-38 are scored on a binary scale where 0= no and 1=yes, with higher scores indicating a higher incidence of early morning dystonia, and a higher degree of clinical fluctuations. The total score ranges from 0 (normal) to 20 (severe disease). Negative changes from baseline indicate improvement.</description>

        <description>The UPDRS is an Investigator-used rating tool to follow the course of Parkinson's disease. The Part I Score is the sum of the answers to the 4 questions that comprise Part I, each of which are measured on a 5-point scale (0-4). The Part I score ranges from 0 to 16 and higher scores are associated with more disability. The Part II score is the sum of the answers to the 13 questions that comprise Part II, each of which are measured on a 5-point scale (0-4). The Part II score ranges from 0-52 and higher scores are associated with more disability. Scores for both &quot;On&quot; time (when PD symptoms are well-controlled by the drug) and &quot;Off&quot; time (when PD symptoms are not adequately controlled by the drug) are presented. Negative changes from baseline indicate improvement.</description>
