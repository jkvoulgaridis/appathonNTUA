  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain is the most common presenting symptom in medical outpatients, and depression and anxiety
      are the two most common mental disorders. All three conditions are often inadequately treated
      and result in substantial disability, reduced health-related quality of life, and increased
      health care costs and utilization. Additionally, pain, anxiety, and depression (PAD) are
      frequently comorbid with one another and have reciprocal negative effects on treatment
      response and additive effects on adverse health outcomes. The PAD triad is especially
      burdensome in Veterans, with their high prevalence of chronic pain, depression, PTSD, and
      other anxiety disorders. The Comprehensive vs. Assisted Management of Mood and Physical
      Symptoms (CAMMPS) study is a randomized comparative effectiveness trial designed to test the
      relative effectiveness of a lower-resource vs. a higher-resource enhancement of usual primary
      care in the management of Veterans suffering from with pain plus comorbid anxiety and/or
      depression.

      The Comprehensive vs. Assisted Management of Mood and Physical Symptoms (CAMMPS) study is a
      randomized comparative effectiveness trial designed to test the relative effectiveness of a
      lower-resource vs. a higher-resource enhancement of usual primary care in the management of
      Veterans suffering from with pain plus comorbid anxiety and/or depression.

      This is a single-site study enrolling Veterans. Patients followed in primary care clinics at
      the Roudebush VAMC will be eligible if they have clinically significant levels of pain plus
      comorbid anxiety and/or depression. A total of 300 eligible patients who provide informed
      consent will be randomized to one of two treatment arms. One group (n=150) will receive
      assisted symptom management (ASM) consisting of automated symptom monitoring by interactive
      voice recording or Internet and prompted pain self-management guided by symptom levels. The
      second group (n=150) will receive comprehensive symptom management (CSM) which combines ASM
      with optimized medication management delivered by a nurse-physician specialist team and
      facilitated mental health care. This team will partner with both VA primary care physicians
      and psychologists embedded in primary care to monitor and adjust treatments using
      evidence-based analgesic and antidepressant algorithms, reinforced self-management, and care
      coordination. The investigators postulate that although both interventions are likely to be
      beneficial, CSM will be superior to ASM.

      In short, this trial compares: 1) usual care plus assisted symptom management (ASM) vs. 2)
      usual care plus ASM plus optimized medication and care management and facilitated mental
      health care (CSM). Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. The primary
      outcome is a composite pain-anxiety-depression severity score. Secondary outcomes include
      individual pain, anxiety, and depression scores; functional status and health-related quality
      of life; treatment satisfaction; and perceived barriers and facilitators of the CSM and ASM
      interventions. The rationale for ASM is preliminary evidence of its effectiveness and its
      lower use of resources. The rationale for CSM is that the addition of optimized medication
      management, facilitated mental health care, and coordination with both primary care
      physicians/Patient Aligned Care Teams (PACTs) and psychologists for the PAD symptoms should
      substantially enhance the benefits of ASM.

    <measure>Composite Z-score of Pain-anxiety-depression Severity</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measure is the composite z-score of the main pain, anxiety, and depression measures in this trial: the BPI, GAD-7, PHQ-9, respectively. A standard z-score is calculated for each scale as follows: subject's scale score minus the sample mean divided by the sample standard deviation. A composite pain-anxiety-depression score is the average of the standard z-scores for the 3 scales. This is a scale of effect size where 0 represents no change from baseline, and a negative number means improvement and a positive number means worsening. Each unit means one standard deviation change from the group at baseline. Practical minimum value= -2.0, maximum value= +2.0. Positive number indicates greater symptoms severity/worse outcomes.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Average/Enjoyment of Life/General Activities Pain Scale (PEG)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PEG is a 3-item validated version of the Brief Pain Inventory. Minimum value = 0; maximum value = 10. Higher scores indicate greater symptom severity/worse outcomes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item Depression Scale (PHQ-9)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PHQ-9 has been used in hundreds of research studies as a depression severity and outcome measure and, now translated into more than 80 languages, is among the most widely used depression measures in clinical practice. Minimum value = 0; maximum value = 27. Higher scores indicate greater symptom severity/worse outcomes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item Anxiety Scale (GAD-7)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The GAD-7 is an anxiety severity measure, validated in several thousand primary care patients and increasingly used in clinical research and practice. It is also a good first-line measure for estimating the probability of 4 common anxiety disorders in primary care - generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and social anxiety disorder. Minimum value = 0; maximum value = 21. Higher scores indicate greater symptom severity/worse outcomes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Brief Pain Inventory (BPI)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The BPI rates the intensity of pain on 4 items (current, worst, least, and average pain in past week), and the interference in 7 areas (mood, physical activity, work, social activity, relations with others, sleep, enjoyment of life). Minimum value = 0; maximum value = 10. Higher scores indicate greater symptom severity/worse outcomes.</description>

        <description>The primary outcome measure is the composite z-score of the main pain, anxiety, and depression measures in this trial: the BPI, GAD-7, PHQ-9, respectively. A standard z-score is calculated for each scale as follows: subject's scale score minus the sample mean divided by the sample standard deviation. A composite pain-anxiety-depression score is the average of the standard z-scores for the 3 scales. This is a scale of effect size where 0 represents no change from baseline, and a negative number means improvement and a positive number means worsening. Each unit means one standard deviation change from the group at baseline. Practical minimum value= -2.0, maximum value= +2.0. Positive number indicates greater symptoms severity/worse outcomes.</description>

      <time_frame>SAEs and AEs were assessed for each participant from baseline date through the date the 12 month interview was completed or through the date the participant withdrew participation (if applicable). The average timeframe among all participants was 365 days.</time_frame>
      <desc>SAEs were solicited and documented from all participants during 6 and 12 month outcome interviews and if spontaneously reported by participants. SAE/AEs were additionally solicited and documented from CSM participants during automated symptom monitoring, multiple nurse care manager phone calls and were documented when the nurse found evidence of an SAE/AE in a CSM participant's medical record. This method led to a much greater identification rate of AEs in CSM than in ASM participants.</desc>
