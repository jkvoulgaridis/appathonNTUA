  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to assess whether completely electronic, HIPAA-compliant, EHR-based,
      closed-loop referrals for tobacco cessation from primary care clinics to a state telephone
      tobacco quitline service can increase the number/percentage of adult tobacco users receiving
      evidence-based tobacco dependence treatment when compared to paper-based fax referrals. This
      study also will survey clinic staff to evaluate satisfaction with the referral process.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aim 1: To evaluate the rates of referral of tobacco users visiting primary care clinics to
      the WTQL, comparing those who were referred via an EHR-based electronic referral system vs.
      those referred via a manual paper fax referral system. Analyses will address the change in
      rates of referrals from pre- to post-intervention and the trajectory of referral
      post-intervention and will reflect per clinic rates.

      Aim 2: To evaluate the rates of quality referrals of tobacco users visiting primary care
      clinics to the WTQL, comparing those who were referred via an EHR-based electronic referral
      system vs. those referred via a manual paper fax referral system (quality referrals are
      defined as ones that result in individuals who enroll in and receive WTQL counseling and/or
      medication treatment services). Analyses will address the change in referrals from pre- to
      post-intervention and will reflect per clinic rates.

      Aim 3: To examine variation in referral rates across clinics to test the hypothesis that the
      eReferral system will result in greater consistency in referral in addition to higher rates
      of referral. Qualitative methods will be used to understand the sources of variation.

      Aim 4: To assess clinician and staff satisfaction with the eReferral and paper fax referral
      systems via self-report questionnaires.

      Aim 5: To evaluate smoking abstinence rates of tobacco users who were referred to and
      accepted services from the WTQL, comparing those who were referred via an EHR-based referral
      system vs. those referred via a manual paper fax referral system.

    <time_frame>Satisfaction measures will be surveyed at baseline and at 6 months and reported as a single change score</time_frame>
    <description>In order to assess clinician and staff satisfaction with the eReferral and paper-based referral systems, a single-item &quot;The steps I need to take to address my patients' tobacco use are efficient and well designed&quot; was administered to healthcare system clinical staff. The response format was 1 = Strongly disagree; 2 = Disagree; 3 = Mildly disagree; 4 = Feel neutral; 5 = Mildly agree; 6 = Agree; 7 = Strongly agree. Higher scores indicate greater satisfaction with the assigned intervention (EHR-based vs Fax-based referral systems). The item is not part of any existing validated scale and was created for purposes of the project; this item was selected from a larger set of items and determined to be the most appropriate measure of overall staff satisfaction.</description>

        <title>Change in Global Staff Satisfaction With the Referral Intervention</title>
        <description>In order to assess clinician and staff satisfaction with the eReferral and paper-based referral systems, a single-item &quot;The steps I need to take to address my patients' tobacco use are efficient and well designed&quot; was administered to healthcare system clinical staff. The response format was 1 = Strongly disagree; 2 = Disagree; 3 = Mildly disagree; 4 = Feel neutral; 5 = Mildly agree; 6 = Agree; 7 = Strongly agree. Higher scores indicate greater satisfaction with the assigned intervention (EHR-based vs Fax-based referral systems). The item is not part of any existing validated scale and was created for purposes of the project; this item was selected from a larger set of items and determined to be the most appropriate measure of overall staff satisfaction.</description>
        <time_frame>Satisfaction measures will be surveyed at baseline and at 6 months and reported as a single change score</time_frame>
