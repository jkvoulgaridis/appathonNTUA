    <textblock>
      This is a tissue and blood collection protocol requiring image-guided biopsies of metastatic
      prostate cancer. Whenever possible, a new bone lesion or new/progressing soft tissue lesion
      will be chosen for biopsy as opposed to radiographically stable lesion. Patients will be
      enrolled in parallel into one of eight possible cohorts based upon planned modality of
      systemic therapy following baseline tumor biopsy and/or disease features at time of study
      entry: (A) Androgen signaling inhibition, (B) Immunotherapy, (C) Radiotherapy, (D) Targeted
      Therapy/Investigational therapeutic, (E) DNA damage response pathway, (F) Aggressive variant
      disease, (G1) Castration-sensitive ADT na√Øve and ADT &lt; 3 months), or (G2)
      Castration-sensitive pre-treated with sub-optimal PSA nadir &gt;0.2 ng/ml.

      After performing tumor biopsies and blood collection and processing the biopsies and research
      blood for comprehensive molecular analysis using established methods for RNA and DNA
      analysis, we will use Pathway Recognition using Data Integration on Genomic Models (PARADIGM)
      and Differential Pathway Signature Correlation (DiPSC), computational approaches to pathway
      activity and predictive signature identification developed at University of California, Santa
      Cruz. We will also collect blood samples (for circulating tumor DNA, plasma, and serum) and
      circulating tumor cells from participating patients. Residual paraffin- embedded blocks,
      frozen tissue, and blood products (serum, plasma, and circulating cells) will be stored in a
      repository for future testing of candidate predictive markers identified during microarray
      analysis. We will utilize only Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified
      laboratories(e.g. Strata Oncology) to identify genetic mutations within mCRPC tumors to
      provide genetic information that can be returned to patient to potentially inform treatment
      decisions.

      Certain genomic sequencing will be performed by Strata Oncology.

      Following biopsy and baseline peripheral blood collection, patients will be treated per
      investigator discretion, with treatment corresponding to assigned patient cohort and
      initiated within 42 days following baseline tumor biopsy and/or research blood collection.
      Patients will be evaluated for response to therapy with monthly serum prostate-specific
      antigen (PSA) measurements (may be done at UCSF or at local laboratory) along with restaging
      scans (bone scan + CT abd/pelvis) (UCSF or local radiology facility). Outcomes on treatment
      post-biopsy will be recorded, including maximal PSA decline, date of radiographic
      progression.

      At the time of disease progression by Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 (PCWG2) criteria,
      patients may undergo optional repeat assessment for metastatic tumor biopsy, along with
      mandatory blood collection for analysis of circulating tumor DNA and circulating tumor cells
      (CTCs). Following second biopsy at progression, patients should continue to be followed for
      response to subsequent therapy.

      All patients will be followed for long term survival with every 3 month telephone calls
      and/or chart review.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  History of histologically confirmed prostate cancer. Patients without histologically
             confirmed prostate cancer are eligible if both the treating physician and the study PI
             agree that the patient's history is unambiguously indicative of advanced prostate
             cancer (e.g. high PSA responsive to Androgen Deprivation Therapy.)

          -  Radiographic evidence of metastatic disease amenable to image-guided or excisional
             biopsy of a metastatic site. Soft-tissue as well as bony metastatic lesions will be
             considered acceptable. Patients with locally advanced disease only (where the biopsy
             would be of a prostatic mass) are not eligible. Biopsy of newly emerging or
             progressive metastases is desired and preferable to the biopsy of previously existing
             stable lesions whenever possible. Patients without lesion amenable to biopsy are still
             eligible, and have the option of re-assessment for potential of metastatic tumor
             biopsy upon progression as outlined in the study calendar.

          -  For patients with metastatic lesion amenable for biopsy:

          -  Platelets &gt; = 75,000/microliter (Œºl)

          -  Prothrombin time (PT) or international normalized ratio (INR) and activated partial
             thromboplastin time (aPTT) &lt; = 1.5 times the institutional upper limit of normal (ULN)
             within 14 days prior to biopsy.

          -  Patients on warfarin, aspirin, or other anti-coagulants are eligible provided they are
             deemed able to tolerate discontinuation of anti-coagulation prior to the biopsy as per
             usual standard of care. Conversion to low molecular weight heparin prior to biopsy is
             permitted per local standard operating procedures, provided there is agreement
             regarding the procedure between the treating physician, the interventional radiologist
             and the PI.

          -  Patients with significant congenital or acquired bleeding disorders (eg type 3 von
             Wildebrand's disease, acquired bleeding factor inhibitors) are not eligible.

          -  Age &gt; 18 yrs

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance status 0-2

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent.

          -  Metastatic, castration resistant disease by Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 (PCWG2)
             criteria, with progression on most recently applied systemic therapy prior to study
             registration, as defined by:

               1. PSA Progression: PSA level of at least 2 nanograms (ng)/milliliter (ml) which has
                  risen on at least 2 successive occasions, at least one week apart and/or

               2. Soft tissue progression: by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)
                  v1.1 and/or

               3. Bone scan progression: the appearance of ‚â• 2 new lesions and/or

               4. Symptomatic progression in an area of radiologically evident disease

          -  Documented serum testosterone &lt; 50 ng/deciliter (dL). Patients without prior bilateral
             orchiectomy are required to remain on luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH)
             analogue for duration of study. Patients with previously documented de novo primary
             small cell carcinoma of the prostate are exempt from this criterion. If serum for
             analysis of testosterone level has been collected but result not available by day of
             scheduled baseline biopsy, patient may still be eligible for study participation upon
             at the discretion of the Principal Investigator.

          -  Patients must possess one of the following criteria:

               1. Planned treatment within 42 days following baseline tumor biopsy and/or research
                  blood collection with androgen signaling inhibitor excluding enzalutamide (cohort
                  A), immunotherapy (cohort B), radiotherapy (cohort C), investigational
                  therapeutic (cohort D), or agent targeting the DNA repair pathway including but
                  not limited to platinum chemotherapy or poly adenosine diphosphate-ribose
                  polymerase (PARP) inhibition (cohort E). Therapeutic combinations are allowed and
                  as treatment may fall into more than one category, cohort assignment will be per
                  PI discretion.

               2. Aggressive variant cancer (cohort F), defined by one or more of the following:

                    -  Presence of one or more visceral organ metastases

                    -  Serum neuron specific enolase and/or chromogranin A &gt;ULN

                    -  Progression by PCWG2 criteria within 12 months following initiation of
                       primary androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) +/- chemotherapy for metastatic
                       hormone sensitive prostate cancer

                    -  Prior histologic evidence of small cell and/or intermediate atypical
                       carcinoma differentiation

          -  Metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer (Cohort G), who are ADT na√Øve or have
             received ADT in the past 3 months (Group 1) or currently receiving (Group 2) androgen
             deprivation therapy within 6-12 months prior to study entry who have sub-optimal serum
             PSA nadir &gt;0.2 ng/ml. The use of chemotherapy or other investigational agents is
             allowed but not required in both Group 1 and Group 2. Group 1 (ADT na√Øve and ADT
             started &lt; 3 months): Patients who have not received LHRH analogue, LHRH antagonist or
             any anti-androgen for metastatic disease. Patients who have received ADT in the past 3
             months will be included. Prior use of androgen deprivation therapy in the
             (neo)adjuvant, salvage, or biochemically recurrent setting is allowed provided the
             last day of effective androgen deprivation was more than 12 months prior to study
             entry. Androgen deprivation therapy must be planned to start within 28 days of
             baseline tumor biopsy. Group 2 (ADT/androgen synthesis inhibitor (ASI) Pre-Treated
             with sub-optimal PSA nadir): Patients who have initiated androgen deprivation therapy
             (including LHRH agonists, antagonists and/or anti-androgens) for metastatic prostate
             cancer within 6-12 months prior to study entry who have sub-optimal serum PSA nadir &gt;
             0.2 ng/ml.
