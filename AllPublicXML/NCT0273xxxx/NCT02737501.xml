  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this phase III, randomized, open-label, comparative, multicenter,
      international study is to compare the efficacy and safety of brigatinib to that of crizotinib
      in ALK-positive locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC participants who have not previously
      been treated with an ALK inhibitor. Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive
      either brigatinib, 90 mg orally once daily (QD) for 7 days, then a 180 mg orally QD, or
      crizotinib, 250 mg orally twice daily (BID). Participants will receive treatment until
      disease progression, intolerable toxicity, consent withdrawal, or death.

      The total estimated duration of the study is at least 5 years, including 2 years to accrue
      participants, with at least 3 years for treatment and follow-up.

    <measure>Progression-free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to approximately 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>PFS as assessed by blinded Independent Review Committee (BIRC) is defined as the time interval from the date of randomization until the first date at which disease progression (PD) is objectively documented, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. PD is sum of longest diameter (SLD) increased by at least 20 percent (%) from the smallest value on study (including baseline, if that is the smallest), the SLD must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 millimeter (mm), and unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to approximately 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>ORR as assessed by BIRC, is defined as percentage of participants who are confirmed to have achieved complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version (v). 1.1 criteria. CR is defined as disappearance of all extranodal target and non-target lesions. All pathological lymph nodes must have decreased to less than (&lt;) 10 mm in short axis for target lesions and all lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (&lt;10 mm short axis), normalization of tumor marker level for non-target lesions. PR is at least a 30% decrease in SLD of target lesions, taking as reference baseline sum diameters. SD is neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD. PD is SLD increased by at least 20% from the smallest value on study (including baseline, if that is the smallest), the SLD must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm, and unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Intracranial ORR</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to approximately 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>Intracranial ORR as assessed by BIRC, is defined as the percentage of the participants who have achieved CR or PR in the central nervous system (CNS) in randomized participants with intracranial CNS metastasis at baseline. CR is defined as disappearance of all extranodal target and non-target lesions. All pathological lymph nodes must have decreased to &lt;10 mm in short axis for target lesions and all lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (&lt;10 mm short axis), normalization of tumor marker level for non-target lesions. PR is at least a 30% decrease in the SLD of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. SD is neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD. PD is SLD increased by at least 20% from the smallest value on study (including baseline, if that is the smallest), the SLD must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm, and unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.</description>

    <measure>Intracranial PFS</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to approximately 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>Intracranial PFS as assessed by BIRC, is defined as the time from randomization until first CNS PD is documented, or death due to any cause. PD is SLD increased by at least 20% from the smallest value on study (including baseline, if that is the smallest), the SLD must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm, and unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to approximately 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival is defined as the time from randomization until death due to any cause.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to approximately 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of response as assessed by BIRC, is defined as the time interval from the date that the criteria are first met for CR/PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that progressive disease (PD) is objectively documented. CR is defined as disappearance of all extranodal target and non-target lesions. All pathological lymph nodes must have decreased to &lt;10 mm in short axis for target lesions and all lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (&lt;10 mm short axis), normalization of tumor marker level for non-target lesions. PR is at least a 30 % decrease in the SLD of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. PD is SLD increased by at least 20% from the smallest value on study (including baseline, if that is the smallest), the SLD must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm, and for non-target lesions, unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>Time to Response (TTR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to approximately 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>Time to response as assessed by BIRC, assessment and is defined as the time interval from the date randomization until the initial observation of CR or PR. CR is defined as disappearance of all extranodal target and non-target lesions. All pathological lymph nodes must have decreased to &lt;10 mm in short axis for target lesions and all lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (&lt;10 mm short axis), normalization of tumor marker level for non-target lesions. PR is at least a 30% decrease in the SLD of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.</description>

CR defined as disappearance of all extranodal target and non-target lesions. All pathological lymph nodes must have decreased to &lt;10 mm in short axis for target lesions and all lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (&lt;10 mm short axis), normalization of tumor marker level for non-target lesions. PR: at least a 30% decrease in SLD of target lesions, taking as reference baseline sum diameters. SD: neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD. PD: SLD increased by at least 20% from the smallest value on study, SLD must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm, and unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health-related Quality of Life (HRQoL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline until 30 days after the last dose of study treatment (approximately 3 years)</time_frame>
    <description>HRQoL is defined as the perceived quality of the participant's life, which includes self-reported multidimensional measures of physical and mental health. Patient-reported symptoms (PROs) and HRQoL will be collected by administering the european organisation for research and treatment of cancer (EORTC) quality of life (QLQ)-C30 questionnaire. EORTC-QLQ-C30 contains 30 items across 5 functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), 9 symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain, dyspnea, sleep disturbance, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties) and a global health status/QOL scale. The 30 items have 4 response levels (not at all, a little, quite a bit, and very much), with 2 questions relying on a 7-point numeric rating scale. Raw scores are converted into scale scores ranging from 0 to 100. For functional scales and QOL scale, higher scores represent better QOL; for the symptom scales, lower scores represent better QOL.</description>

    <ipd_description>Takeda makes patient-level, de-identified data sets and associated documents available after applicable marketing approvals and commercial availability have been received, an opportunity for the primary publication of the research has been allowed, and other criteria have been met as set forth in Takeda's Data Sharing Policy (see www.TakedaClinicalTrials.com/Approach for details). To obtain access, researchers must submit a legitimate academic research proposal for adjudication by an independent review panel, who will review the scientific merit of the research and the requestor's qualifications and conflict of interest that can result in potential bias. Once approved, qualified researchers who sign a data sharing agreement are provided access to these data in a secure research environment.</ipd_description>
