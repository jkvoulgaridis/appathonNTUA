      This is an Open-Label, Single-Arm, Phase II Multicenter Study of the Safety and Efficacy of
      PRO 140 for Prophylaxis of Acute Graft-Versus-Host Disease (GVHD) in Patients Undergoing
      Reduced Intensity Conditioning (RIC) Allogeneic Stem-Cell Transplantation.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-arm, phase II, multicenter study to evaluate the feasibility of
      the use of PRO 140 as an add-on therapy to standard GVHD prophylaxis treatment for prevention
      of acute GVHD in adult patients undergoing RIC allogeneic HCT.

      In this study, up to 60 subjects will be enrolled. PRO 140 will be administered as a 525 mg
      subcutaneous injection on Day -3 or Day -2 prior to stem cell infusion, on the day of stem
      cell infusion (Day 0), and then weekly for up to 100±7 days. Subjects will return to the
      clinic for three Follow-up visits at 2 weeks after the last treatment visit, 30 days after
      the last treatment visit and one year after the first treatment visit.

               -  Hepatic function: Baseline direct bilirubin, ALT or AST lower than three times
                  the upper limit of normal.

               -  Pulmonary: FVC or FEV1 ≥ 40% predicted.

             known to be free of disease for at least 2 years.

          8. Presence of fluid collection (ascites, pleural or pericardial effusion) that
             interferes with methotrexate clearance or makes methotrexate use contraindicated

          9. Patients who are HIV positive

         10. Females who are pregnant, lactating, or breastfeeding, or who plan to become pregnant
