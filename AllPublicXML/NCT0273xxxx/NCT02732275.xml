  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      DS-3201b is an experimental drug. It is not approved for regular use. It can only be used in
      clinical research.

      Adults with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) might be able to join this study if their disease:

        -  has come back after remission

        -  is not responding to current treatment

      This study has three parts:

        1. Dose Escalation is to find the safe dose of DS-3201b that adults with advanced NHL can
           tolerate.

        2. Dose Expansion is to:

             -  find out how effective DS-3201b is for rare types of NHL

             -  collect additional safety data

        3. Drug-Drug Interaction (DDI) Cohort (US Only) is to evaluate the effect of DS-3201b on
           the pharmacokinetics (PK) midazolam and digoxin when co-administered to patients with
           NHL
