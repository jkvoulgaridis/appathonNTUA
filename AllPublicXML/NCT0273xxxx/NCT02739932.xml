      The primary study aims are to determine the clinical, behavioural and social predictors of
      SMI development in youth, and to investigate whether neuroimaging can distinguish youth who
      will develop SMI from those who will not.

      The study's secondary aims are to examine the proportions of the cohort that make transitions
      between the different clinical stages of risk, and to determine the proportions that have
      poor outcomes, defined as ongoing or increased symptoms, secondary substance misuse, poor
      social or role functioning, i.e., non-participation in education, or employment, and new
      self-harm.

      Investigators will study a cohort of 240 youth (aged 14-25, male and female) that includes
      youth with early mood symptoms or sub-threshold psychotic symptoms (symptomatic group;
      n=160), youth at risk due to a family history of a SMI (family high risk (FHR); n=40), and
      healthy controls (HC; n=40). From this cohort, clinical, social and cognitive data, as well
      as imaging data will be gathered to create a multi-layered &quot;snapshot&quot; of these individuals
      and provide full-level characterization. Investigators will use the full range of clinical
      and imaging data generated from this cohort to develop novel prediction algorithms
      incorporating key variables that predict the development of SMI.
