  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label extension study aimed to assess long-term safety and
      efficacy of SPN-812 ER when administered alone or in conjunction with an Food and Drug
      Administration-approved Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) medication in the
      treatment of ADHD in pediatric subjects who have participated in a previous blinded studies
      of SPN-812 ER (812P202, 812P301, 812P302, 812P303, and 812P304). All pediatric subjects who
      complete a blinded study of SPN-812 ER will have the option to participate in this study in
      which all subjects receive SPN-812 ER at an optimized dose. After an initial dose, subjects
      will enter an dose optimization phase of up to twelve weeks. Following optimization, subjects
      will return to the clinic every 3 months or until the subject discontinues or the study ends
      at 36 months.
