  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to 260 subjects presenting with skin laxity on the face and neck will be randomized to one
      of two treatment groups. Subjects meeting all entrance criteria will receive study treatment,
      then complete two post treatment phone contacts and follow-up study visits at 90, 180 and 365
      days post treatment. Study images will be obtained pre-treatment, immediately post-treatment,
      and at each follow-up visit for qualitative and quantitative assessments of efficacy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, double blinded, multi-center, parallel arm,
      non-inferiority, pivotal clinical trial to demonstrate the efficacy of the Ultherapy
      treatment with prototype 2 simulines transducers (4-3.0 Smm and 4-4.5 Smm) at energy level
      (EL) 2 is non-inferior to treatment with standard transducers (7-3.0 mm and 4-4.5mm) at EL 2
      for lifting the lower face and neck and to demonstrate the safety of treatment with prototype
      2 simulines transducers is similar to treatment with standard transducers.

      Changes from baseline in quantitative measures of neck and submental lift will be assessed at
      study follow-up visits. Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale scores, Merz Jawline Grading Scale
      scores, 3D volumetric changes from baseline to post treatment, patient satisfaction and
      patient-reported improvement will be obtained.

    <measure>Number of Participants Who Achieved Greater Than or Equal to (&gt;=) 20 mm^2 Reduction in Submental Area at Day 90</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 90</time_frame>
    <description>Participant response was defined as &gt;=20 mm^2 reduction in 2D submental area from baseline. Submandibular and Submental quantitative measurements were calculated comparing participants using prototype 2 simulines versus standard transducers. The standard 2D photographic images were obtained. Utilizing the lateral profile view of pre-and 90-day post treatment photos of each participant, quantitative results were calculated by using 5 evenly spaced points on the neck. Area was calculated between each of the 5 points and then sum of the 5 calculations was the total area of the region of interest. The delta area between the pre-and post-treatment area of the chin and neck determined the amount of tissue lift in the area.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Who Achieved Greater Than or Equal to (&gt;=) 20 mm^2 Reduction in Submental Area at Day 90</title>
        <description>Participant response was defined as &gt;=20 mm^2 reduction in 2D submental area from baseline. Submandibular and Submental quantitative measurements were calculated comparing participants using prototype 2 simulines versus standard transducers. The standard 2D photographic images were obtained. Utilizing the lateral profile view of pre-and 90-day post treatment photos of each participant, quantitative results were calculated by using 5 evenly spaced points on the neck. Area was calculated between each of the 5 points and then sum of the 5 calculations was the total area of the region of interest. The delta area between the pre-and post-treatment area of the chin and neck determined the amount of tissue lift in the area.</description>

        <description>Participant's treatment-related pain scores were obtained using a validated 11-point NRS with 0: no pain; 5: moderate pain; and 10: worst possible pain. Pain scores were obtained following each region treated (submandibular/submental and cheeks) and for each transducer used during treatment. Average pain score was calculated for each arm by adding all the scores of all participants in each arm to obtain the mean NRS score.</description>

          <title>Mean Pain Scores to Assess Participant's Treatment Related Comfort Level Based on Numeric Rating Scale (NRS)</title>
          <description>Participant's treatment-related pain scores were obtained using a validated 11-point NRS with 0: no pain; 5: moderate pain; and 10: worst possible pain. Pain scores were obtained following each region treated (submandibular/submental and cheeks) and for each transducer used during treatment. Average pain score was calculated for each arm by adding all the scores of all participants in each arm to obtain the mean NRS score.</description>
