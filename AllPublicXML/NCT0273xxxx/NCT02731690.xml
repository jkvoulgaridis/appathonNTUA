    <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug, whether or not considered drug related. An SAE or serious suspected adverse reaction is an AE or suspected adverse reaction that at any dose, in the view of either the Investigator or Ultragenyx, results in any of the following outcomes: death; a life-threatening AE; inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; persistent or significant incapacity or disability (substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions); congenital anomaly/birth defect. TEAEs were defined as any AE that occurred after the first dose of study drug.</description>

             judgment of the investigator, places the subject at increased risk for adverse effects

          -  Has serum transaminase (i.e. aspartate aminotransferase [AST] or gamma-glutamyl
             transpeptidase [GGT]) levels greater than 3X the upper limit of normal (ULN) for
             age/gender, or serum creatinine of greater than 2X ULN at Screening

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding at Screening or planning to become pregnant (self or

          -  Has a condition of such severity and acuity, in the opinion of the investigator, that

          -  Has a concurrent disease, active suicidal ideation, or other condition that, in the
             view of the investigator, places the subject at high risk of poor treatment compliance
             or of not completing the study, or would interfere with study participation or would
             affect safety

          <description>Hand held dynamometry testing was used to measure strength. The maximum voluntary isometric contraction against a dynamometer was used to measure bilateral strength in the following muscle groups: shoulder abductors, wrist extensors and knee extensors. Specialized dynamometers for the measurement of grip and key pinch strength were also used. The total force (in kgf) for each was recorded.</description>

An SAE or serious suspected adverse reaction is an AE or suspected adverse reaction that at any dose, in the view of either the Investigator or Ultragenyx, results in any of the following outcomes: death; a life-threatening AE; inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; persistent or significant incapacity or disability (substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions); congenital anomaly/birth defect.

        <title>Change From Baseline in HHD Raw Strength (Shoulder Abductors) Over Time</title>
        <description>Hand held dynamometry testing was used to measure strength. The maximum voluntary isometric contraction against a dynamometer was used to measure bilateral strength in the following muscle groups: shoulder abductors, wrist extensors and knee extensors. Specialized dynamometers for the measurement of grip and key pinch strength were also used. The total force (in kgf) for each was recorded. Analyzed using a repeated measure GEE model, which includes the change from baseline as the dependent variable, visit as a fixed factor, and the baseline value as a covariate.

        <description>Hand held dynamometry testing was used to measure strength. The maximum voluntary isometric contraction against a dynamometer was used to measure bilateral strength in the following muscle groups: shoulder abductors, wrist extensors and knee extensors. Specialized dynamometers for the measurement of grip and key pinch strength were also used. The total force (in kgf) for each was recorded.</description>
