  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is determine if the triplet combination of ribociclib, everolimus
      and exemastane is effective in the treatment of locally advanced/metastatic breast cancer
      following treatment with a CDK 4/6 inhibitor

  <detailed_description>

      The purpose of the phase I dose escalation part of this study is to estimate the MTD(s)
      and/or identify the RP2D of the combination treatment of ribociclib+ everolimus + exemestane
      when dosed continuously in adult men and postmenopausal women with HR+ HER2-negative advanced
      breast cancer resistant to the non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors, fulvestrant or tamoxifen.

      The purpose of the phase II portion of this trial will be to evaluate the anti-tumor activity
      of exemestane, everolimus and ribociclib triplet following progression on a CDK 4/6
      inhibitor. This part of the study will be conducted using a Simon's optimal two-stage design.
