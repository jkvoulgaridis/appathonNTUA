  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic disease self-management is the ability of the individual, in conjunction with family,
      community and healthcare professionals to manage symptoms, treatments, lifestyle changes and
      psychosocial, cultural and spiritual consequences associated with a chronic condition.
      Self-management strategies have been successfully used in supportive care and survivorship in
      oncology. Stepping On, a multi-component program using a small-group learning environment,
      reduces falls by 31%. It empowers participants with knowledge about fall-risk, exercise,
      medications and environmental hazards to self-manage their risk of falls over 7 weeks of
      educational sessions, followed by a home visit. The research in this proposal will yield the
      adaptation of the effective group-education-based fall-prevention intervention Stepping On,
      tailored to cancer patients, feasible for testing in a multi-institutional trial, and
      ultimately scalable in the oncology setting.

Complete baseline questionnaires about Instrumental Activities of Daily Living, Medical Outcome Study Activities, Karnofsky Performance Status, falls in past 3 months, medications, comorbidities, vision &amp; hearing, The Falls Behavioral Scale, The Falls Efficacy Scale-International, Patient Reported Outcome pain, PRO neuropathy
7 week STEPPING ON program is multi-component learning environment which has shown to help reduce falls
A home visit to gather any feedback on the experience of the program
Follow-up questionnaires up to 3 months after completion of the program
Participants may elect to participate in a &quot;booster session&quot; to reinforce concepts 3-6 months after completion of the program</description>

    <description>The Mini-BESTest includes 14-items that assess balance across four domains: 1) anticipatory postural adjustments, 2) reactive postural responses, 3) sensory orientation, and 4) stability in gait. Each item is rated on a 0-2 scale with 0 indicating poor balance and 2 indicating no impairment. The total possible score on the Mini-BESTest is 28 points
Balance testing will take approximately 15 minutes.</description>

    <description>Gait will be assessed using the 4.87-m GAITRite
The GAITRite is a computerized mat that allows for measurement of spatiotemporal measures (e.g., gait velocity, stride length) of gait. We will measure gait in the following conditions: 1) comfortable forward, 2) fast-as-possible, and 3) dual-task. For comfortable forward, participants will be asked to walk at their self-perceived normal pace. For fast-as-possible, participants will be asked to walk as quickly and safely as possible. For dual-task, participants will be asked to walk at their comfortable pace forward while saying as many words that begin with a letter given to them just prior to the start of the trial. Participants will complete five trials of each condition. Gait testing will take approximately 15 minutes.</description>

    <intervention_name>Precise measure of movement testing</intervention_name>
    <description>We will conduct additional movement-based testing with participants wearing small, portable sensors (APDM, Inc., Portland, OR). These sensors allow for precise measurement of movement characteristics. The sensors will be worn on the outside of clothing and will be placed on the following body locations: 1) sternum, 2) low back, 3) right wrist, 4) left wrist, 5) right ankle, and 6) left ankle. The participants will wear these sensors during the following movement tasks: 1) Two Minute Walk Test, 2) Timed Up &amp; Go, 3) Dual Timed Up &amp; Go, 4) Stand and Walk (SAW), and 5) 360 Degree Turn test. These sensors will allow for capture of precise measures postural sway, arm swing, gait variability, and many other variables the proposed movement tasks.</description>
