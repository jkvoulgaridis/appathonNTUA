  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be screened up to 28 days before start of treatment. During the screening
      visit, the purpose and procedures of the study will be explained to potential patients and
      informed consent will be obtained.

      At the baseline visit, all inclusion and exclusion criteria will be re-assessed. Eligible
      patients will be randomized to treatment of the target area with either 30 minutes (group30)
      or 15 minutes (group15) blue light at 600 milliwatt per square centimeter (mW/cm²).
      Additionally, two study areas with similar clinical symptomatology will be determined and
      will be randomized to blue light treated area and Daivonex (Vitamin D) treated area.

      After randomization, patients will be trained on a demonstrator device (no actual treatment
      to ensure investigator is blinded as to which group the patient is randomized to) as well as
      the Daivonex cream. After patients have been instructed, treatment of the areas will be
      applied daily (once per day, 5-7 times / week) at home for a treatment period of 12 weeks.
      During those 12 weeks, patients will return to the study site for safety and effectiveness
      assessments at week 2, 4, 8 and week 12. A phone call visit will be performed after one week
      of treatment to check for any adverse events or problems in handling the device or the cream.
      The visit at week 12 serves as end of treatment visit. The patients will be followed-up for
      another 4 weeks. Treatment responses will be photo documented.

    <measure>Change From Baseline (Visit 2) of the Local PSI of the Blue Light Treated Area (Group 30) as Compared to the VitaminD Treated Area (Control) at End of Treatment (Week 12).</measure>
    <time_frame>week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The local Psoriasis severity index (LPSI) was adapted from the well known PASI. The investigator evaluated and graded the severity of erythema, induration, and scaliness as the key symptoms of psoriasis on the study areas (0-4). A total severity score was calculated as the sum of the three symptom ratings (range 0-12). The measure reported is the change in LPSI at end of treatment versus baseline. A negative change indicates an improvement of the LPSI.</description>

    <time_frame>week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Lesional erythema was measured objectively with a measurement device (Mexameter). The Mexameter delivers a two digit number for the redness of the skin (range 0-99). 0 = no redness and 99 = maximal redness.</description>

    <measure>Patient Satisfaction (Week 12)</measure>
    <time_frame>week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Patient satisfaction will be measured by questionnaire using the System usability score (SUS). The participant's scores for each question are converted to a new number, added together and then multiplied by 2.5 to convert the original scores of 0-40 to 0-100. Though the scores are 0-100, these are not percentages and should be considered only in terms of their percentile ranking. The higher the score the better the patient satisfaction the better the outcome. The lower the score the worse the patient satisfaction the worse the outcome.</description>

          <description>Skin type was assessed by a dermatologist according to Fitzpatrick type (I-VI):
Type I always burns, never tans (pale white; blond or red hair; blue eyes; freckles).
Type II usually burns, tans minimally (white; fair; blond or red hair; blue, green, or hazel eyes) Type III sometimes mild burn, tans uniformly (cream white; fair with any hair or eye color) Type IV burns minimally, always tans well (moderate brown) Type V very rarely burns, tans very easily (dark brown) Type VI Never burns, never tans (deeply pigmented dark brown to darkest brown)</description>

        <description>The local Psoriasis severity index (LPSI) was adapted from the well known PASI. The investigator evaluated and graded the severity of erythema, induration, and scaliness as the key symptoms of psoriasis on the study areas (0-4). A total severity score was calculated as the sum of the three symptom ratings (range 0-12). The measure reported is the change in LPSI at end of treatment versus baseline. A negative change indicates an improvement of the LPSI.</description>

        <description>Patient satisfaction will be measured by questionnaire using the System usability score (SUS). The participant's scores for each question are converted to a new number, added together and then multiplied by 2.5 to convert the original scores of 0-40 to 0-100. Though the scores are 0-100, these are not percentages and should be considered only in terms of their percentile ranking. The higher the score the better the patient satisfaction the better the outcome. The lower the score the worse the patient satisfaction the worse the outcome.</description>
