  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of hydrocephalus is the most time consuming, and arguably the most important
      role of the pediatric neurosurgical service at most children's' hospitals. Despite many
      technological advances, cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) shunting procedures remain the mainstay
      of hydrocephalus treatment. While often lifesaving, CSF shunting procedures are associated
      with high complication rates and account for a disproportionate share of health care
      expenditures and morbidity.

      Programmable CSF shunt valves, through which CSF flow and pressure can be adjusted by quick
      and painless transcutaneous reprogramming, have been implanted for more than 15 years in the
      developed world. Reprogramming these valves relies on rotational magnetic forces, which are
      applied by neurosurgeons and neurosurgical advanced practice providers. Inadvertent
      reprogramming (IR) can occur when patients with these valves are exposed to magnetic fields
      in the environment, which may lead to serious symptoms that may require urgent reprogramming
      and/or surgery.

      The concurrent proliferation of magnetically sensitive programmable CSF shunt valves and
      household items that generate substantial magnetic fields has caused concern among patients,
      parents and providers about the potential consequences of inadvertent valve reprogramming.
      This growing concern led the FDA to issue a warning to individuals with programmable valves
      in 2014, which deemed the programmable valves safe for use but vulnerable to IR when
      household devices such as tablets or cell phones are placed within 2 inches of the valve. The
      FDA recommended further study, stating that no systematic evaluation had been performed
      regarding the prevalence of accidental valve adjustments.

      By evaluating each of the patients with magnetically susceptible CSF shunt valves, during
      each of the routine points of contact with the service, investigators aim to define the
      prevalence of inadvertent shunt reprogramming, to correlate with the presence and absence of
      symptoms and radiographic changes, and to evaluate the risk of inadvertent shunt
      reprogramming based on exposure to common environmental items.

    <textblock>
      Investigators intend to evaluate all patients 21 years old and younger with magnetically
      susceptible CSF shunts, specifically those with Strata (Medtronic, Dublin) valves implanted.
      All evaluations will be performed during routine patient care in the hospital, the emergency
      department and in the outpatient facilities. Valve settings will be checked transcutaneously
      in the standard manner, before and after any MRI studies.

      Evaluating IR and making correlations between exposure to MRI or environmental magnets and
      symptoms and radiographic changes (when available) will require the patient or family to
      complete a brief questionnaire. It will then require the study team and delegated providers
      to check the valve setting before and after MRI, and to gather clinical information from the
      medical record and from the current clinical evaluation.

      Each patient's initial enrollment will require the acquisition of an informed consent, which
      will cover all future evaluations of IR during the three year study period for that patient.
      However, every time a patient enrolled in the study encounters the neurosurgical service, all
      study steps will be performed, including the valve check before and after MRI, the
      participant's completion of the questionnaire, and the research staff's completion of the
      data sheets.

        Patients 21 years of age and younger, with Strata valve CSF shunts, who are being evaluated
        by the All Children's Hospital (ACH) neurosurgical service as part of standard of care,
        will be eligible for participation during the three-year enrollment period. Each time an
        eligible patient has contact with the neurosurgical service their valve will be checked for
        possible inadvertent reprogramming in the outpatient facilities, emergency department, and
        inpatient setting. Patients will only have their valves checked as part of this study once
        during each encounter. Only patients who were evaluated by the neurosurgical service and
        returned to their normal environment more than seven days prior to their current encounter
        will be eligible to have their valves rechecked as part of this study.

            <description>Pediatric patients with adjustable cerebral spinal fluid shunt valves were assessed at &quot;single&quot; encounters when scheduled for an MRI. Assessment included questionnaires that assessed multiple variables that have been previously associated with inadvertent reprogramming, including proximity to magnets, iPads and cell phones. Valve settings were assessed before and after the MRI and data collected regarding history, clinical and imaging findidngs.</description>
