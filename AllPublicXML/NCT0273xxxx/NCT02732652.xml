  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, a score based on glycosaminoglycan (GAG) profiling in subjects with suspicion
      of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is hypothesized to distinguish malignant masses when early
      actionable clinical decisions are desirable. For example to diagnose early recurrence after
      surgical treatment; to screen population at risk of RCC; or to distinguish benign masses from
      RCC before surgical treatment. To this end, plasma and urine GAGs will be measured in a
      prospective cohort of patients referred to surgical treatment for RCC. The resulting GAG
      scores are then correlated to post-surgical recurrence, to post-surgical definitive diagnosis
      and and to tumor size if RCC. In a subset cohort of patients at high risk of RCC recurrence,
      plasma and urine GAGs will be monitored to observe its correlation with disease recurrence.
