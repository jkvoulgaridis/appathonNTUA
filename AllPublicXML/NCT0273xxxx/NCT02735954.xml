    <textblock>
      In Colorado, marijuana is currently used for both recreational and medicinal purposes.To
      learn more about the positive and negative long term medical effects of marijuana use.
      Information obtained during this study may identify new markers that influence the
      development of lung diseases such as COPD. The Investigators are also interested in learning
      more about the effects of marijuana use for insomnia and how it may or may not affect sleep.

    <textblock>
      In Colorado, marijuana is currently used for both recreational and medicinal purposes. The
      major active drug is tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). The most common route of use is through
      inhalation of the combustion products of the dried, buds/flowers from the female plant either
      rolled in paper (joint) or burned through a screen in a dry or water filled pipe (bong).
      Increasingly THC is consumed.

      The side effects of the inhalation of burned leaves are controversial. The purpose of this
      proposal is to establish a prospective cohort of heavy marijuana users to evaluate positive
      and negative long term medical effects of marijuana use. As marijuana has also been reported
      for use to help treat insomnia, a sub-study will focus on how marijuana is used for sleep
      disorders and disturbances.

      This study will enroll individuals that use marijuana to learn more about long-term health
      effects. The study involves one visit where participants will complete questionnaires,
      breathing tests, blood and urine collection. There is a sub-study where eligible participants
      will also complete an at-home sleep monitoring test. Participants will be contacted multiple
      times a year for long-term follow-up.
