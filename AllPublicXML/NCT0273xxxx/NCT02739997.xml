  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, multi-site, non-randomized, open-label study evaluating the safety and
      efficacy of MK-7625A 1.5 g (ceftolozane 1 g/tazobactam 0.5 g) plus metronidazole 500 mg for
      the treatment of Complicated Intra-abdominal Infections (cIAI) in Japanese participants.
      Efficacy will be primarily assessed by clinical response defined as complete resolution or
      significant improvement in signs and symptoms of the index infection.

    <description>The percentage of participants with clinical responses (cure, failure, or indeterminate) at TOC was determined. Clinical cure was defined as &quot;complete resolution or significant improvement in signs and symptoms of the index infection, such that no additional antibacterial therapy or surgical or drainage procedure is required&quot;. Clinical failure was defined as &quot;death related to IAI at any time point; persisting or recurrent infection within the abdomen requiring additional intervention to cure; need for treatment with additional antibiotics for ongoing IAI symptoms; or post-surgical wound infection that requires additional antimicrobial therapy and/or non-routing wound care&quot;. Indeterminate was defined as &quot;study data are not available for evaluation for any reason, including death during the study period unrelated to the index infection; or extenuating circumstances that preclude classification as cure or failure&quot;.</description>

Clinical cure was defined as &quot;complete resolution or significant improvement in signs and symptoms of the index infection, such that no additional antibacterial therapy or surgical or drainage procedure is required&quot;. Clinical failure was defined as &quot;death related to IAI at any time point; persisting or recurrent infection within the abdomen requiring additional intervention to cure; need for treatment with additional antibiotics for ongoing IAI symptoms; or post-surgical wound infection that requires additional antimicrobial therapy and/or non-routing wound care&quot;. Indeterminate was defined as &quot;study data are not available for evaluation for any reason, including death during the study period unrelated to the index infection; or extenuating circumstances that preclude classification as cure or failure&quot;.</description>

        <description>The percentage of participants with microbiological responses (eradication, persistence, or indeterminate) at EOT was determined. Eradication was defined as &quot;absence of the baseline pathogen in a specimen&quot;. Persistence was defined as &quot;presence of the baseline pathogen in a specimen&quot;. Indeterminate was defined as &quot;Baseline culture either not obtained or has an assessment of no growth, or any other circumstance that makes it impossible to define the microbiological response&quot;.</description>
