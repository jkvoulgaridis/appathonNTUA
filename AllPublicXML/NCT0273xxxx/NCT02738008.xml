    <textblock>
      Open-label, multi-center extension study of intravenous ARC-520 in combination with entecavir
      or tenofovir in patients with chronic HBV infection. Patients who successfully completed the
      Heparc-2002 (NCT02604199) and Heparc-2003 (NCT02604212) studies and responded to therapy are
      eligible to participate. Responders are defined as patients who showed a ½ log or greater
      reduction in their serum Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HBsAg) levels from baseline to day 71 ±
      3 days of the primary Heparc-2002 and Heparc-2003 studies. Patients who have signed a Human
      Research Ethics Committee approved informed consent and have met all of the protocol
      eligibility criteria will continue receiving daily oral entecavir or tenofovir and
      intravenous (IV) injections of ARC-520. Study visits will occur once every 4 weeks for a
      total of 9 visits for monitoring and ARC-520 administration.

      Patients will undergo the following evaluations at regular intervals during the study:
      medical history, physical examinations, vital sign measurements (blood pressure, heart rate,
      respiratory rate and temperature), weight, adverse events (AEs), 12-lead electrocardiograms
      (ECGs), concomitant medications, blood sample collection for hematology, coagulation,
      chemistry, creatine kinase, troponin, hemoglobin A1c, exploratory pharmacodynamic (PD)
      measures, urinalysis, HBV serology, immunogenicity, and pregnancy testing for females of
      childbearing potential. Patients will be monitored for HBV virology, AEs, and exploratory PD
      measures for a total of 24 weeks after the last dose of ARC-520.

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 36</time_frame>
    <description>Initial responders are defined as participants who showed a ½ log or greater reduction in their serum HBsAg levels from baseline to Day 71 ± 3 days of the primary Heparc-2002 and Heparc-2003 studies, where baseline is defined as the average of pre-dose values.</description>

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An SAE is any AE that: results in death; is life-threatening; requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of an existing hospitalization; results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or is a medically important event or reaction. A TEAE was defined as an AE that was not present prior to the first study medication administration and started at/after the time of initiation of administration of study medication, or an AE which was present prior to initiation of study medication administration, which increased in severity after study medication administration.</description>
