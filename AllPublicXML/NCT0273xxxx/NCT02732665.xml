  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, glycosaminoglycan (GAG) profiling in subjects diagnosed with metastatic renal
      cell carcinoma (mRCC) is hypothesized to be useful in monitoring drug response and predict
      radiological response. To this end, glycosaminoglycan scores based on longitudinal samples of
      plasma and urine in prospectively enrolled patients will be correlated to radiological
      response to first-line therapy based on current standard-of-care. A positive correlation
      indicates that glycosaminoglycan scores can successfully detect patients that are not
      responding to treatment before the scheduled follow-up in which radiological imaging is
      performed. Data on the extent of metastasis (number of metastatic sites) will be collected to
      assess whether glycosaminoglycans correlate accordingly.

    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 weeks after treatment start</time_frame>
    <description>ROC curves are generated to determine the specificity and sensitivity of the glycosaminoglycan scores sampled at 6 weeks to progressive disease as assessed by radiological imaging during the first scheduled response evaluation according to RECIST 1.1. criteria. The area under each ROC curve (AUC) is then calculated as primary outcome measure.</description>

    <description>ROC curves are generated to determine the specificity and sensitivity of the glycosaminoglycan scores sampled at 6 weeks to complete response or partial response as assessed by radiological imaging during the first scheduled response evaluation according to RECIST 1.1. criteria. The area under each ROC curve (AUC) is then calculated as primary outcome measure.</description>
