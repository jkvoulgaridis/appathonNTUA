             features of small cell disease are not eligible.

        At enrolment, patients must fit into one of the following 5 categories:

          1. Treatment naïve for mCRPC (have not yet started approved therapies for CRPC ie:

             treatment with Abi/Enza/Apa. These patients must absolutely be responding or stable
             (PSA values must be stable or declining after starting Abi/Enza/Apa treatment) and
             have an expected life expectancy of more than 1 year.

                  'Yes' to only Questions 8-11, they will be considered eligible upon physician
                  clearance

               -  Successfully pass the screening CPET by achieving:

                  o Volitional exhaustion (RPE ≥ 9 using the 0-10 RPE scale) after 8 (or more)
                  minutes, in the absence of any cardiorespiratory abnormalities.

               -  If cardiorespiratory abnormalities are identified, please refer the patient to
                  his managing physician for further assessment and diagnosis.

               -  Note: To assist practitioners with delivering valid CPET assessments, patients
                  nearing exhaustion should achieve a respiratory exchange ratio (RER) of ≥1.1.

               -  RER is not a criteria of the test. This objective measure should only be used to
                  assist practitioners with patient management and decision-making.

             metastatic castration sensitive disease are eligible.

          -  Currently receiving experimental treatment with non-approved drugs at the time of
             enrolment. Patients must undergo a 28-day washout between last dose and screening
