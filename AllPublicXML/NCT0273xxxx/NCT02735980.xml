  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of prexasertib when given to
      participants with extensive stage disease small cell lung cancer (ED-SCLC). The study will
      evaluate how the body processes the drug and how the drug affects the body. The study will
      also evaluate the association between tumor response and the participant's perceived quality
      of life.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) (Objective Response Rate [ORR])</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 10 months</time_frame>
    <description>ORR was the percentage of participants achieving a best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. CR defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no appearance of new lesions. PR defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters (LD) of target lesions (taking as reference the baseline sum LD), no progression of non-target lesions, and no appearance of new lesions</description>

    <measure>Disease Control Rate: Percentage of Participants With a Best Overall Response of CR, PR, or Stable Disease (SD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through Disease Progression or Death from Any Cause to 28 months</time_frame>
    <description>Disease control rate (DCR) is defined as the percentage of participants achieving a best overall response of CR, PR, or SD as determined by RECIST 1.1. CR is defined as a disappearance of all target lesions and any pathological lymph nodes must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm and normalization of tumor marker results; PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters; SD is defined as neither sufficient shrinking to qualify as PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Disease Progression or Death (up to 9 months)</time_frame>
    <description>PFS defined as the from randomization date to the first evidence of disease progression as defined by RECIST v1.1 or death from any cause. Progressive Disease (PD) was at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, with reference being the smallest sum on study and an absolute increase of at least 5 mm, or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions, or 1 or more new lesions. If a participant does not have a complete baseline disease assessment, then the PFS time was censored at the date of first dose, regardless of whether or not objectively determined disease progression or death has been observed for the participant. If a participant was not known to have died or have objective progression as of the data inclusion cutoff date for the analysis, the PFS time was censored at the last adequate tumor assessment date.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response (DoR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Date of CR or PR to Date of Disease Progression or Death Due to Any Cause up to 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>DoR the time from the date of an objective response until Progressive Disease (PD): was at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, with reference being the smallest sum on study and an absolute increase of at least 5 mm, or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions, or 1 or more new lesions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 28 months</time_frame>
    <description>OS defined as from randomization date to the date of death due to any cause. For each participant who is not known to have died as of the data-inclusion cutoff date for overall survival analysis, OS time was censored on the last date the participant is known to be alive.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Lung Cancer Symptom Scale Score (LCSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>LCSS is a 9-item questionnaire, six measuring major symptoms for lung malignancies (appetite, fatigue, cough, dyspnea, hemoptysis and pain), and 3 summation items related to total symptomatic distress, activity status and overall quality of life. Participant responses were measured using visual analogue scales (VAS) with 100-mm lines. The LCSS total score was defined as the mean of the 9 items of the scale, each scored between 0 (for best outcome) to 100 (for worst outcome).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline on the Average Symptom Burden Index (ASBI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>ABSI was the mean score for the six major lung cancer symptoms (appetite, fatigue, cough, dyspnea, hemoptysis and pain), each scored between 0 (for best outcome) to 100 (for worst outcome).</description>

        <description>Disease control rate (DCR) is defined as the percentage of participants achieving a best overall response of CR, PR, or SD as determined by RECIST 1.1. CR is defined as a disappearance of all target lesions and any pathological lymph nodes must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm and normalization of tumor marker results; PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters; SD is defined as neither sufficient shrinking to qualify as PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD.</description>
