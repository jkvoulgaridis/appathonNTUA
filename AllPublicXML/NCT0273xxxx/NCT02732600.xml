  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In August 2014, the White House issued an Executive Action mandating that 25 VA medical
      centers place Peer Specialists (Veterans recovered from mental illness who are trained to
      support other Veterans with mental illness) on Primary Care Teams. Research shows that the
      success of adding new staff to existing teams can be improved by outside aid and
      facilitation. This quality improvement project will evaluate whether providing expanded
      support to half of the Primary Care Teams will lead to better outcomes when compared with
      teams that do not get extra support.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peer Specialists are individuals with mental illness currently deployed to serve Veterans in
      specialty mental health clinics based upon their lived experiences. Peer Specialist delivered
      interventions have been shown to improve patient activation in multiple studies. In August
      2014, the White House issued an Executive Action mandating that 25 VA medical centers pilot
      the deployment of Peer Specialists in their Patient Aligned Care Teams (PACTs). This project
      expands upon this nationally mandated Peer Specialist pilot with the integration of a cluster
      randomized implementation trial. This quality improvement project will evaluate the impact of
      facilitated implementation vs. standard implementation to support on the deployment of Peer
      Specialists in PACTs.

      The 25 sites will be divided into three cohorts (n=8,8,9). Each cohort will begin over three
      successive six-month blocks beginning in early 2016. Within each cohort, sites will be
      randomized to receive either facilitated or standard implementation. Facilitated
      Implementation sites will receive one year of support based on the i-PARIHS implementation
      model which includes training, implementation planning, ongoing external facilitation,
      feedback and consultation. Standard Implementation sites will receive written guidance and
      limited consultation by the investigators' team. The investigators will compare the groups on
      1) the percent of their target population that actually received PS services; 2) ratings on
      PS workload productivity including ; 3) Peer Implementation and Services scores; 4)
      assessment of Veteran's change over time on the outcome variables of satisfaction,
      activation, and functioning ; 5) qualitative analysis of how well PSs were deployed and their
      impact.

    <measure>Patient Activation Measure Change</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months, 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Activation Measure (PAM) is a 13-item survey that measures an individual's perceived ability to manage his or her illness and health behaviors and act as an effective patient. It has been shown to be reliable, valid, sensitive to change and correlates with measures of improved self-management. Scores for this outcome range from Zero to One Hundred with higher scores indicating higher levels of patient activation (better outcome).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Team Development Measure Change</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months, 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The Team Development Measure is a 31 item self-report survey that evaluates the degree to which a team has and uses the components needed for highly effective teamwork including: Cohesiveness, Communication, Role clarity, and Goals and means clarity.</description>

    <measure>Organizational Readiness for Change</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Organizational Readiness for Change is a 129 item self-report survey that assesses organizational functioning in 4 domains: Motivation for Change, Adequacy of Resources, Staff Attributes, and Organizational Climate.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Peer Fidelity Measure Change</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months, 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The Peer Fidelity Measure assesses: a) service adherence to the VA's PS model and b) barriers or facilitators known to impact the PS deployment. The first part has 15 domains of peer services critical to the VA's peer support model (e.g., being a role model that recovery is possible; share personal recovery story). The second has 17 domains of implementation factors shown to either help or hinder PS deployment (e.g., role clarity, support for PS at higher organizational levels, regular supervision). Each domain has 1-2 questions (responses ranging from 1=Not at all to 5=Very much) that ask about the presence of the services or implementation factors. The Peer Fidelity Measure will be administered to both Peer Specialists and their supervisors.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Satisfaction Index-Mental Health Change</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months, 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The Satisfaction Index-Mental Health is a 12-item, unidimensional measure of patient satisfaction with care. It has been used with Veteran populations and has been shown to be valid, reliable, and sensitive to change in a sample of Veterans with mental illnesses being treated in primary care settings. It will be administered to Veterans who receive care from the Peer Specialists involved in the project.</description>

        <title>Patient Activation Measure Change</title>
        <description>The Patient Activation Measure (PAM) is a 13-item survey that measures an individual's perceived ability to manage his or her illness and health behaviors and act as an effective patient. It has been shown to be reliable, valid, sensitive to change and correlates with measures of improved self-management. Scores for this outcome range from Zero to One Hundred with higher scores indicating higher levels of patient activation (better outcome).</description>

        <description>The Peer Fidelity Measure assesses: a) service adherence to the VA's PS model and b) barriers or facilitators known to impact the PS deployment. The first part has 15 domains of peer services critical to the VA's peer support model (e.g., being a role model that recovery is possible; share personal recovery story). The second has 17 domains of implementation factors shown to either help or hinder PS deployment (e.g., role clarity, support for PS at higher organizational levels, regular supervision). Each domain has 1-2 questions (responses ranging from 1=Not at all to 5=Very much) that ask about the presence of the services or implementation factors. The Peer Fidelity Measure will be administered to both Peer Specialists and their supervisors.</description>

        <title>The Satisfaction Index-Mental Health Change</title>
        <description>The Satisfaction Index-Mental Health is a 12-item, unidimensional measure of patient satisfaction with care. It has been used with Veteran populations and has been shown to be valid, reliable, and sensitive to change in a sample of Veterans with mental illnesses being treated in primary care settings. It will be administered to Veterans who receive care from the Peer Specialists involved in the project.</description>
