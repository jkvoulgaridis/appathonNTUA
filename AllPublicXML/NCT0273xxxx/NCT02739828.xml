          <description>The Work Productivity and Activity Impairment-Specific Health Problem (WPAI-SHP) questionnaire is a 6-item questionnaire used to assess work and activity impairment due to symptoms of HS. Work time missed is calculated based on 2 items: (Q2) the number of hours missed from work due to health problems in the past 7 days from visit and (Q4) the number of actual work hours in the past 7 days from visit, using the formula Q2/(Q2+Q4) and converted to percent. Higher numbers indicate greater impairment and less productivity.</description>

          <description>WPAI-SHP is a 6-item participant-assessed questionnaire used to assess work and activity impairment due to symptoms of HS. Calculated based on 1 item: (Q5) to what degree did the disease impair the productivity while working in the past 7 days from visit. The item was measured on a scale from 0 (no effect) to 10 (completely prevented from doing regular activities/ working), using the formula Q5/10 and converted to percent. Data are presented as impairment percentage, with higher numbers indicating greater impairment and less productivity.</description>

          <title>WPAI:SHP: Overall Activity Impairment Due to Health Problem</title>
          <description>WPAI-SHP is a 6-item participant-assessed questionnaire used to assess work and activity impairment due to symptoms of HS. Calculated based on 1 item: (Q6) to what degree did the disease impair the ability to do regular activities in the past 7 days from visit, measured on a scale from 0 (no effect) to 10 (completely prevented from doing regular activities/working), using the formula Q6/10 and converted to percent. Data are presented as impairment percentage, with higher numbers indicating greater impairment and less productivity.</description>

        <description>The 'work time missed due to health problem' was assessed using the WPAI-SHP questionnaire. WPAI-SHP is a 6-item participant-assessed questionnaire used to assess work and activity impairment due to symptoms of HS. The 'work time missed due to health problem' was calculated based on 2 items: (Q2) the number of hours missed from work due to health problems in the past 7 days from visit and (Q4) the number of actual work hours in the past 7 days from visit. The data was calculated using the formula Q2/(Q2+Q4) and converted to percent. Data are presented as impairment percentage, with higher numbers indicating greater impairment and less productivity.</description>

        <title>WPAI-SHP: Mean Change From Baseline in Work Time Missed Due to Health Problem at Week 24</title>
        <description>The 'work time missed due to health problem' was assessed using the WPAI-SHP questionnaire. WPAI-SHP is a 6-item participant-assessed questionnaire used to assess work and activity impairment due to symptoms of HS. The 'work time missed due to health problem' was calculated based on 2 items: (Q2) the number of hours missed from work due to health problems in the past 7 days from visit and (Q4) the number of actual work hours in the past 7 days from visit. The data was calculated using the formula Q2/(Q2+Q4) and converted to percent. Data are presented as impairment percentage, with higher numbers indicating greater impairment and less productivity.</description>

        <title>WPAI-SHP: Mean Change From Baseline in Impairment While Working Due to Health Problem at Week 4</title>
        <description>The 'impairment while working due to health problem' was assessed using the WPAI-SHP questionnaire. WPAI-SHP is a 6-item participant-assessed questionnaire used to assess work and activity impairment due to symptoms of HS. The 'impairment while working due to health problem' was calculated based on 1 item: (Q5) to what degree did the disease impair the productivity while working in the past 7 days from visit. The item was measured on a scale from 0 (no effect) to 10 (completely prevented from doing regular activities/working). The data was calculated using the formula Q5/10 and converted to percent. Data are presented as impairment percentage, with higher numbers indicating greater impairment and less productivity.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Overall Work Impairment Due to Health Problem at Week 12</title>
        <description>The 'overall work impairment due to health problem' was assessed using the WPAI-SHP questionnaire. WPAI-SHP is a 6-item participant-assessed questionnaire used to assess work and activity impairment due to symptoms of HS. The 'overall work impairment due to health problem' was calculated based on 3 items: (Q2) the number of hours missed from work due to health problems in the past 7 days from visit; (Q4) the number of actual work hours in the past 7 days from visit; and (Q5) to what degree did the disease impair the productivity while working past 7 days from visit. The data was calculated using the formula Q2/(Q2+Q4)+[(1-(Q2/(Q2+Q4))x(Q5/10)] and converted to percent. Data are presented as impairment percentage, with higher numbers indicating greater impairment and less productivity.</description>

WPAI-SHP is a 6-item participant-assessed questionnaire used to assess work and activity impairment due to symptoms of HS. The 'overall activity impairment due to health problem' was calculated based on 1 item: (Q6) to what degree did the disease impair the ability to do regular activities in the past 7 days from visit. The item was measured on a scale from 0 (no effect) to 10 (completely prevented from doing regular activities/working). The data was calculated using the formula Q6/10 and converted to percent. Data are presented as impairment percentage, with higher numbers indicating greater impairment and less productivity.</description>

The 'overall work impairment due to health problem' was calculated based on 3 items: (Q2) the number of hours missed from work due to health problems in the past 7 days from visit; (Q4) the number of actual work hours in the past 7 days from visit; and (Q5) to what degree did the disease impair the productivity while working past 7 days from visit. The data was calculated using the formula Q2/(Q2+Q4)+[(1-(Q2/(Q2+Q4))x(Q5/10)] and converted to percent. Data are presented as impairment percentage, with higher numbers indicating greater impairment and less productivity.</description>
