  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate whether addition of the Biobridge scaffold to the standard surgery for
      vascularized lymph node transfer will improve the outcome of surgical treatment in lymphedema
      of the upper arm.

      The investigators will perform lymph scans (lymphoscintigrams) before surgery and one year
      following surgery to determine the success of the surgery. In addition, the volume of the
      operated arm will be monitored by repeated measurement with a tape measure. The investigators
      will also track bioimpedance, a painless technique to detect fluid in the tissues. The
      investigators will obtain small skin biopsies and blood samples to detect the biological
      changes that may occur as a result of successful surgery.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        The subject must be a breast cancer survivor, at least three years beyond completion of
        cancer therapy, free of clinical disease, and eligible for surgical intervention.

          -  Ages 18 to 75 years (inclusive).

          -  Swelling of 1 limb that is not completely reversed by elevation or compression

          -  Stage II or greater lymphedema at screening, based on the International Society of
             Lymphology (ISL) staging system

          -  Completion of a full course of complete decongestive therapy (CDT), according to ISL
             guidelines at least 8 weeks prior to screening, including use of compression garments
             for at least 8 weeks without change in regimen

          -  Willingness to maintain a stable regimen of self-care, with consistent use of
             compression garments from screening through the entire study duration (through the
             safety follow-up visit). Self-bandaging, use of nighttime compression garments, and
             intermittent pneumatic compression devices are allowed, but the procedures and
             regimens must remain consistent from screening though the entire study duration.

          -  Two consecutive measurements of limb volume (LV) in the affected limb taken at least 1
             day apart during the screening period must be within 10% of each other. A maximum of 3
             measurements can be taken. Affected limb volume ratio &gt;20% (affected limb compared to
             unaffected limb); volume measurements will be performed and volume ratio will be
             calculated at S1 and S2 visit.

          -  Evidence of abnormal bioimpedance ratio, if feasible based upon unilateral disease:
             L-Dex &gt;10 units; bioimpedance performed at S1 and S1

             consent form document

          -  Willingness and ability to comply with all study procedures, including measurement of
             skin thickness using skin calipers.
