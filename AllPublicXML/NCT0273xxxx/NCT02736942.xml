      Background Surgery for mid and low rectal cancer is associated with relative high rates of
      incomplete mesorectal excisions and high rates of circumferential resection margin (CRM)
      involvement resulting in significant number of local recurrences. Moreover, patients with mid
      and low rectal cancer suffer from high rates of morbidity, permanent colostomies and
      impairment of quality of life. The transanal TME (TaTME) has been developed to improve the
      quality of TME surgery in mid and low rectal cancer.

      Study design The COLOR III trial is an international multicentre randomised study comparing
      short- and long-term outcomes of TaTME and laparoscopic TME for rectal cancer. The study will
      include a quality assessment phase before randomisation to ensure required competency level
      and uniformity of the new TaTME technique and the laparoscopic TME. During the trial clinical
      data will be reviewed centrally to ensure uniform quality.

      Endpoints The primary endpoint of the study is the local recurrence rate at 3-years
      follow-up. Secondary endpoints include sphincter saving procedures, short-term morbidity and
      mortality, involved circumferential resection margin (CRM), disease-free and overall survival
      at 3 and 5 years, completeness of mesorectum and quality of life.

      Statistics In laparoscopic TME the percentage of local recurrence at 3-years follow-up is
      estimated 5%. With the non-inferiority margin set at 4%, with a one-sided level of
      significance of 2.5% and a power of 80%, a total of 1104 patients is needed, 669 patients in
      the TaTME arm and 335 patients in the laparoscopic TME arm. All analyses will be performed on
      intention-to-treat basis.

      Main selection criteria Patients with histologically proven single mid or distal rectum
      carcinoma (0 to 10 cm from anal verge) at MRI, eligible for restorative surgery with a
      curative intent, are included. Patients with a T1 tumor suitable for local excision, T3
      tumors with a suspected involved circumferential resection margin and T4 tumors are excluded.

      Hypothesis The hypothesis is that TaTME will result in a comparable local recurrence rate at
      3-years follow-up with benefit of lower morbidity and conversions. Furthermore, because of
      direct endoscopic visualization, even in very low tumors a coloanal anastomosis can be
      created, resulting in a lower colostomy rate compared with laparoscopic and open resection.
      Because long-term outcomes are unknown, within a trial setting the technique can be
      standardized and quality control can be performed.

    <textblock>
      To improve oncological and functional outcomes of patients with rectal cancer new surgical
      techniques are being developed. The adoption of the TME technique has resulted in better
      oncological outcome in the last decades. The addition of neoadjuvant therapy has further
      improved oncological outcome. The minimal invasive laparoscopic resection of rectal cancer
      has shown to be safe and to result in improved short-term outcomes and reduced morbidity.

      Nevertheless, the laparoscopic resection of mid and low rectal cancer remains challenging due
      to the anatomy of the narrow pelvis and is associated with a relative high risk of resections
      with an involved CRM resulting in increased risk of a local recurrence.

      In attempt to improve the quality of the TME procedure in low rectal cancer and further
      improve oncological results the TaTME has been developed, in which the rectum is dissected
      transanally according to TME principles. First series have been described since 2010 and
      although randomised evidence is still lacking this new technique has shown to be feasible and
      safe. The rectum including the total mesorectum is mobilised transanally in a reversed way
      with minimally invasive surgery including high quality imaging techniques.

      The TaTME technique for mid and low rectal cancer has shown to have potential benefits:
      better specimen quality with less R1 resections, less morbidity, less conversion to
      laparotomy and more sphincter saving rectal resections without compromising oncological
      outcomes.

      The investigators propose to evaluate the TaTME technique compared with conventional
      laparoscopic rectal resection for patients with mid and low rectal cancer in an international
      randomised trial: the COLOR III trial.
