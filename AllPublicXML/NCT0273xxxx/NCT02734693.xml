    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, efficacy and safety
      study in children with ADHD in a laboratory classroom setting. The study will be comprised of
      3 periods: Screening (up to 35 days) including a 3 - 5 day ADHD medication washout prior to
      Day -1; Double-blind randomized treatment with either dasotraline (4 mg/day) or placebo for14
      days; and End of Study (EOS) Visit (7 days after last dose). Prior to the start of treatment
      (Day 1) and following the conclusion of the double-blind period (Day 15), subjects will
      undergo a full-day laboratory classroom evaluation during which approximately 12 to 18
      subjects will be assessed. Each laboratory classroom day will include seven 30-minute
      simulated classroom sessions where trained observers will assess subjects using the Swanson,
      Kotkin, Agler, M-Flynn, and Pelham (SKAMP) Scale. In addition during each classroom session,
      a 10-minute math test (Permanent Product Measure of Performance [PERMP]) will be administered
      to evaluate sustained attention and effort. Seven (± 2) days after the last dose of study
      drug, subjects will return to the clinic and complete safety assessments.

        <description>The Swanson, Kotkin, Agler, M-Flynn, Pelham Rating Scale (SKAMP) scale is a 13-item independent observer rating of subject impairment of classroom observed behaviors. Each item is rated on a 7-point impairment scale (0 = normal to 6 = maximal impairment). The combined scores for the SKAMP are obtained by summing the values of all 13 items in the assessment. The range of SKAMP combined score is 0-78, with higher values represent a worse outcome.</description>

        <description>TThe Permanent Product Measure of Performance (PERMP) is a math test consisting of 400 problems. Both attempted problems and correct problems are assessed. Subjects are to complete as many problems as possible in 10 minutes. Performance is measured by the number of math problems attempted and the number of math problems correctly completed. The minimum possible score is 0. The highest possible score is 400, with higher scores mean higher performance and less severe ADHD symptoms.</description>
