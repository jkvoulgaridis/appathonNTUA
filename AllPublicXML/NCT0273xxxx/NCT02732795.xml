  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adenotonsillectomy (AT) is one of the most common pediatric surgeries performed, and is
      estimated to comprise 530,000 procedures in children under 15 years of age. Historically, the
      leading cause for these procedures was recurrent infections; however, more recently surgical
      indications include sleep disordered breathing and obstructive sleep apnea (OSAS).
      Pre-operative polysomnography (PSG) is recommended for all children with suspected OSAS prior
      to undergoing AT, although it is unclear whether sleep disordered breathing characteristics
      predict post-operative outcomes or complications.

      Obesity has become an epidemic in the pediatric population. More recently, an increased
      population of obese children are presenting for AT with upper airway obstruction with or
      without tonsillar hypertrophy, which is similar to the adult etiology of OSAS. Obesity is a
      multisystem disease, causing fatty liver and cardiac disease, defects in glucose metabolism,
      insulin resistance, leptin resistance, and creates a state of chronic inflammation. Markers
      for inflammation, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Î±, C-reactive protein (CRP), leptin,
      interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10, are abnormal in obese patients and have also been linked to
      more severe OSAS disease in children even after controlling for BMI.

      In pediatrics, medication dosing is based on an actual body-weight calculation, however,
      recent reports suggest that this dosing method is over-dosing patients with obesity.
      Therefore, increased respiratory complications after surgery may be related to inappropriate
      intra-operative opioid dosing.

      Specific Aim 1 (SA1): To compare morphine pharmacokinetics in normal children &lt;=12 years of
      age, non-obese children with severe OSAS, and obese children with severe OSAS. The
      investigators hypothesize that obesity independently enhances morphine pharmacokinetics.

      Specific Aim 2 (SA2): To determine whether biomarkers related to obesity, chronic
      inflammation, and OSAS predict changes to morphine pharmacokinetics. The investigators
      hypothesize that inflammatory and obesity-related biomarkers are elevated in overweight
      children with OSAS, more so in obese children with OSA, compared to lean children with OSAS.
      In addition, the investigators hypothesizes that leptin independently is linked to altered
      morphine pharmacokinetics.
