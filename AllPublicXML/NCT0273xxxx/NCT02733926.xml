    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effect of vegetation cover on certain Interleukin-10 and
      immunoglobulinE (IgE) among children (3-5 y old). Children will either be in a kindergarten
      that does not have forest floor and agricultural land in the backyards, or alternatively they
      will be in a kindergarten that does have forest floor and agricultural land in the backyards.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      High vegetation cover is assumed to change immunoglobulinE (IgE) and interleukin-10
      concentrations in blood serum. Children living in high-green kindergarten are compared with
      those kindergarten living utilizing backyards with a low-green cover.

    <description>Diversity of skin bacterial phyla, particularly Proteobacterial community, is higher in intervention arm compared to control arm. Proteobacterial community was associated with the coverage of green land cover in an earlier study. In addition, it was different in atopic and non-atopic study subjects in an earlier study.
