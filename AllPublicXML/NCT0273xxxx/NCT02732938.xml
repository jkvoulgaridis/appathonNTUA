    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Phase 1b/2 study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of
      PF-04136309 in combination with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine, characterize the
      dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and overall safety profile of escalated doses of PF-04136309
      and the associated schedule, determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and to assess the
      enhancement of efficacy of PF-04136309 in combination with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine
      versus nab-paclitaxel + gemcitabine + placebo in terms of Progression Free Survival.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study has 2 parts:

      Phase 1b (dose-finding cohorts) will be open label as patients will receive ascending doses
      of PF-04136309 in combination with nab-paclitaxel + gemcitabine. The observation period for
      dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) will be from Day 1 to Day 28. Pharmacokinetic (PK) and
      pharmacodynamic (PD) properties of PF-04136309 will also be assessed. The criteria for dose
      escalation will be based on a modified toxicity probability interval (mTPI) method. After
      evaluating the safety and other results (eg, PK) from patients enrolled in the dose
      escalation cohorts, a dose level will be selected to be further evaluated as the Recommended
      Phase 2 Dose (RP2D). A minimum of 6 patients, up to 12 patients, will be treated at this dose
      level to establish it as the RP2D. To further evaluate safety and pharmacodynamics, the
      number of patients enrolled during this part of the study (Phase 1b) may be N up to 20. The
      study will stop if all PF-04136309 doses explored appear to be overly toxic.

      Phase 2 randomized double blinded placebo control. Approximately 92 patients will be
      randomized 1:1 to receive the RP2D of PF-04136309 in combination with nab-paclitaxel +
      gemcitabine (ARM A; n=46) versus nab-paclitaxel + gemcitabine + placebo (ARM B; n=46). The
      primary objective will be the enhancement of efficacy in terms of PFS.

      Patients will be treated as long as they are clinically benefiting from investigational
      product without unacceptable toxicity, objective disease progression, or withdrawal of
      consent.

             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or
             investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of
             study results and, in the judgment of the Investigator, would make the patient
             inappropriate for entry into this study.

         12. Pregnant female patients; breastfeeding female patients; males patients with partners
             currently pregnant, male patients able to father children and female patients of

             methods of contraception as outlined in this protocol for the duration of the study
             and for 28 days after last dose of PF-04136309, and for 6 months after last dose of

          <description>PF-04136309 (formulated 125 mg tablets) was administered orally at 750 mg twice-daily (BID) for 28-day cycles. Nab-paclitaxel (125 mg/m2) was administered as an intravenous (IV) infusion on Days 1, 8 and 15 followed by 1 week of no treatment in 28-day cycles. Gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2) was administered as an IV infusion immediately after nab-paclitaxel, on Days 1, 8 and 15 followed by 1 week off treatment for 28-day cycles.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Chemistries Laboratory Abnormalities by Maximum NCI CTCAE Grade [Phase 1b]</title>
        <description>Following parameters were analyzed for chemistry laboratory test: blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, glucose (fasting), calcium, sodium, potassium, chloride, total bicarbonate, AST, ALT, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, uric acid, albumin, total protein, Magnesium, phosphorous or phosphate. For potential Hy's Law cases, in addition to repeating AST and ALT, laboratory tests should have included albumin, creatine kinase, total bilirubin, direct and indirect bilirubin, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), prothrombin time / international normalized ratio (PT/INR), alkaline phosphatase, total bile acids, and acetaminophen drug and/or protein adduct levels. Laboratory abnormalities were graded per NCI CTCAE version 4.03 and those with at least 1 participant are presented here.</description>

        <population>All Phase 1b enrolled participants who received at least 1 dose of study treatment. GGT was an additional test for potential Hy's law. Only 1 participant in the PF-04136309 500 mg BID + Nab-paclitaxel + Gemcitabine treatment group was tested for GGT.</population>

            <description>PF-04136309 (formulated 125 mg tablets) was administered orally at 750 mg twice-daily (BID) for 28-day cycles. Nab-paclitaxel (125 mg/m2) was administered as an intravenous (IV) infusion on Days 1, 8 and 15 followed by 1 week of no treatment in 28-day cycles. Gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2) was administered as an IV infusion immediately after nab-paclitaxel, on Days 1, 8 and 15 followed by 1 week off treatment for 28-day cycles.</description>
