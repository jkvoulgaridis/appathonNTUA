  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the tolerability and safety profile of
      ASP8374 when administered as a single agent and in combination with pembrolizumab in
      participants with locally advanced (unresectable) or metastatic solid tumor malignancies.
      Also primary purpose is to characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of ASP8374 when
      administered as a single agent and in combination with pembrolizumab. Last primary purpose of
      this study is to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of ASP8374 when administered
      as a single agent and in combination with pembrolizumab.

      The secondary purpose of this study is to evaluate the anti-tumor effect (objective response
      rate [ORR], duration of response [DOR], persistence of response after discontinuation, and
      disease control rate [DCR]) of ASP8374 when administered as a single agent and in combination
      with pembrolizumab.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, multiple-dose, dose-escalation and expansion study of ASP8374 as a
      single agent and in combination with pembrolizumab. After discontinuation of study drug
      treatment, all participants will complete an end of treatment visit and safety follow-up
      visits. Participants will be enrolled in respectively escalation cohorts or expansion
      cohorts.

      Escalation cohorts: Approximately 63 participants may be enrolled in the escalation cohorts
      (approximately 33 participants for monotherapy and 30 participants for combination therapy).

      Expansion cohorts: The total number of subjects in the expansion cohorts will depend on the
      observed pharmacokinetic and antitumor activity. It is estimated that approximately 300
      participants may be enrolled in the monotherapy and combination therapy expansion cohorts.

      As the number of participants in the escalation cohorts and the expansion cohorts will depend
      on the observed Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT), pharmacokinetics and antitumor activity,
      approximately 363 participants are expected to be enrolled.

                  or colorectal cancer (CRC)).

          -  Subject has at least 1 measureable lesion per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
             Tumors (RECIST) 1.1. The measureable lesion must be outside the field of radiation if
             subject had prior radiotherapy. Subjects with mCRPC who do not have measurable lesions
             must have at least one of the following:

               -  Progression with 2 or more new bone lesions; or

               -  Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression (defined as a minimum of three rising
                  PSA levels with an interval of ≥ 1 week between each determination) within 6
                  weeks prior to study drug administration and a PSA value at the screening visit ≥
                  2 ng/mL.

          -  Subject consents to provide an available tumor specimen in a tissue block or unstained
             serial slides obtained within 56 days prior to first dose of study treatment, or
             subject is an appropriate candidate for tumor biopsy and is amenable to undergoing a
             tumor biopsy (core needle biopsy or excision) during the screening period.This does
             not apply to subjects with mCRPC without measurable disease.

          -  Subject in any expansion cohort, is an appropriate candidate for tumor biopsy and
             consents to undergoing a tumor biopsy (core needle biopsy or excision) during the
             treatment period as indicated in the Schedule of Assessments.

        Exclusion:

          -  Subject weighs &lt; 45 kg at screening.

          -  Subject has received investigational therapy (other than an investigational epidermal
             growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR TKI) in a subject with EGFR
             activating mutations or ALK inhibitor in a subject with an ALK mutation) within 21
             days prior to start of study drug.

          -  Subject requires or has received systemic steroid therapy or any other
             immunosuppressive therapy within 14 days prior to study drug administration. Subjects
             using a physiologic replacement dose of hydrocortisone or its equivalent (defined as
             up to 30 mg per day of hydrocortisone up to 10 mg per day of prednisone) are allowed.

          -  Subject has symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) metastases or subject has
             evidence of unstable CNS metastases even if asymptomatic (e.g., progression on scans).
             Subjects with previously treated CNS metastases are eligible, if subject is clinically
             stable and have no evidence of CNS progression by imaging for at least 4 weeks prior
             to start of study treatment and are not requiring immunosuppressive doses of systemic
             steroids (&gt; 30 mg per day of hydrocortisone or &gt; 10 mg per day of prednisone or
             equivalent) for longer than 2 weeks.

          -  Subject has an active autoimmune disease. Subjects with type 1 diabetes mellitus,
             endocrinopathies stably maintained on appropriate replacement therapy, or skin
             disorders (e.g., vitiligo, psoriasis, or alopecia) not requiring systemic treatment
             are allowed.

          -  Subject was discontinued from prior immunomodulatory therapy due to a grade ≥ 3
             toxicity that was mechanistically related (e.g., immune related) to the agent.

          -  Subject has known history of serious hypersensitivity reaction to a known ingredient
             of ASP8374 or pembrolizumab or severe hypersensitivity reaction to treatment with
             another monoclonal antibody.

          -  Subject has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus.

          -  Subject with positive for Hepatitis B virus (HBV) antibodies and surface antigen
             (including acute HBV or chronic HBV) or Hepatitis C ([HCV]; ribonucleic acid [RNA]
             detected by qualitative assay). Hepatitis C RNA testing is not required in subjects
             with negative Hepatitis C antibody testing.

          -  Subject has received a live vaccine against infectious diseases within 28 days prior
             to initiation of study treatment.

          -  Subject has a history of drug-induced pneumonitis (interstitial lung disease) or
             currently has pneumonitis.

          -  Subject has an infection requiring systemic therapy within 14 days prior to study drug
             treatment.

          -  Subject has received a prior allogeneic bone marrow or solid organ transplant.

          -  Subject is expected to require another form of antineoplastic therapy while on study
             treatment.

          -  Subject has had a myocardial infarction or unstable angina within 6 months prior to
             the start of study treatment or currently has an uncontrolled illness including, but
             not limited to symptomatic congestive heart failure, clinically significant cardiac
             disease, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social
             situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.

          -  Any condition that makes the subject unsuitable for study participation.

          -  Subject has had a major surgical procedure and has not completely recovered within 28
             days prior to the start of study treatment.
