    <textblock>
      Among primary care patients, compare the effectiveness of an 8-week mindfulness-based
      intervention (Mindfulness Training for Primary Care[MTPC]) vs. a low-dose mindfulness
      introduction comparator on self-management of chronic illness and illness-related health
      behavior action plan initiation, as well as on measures related to anxiety, depression, and
      stress.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study builds on a pilot study that investigated the impact of Mindfulness Training for
      Primary Care on anxiety, depression, stress, and chronic illness self-management in primary
      care patients receiving care in an urban, community, multi-cultural safety net healthcare
      system. The current comparative effectiveness randomized controlled trial takes place in a
      larger sample, and investigates the impact of a refined MTPC curriculum on specific aspects
      of self-regulation such as action plan initiation, while examining potential mechanisms of
      change, including self-efficacy, perceived control, mindfulness, self-compassion, emotion
      regulation, and body awareness. Participants randomized to MTPC are compared with
      participants who are randomized to a low-dose comparator condition and receive a 1-hour
      introduction to mindfulness with a referral to community mindfulness resources. Outcome
      assessments are conducted at baseline and study weeks 8-10.

    <measure>Action Plan Initiation Survey (APIS-5)</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 8-10</time_frame>
    <description>The Action Plan Initiation Survey (APIS-5) is a 5-item self-report questionnaire adapted from a measure used by Guck et al. Participants are asked to indicate how successful they were in meeting a previously set Action Plan by using a 7-point Likert scale from 1 (Not met at all) to 7 (Totally met), with a score of 5 or above indicating successful initiation of the goal. For each unmet goal, patients are asked to further rate the cause of not meeting the goal by using a 7-point Likert rating scale from 1 (Extremely controllable) to 7 (Not at all controllable).
For this outcome we reported the number of participants in each arm who successfully initiated an Action Plan, as indicated by a score of 5 or above in reporting whether they were able to meet their action plan goal.</description>

    <measure>Perceived Stress Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 8 (pre to post Intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) (10 items) measures the degree to which situations in life are stressful. Items are designed to evaluate how overloaded, unpredictable, and uncontrollable one finds one's life. Each item is scored on a 5 point Likert scale from 0 (Never) to 4 (Very often). Scores range from 0-40 with higher scores reflecting worse results (more stress).</description>

    <measure>Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System - Anxiety Short Form (PROMIS-ASF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 8 (pre to post Intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System - Anxiety Short Form 8a (PROMIS-ASF) is an 8-item scale used to assess patient-reported health status for anxiety. PROMIS instruments are funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and used to reliably and validly measure patient-reported outcomes for clinical research and practice. Participants are asked to rate their experience of the item in the past seven days on a 5-point Likert scale from 1 (Never) to 5 (Always). The values of the response to each question are summed into a raw score ranging from 8-40. The raw score is then rescaled with use of the PROMIS Assessment Center Scoring Service into a T score, a standardized score with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation (SD) of 10. Higher T-Score reflects worse results (greater symptom severity).</description>

    <measure>Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 8 (pre to post Intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>The Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) is a 39-item scale that examines five factors that represent aspects of the current empirical conception of mindfulness. These five facets include: &quot;observing, describing, acting with awareness, non-judging of inner experience, and non-reactivity to inner experience.&quot; Participants rate their degree of agreement with each of the items on a Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (Never or very rarely true) to 5 (Very often or always true). Facet scores range from 8−40, with the exception of the nonreactivity facet, which ranges from 7−35. Total scores range from 39-195, with higher scores reflecting higher levels of mindfulness (a better outcome).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived Control Questionnaire (PCQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 8 (pre to post Intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>The Perceived Control Questionnaire (PCQ) is adapted from a 5-item perceived control measure from Jerant et al. and a previously validated survey from Armitage et al. This 5-item scale asks participants to rate their sense of control over chronic illness self-management on a 7-point scale from 1 (None) to 7 (Total). Scores range from 5-35, with higher scores indicating better results (greater sense of control).</description>

    <measure>Difficulty in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 8 (pre to post Intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>The Difficulties in Emotion Regulation (DERS) Scale is a 36-item self-report scale designed to assess emotional dysregulation. Participants are asked to rate how often they have emotional dysregulation on a 5-point Likert scale from 1 (almost never [0-10%]) to 5 (almost always [91-100%]). The scale assess 6 aspects of emotional dysregulation: non-acceptance of emotional responses, difficulties engaging in goal directed behavior, impulse control difficulties, lack of emotional awareness (reverse-scored), limited access to emotion regulation strategies, and lack of emotional clarity. Total scores range from 5-180, with higher scores indicating worse results (more difficulty in emotional regulation).</description>

    <measure>Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness (MAIA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 8 (pre to post Intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>The Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness (MAIA) is a 32-item self-report scale designed to assess 8 aspects of interoceptive awareness : noticing, not-distracting, not-worrying, attention regulation, emotional awareness, self-regulation, body listening, and trusting. Participants are asked to rate their awareness of interoceptive experiences on a 6-point Likert scale from 0 (Never) to 5 (Always). Each subscale has 3-7 items, and scores are obtained by reverse coding items 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and then taking the average of items in each scale. Scores range from 0-5, with higher scores indicating better results (greater interoception).</description>

Mindfulness Training for Primary Care: MTPC is a referral-based, insurance-reimbursable 8-week program that can be delivered as group psychotherapy by Patient-Centered Medical Home-integrated behavioral clinicians or as an 8-week primary care group visit delivered by a primary care provider. MTPC groups are 2 hours long for 8 weeks with a 7-hour weekend day of silent practice. MTPC emphasizes mindfulness-oriented skills for self-regulation, self-management of chronic illness, and health behavior change. All participants complete an action planning protocol during Week 7.</description>

        <title>Action Plan Initiation Survey (APIS-5)</title>
        <description>The Action Plan Initiation Survey (APIS-5) is a 5-item self-report questionnaire adapted from a measure used by Guck et al. Participants are asked to indicate how successful they were in meeting a previously set Action Plan by using a 7-point Likert scale from 1 (Not met at all) to 7 (Totally met), with a score of 5 or above indicating successful initiation of the goal. For each unmet goal, patients are asked to further rate the cause of not meeting the goal by using a 7-point Likert rating scale from 1 (Extremely controllable) to 7 (Not at all controllable).
For this outcome we reported the number of participants in each arm who successfully initiated an Action Plan, as indicated by a score of 5 or above in reporting whether they were able to meet their action plan goal.</description>
        <time_frame>Weeks 8-10</time_frame>
        <population>Using mixed effects intent-to-treat analysis, we defined non-initiator status as participants who never endorsed greater than 4 or who did not complete the API survey. by week 9. The APIS-5 is analyzed using an intent to treat analysis and missing APIS is considered incomplete action plan initiation.</population>

            <title>Mindfulness Training for Primary Care</title>
            <description>Mindfulness Training for Primary Care (MTPC) is a primary care adaptation that includes core common Mindfulness-Based Intervention (MBI) elements integrated with novel mindfulness-oriented behavior change elements into a format that is adaptable to delivery in primary care health centers.
Mindfulness Training for Primary Care: MTPC is a referral-based, insurance-reimbursable 8-week program that can be delivered as group psychotherapy by Patient-Centered Medical Home-integrated behavioral clinicians or as an 8-week primary care group visit delivered by a primary care provider. MTPC groups are 2 hours long for 8 weeks with a 7-hour weekend day of silent practice. MTPC emphasizes mindfulness-oriented skills for self-regulation, self-management of chronic illness, and health behavior change. All participants complete an action planning protocol during Week 7.</description>

            <description>Comparator arm: Participants receive a 60-minute introduction to mindfulness group plus referral to a list of community mindfulness resources such as private-pay community mindfulness classes, mobile mindfulness applications, books, and online recordings. These participants are added to a 6-month wait-list for a Cambridge Health Alliance mindfulness-based intervention group and allowed to receive behavioral and medical referrals and treatment as usual. All participants complete an action planning protocol during Week 7.
60-minute Introduction to Mindfulness: Participants in the low-dose comparator arm receive a 60-minute introduction to mindfulness. Participants are introduced to the definition(s) of mindfulness, brief mindfulness practices, discussion, and an orientation to an 8-week mindfulness group. They are also given a list of leading community, online, print, and smartphone mindfulness resources.</description>

        <description>The Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System - Anxiety Short Form 8a (PROMIS-ASF) is an 8-item scale used to assess patient-reported health status for anxiety. PROMIS instruments are funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and used to reliably and validly measure patient-reported outcomes for clinical research and practice. Participants are asked to rate their experience of the item in the past seven days on a 5-point Likert scale from 1 (Never) to 5 (Always). The values of the response to each question are summed into a raw score ranging from 8-40. The raw score is then rescaled with use of the PROMIS Assessment Center Scoring Service into a T score, a standardized score with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation (SD) of 10. Higher T-Score reflects worse results (greater symptom severity).</description>

Participants are asked to rate their awareness of interoceptive experiences on a 6-point Likert scale from 0 (Never) to 5 (Always). Each subscale has 3-7 items, and scores are obtained by reverse coding items 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and then taking the average of items in each scale. Scores range from 0-5, with higher scores indicating better results (greater interoception).</description>

Participants are asked to rate their awareness of interoceptive experiences on a 6-point Likert scale from 0 (Never) to 5 (Always). Each subscale has 3-7 items, and scores are obtained by reverse coding items 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and then taking the average of items in each scale. Scores range from 0-5, with higher scores indicating better results (greater interoception).</description>

      <time_frame>Participants completed a self-reported adverse events form during weeks 8 and 24. Adverse events were further collected during engagement phone calls during weeks 2, 4 6, and 8 using a combination of checklist and open-ended questions.</time_frame>
      <desc>An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject during participation in the clinical study. An adverse finding can include a sign, symptom, abnormal assessment (from vital signs or brain imaging), or any combination of these. AEs will be labeled according to severity based on their impact on the patient on the patient's well-being: &quot;mild&quot; if it does not have major impact, &quot;moderate&quot; if it causes some minor inconvenience, and &quot;severe&quot; if it causes substantial disruption.</desc>

          <title>Mindfulness Training for Primary Care</title>
          <description>Mindfulness Training for Primary Care (MTPC) is a primary care adaptation that includes core common Mindfulness-Based Intervention (MBI) elements integrated with novel mindfulness-oriented behavior change elements into a format that is adaptable to delivery in primary care health centers.
Mindfulness Training for Primary Care: MTPC is a referral-based, insurance-reimbursable 8-week program that can be delivered as group psychotherapy by Patient-Centered Medical Home-integrated behavioral clinicians or as an 8-week primary care group visit delivered by a primary care provider. MTPC groups are 2 hours long for 8 weeks with a 7-hour weekend day of silent practice. MTPC emphasizes mindfulness-oriented skills for self-regulation, self-management of chronic illness, and health behavior change. All participants complete an action planning protocol during Week 7.</description>

          <title>Low-dose Comparator</title>
          <description>Comparator arm: Participants receive a 60-minute introduction to mindfulness group plus referral to a list of community mindfulness resources such as private-pay community mindfulness classes, mobile mindfulness applications, books, and online recordings. These participants are added to a 6-month wait-list for a Cambridge Health Alliance mindfulness-based intervention group and allowed to receive behavioral and medical referrals and treatment as usual. All participants complete an action planning protocol during Week 7.
60-minute Introduction to Mindfulness: Participants in the low-dose comparator arm receive a 60-minute introduction to mindfulness. Participants are introduced to the definition(s) of mindfulness, brief mindfulness practices, discussion, and an orientation to an 8-week mindfulness group. They are also given a list of leading community, online, print, and smartphone mindfulness resources.</description>
