  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot randomized, controlled trial of Vitamin D supplementation in patients on
      peritoneal dialysis to determine the feasibility of a future full-scale RCT exploring if oral
      administration of vitamin D3 could reduce the risk of subsequent Peritoneal dialysis-related
      (PD-related) peritonitis.

      Aims of the study:

      Aim 1: To determine the feasibility of oral vitamin D supplementation among PD patients who
      have recovered from a recent episode of peritonitis.

      Aim 2: To examine the effect of vitamin D supplementation on the risk for peritonitis among
      patients on peritoneal dialysis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be screened for eligibility one month after the onset of PD-related
      peritonitis, those who meet the inclusion criteria will be enrolled in this study.

      All consenting participants will be randomized into the vitamin D treatment group or the
      control group, general information and baseline biochemistry data would be collected.
      Patients in the treatment group will be treated with oral Cholecalciferol (2000IU/day) apart
      from routine treatment for PD. Those in the control group will receive routine treatment for
      PD. Both groups will be followed for 12 months. During the observational period, any onset of
      subsequent peritonitis will be recorded, serum 25(OH)D, biochemical indices will be measured
      every 3 months. Follow up would take place frequently, any outcome events would be recorded.

      Aims and hypotheses:

      Aim 1: To determine the feasibility of oral vitamin D supplementation among PD patients who
      have recovered from a recent episode of peritonitis.

      Hypothesis1: A large、full-scale randomized controlled trail on the effects of oral vitamin D
      on the risk for peritonitis among PD patients is feasible.

      Aim 2: To examine the effect of vitamin D supplementation on the risk for peritonitis among
      patients on peritoneal dialysis.

      Hypothesis 2: Oral supplementation of vitamin D will reduce the risk of subsequent peritoneal
      dialysis.
