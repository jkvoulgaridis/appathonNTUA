  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study compares 2 medicines for type 2 diabetes: fast-acting insulin aspart (a new
      medicine) and NovoRapid®/NovoLog® (a medicine doctors can already prescribe). Fast-acting
      insulin aspart will be tested to see how well it works and if it is safe. Participants will
      get either fast-acting insulin aspart or NovoRapid®/ NovoLog® - which treatment you get is
      decided by chance. Both medicines will be taken together with insulin degludec. Participants
      will need to take 1 injection 4 times every day (all insulins will be provided in pens). The
      study will last for about 8 months (34 weeks).

        informed consent. - Diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus for 10 years or longer prior to
        screening (Visit 1). - Treated with a basal-bolus insulin regimen for 1 year or longer
        prior to the day of screening (Visit 1). A basal-bolus insulin regimen is defined as basal
        insulin once or twice daily and bolus insulin analogue taken with meals at least 3 times
        daily. Treatment with premixed insulin or soluble insulin combination is not considered a
        basal-bolus regimen. - Treated with or without oral antidiabetic drugs including extended
        release formulations. - HbA1c 7.0-10.0% (both inclusive) as assessed by central laboratory
        at screening (Visit 1). Exclusion Criteria: - Any of the following: myocardial infarction,
        stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina or transient ischaemic attack within the past
        180 days prior to the day of screening (Visit 1). - Subjects presently classified as being
        in New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class IV. - Planned coronary, carotid or peripheral
        artery revascularisation known on the day of screening (Visit 1). - Treatment with
        injectable GLP-1 receptor agonists in a period of 90 days prior to screening (Visit 1). -
        Anticipated initiation or change in concomitant medications (for more than 14 consecutive
        days) known to affect weight or glucose metabolism (e.g. treatment with orlistat, thyroid
        hormones, or corticosteroids).

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>The trial was conducted at 165 sites in 17 countries as follows: Argentina-3, Bulgaria-4, Canada-10, Croatia-4, Czech Republic-4, Germany-6, Greece-8, Italy-4, Poland-10, Republic of Korea-6, Romania-6, Russia-8, Serbia-9, Slovakia-5, Spain-8, Ukraine-6 and United States (US)-62. Two sites in the US screened but didn’t randomise any subject.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>There was a 12-week run-in period primarily for optimisation of the basal insulin and reinforcement of subject training in trial procedures, diabetes education and dietary training. Out of the 1264 participants enrolled in the study, 173 were run-in failures and 1091 were randomised.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Faster Aspart</title>
          <description>Participants received Faster aspart along with insulin degludec (basal-bolus regimen) with or without metformin for 16 weeks. Before the treatment period was a 12-week run-in period in which the investigator optimised basal insulin dose. Insulin degludec dose was adjusted weekly by the investigator in the run-in period based on the mean of three pre-breakfast SMPG values measured on the last two days prior to and on the day of contact. If one of the SMPG values were below target (&lt; 4.0 mmol/L or 71 mg/dL) then the insulin degludec dose was adjusted according to the titration guideline specified in the protocol. Faster aspart was titrated from randomisation (week 0) and onwards, twice weekly to reach the glycaemic target of pre-prandial and bedtime PG between 4.0-6.0 mmol/L (71 - 108 mg/dL) in a treat-to-target fashion.</description>

Before the treatment period was a 12-week run-in period in which the investigator optimised basal insulin dose. Insulin degludec dose was adjusted weekly by the investigator in the run-in period based on the mean of three pre-breakfast SMPG values measured on the last two days prior to and on the day of contact.

        <description>Change from baseline (week 0) in mean of the 7-9-7 point SMPG profile was evaluated after 16 weeks of randomisation. The results are based on the last in-trial value, which included the last available measurement in the in-trial period. 7-9-7 point SMPG was measured at the following mentioned time points: 1) Before breakfast, 2) 60 mins after the start of Breakfast, 3) Before lunch, 4) 60 mins after the start of lunch, 5) Before main evening meal, 6) 60 mins after the start of main evening meal, 7) At bedtime, 8) At 4 AM, 9) Before breakfast.</description>

Before the treatment period was a 12-week run-in period in which the investigator optimised basal insulin dose. Insulin degludec dose was adjusted weekly by the investigator in the run-in period based on the mean of three pre-breakfast SMPG values measured on the last two days prior to and on the day of contact. If one of the SMPG values were below target (&lt; 4.0 mmol/L or 71 mg/dL) then the insulin degludec dose was adjusted according to the titration guideline specified in the protocol. Faster aspart was titrated from randomisation (week 0) and onwards, twice weekly to reach the glycaemic target of pre-prandial and bedtime PG between 4.0-6.0 mmol/L (71 - 108 mg/dL) in a treat-to-target fashion.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline of the 7-9-7 Point SMPG Profile: PPG Increment (Mean, Breakfast, Lunch and Main Evening Meal)</title>
        <description>Change from baseline (week 0) in PPG increment (breakfast, lunch, main evening meal and mean over all meals) of the 7-9-7 point SMPG profile was evaluated after 16 weeks of randomisation. The results are based on the last in-trial value, which included the last available measurement in the in-trial period. PPG increment based on the 7-9-7-point profiles were derived separately for PG measurements made at 1 hour after main meals (breakfast, lunch and main evening meal). PPG incremental value for each time point was derived as PPG value at that time point minus the preprandial glucose value. In trial observation period was from date of randomisation and until last trial-related participant-site contact.</description>

            <description>Participants received Faster aspart along with insulin degludec (basal-bolus regimen) with or without metformin for 16 weeks. Before the treatment period was a 12-week run-in period in which the investigator optimised basal insulin dose. Insulin degludec dose was adjusted weekly by the investigator in the run-in period based on the mean of three pre-breakfast SMPG values measured on the last two days prior to and on the day of contact. If one of the SMPG values were below target (&lt; 4.0 mmol/L or 71 mg/dL) then the insulin degludec dose was adjusted according to the titration guideline specified in the protocol. Faster aspart was titrated from randomisation (week 0) and onwards, twice weekly to reach the glycaemic target of pre-prandial and bedtime PG between 4.0-6.0 mmol/L (71 - 108 mg/dL) in a treat-to-target fashion.</description>

            <description>Participants received Insulin aspart (NovoRapid®/NovoLog®: basal-bolus regimen) along with insulin degludec (basal-bolus regimen) with or without metformin for 16 weeks. Before the treatment period was a 12-week run-in period in which the investigator optimised basal insulin dose. Insulin degludec dose was adjusted weekly by the investigator in the run-in period based on the mean of three pre-breakfast SMPG values measured on the last two days prior to and on the day of contact. If one of the SMPG values were below target (&lt; 4.0 mmol/L or 71 mg/dL) then the insulin degludec dose was adjusted according to the titration guideline specified in the protocol. NovoRapid was titrated from randomisation (week 0) and onwards, twice weekly to reach the glycaemic target of pre-prandial and bedtime PG between 4.0-6.0 mmol/L (71 - 108 mg/dL) in a treat-to-target fashion.</description>

If one of the SMPG values were below target (&lt; 4.0 mmol/L or 71 mg/dL) then the insulin degludec dose was adjusted according to the titration guideline specified in the protocol. NovoRapid was titrated from randomisation (week 0) and onwards, twice weekly to reach the glycaemic target of pre-prandial and bedtime PG between 4.0-6.0 mmol/L (71 - 108 mg/dL) in a treat-to-target fashion.</description>

Insulin degludec dose was adjusted weekly by the investigator in the run-in period based on the mean of three pre-breakfast SMPG values measured on the last two days prior to and on the day of contact. If one of the SMPG values were below target (&lt; 4.0 mmol/L or 71 mg/dL) then the insulin degludec dose was adjusted according to the titration guideline specified in the protocol. Faster aspart was titrated from randomisation (week 0) and onwards, twice weekly to reach the glycaemic target of pre-prandial and bedtime PG between 4.0-6.0 mmol/L (71 - 108 mg/dL) in a treat-to-target fashion.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Vital Signs: Systolic and Diastolic Blood Presure</title>
        <description>Change in vital signs - systolic and diastolic blood pressure from baseline (week 0) was evaluated after 16 weeks of randomisation. The results are based on the last on-treatment value, which included the last available measurement in the on-treatment period. On-treatment period started from date of first dose of randomised NovoRapid/faster aspart and to 7 days after day of last dose or day before initiation of ancillary treatment.</description>

            <description>Participants received Faster aspart along with insulin degludec (basal-bolus regimen) with or without metformin for 16 weeks. Before the treatment period was a 12-week run-in period in which the investigator optimised basal insulin dose. Insulin degludec dose was adjusted weekly by the investigator in the run-in period based on the mean of three pre-breakfast SMPG values measured on the last two days prior to and on the day of contact. If one of the SMPG values were below target (&lt; 4.0 mmol/L or 71 mg/dL) then the insulin degludec dose was adjusted according to the titration guideline specified in the protocol. Faster aspart was titrated from randomisation (week 0) and onwards, twice weekly to reach the glycaemic target of pre-prandial and bedtime PG between 4.0-6.0 mmol/L (71 - 108 mg/dL) in a treat-to-target fashion.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Fundoscopy/Fundus Photography</title>
        <description>Changes in fundoscopy/fundus photography from baseline (week 0) were evaluated after 16 weeks of randomisation. The results are based on the last on-treatment value, which included the last available measurement in the on-treatment period. On-treatment period started from date of first dose of randomised NovoRapid/faster aspart and to 7 days after day of last dose or day before initiation of ancillary treatment.</description>

            <description>Participants received Faster aspart along with insulin degludec (basal-bolus regimen) with or without metformin for 16 weeks. Before the treatment period was a 12-week run-in period in which the investigator optimised basal insulin dose. Insulin degludec dose was adjusted weekly by the investigator in the run-in period based on the mean of three pre-breakfast SMPG values measured on the last two days prior to and on the day of contact. If one of the SMPG values were below target (&lt; 4.0 mmol/L or 71 mg/dL) then the insulin degludec dose was adjusted according to the titration guideline specified in the protocol. Faster aspart was titrated from randomisation (week 0) and onwards, twice weekly to reach the glycaemic target of pre-prandial and bedtime PG between 4.0-6.0 mmol/L (71 - 108 mg/dL) in a treat-to-target fashion.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Haematology - Leukocytes</title>
        <description>Changes in haematology - leukocytes from baseline (week 0) were evaluated after 16 weeks of randomisation. The results are based on the last on-treatment value, which included the last available measurement in the on-treatment period. On-treatment period started from date of first dose of randomised NovoRapid/faster aspart and to 7 days after day of last dose or day before initiation of ancillary treatment.</description>

            <description>Participants received Faster aspart along with insulin degludec (basal-bolus regimen) with or without metformin for 16 weeks. Before the treatment period was a 12-week run-in period in which the investigator optimised basal insulin dose. Insulin degludec dose was adjusted weekly by the investigator in the run-in period based on the mean of three pre-breakfast SMPG values measured on the last two days prior to and on the day of contact. If one of the SMPG values were below target (&lt; 4.0 mmol/L or 71 mg/dL) then the insulin degludec dose was adjusted according to the titration guideline specified in the protocol. Faster aspart was titrated from randomisation (week 0) and onwards, twice weekly to reach the glycaemic target of pre-prandial and bedtime PG between 4.0-6.0 mmol/L (71 - 108 mg/dL) in a treat-to-target fashion.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Biochemistry - Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST)</title>
        <description>Changes in biochemistry - aspratate aminotransferase from baseline (week 0) were evaluated after 16 weeks of randomisation. The results are based on the last on-treatment value, which included the last available measurement in the on-treatment period. On-treatment period started from date of first dose of randomised NovoRapid/faster aspart and to 7 days after day of last dose or day before initiation of ancillary treatment.</description>

            <description>Participants received Faster aspart along with insulin degludec (basal-bolus regimen) with or without metformin for 16 weeks. Before the treatment period was a 12-week run-in period in which the investigator optimised basal insulin dose. Insulin degludec dose was adjusted weekly by the investigator in the run-in period based on the mean of three pre-breakfast SMPG values measured on the last two days prior to and on the day of contact. If one of the SMPG values were below target (&lt; 4.0 mmol/L or 71 mg/dL) then the insulin degludec dose was adjusted according to the titration guideline specified in the protocol. Faster aspart was titrated from randomisation (week 0) and onwards, twice weekly to reach the glycaemic target of pre-prandial and bedtime PG between 4.0-6.0 mmol/L (71 - 108 mg/dL) in a treat-to-target fashion.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Biochemistry - Total Bilirubin</title>
        <description>Changes in biochemistry - total bilirubin from baseline (week 0) were evaluated after 16 weeks of randomisation. The results are based on the last on-treatment value, which included the last available measurement in the on-treatment period. On-treatment period started from date of first dose of randomised NovoRapid/faster aspart and to 7 days after day of last dose or day before initiation of ancillary treatment.</description>

            <description>Participants received Faster aspart along with insulin degludec (basal-bolus regimen) with or without metformin for 16 weeks. Before the treatment period was a 12-week run-in period in which the investigator optimised basal insulin dose. Insulin degludec dose was adjusted weekly by the investigator in the run-in period based on the mean of three pre-breakfast SMPG values measured on the last two days prior to and on the day of contact. If one of the SMPG values were below target (&lt; 4.0 mmol/L or 71 mg/dL) then the insulin degludec dose was adjusted according to the titration guideline specified in the protocol. Faster aspart was titrated from randomisation (week 0) and onwards, twice weekly to reach the glycaemic target of pre-prandial and bedtime PG between 4.0-6.0 mmol/L (71 - 108 mg/dL) in a treat-to-target fashion.</description>
