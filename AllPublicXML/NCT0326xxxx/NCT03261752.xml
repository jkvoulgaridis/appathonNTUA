      Colo rectal cancer is one of the greatest ,mutual malignancies worldwide ,accounting for an
      estimated 1.3 million new cases and &gt;500,000 mortality ‚ÅÑ year . is the fourth leading cause
      of cancer-associated mortality worldwide with speedily ,cumulative ,occurrence rate in the
      worldwide

    <textblock>
      colo rectal cancer represents a global and local problem, as it is one of the commonest types
      of cancer all over the world. Globally, Colo rectal cancer in women (9.2% of diagnoses) it is
      the second most common cause of cancer . it is the third most common in men (10.0%). After
      lung, stomach, and liver cancer it is the fourth most common cause of cancer death.

      Cancer is a multistep procedure resulting from an ongoing accretion of genetic and epigenetic
      fluctuations to the genome.

      Spartin is a protein that in humans is encoded by the SPG20 gene. This protein may be
      involved in endosomal trafficking, microtubule dynamics, or both functions. Aberrant promoter
      methylation of genes is a common epigenetic alteration in colo rectal cancer .

      This has stimulated the prospect to implement a dependable, reasonable and simple approach
      for Colo rectal detection . The SPG20 gene is situated in chromosome band 13q13.3; the SPG20
      gene converts the spartin protein, which is a multi functional protein that has formerly been
      recognized to be complicated in intra cellular epidermal growth factor receptor trading , The
      serine-threonine kinase 31 (STK31) gene was initially identified through cDNA subtraction as
      a testis-specific protein kinase gene expressed in mouse spermatogonia . Recently, STK31 has
      been described as a novel cancer testis (CT) antigen, highly expressed in Gastrointestinal
      cancer cells (colo rectal, gastric and esophageal cancer), while restricted to testis and
      fetal brain in normal tissues .

      It was found that SPG20 is mutated in Troy er syndrome, an hereditary spastic paraplegia
