  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether spherical silica can achieve similar or
      greater extrinsic dental stain and plaque removal, in comparison to dentifrices containing
      higher concentrations of standard abrasive silica, and how the addition of 5% sodium
      tripolyphosphate (STP) enhances cleaning capability.

      This proof of principal (PoP) single centre, randomised, examiner blind, four-treatment arm,
      parallel design study will be conducted in healthy participants with a propensity for
      extrinsic dental stain (based on the judgement of the examiner) on the facial surfaces of the
      anterior teeth. This study will be used to evaluate and compare the extrinsic dental stain
      and plaque removal of an experimental low abrasivity 0.5% spherical silica dentifrice and a
      marketed low abrasivity 6% standard silica abrasive dentifrice, and an experimental moderate
      abrasivity 1% spherical silica / 5% STP dentifrice and a marketed high abrasivity 16%
      standard abrasive silica / 5% STP dentifrice. Stain will be assessed using an established
      clinical measure of extrinsic dental stain - the MacPherson modification of the Lobene stain
      index (MLSI). Particpants will be stratified by baseline MLSI score (total MLSI (area [A] ×
      intensity [I]) for the facial surfaces of the 4 anterior assessment teeth). Plaque will be
      assessed using an established clinical measure of plaque - the Turesky Modification of the
      Quigley Hein Index. Stain and plaque will be assessed at intervals over an 8 week treatment
      period. Plaque will be assessed at baseline and Week 8 only.

    <description>An assessment of the area and intensity of dental stain on the study teeth was performed using the MLSI to evaluate ranking order in extrinsic dental stain removal or reduction of test product 1, test product 2, reference product 1, reference product 2; after usage for 8 weeks, twice daily brushing. The intensity of stain was scored separately for the gingival and body areas of each assessable tooth on a scale of 0 to 3 (0 - no stain, 1- light stain, 2 - moderate stain, 3 - heavy stain). The area of stain was scored separately for the gingival and body areas of each assessable tooth on the following scale: 0 - no stain; 1 - stain up to 1/3 of the area affected; 2- stain between 1/3 and 2/3 of the area affected; and 3 - stain more than 2/3 of area affected. Overall MLSI was calculated by multiplying scores of intensity and area, and was thus analyzed on a scale of 0 (best score) to 9 (worst score).</description>

             caries, or reported treatment of decay in 12 months of screening. c) Tooth with
             exposed dentine which, in the opinion of the investigator, could impact grading of
             extrinsic dental stain; tooth with deep, defective or facial restorations; tooth used
             as an abutment for fixed or removable partial dentures; tooth with full crown or
             veneer, orthodontic bands or cracked enamel. d) Tooth with surface irregularities,
             discoloration due to trauma, tetracycline stain, restorations, or hypo or hyperplasic
             areas which, in the opinion of the investigator, would prevent consistent grading of
             extrinsic dental stain. e) High levels of calculus deposits which might interfere with
             plaque assessments at the discretion of the investigator. f) Presence of orthodontic
             bands or appliances, extensive crowns, partial dentures, or fixed retainers.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Overall Macpherson Modification of the Lobene Stain Index (MLSI) at 8 Weeks.</title>
        <description>An assessment of the area and intensity of dental stain on the study teeth was performed using the MLSI to evaluate ranking order in extrinsic dental stain removal or reduction of test product 1, test product 2, reference product 1, reference product 2; after usage for 8 weeks, twice daily brushing. The intensity of stain was scored separately for the gingival and body areas of each assessable tooth on a scale of 0 to 3 (0 - no stain, 1- light stain, 2 - moderate stain, 3 - heavy stain). The area of stain was scored separately for the gingival and body areas of each assessable tooth on the following scale: 0 - no stain; 1 - stain up to 1/3 of the area affected; 2- stain between 1/3 and 2/3 of the area affected; and 3 - stain more than 2/3 of area affected. Overall MLSI was calculated by multiplying scores of intensity and area, and was thus analyzed on a scale of 0 (best score) to 9 (worst score).</description>

            <other_analysis_desc>The reason for entering same analysis for primary and secondary is because statistical analysis was not done separately for primary outcome measure.
The decision was clinical decision at the time of protocol design.There was no comparisons for the primary objective as the main objective was to look at the rank order of the treatments in level of stain reduction after 8 weeks of treatment. This was achieved via the adjusted means and confidence intervals for the means along with plots of MLSI over time. The hypothesis was that the test products would reduce stain to a greater extent than the reference products. Two comparisons of interest were done under secondary and exploratory objectives.</other_analysis_desc>

        <title>Difference of Least Square Mean of Change From Baseline in Overall MLSI After 8 Weeks (Test Product 1 Versus vs. Reference Product 1)</title>
        <description>An assessment of the area and intensity of dental stain on the study teeth will be performed using the MLSI after usage test product 1 and reference product 1 for 8 weeks, twice daily brushing. The intensity of stain was scored separately for the gingival and body areas of each assessable tooth on a scale of 0 to 3 (0 - no stain, 1- light stain, 2 - moderate stain, 3 - heavy stain). The area of stain was scored separately for the gingival and body areas of each assessable tooth on the following scale: 0 - no stain; 1 - stain up to 1/3 of the area affected; 2- stain between 1/3 and 2/3 of the area affected; and 3 - stain more than 2/3 of area affected. Overall MLSI will be calculated by multiplying scores of intensity and area, and will be thus analyzed on a scale of 0 (best score) to 9 (worst score).</description>

        <population>The ITT population comprised all participants who were randomly allocated to treatment and received the study treatment at least once and provided at least 1 post-baseline (post-treatment) assessment of efficacy.
