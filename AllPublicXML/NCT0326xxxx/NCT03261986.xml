  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to use radiostereometric analysis (RSA) and clinical outcome
      measures to evaluate early post-operative implant stability and the clinical performance of
      Stryker's Trident II Acetabular Cup.

      The proposed study is a prospective evaluation of data from patients undergoing primary total
      hip arthroplasty using the Trident II acetabular cup. Fifty patients will be recruited for
      this study. All patients that qualify for the study per the inclusion-exclusion criteria and
      provide written informed consent will receive the Trident II acetabular cup and RSA beads.
      Implant stability, through RSA, will be measured throughout the first two postoperative
      (post-op) years per the following schedule: immediate post-op and 6 weeks, 3 months, 6
      months, 1 year, and 2 years following surgery. Patients will be discharged and seen for
      follow-up assessments as per standard of care. Adverse events that are related to the index
      joint will be collected. Health outcome questionnaires will be collected. The health outcome
      questionnaires will include: EQ-5D, HOOS JR and Harris Hip Score. Health outcome
      questionnaires will be completed pre-operatively and again at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 1
      year and 2 years following surgery. Conventional x-ray analysis will be performed
      pre-operatively and again at 6 weeks, 1 year and 2 years following surgery.

    <description>X-ray radiographs will be taken at pre-op, 6 weeks, 1 year and 2 year appointments. It may take up to 3 years after study start for all patients to reach the 2 year visit mark, depending on how long enrollment takes.</description>

    <description>Inducible displacements will be measured using RSA exams at the 1 year follow-up. It may take up to 2 years after study start for all patients to reach the 1 year visit mark, depending on how long enrollment takes.</description>
