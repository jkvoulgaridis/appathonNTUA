      This a single center non-randomised non-sham controlled intervention study evaluating the
      effectiveness and safety of endoscopic lung volume reduction by endobronchial valves
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the current study is to explore the effect of targeted lobar
      endobronchial lung volume reduction in symptomatic patients with severe emphysema and absent
      collateral ventilation, on lung function, exercise capacity and physical activity. As a
      secondary objective, changes in physical activity as result of a 3 month activity coaching
      program delivered between 3 to 6 months post intervention will be investigated. Exploratory
      objectives are to extend insight in the clinical characteristics of responders and
      non-responders and to address relationships between lung function response, physical
      functioning and its impact on inflammation, skeletal and cardiac function. Furthermore,
      comparison of the effects on lung function, exercise capacity, quality of life and physical
      activity between endoscopic lung volume reduction and surgical lung volume reduction will be
      made.

      The study will also explore if treatment response can be optimised by an intermediate
      evaluation with CT scan one month after intervention. Endoscopic evaluation and repositioning
      of the endobronchial valves will be imposed in case no lober atelectasis is visualised.

    <description>A ambulatory diagnostic bronchoscopy under general anesthesia will evaluate the presence or absence of collateral ventilation . The targeted lobar airway is temporarily occluded by means of a balloon catheter, which blocks inspiratory flow but allows expiratory flow, in order to assess whether the air flow gradually declines to zero, meaning absence of collateral ventilation. Only in case collateral ventilation is excluded, a therapeutic bronchoscopy will be scheduled to insert the one-directional endobronchial valves in the targeted lobar airways. We will only perform a unilateral intervention during which we will treat one or maximal two lobes at one side.</description>
