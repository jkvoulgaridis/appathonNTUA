  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antibiotic resistance is a worldwide health care problem. Increasing use of antibiotics is
      associated with an increase in the prevalence of bacteria resistant to the antibiotic used.
      Reducing antibiotic use can be effected by improving antibiotic prescribing quality in two
      complementary ways. One is to limit antibiotic prescribing to those patients who will benefit
      from the treatment and two is to prescribe these patients the recommended antibiotic.

      International research has shown that a web-based communication training for the prescriber
      combined with an interactive booklet containing relevant patient information (Genomics to
      combat Resistance against Antibiotics for Community acquired LRTI in Europe INternet Training
      for Reducing antibiOtic use (GRACE INTRO)) can significantly and safely reduce antibiotic
      prescribing in adults presenting to primary care with acute cough/lower respiratory tract
      infections (LRTI). Quality assessment of antibiotic prescribing for respiratory infections in
      general practice has revealed the use of far too many (broad-spectrum) antibiotics in
      Belgium.

      In the proposed project, the investigators aspire to make Belgium the first European country
      to implement the most cost-effective part of the GRACE INTRO intervention (Translational
      Research on Antimicrobial resistance and Community-acquired infections in Europe (TRACE)
      e-learning, www.acutecough.org) at national level and to perform a scientifically sound
      assessment of the nationwide implementation on outpatient antibiotic use and societal cost.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The envisaged research aims to implement the most cost-effective part of the GRACE INTRO
      intervention (TRACE e-learning, www.acutecough.org), i.e. a web-based communication training
      and an interactive patient booklet for adults presenting to primary care with LRTI, at
      national level. For that purpose the investigators will perform a stepped wedge
      cluster-randomised trial. Stepped wedge randomised trial designs involve sequential roll-out
      of an intervention to participants (individuals or clusters) over a number of time periods.
      By the end of the study, all participants will have received the intervention, although the
      order in which participants receive the intervention is determined at random. Over a period
      of one year all practices in the 10 Belgian provinces and Brussels (n=11 clusters) will get
      access to the intervention. The order in which the clusters receive the intervention is
      determined at random. The general practitioners (GPs) in the intervention phase will be
      invited to take an educational web-based module, including communication training, to improve
      prescribing of antibiotics for LRTI and will receive patient booklets to be used
      interactively during the consultation. The clusters not yet exposed to the intervention will
      serve as control group. The effect on prescribing behavior will be assessed using monthly
      Intermutualistic Agency (IMA, www.nic-ima.be) data. Hence, the outcome measurement will have
      complete response, and will not interfere with the normal routine of the eligible GPs,
      allowing a more valid estimate of any intervention effect. Since the training will be
      assessed, and not the eligible practices or GPs, IMA has the legal authority (Art. 153 of the
      coordinated Law of 14 July 1994) to perform the required analyses. The estimates of the
      efficacy of the intervention will at the same time describe its effectiveness in daily
      practice, which is unconventional for a randomized trial (on a behavioural intervention).
      Given the large sample size, the proposed trial will also provide very precise estimates.
