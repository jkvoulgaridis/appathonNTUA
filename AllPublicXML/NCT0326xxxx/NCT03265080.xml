  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, multicenter study of ADXS-NEO administered alone and in
      combination with pembrolizumab in subjects with select advanced or metastatic solid tumors.
      This study will be performed in 2 phases, a safety phase (Part A and Part B) and an efficacy
      phase (Part C).

      Mutation-derived tumor antigens, which are often unique to each patient's tumor, represent a
      new source of targets for cancer immunotherapy. These mutations, which arise during
      tumorigenesis, are expressed only by the tumor and, as such, may be recognized as newly
      formed antigens, or neoantigens, by the patient's T cells. The lack of expression of
      patient-specific tumor mutations in nonmalignant cells suggests that vaccines targeting these
      tumor mutations have a low risk of autoimmunity and may represent a safer therapeutic
      approach than many of those currently available. The development of a Listeria monocytogenes
      (Lm)-based vaccine that expresses these patient-specific tumor antigens and that activates
      tumor-killing T cells has the potential to be a highly effective form of immunotherapy. In
      addition, the Lm platform, because it mediates tumor control through multiple mechanisms, may
      exhibit more robust anti-tumor activity than other vaccine platforms. Thus, the targeting of
      patient-specific mutation-derived tumor antigens and the concurrent stimulation of host
      immunity provides a rational approach for boosting anti-tumor immunity, as monotherapy and in
      combination with anti-PD-1 inhibitors.

          2. Have Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 1.

          3. Screening tumor biopsy must be adequate for the identification of NSMs by whole exome
             sequencing and for the development of ADXS-NEO. Biopsies may be repeated for subjects
             whose Screening biopsies are found to be inadequate for the development of ADXS-NEO.
             Biopsy should be excisional, incisional or core needle. Fine needle aspiration is
             generally inadequate.

          4. Subject population for Part A (ADXS-NEO monotherapy) is as follows:

               1. Histological or cytological diagnosis of metastatic CRC excluding known MSI-high
                  sub-types, metastatic SCCHN or metastatic NSCLC that have progressed or have
                  become intolerant to standard therapy, and whose disease may allow management
                  with other available therapies (or a treatment break, if appropriate) for up to
                  approximately 12 weeks following Screening tumor biopsy. More than one form of
                  anti-tumor therapy is allowed during this interval.

                  metastatic setting are allowed, including approved antibody and targeted agent
                  therapy. Subjects may be eligible if they have received additional lines of
                  therapy upon discussion with and approval by the Sponsor. Subjects are excluded
                  if they are known to have MSI-high tumors. If the status of microsatellite
                  stability is not known, subjects are eligible. The determination of
                  microsatellite stability for CRC may be made by local testing on any available
                  tissue prior to study entry.

               3. For metastatic SCCHN, up to 2 lines of approved therapy in the advanced or
                  metastatic setting are allowed, including approved antibody therapy and

                  histologies with neuroendocrine or small cell components may be eligible upon
                  discussion with and approval by the Sponsor.

               5. Prior exposure to immunotherapy including, but not limited to, anti-PD1 or
                  anti-PDL1 antibodies is allowed but not required. Subjects who received prior
                  treatment with such agents must meet the following criteria: (a) Full resolution
                  of prior checkpoint inhibitor-related adverse events and no treatment for these
                  adverse events for at least 3 weeks prior to the first infusion of ADXS-NEO; and
                  (b) no history of severe immune related adverse events (irAE) from prior exposure
                  to checkpoint inhibitors. Severe irAEs are defined as any CTCAE Grade 4 toxicity
                  requiring treatment with corticosteroids or Grade 3 toxicity requiring
                  corticosteroid treatment (greater than 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent dose)
                  for greater than 12 weeks.

          5. Subject population for Part B and Part C (ADXS-NEO + pembrolizumab) is as follows:

               1. Histological or cytological diagnosis of NSCLC, SCCHN, urothelial carcinoma, or
                  melanoma.

               2. Subject has received, and then progressed or been intolerant to up to 3 lines of
                  prior therapy in the advanced or metastatic setting, including approved
                  chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy and antibody therapy, if eligible.
                  Subjects who have received &gt;3 lines of prior therapy may be eligible upon
                  discussion with and approval by the Sponsor.

               3. For NSCLC: subjects with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors express PD-L1 (TPS â‰¥1%) as
                  determined by an FDA-approved test are eligible, with disease progression on or
                  after platinum-containing chemotherapy. Subjects with EGFR or ALK genomic tumor
                  aberrations should have disease progression on FDA-approved therapy for these
                  aberrations prior to enrolment.

               4. For SCCHN: subjects with recurrent or metastatic SCCHN with disease progression
                  on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy are eligible.

             Prior/Concomitant Therapy

         18. Monoclonal antibody or biologic therapy within 5 half-lives or 28 days, whichever is
             shorter, prior to first dose of ADXS-NEO (Part A) or pembrolizumab (Part B and Part
             C). Subjects undergoing therapy with pembrolizumab at the time of Screening (Part B)
             may continue pembrolizumab without the above-mentioned washout period if stable.

         19. Received anticancer chemotherapy, surgical treatment, and/or radiation therapy (except
             palliative radiation therapy for disease-related pain in consultation with the
             Sponsor's medical monitor) within 3 weeks of first dose of ADXS-NEO (Part A) or
             pembrolizumab (Part B and Part C).

         20. Because of a possible interaction between attenuated Lm and PI3K inhibitor (may be
             directly involved in regulation of TNFÎ± production and enhance Lm virulence)
             (Hochdorfer 2011; Smith, 2007; Sonje 2010), subjects receiving a PI3K or TNFÎ±
             inhibitor within 3 weeks of first dose of study treatment, or are expected to receive
             such agents at any time during the treatment period, are excluded.

         21. Received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of ADXS-NEO (Part A) or
             pembrolizumab (Part B and Part C).

         22. Major surgery, including surgery for a new artificial implant and/or medical device,
             which is permitted by the protocol, within 6 weeks prior to initiation of ADXS-NEO
             (Part A) or pembrolizumab (Part B and Part C). NOTE: All toxicities and/or
             complications must have recovered to baseline or Grade 1 prior to the initiation of
             study treatment. Consult with the Sponsor prior to enrolling participants who recently
             had major surgery or who have a new artificial implant, and/or devices.

             Prior/Concurrent Clinical Study Experience

         23. Currently participating in or has participated in a study of an investigational agent
             or is using an investigational device within 3 weeks of enrollment.
