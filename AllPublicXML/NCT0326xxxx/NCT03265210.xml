  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain and depression frequently co-exist in late and mid-life and contribute to
      increased disability, high health care costs, psychiatric comorbidity, and suicide. The
      investigators will recruit 60 adults from Weill Cornell Medical Associates primary care
      practices; participants will be randomized to either Relief (a 9 session behavioral
      intervention) or usual care/referral for mental health care. Research assessments are
      conducted with both groups at study entry (Baseline), 6, 9, and 12 weeks.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in clinically significant depressive symptoms, as measured by the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6, 9, and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The MADRS is a 10 item questionnaire assessing severity of depression by scoring participants on mood, anxiety, sleep, concentration, appetite, and suicidal thoughts. The lowest score is 0, no depression symptoms, and the highest possible score is 60, severe depression symptoms.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in pain-related disability, as measured by the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6, 9, and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The RMDQ includes a scale assessing how much pain the participant has experienced in the past week, with 0 indicating no pain and 10 indicating pain as bad as he/she can imagine.
The RMDQ also includes a series of questions related to pain disability, with 0 indicating no pain-related disability, and 24 indicating severe pain-related disability.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>9 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A questionnaire that evaluates participants' satisfaction with treatment; ranging from 1 (needs have not been met/dissatisfied) to 4 (almost all needs have been met/very satisfied).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Mood, as measured by the Daily Photographic Affect Meter (PAM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Daily for 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PAM is used for assessing mood and emotional state. Participants can either score a &quot;positive&quot; or &quot;negative&quot; affect value.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Activities monitoring</measure>
    <time_frame>Daily for 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Activities monitoring through a phone application; measuring distance covered daily by the participant during the week.</description>
