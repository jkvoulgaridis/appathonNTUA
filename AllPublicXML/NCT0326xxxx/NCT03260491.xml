  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study has two parts: dose escalation and dose expansion.

      The primary objectives are:

        -  For Dose Escalation, to assess the safety and tolerability of U3-1402 in the study
           population and to determine the recommended dose for expansion of U3-1402 in the study
           population

        -  For Dose Expansion, to investigate the antitumor activity of U3-1402

      The number of treatment cycles is not fixed in this study. Participants will continue study
      treatment (for approximately 36 months) until they decide not to (withdraw consent), their
      disease gets worse [progressive disease (PD)], or side effects become unacceptable
      (unacceptable toxicity) or other stopping reasons have been met.
