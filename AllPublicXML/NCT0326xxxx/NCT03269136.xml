      To assess the safety and tolerability at increasing dose levels of PF-06863135 in patients
      with relapse/ refractory multiple myeloma in order to determine the maximum tolerated dose
      and select the recommended Phase 2 dose.

      Study C1071001 is a Phase 1, open label, multi dose, multi center, dose escalation, safety,
      pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic study of PF-06863135 in adult patients with advanced
      multiple myeloma who have relapsed from or are refractory to standard therapy. This two part
      study will assess the safety and tolerability of increasing dose levels of PF-06863135 in
      Part 1, and establish the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) in Part 2.
