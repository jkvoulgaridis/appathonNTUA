  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Poor anticoagulation quality is a major problem among Chinese patients receiving warfarin
      therapy in traditional health care settings. Improving warfarin therapy has been crucial for
      Chinese patients. Wechat is social-software in China. Most of all Chinese adults use Wechat,
      as well as our patients. So we set up a Wechat-based mini-program to instruct Chinese
      patients' warfarin therapy. We aim to assess whether social software could improve warfarin
      therapy in Chinese patients by conducting a single-centre, open-label, prospective,
      randomized clinical trial.

      Social software is becoming a necessary of life. Wechat, powered by Tencent company, is the
      most popular social software in China. People can chat with others no matter how far away
      from each other.

      Anticoagulation Quality is very important for patients receiving warfarin anticoagulation
      therapy, which is usually evaluated Time in therapeutic range (TTR). It is reported that TTR
      is very low (38.8%) in China patients. So we are planning to introduce the social software to
      set up a bridge for clinicians and their patients, to instruct warfarin therapy. We aim to
      investigate whether social software could be used to improve warfarin anticoagulation quality
      of Chinese patients.

      We planned to enrol enough eligible patients receiving warfarin therapy due to the mechanical
      valves in a randomized controlled trial. Warfarin-treated patients were assigned to social
      software management group ( in which warfarin therapy was guided via the social platform by
      experienced clinicians) or to the traditional management control group (in which warfarin
      therapy was managed with traditional model). The primary outcomes the first time to bleeding
      or thrombotic events, the secondary outcomes were an elevation in time in therapeutic range
      (TTR) of international normalized ratio (INR), reduction in INR variation and number of
      extremely high INR results during 18 months.
