      This study comparing both of the investigational device and reference device to gold standard
      Patient Monitor of the accuracy of heart rate and respiratory rate monitoring. The primary
      variables for the analysis of heart rate (HR) and respiratory rate (RR) are each the overall
      mean root mean square difference (RMSD). Results of the investigational device and reference
      device compared with the patient monitor are evaluated to see if there are equivalent. Motion
      and bed exit accuracy will be evaluated by comparing with the manual observation.

    <textblock>
      The testing will be conducted in three periods. In the Accuracy Tests (periods

      1 and 2), one of the contact-free devices will be used to monitor the HR and RR, while being
      compared with the Patient Monitor. The RHEA investigational device and reference device will
      be used to monitor the same subject at different times, as the sensors of the two devices are
      placed at a similar location of the bed. HR and RR will be recorded for all three devices.

      The primary hypotheses for HR, are as follows:

      Adults HO: μ = 3.25 vs. HA: μ &lt; 3.25, Children HO: μ = 3.5 vs. HA: μ &lt; 3.5,

      The primary hypotheses for RR, are as follows:

      Adults HO: μ = 2.25 vs. HA: μ &lt; 2.25, Children HO: μ = 2.5 vs. HA: μ &lt; 2.5, where μ
      represents the population mean HR or RR. If the upper bound of the confidence interval is
      less than the hypothesized value, the corresponding null hypothesis will be rejected.
      Comparison of the performance of the two contact-free devices will be performed on the
      recorded results via statistical analysis.

      The hypothesis here is that the two devices have equivalent performance. The third test will
      assess the ability of the RHEA device to accurately detect motion on or exit from the bed, as
      compared to the manual observation. Motion and no motion accuracy will each be calculated
      along with their respective two-sided 95% confidence intervals.

    <intervention_model_description>The RHEA device and Patient Monitor are used to monitor the heart rate (HR) and respiratory rate (RR) of participants at the same time in Test 1. The reference device and patient monitor are used to monitor the hear rate and respiratory rate of the same participant at the same time at Test 2. The two tests results will be compared and evaluated the accuracy of the two devices. And the RHEA device is used alone to evaluate the accuracy of motion and no motion.</intervention_model_description>
