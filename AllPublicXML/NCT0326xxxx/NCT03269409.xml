  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial aims to determine if cells from a patient's own adipose tissue
      is safe and capable of helping regenerate the femoral head in patients with osteonecrosis.
      The standard of care is known as hip decompression which simply removes dead tissue from the
      femoral head and creates a new cavity to be filled in by healthy bone. This trial will use
      hip decompression in one hip and hip decompression supplemented with adipose derived
      regenerative cells in patients with osteonecrosis in both of their hips.

    <textblock>
      Preclinical and clinical data suggest that ADRC may serve as a safe and efficacious adjuvant
      agent for the treatment of ON. However, to the authors knowledge no RCT in the United States
      has formally evaluated safety of ADRC in the setting of ON. Therefore, the primary endeavor
      of this Phase I pilot study will be to evaluate safety of ADRC for pre-collapse ON of the
      femoral head.

      The Celution 800/GP System (Cytori Therapeutics, San Diego, USA) for preparation of ADRC from
      lipoaspirate is currently being evaluated in FDA approved clinical trials including an
      orthopedic indication (osteoarthritis). In addition, the device has a CE Mark registration in
      Europe and Class I approval in Japan. As such, it serves as a known platform that produces a
      clinical grade product for human use. Other devices on the market process lipoaspirate by
      either mechanical, washing, or centrifugation methods; however, the remaining components of
      original adipose tissue are significant and impair the regenerative process. Derivation of
      relatively pure ADRC has been achieved by few devices and the Cytori Celution 800/GP System
      is the only one to our knowledge with a sufficient safety and efficacy track record enabling
      multiple investigational device exemption (IDE) approvals. The reagent used (Celase®) is of a
      clinical and pharmacologic grade for use in humans. The production of Celase is free of
      mammalian products.
