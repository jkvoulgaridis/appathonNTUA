  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Avmacol is an over-the-counter dietary supplement containing broccoli seed and sprout
      extracts in tablet form, hypothesized to activate protective cellular pathways including
      detoxication. In this study, participants who have been curatively treatment for head and
      neck cancer, will take Avmacol twice a day for 3 months.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The broccoli seed preparation, Avmacol®, results in acute and/or sustained induction of NRF2
      target gene transcripts in the oral mucosa of patients who have been curatively treated for a
      tobacco-related head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), including high grade
      dysplasia, carcinoma in situ, or invasive carcinoma. This study is not designed to examine
      the therapeutic or reparative effects of Avmacol® on premalignant lesions of the oral cavity.

      We will systematically assess the clinical chemopreventive potential of Avmacol®
      administration to patients with tobacco-related HNSCC at high risk for second primary tumor
      by:

        1. Conducting this phase 0 clinical study to evaluate the pharmacodynamic range of NRF2
           pathway activation in the oral mucosa of HNSCC patients, in response to two tolerable
           and bioactive doses of Avmacol®;

        2. Determining whether the level of NRF2 pathway activation achieved in human oral
           epithelium is chemopreventive in the NQO1 murine model of environmental carcinogenesis;
           and

        3. Analyzing specimens from the Phase 0 trial to determine whether Avmacol® induces changes
           in alternative biomarkers of SF chemopreventive efficacy identified in the laboratory.

After being deemed eligible, subjects will be assigned a patient number and be registered into the CTMA database.
At registration, they will be randomized to receive either 4 tablets/day in Cycle 1 or 8 tablets/day in Cycle 1 (and the other dose in Cycle 2). This randomization is not blinded. Randomization will be stratified by history of head and neck radiation therapy (yes or no).</intervention_model_description>
