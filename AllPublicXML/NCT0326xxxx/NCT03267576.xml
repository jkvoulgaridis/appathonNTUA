    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to assess the effects of 4 weeks each of daily treatment
      with canagliflozin 300 milligram (mg) versus sitagliptin 100 mg as treatment adjuncts to
      metformin (at stable dosages) on intrapatient glycemic coefficient of variation (CV),
      expressed as a ratio percentage of standard deviation (SD) to mean glucose levels.

    <description>Continuous blood glucose monitoring was done in participants using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) determined over a 6-day period (in order to obtain a continuous 72-hour reading) at baseline and after each active treatment. Glucose coefficient of variation (CV) was calculated based on CGM data dividing the standard deviation of blood glucose values by the mean of the corresponding glucose readings. The participants were analyzed according to treatment received in treatment period 2 as per the sequence reported in this outcome measure.</description>
