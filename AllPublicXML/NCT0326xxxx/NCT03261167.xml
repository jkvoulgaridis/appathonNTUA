  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Botulinum toxin A (GSK1358820) is a sterile, purified type A botulinum neurotoxin complex. In
      Japan, 240 units of botulinum toxin A are approved as a maximum dose per administration for
      upper limb spasticity. This study is planned to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of 400
      units of botulinum toxin A which can help to increase the maximum dose per administration to
      400 units from 240 units as the treatment with 240 units is considered insufficient in
      subjects with post-stroke upper limb spasticity. Approximately 120 subjects will be
      randomized to receive either 400 or 240 units of botulinum toxin A in double blind phase
      followed by open-label phase in which 400 units of the study treatment will be injected in
      both the groups. The study period will be up to 52 weeks, consisting of a screening phase up
      to 4 weeks, minimum 12-week double blind phase (Part 1), maximum 36- week open-label phase
      (12 weeks per cycle with 3 treatment phases: Part 2, Part 3 and Part 4).

          -  Subjects who have a skin disease such as infection at the site to be injected.

          -  Subjects who suffer from serious and unstable disease, which could pose problems for
             the safety of subjects and study procedure compliance.

          -  For enrolment in the study (Day 1 [prior to injection]): Subjects who have aspiration
             pneumonia, relapse of lower respiratory tract infection, uncontrollable asthma,
             uncontrollable COPD, and/or underlying or a history of serious respiratory
             dysfunction, which were clinically considered to be respiratory function impairment by
             a investigator within 12 months before Day 1 visit.

          -  Subjects who have a history of aspiration, or an underlying and/or a history of the
             symptoms that suggests high risks for aspiration by a investigator within 12 months
             before Day 1 (serious salivation requiring changing in a type of diet, chronic
             dysphagia that is difficult to swallow).

          -  Subjects who were treated with botulinum toxin for spasticity of upper limb less than
             16 weeks before Day 1 visit.

          -  Subjects who underwent surgical interventions, phenol block, ethanol block or muscle
             afferent block (MAB) within 12 months before Day 1 visit, or these interventions are
             planned during the study period in any one of the finger (upper limb), wrist, elbow or
             shoulder muscles, which will be involved in the study.

          -  Subjects who placed a surgical cast or a dynamic splint within 3 months before Day 1
             study visit, and/or these interventions are planned to be placed on the upper limb to
             be involved in the study.

          -  Subjects who were injected corticosteroid or an anesthetic agent into the finger
             (upper limb), wrist, or shoulder flexors, which will be involved in the study within 3
             months before Day 1 visit, or these injections are planned during the study.

          -  Subjects who received constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) within 3 months
             before Day 1 visit or CIMT is planned during the blind phase.

          -  Subjects who underwent ultrasound therapy, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation
             (TENS) , electrical stimulation therapy, or acupuncture therapy in the upper arm,
             which will be involved in the study within 1 month before Day 1 visit, or these
             therapies are planned during the study.

        <description>MAS was used to measure the level of spasticity. The test was performed in a sitting position throughout the study. The affected parts were extended as fast as possible to grade the flexor muscle tones. It was scored on a scale of 0 to 4 as: 0=No increase in muscle tone, 1=Slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch and release or by minimal resistance at the end of the range of motion (ROM) when the affected part(s) is moved in flexion or extension, 1+=Slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch, followed by minimal resistance throughout the remainder (less than half) of the ROM, 2=More marked increase in muscle tone through most of the ROM, but affected part(s) easily moved, 3=Considerable increase in muscle tone, passive movement difficult and 4=Affected part(s) rigid in flexion or extension. Higher scores=worst outcome while lower scores=better outcome.</description>

            <description>Participants were injected with a single dose of GSK1358820 240 U into the muscles that act on the wrist (Flexor carpi radialis [B1], Flexor carpi ulnaris [B2]), finger (Flexor digitorum profundus [C1], Flexor digitorum superficialis [C2]), thumb (Flexor pollicis longus [D1], Adductor pollicis [D2]) and a single dose of matching placebo was injected into the muscles that acted on elbow flexors Biceps brachii [A1], Brachialis [A2], Brachioradialis [A3] during the double-blind phase. Participants who met the re-treatment criteria between Week 12 to 36 were treated with GSK1358820 400 U injections in the open-label phase (one injection each in Treatment cycles [cyc] 2, 3 and 4). Participants were re-treated up to 3 times with an interval of 12 weeks between treatments during the open-label phase.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in MAS Scores in Elbow, Wrist, Finger and Thumb Flexors up to Week 12 (Mixed Model Repeated Measures [MMRM])</title>
        <description>The affected parts were extended as fast as possible to grade the flexor muscle tones. It was scored on a scale of 0 to 4 as: 0=No increase in muscle tone, 1=Slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch and release or by minimal resistance at the end of the range of motion (ROM) when the affected part(s) is moved in flexion/extension, 1+=Slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch, followed by minimal resistance throughout the remainder (less than half) of the ROM, 2=More marked increase in muscle tone through most of the ROM, but affected part(s) easily moved, 3=Considerable increase in muscle tone, passive movement difficult and 4=Affected part(s) rigid in flexion/extension. Higher scores=worst outcome while lower scores=better outcome. Baseline was defined as the latest pre-first dose assessment with a non-missing value. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-dose visit value minus the Baseline value.</description>

Participants who met the re-treatment criteria between Week 12 to 36 were treated with GSK1358820 400 U injections in the open-label phase (one injection each in Treatment cycles [cyc] 2, 3 and 4). Participants were re-treated up to 3 times with an interval of 12 weeks between treatments during the open-label phase.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Principal Therapeutic Target of Disability Assessment Scale (DAS) - MMRM up to Week 12</title>
        <description>The investigator assessed 4 areas of disability namely hygiene, pain, dressing and limb posture and was graded using the 4-point DAS scale where (0=No functional disability, 1: Mild disability, 2: Moderate disability and 3=Severe disability). The investigator, in consultation with the participant, selected 1 functional disability item from the 4 areas of disability and assessed it as a principal therapeutic target. The maximum possible score was 3 where higher scores indicate severe disability and lowers scores indicate sound functional ability. Baseline value was defined as the latest pre-first dose assessment with a non-missing value, including those from unscheduled visits. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-dose visit value minus the Baseline value.</description>

          <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. Any untoward event resulting in death, life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly/birth defect or any other situation according to medical or scientific judgment was categorized as SAE. Data for number of participants with any AE and any SAE is presented.</description>

          <description>Urinalysis parameters assessed were urine occult blood, urine protein . In this dipstick test, occult blood and protein in urine samples were recorded as negative trace, 1+, 2+, and 3+ (the plus sign increases with occult blood or proteins in the urine: 1+=slightly positive, 2+=positive, 3+=high positive etc). Number of participants with worst-case urinalysis results post-Baseline relative to Baseline by dipstick analysis have been presented.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Vital Sign Parameters Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) and Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP) at Week 12 and Week 48</title>
        <description>Vital sign parameters SBP and DBP were measured in a semi-recumbent position after a 5-minute rest. If measurement in a semi-recumbent position was difficult, measurement in another position (e.g., sitting) was acceptable. The measurement was performed always in the same position during the study period. SBP and DBP were measured using an automated device. Baseline value was defined as the latest pre-dose assessment with a non-missing value, including those from unscheduled visits. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the post-dose visit value minus the Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Vital Sign Parameter Temperature at Week 12 and Week 48</title>
        <description>Vital sign parameter temperature was measured orally, intra-aurally, or axillary fossa, the participant was instructed to refrain from eating food or drinking beverage within 5 minutes before the measurement. The method for the measurement of body temperature was same throughout the study. Baseline value was defined as the latest pre-dose assessment with a non-missing value, including those from unscheduled visits. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the post-dose visit value minus the Baseline value.</description>
