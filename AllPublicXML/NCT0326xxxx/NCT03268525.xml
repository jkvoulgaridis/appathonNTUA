      The investigators aim is to study the effect of pre-operative local anesthetic on post
      vaginal hysterectomy pain.

      This is a double-blinded, randomized, controlled trial. Women who undergone elective vaginal
      hysterectomy and gave their informed consent were included. Exclusion criteria included
      additional abdominal, chronic pelvic pain, malignancy, and allergy to Bupivacaine.

      Solutions of either Bupivacaine-Hydrochloride 0.5%, or Sodium-Chloride 0.9% as a placebo,
      were prepared prior to surgery, according to randomization. The chosen solution was injected
      before incision, as a modified paracervical block, and in each resection line (sacro-uterine
      and cardinal ligaments). The amount of fluid administered was 10 ml. When colporrhaphy was
      also performed, an additional 5 ml of solution were injected in the midline of the vaginal
      wall prior to each incision line.

      By utilizing the 10 cm Visual-analogue-scale (VAS) we examined the differences in
      post-operative pain at rest at 3, 8, and 24 hours, and during ambulation at 8 and 24 hours
      using multivariate linear regression models. We also assessed the differences in analgesics
      given at the different time points between the groups using multivariate negative binomial
      regression models.

    <description>Marcaine 0.5 % Injectable Solution will be injected before incision, and in a systematic fashion as a modified paracervical block. First, 2 ml will be injected through the vaginal fornices at 03.00, 06.00, 09.00, and 12.00 hours at 2 cm depth. Thus, 8 ml will be systematically injected around the cervical circumference before incision. In addition, 1 ml of the solution will be injected in each resection line (sacro-uterine and cardinal ligaments), adding up to a total of 10 ml. In case of performing additional anterior/ posterior colporrhaphy, additional solution of Marcaine 0.25%will be prepared: 5 ml of the solution will be injected to the cutting line of the anterior/ posterior vaginal wall, respectively, prior to incision.</description>
