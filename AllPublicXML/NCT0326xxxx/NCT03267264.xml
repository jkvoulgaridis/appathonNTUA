  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-site, prospective, open-label, randomized, 2 period cross over study
      comparing the subjects' current 32G pen needle (four groups of pen needles) to the BD Nucleus
      pen needle. The study will consist of two 15 day periods ( in which the subject will use each
      pen needle [BD Nucleus pen needle or subject's current pen needle, order randomized] for
      injection. At the end of the last study period, each subject will be asked to evaluate his or
      her perceptions using a 150mm relative VAS scale.

    <measure>Overall User Preference -Combined Groups</measure>
    <time_frame>30 Days</time_frame>
    <description>This is a combined endpoint for all study subjects. User preference is assessed through a single question reported on a 150mm relative VAS scale with the Nucleus Pen labeled at +75 mm and the subject's current pen needle labeled at -75mm. On this scale, zero represents no preference to either pen needle. Relative VAS scores range from -75mm to 75mm; positive scores reflect preference for BD Nucleus and negative scores reflect preference for the comparator (current pen needle).</description>

    <measure>User Experience - All Study Groups Combined</measure>
    <time_frame>30 Days</time_frame>
    <description>This is a combined endpoint for all study subjects. User experience is assessed through a series of questions reported on a 150mm relative VAS scale with the Nucleus Pen labeled at +75 mm and the subject's current pen needle labeled at -75mm. On this scale, zero represents no preference to either pen needle. Relative VAS scores range from -75mm to 75mm; positive scores reflect preference for BD Nucleus and negative scores reflect preference for the comparator (current pen needle). Questions include the subject's perception of: Overall Comfort, Anxiety Associated with a Needle Stick Injury, Injection Pain, and Ease of Use.</description>

        <title>Overall User Preference -Combined Groups</title>
        <description>This is a combined endpoint for all study subjects. User preference is assessed through a single question reported on a 150mm relative VAS scale with the Nucleus Pen labeled at +75 mm and the subject's current pen needle labeled at -75mm. On this scale, zero represents no preference to either pen needle. Relative VAS scores range from -75mm to 75mm; positive scores reflect preference for BD Nucleus and negative scores reflect preference for the comparator (current pen needle).</description>

        <description>This is a combined endpoint for all study subjects. User experience is assessed through a series of questions reported on a 150mm relative VAS scale with the Nucleus Pen labeled at +75 mm and the subject's current pen needle labeled at -75mm. On this scale, zero represents no preference to either pen needle. Relative VAS scores range from -75mm to 75mm; positive scores reflect preference for BD Nucleus and negative scores reflect preference for the comparator (current pen needle). Questions include the subject's perception of: Overall Comfort, Anxiety Associated with a Needle Stick Injury, Injection Pain, and Ease of Use.</description>
