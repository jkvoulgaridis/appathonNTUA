      Related donor Adenovirus (ADV) specific cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) manufactured with the
      Miltenyi CliniMACS Prodigy Cytokine Capture System will be administered intravenously in in
      children, adolescents and young adults with refractory ADV infection post Allogeneic
      Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (AlloHSCT), with primary immunodeficiencies (PID) or
      post solid organ transplant.

        1. Patients with Adenovirus infections post allogeneic HSCT, with primary
             immunodeficiencies or post solid organ transplant with:

               -  Increasing or persistent quantitative ADV RT-PCR DNA copies despite two weeks of
                  appropriate anti-viral therapy and/or

               -  clinical symptoms attributed to adenovirus, including pneumonitis, hemorrhagic
                  cystitis, colitis, hepatitis AND/OR

                    -  grade 2 renal insufficiency secondary to cidofovir Consent: Written informed
                       consent given (by patient or legal representative) prior to any
                       study-related procedures.

             a. Third Party Related Allogeneic Donor: If original donor is not available or does
             not have a T-cell response: third party allogeneic donor (family donor &gt; 1 HLA A, B,
             DR match to recipient) with a T-cell response at least to the viral MACS® GMP
             PepTivator antigen(s) of adenovirus.
