  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of undertaking CLN0020, which was a Substudy of the European Coil registry
      (CLN0014), was to investigate the use of COPD Co-Pilot AIR™, a COPD disease management
      program manufactured and operated by HGE Health Care Solutions, LLC, in participants
      undergoing the PneumRx Endobronchial Coil Treatment in a post-market setting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      COPD Co-Pilot AIR™ combines a digital respiratory symptom reporting participant application
      (an &quot;app&quot;) with facilitation of rapid personalized clinical recommendations made by the
      participant's health care provider and communicated to the participant through the
      application. COPD Co-Pilot AIR™ provides early identification of an increase in a
      participant's respiratory symptoms relative to the participant's own baseline symptom profile
      which in turn enables health care providers to rapidly implement modified treatment plans.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Participant has read, understood, and signed a CLN0020 informed consent form prior to
             enrollment.

          2. Participant is appropriate for Coil treatment per the Conformité Européene (European
             Conformity [CE])-Mark Approved RePneu Instructions for Use (IFU).

          3. Participant has been enrolled in and scheduled for treatment(s) with the PneumRx
             Endobronchial Coil procedure in the CLN0014 study.

          4. Participant's PneumRx Endobronchial Coil procedure is scheduled to occur no fewer than
             14 days from enrollment, providing enough time to establish a baseline of their daily
             symptoms. Ten days minimum of baseline data are required, which is defined as the
             Run-in period going forward.

          5. Participant is willing and able to use a smart phone.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Participant has undergone a Coil procedure.

          2. Participant has had an acute exacerbation of COPD that required hospitalization or
             emergency room visit or treatment with systemic steroids and/or antibiotics during the
             28 days prior to CLN0020 enrollment.

          3. Participant has a COPD exacerbation or respiratory illness during the Run-in period
             that in the judgment of the investigator requires medical intervention (for example,
             treatment with systemic steroids and/or antibiotics and/or hospitalization).

          4. Participant is suffering from terminal illness expected to adversely affect survival
             in the next 12 months.

          5. Participant has a history of non-compliance with medical therapies.
