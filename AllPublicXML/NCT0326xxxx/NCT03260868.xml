      Primary Objective:

      To evaluate the effect of virtual approach via novel technologies versus traditional study
      conduct on glycemic control in terms of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c).

      Secondary Objective:

      To evaluate the appropriate utilization of virtual approach via novel technologies during the
      study and to assess the effect of the virtual versus traditional study conduct on multiple
      outcomes in terms of study methodology and diabetes management.

      The study had a maximum study duration of 29 weeks, which consisted of a 3-week screening
      period (including a possible 1-week delay in first investigational medicinal product [IMP]
      administration after randomization in virtual group due to shipment of IMP and the virtual
      devices), a 24-week treatment period, and 1-week post-treatment safety follow-up period.

    <time_frame>During 24 weeks treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>Severe hypoglycemia was an event in which the participant required the assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions. Documented symptomatic hypoglycemia: an event during which typical symptoms of hypoglycemia were accompanied by a measured plasma glucose concentration of &lt;=3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) or &lt;3.0 mmol/L (54 mg/dL). Asymptomatic hypoglycemia: an event not accompanied by typical symptoms of hypoglycemia but with a measured plasma glucose concentration &lt;=3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) or &lt;3.0 mmol/L (54 mg/dL). Probable symptomatic hypoglycemia: an event during which symptoms of hypoglycemia were not accompanied by plasma glucose determination but was presumably caused by a plasma glucose concentration. Pseudo-hypoglycemia: an event with any of the typical symptoms of hypoglycaemia with plasma glucose concentration &gt;3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL).</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire Change (DTSQc) Score to Week 24</title>
          <description>DTSQc measured the relative change in treatment satisfaction from previous therapy. It consists of 8 items that were answered on a 6 point scale ranges from 3 (much less satisfied) to -3 (much more satisfied). Total treatment satisfaction score was the sum of items 1, 4-8 scores and ranged from -18 (much less satisfied) to +18 (much more satisfied), higher score indicated more satisfaction.</description>

        <description>Fear of hypoglycemia was measured with HFS-II at Week 24. The HFS-II comprises 33 items: 15 items explore behaviors that participants were engaged in to avoid low blood sugar and its negative consequences and 18 items related to concern/worry that participants had about their hypoglycemia. Responses to each item were made on a 5-point Likert scale ranges from 0 equal (=) &quot;Never&quot; to 4 = &quot;Always&quot;. Total HFS mean score was determined by computing the mean of all 33 items and the score ranged from 0 to 4, where higher score indicated more fear/worry.</description>

        <description>Severe hypoglycemia was an event in which the participant required the assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions.

Asymptomatic hypoglycemia: an event not accompanied by typical symptoms of hypoglycemia but with a measured plasma glucose concentration &lt;=3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) or &lt;3.0 mmol/L (54 mg/dL). Probable symptomatic hypoglycemia: an event during which symptoms of hypoglycemia were not accompanied by plasma glucose determination but was presumably caused by a plasma glucose concentration.
