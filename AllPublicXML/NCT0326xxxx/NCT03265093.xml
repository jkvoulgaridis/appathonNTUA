      Platelet Rich Fibrine (PRF), which promotes wound healing by supporting angiogenesis,
      immunity and epithelial proliferation phases. over a decade has since past since PRF was
      developed and many clinicians now point to the potential use of a liquid version of PRF. a
      liquid injectable-platelet-rich fibrin (i-PRF) was developed by modifying spin centrifugation
      forces. At lower centrifugation speeds and by utilizing non-glass centrifugation tubes, the
      fibrin coagulation could be slowed down at early time points thus generating an injectable
      PRF. Much like traditional PRF, i-PRF contains an increase in leukocyte number and is further
      able to stimulate growth factor release.

      Lichen planus is a common chronic mucocutaneous inflammatory disorder which generally affect
      s middle aged adults. Therapeutic methods including topical and systemic corticosteroids for
      the treatment of oral lichen planus (OLP) are suggested. However, long

      -term use of corticosteroids may be associated with local and systemic complications, and
      moreover, some patients may not be responsive.

      The investigators aimed to apply a treatment of autogenous origin (including no foreign
      products), considering the side effects of our corticosteroids. The study was designed as a
      split mouth.

      The investigators planned to administer I-PRF to one side and intralesional corticosteroid
      therapy to the other side at patients with bilateral atrophic / erosive oral lichen planus
      lesions

      Lichen planus diagnosis will be made histopathologically. Intraoral photographs and
      measurements will be taken at the beginning of the treatment and 2 months after the treatment
      is finished.

    <description>Venous blood will be taken from the patient every session and I-PRF will be created in the centrifuge. I- prf will be injected on one side and corticosteroid will be injected on the other side in patients with bilateral oral lichen planus. Once a week in the first month after treatment and one time at the end of the second month, the patient will be called to the control.</description>
