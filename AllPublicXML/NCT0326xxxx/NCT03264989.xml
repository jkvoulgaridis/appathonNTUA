  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the CSEG101A2202 study was to characterize the PK and PD of
      SEG101/crizanlizumab at 5 mg/kg and to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      SEG101/crizanlizumab in SCD patients.

      Study CSEG101A2202 was designed as a Phase II, multicenter, open-label study. The first 45
      patients (to identify 27 evaluable patients) were enrolled to the treatment group
      crizanlizumab 5.0 mg/kg to complete full PK/PD sampling at week 1 and week 15. In all
      patients, trough PK/PD samples was collected prior to each dose. In addition, throughout the
      study (and when possible), all patients had blood drawn for serum to assess PK and PD drawn
      at times of onset and resolution of each VOC event, fever, or infection. Once the up to 45
      patients were enrolled, 12 additional patients were enrolled to the exploratory treatment
      group and begin at 7.5 mg/kg of crizanlizumab.
