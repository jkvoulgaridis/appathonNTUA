      The investigators propose a trial to evaluate if the addition of ipilimumab to nivolumab
      after primary resistance to anti- programmed death 1 (PD-1) axis therapy can lead to
      objective radiographic tumor regression.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 20 percent of unselected patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC) and progression during or after standard first line chemotherapy will experience
      tumor response to nivolumab. Treatment options for patients who are not responsive to
      programmed death 1 (PD-1) axis inhibitor therapy are limited, and the mechanisms of primary
      resistance are poorly understood.

      The combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab is currently FDA approved for the treatment of
      advanced melanoma based on superiority to either agent alone5. The results of a phase I study
      evaluating combination therapy with nivolumab and ipilimumab in patients with advanced NSCLC
      (NCT01454102) were presented at the annual American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)
      meeting in 20166. Dosing of nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks and ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 6
      weeks yielded an objective response rate (ORR) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
      Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 of 39%, with one-year survival rate of 69% and grade 3-4
      treatment-related adverse event rate of 33%. These results prompted an ongoing phase III
      study comparing this regimen to standard first line chemotherapy, nivolumab monotherapy or
      combination therapy with chemotherapy and nivolumab for patients with advanced NSCLC
      (NCT02477826).

      The investigators propose a trial to evaluate if the addition of ipilimumab to nivolumab
      after primary resistance to anti-PD-1 axis therapy can lead to objective radiographic tumor
      regression. It is hypothesized that ipilimumab will enable more effective immune priming in
      some patients, resulting in the trafficking of tumor-specific cytotoxic T cells to the tumor,
      as well as depletion of tumor-permissive T regulatory cells. With concurrent nivolumab, PD-1
      inhibition in the tumor will enable effective anti-tumor attack by tumor-specific T cells.
      Serial tumor biopsies and blood collections will allow interrogation of changes in the tumor
      microenvironment (and periphery) that support this hypothesis.

      The investigators will primarily enroll patients who have experienced progression of NSCLC
      after anti-PD-1- axis therapy without initial response to such therapy ('primary
      resistance'). A smaller cohort of patients with acquired resistance to anti-PD-1 axis therapy
      (i.e. progression after initial response) will additionally be accrued.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria

        A. Signed Informed Consent B. Ability to comply with the protocol C. Age ≥18 years D.
        Histologically or cytologically documented, locally advanced or metastatic (i.e., Stage
        IIIB not eligible for definitive chemoradiotherapy, Stage IV, or recurrent) NSCLC (per the
        American Joint Committee /AJCC staging system) E. ECOG performance status of 0 to 2 F.
        Measurable disease, as defined by RECIST v1.1. Previously irradiated lesions can be counted
        as target lesions if clearly progressing after radiation.

        G. Chemotherapy-naive and treated patients will be eligible, with no limit on number of
        prior therapies. Patients with NSCLC known to harbor an ALK rearrangement, or EGFR mutation
        known to be sensitive to FDA-approved tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), are only eligible
        after experiencing disease progression (during or after treatment) or intolerance to an FDA
        approved EGFR TKI or ALK TKI, respectively.

          1. Patients with TKI-treated EGFR mutant NSCLC harboring the secondary EGFR T790M tumor
             must have received prior osimertinib

          2. Patients with crizotinib-treated ALK rearranged NSCLC must have received a next
             generation ALK inhibitor (e.g. ceritinib, alectinib or brigatinib) H. Prior palliative
             radiotherapy must have been completed at least 2 weeks before the first dose of study
             drug.

        I. Anti- PD-1 Axis therapy (anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1, e.g. nivolumab, pembrolizumab,
        atezolizumab, durvalumab, avelumab) must be the most recent systemic anti-tumor treatment
        received in all patients, with documented progressive disease. Last administration of
        anti-PD-1 axis therapy must have been at least 3 weeks before the first dose of study drug.

        a. Patients to be enrolled to the primary cohort (primary resistance) must have had
        progressive disease or stable disease less than 24 weeks as the best clinical response to
        anti-PD-1-axis monotherapy b. Patients to be enrolled to the exploratory cohort (acquired
        resistance) must have had stable disease for at least 24 weeks, partial response, or
        complete response as the best clinical response to anti-PD-1-axis monotherapy, with
        subsequent progression of disease J. At least one tumor amenable to incisional, excisional,
        core or forceps (transbronchial) biopsy. Patients must be willing to undergo tumor biopsies
        before starting trial therapy, and 9 to 10 weeks after initiation of therapy.

        a. If the initial biopsy will be excisional, the excised tumor cannot be counted as a
        target lesion and there must be another lesion amenable to incisional, excisional, core or
        forceps biopsy. In this scenario, the second biopsy can only be excisional if the lesion to
        be excised is not a target lesion. b. Cytology tumor specimens (e.g. from fine-needle
        biopsies, or drainage of pleural/ pericardial or ascites fluid) are not acceptable.
        Biopsies of bone lesions that do not have a soft tissue component are also not acceptable
        (i.e. decalcified tumor samples are not acceptable).

        K. For female patients of childbearing potential and male patients with partners of
        childbearing potential, agreement (by patient and/or partner) to use a highly effective
        form(s) of contraception (i.e., one that results in a low failure rate [&lt;1% per year] when
        used consistently and correctly) and to continue its use for 6 months after the last dose
        of trial therapy. Highly effective contraception is one with a failure rate of &lt;0.1%. Birth
        control pills on their own do not achieve that rate.

          1. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test (serum or urine)
             within 72 hours of the start of study drug administration

          2. Women who have recently given birth must no longer be breastfeeding

        L. Adequate hematologic and end-organ function, defined by the following laboratory results
        obtained within 14 days prior to the first study treatment:

        - Neutrophils ≥1500 cells/μL (without granulocyte colony-stimulating factor support within
        2 weeks prior to Cycle 1, Day 1)

          -  Platelets ≥75,000/μL (transfusion to achieve this level is not permitted within 2
             weeks of the first study drug administration)

          -  Hemoglobin ≥9.0 g/dL

          -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤3 x institutional
             upper limit of normal (ULN) with the following exceptions: Patients with documented
             liver metastases: AST and/or ALT≤5 x ULN

          -  Serum bilirubin ≤1.5 x ULN (Patients with known Gilbert disease who have serum
             bilirubin level ≤3 x ULN may be enrolled)

          -  Serum creatinine ≤1.5 x ULN or creatinine clearance ≥50 mL/min

        Exclusion Criteria

        A. Has an active autoimmune disease requiring systemic treatment within the past 3 months
        or a documented history of clinically severe autoimmune disease, or a syndrome that
        requires systemic steroids or immunosuppressive agents. Subjects with vitiligo or resolved
        childhood asthma/atopy would be an exception to this rule. Subjects who require
        intermittent use of inhaled steroids or local steroid injections would not be excluded from
        the study. Subjects with hypothyroidism stable on hormone replacement, or psoriasis not
        requiring systemic therapy (within the past 3 years) will not be excluded from the study.
        B. Interstitial lung disease that is symptomatic or may interfere with the detection or
        management of suspected drug-related pulmonary toxicity C. Subjects must not have a history
        of life-threatening toxicity related to prior anti-PD-1 axis therapy a. Subjects with
        history of anti-PD-1 axis therapy toxicities that are unlikely to recur with standard
        countermeasures (e.g., hormone replacement after adrenal crisis) are eligible.

        E. Symptomatic or untreated CNS metastases. Patients with a history of treated asymptomatic
        CNS metastases are eligible, provided they meet all of the following criteria:

          1. No evidence of interim progression between the completion of CNS-directed therapy and
             the start of trial therapy.

          2. No ongoing requirement for dexamethasone as therapy for CNS disease; anticonvulsants
             at a stable dose are allowed.

          3. Completed stereotactic radiosurgery at least 1 week prior to Cycle 1, Day 1 or
