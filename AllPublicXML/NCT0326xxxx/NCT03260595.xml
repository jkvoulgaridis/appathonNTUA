    <measure>Cohort 1: Skin Irritation Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 3 to 4</time_frame>
    <description>The skin irritation index is a common measure of skin irritation potential (safety criteria) of investigational product and derived using skin irritation scores. Individual skin irritation score ranges from 0-4, where 0 = no reaction, 0.5 = mild erythema, 1 = erythema, 2 = erythema with edema and papula, 3 = erythema with edema, papula and small water blister, 4 = large water blister, higher score indicates more skin irritation. For each investigational product, the skin irritation index was calculated as the sum of the maximum individual skin irritation scores divided by the number of evaluable participants and multiplied by 100, which ranged from 0 to 400; where, lower score indicated less skin irritation and higher score indicated more skin irritation.</description>

        <title>Cohort 1: Skin Irritation Index</title>
        <description>The skin irritation index is a common measure of skin irritation potential (safety criteria) of investigational product and derived using skin irritation scores. Individual skin irritation score ranges from 0-4, where 0 = no reaction, 0.5 = mild erythema, 1 = erythema, 2 = erythema with edema and papula, 3 = erythema with edema, papula and small water blister, 4 = large water blister, higher score indicates more skin irritation. For each investigational product, the skin irritation index was calculated as the sum of the maximum individual skin irritation scores divided by the number of evaluable participants and multiplied by 100, which ranged from 0 to 400; where, lower score indicated less skin irritation and higher score indicated more skin irritation.</description>

        <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent were events between first dose of study drug and up to 28 days after last dose of study drug (up to Day 36) that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pre-treatment state. AEs included both SAEs and non-serious AEs.</description>

        <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent were events between first dose of study drug and up to 28 days after last dose of study drug (up to Day 29) that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pre-treatment state. AEs included both SAEs and non-serious AEs.</description>
