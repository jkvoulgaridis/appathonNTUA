  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoporosis fractures impose a significant economic burden on the health system. There is
      evidence that osteoporosis has a high prevalence in Iran (4.8% for men and 7.7% for women),
      and the frequency of osteopenia is 36.8% for men and 39.3% for women in Iran Accordingly, the
      prevention of osteopenia progression towards osteoporosis has been considered as an important
      issue in medicine. Bone is a dynamic tissue that is constantly being remodeled thus the
      equilibrium between bone formation and resorption done by simultaneously regulating
      osteoclasts and osteoblasts is important. Imbalance between bone deposition and resorption
      contributes to reducing bone mineral density and hence increasing the risk of osteoporosis

      Recently, new therapies have been focused on use of medicinal herbs, especially
      phytochemicals. Among phytochemicals, phytonutrients, and especially polyphenols, can act
      both on osteoblast and on osteoclast.

      Pine bark extract (oligopin) is a rich source of polyphenols that exerts strong antioxidant
      and anti-inflammatory activities. It has also beneficial effects on bone turnover based on in
      vitro studies and animal models. Investigators aimed to investigate the effects of oligopin
      on bone turnover markers and plasma and peripheral mononuclear cells oxidative stress in
      postmenopausal women with osteopenia in a double-blind randomized clinical trial.
      Participants are forty four women with osteopenia divided into two groups randomly (22,
      having oligopin, 150 mg, once daily, for 12 weeks). The 2nd group (22 women with osteopenia)
      receives the same amount of the placebo. At the first and the end of the study, blood sample
      are taken to measure in order to peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolation and plasma
      separation. The levels of bone alkaline phosphatase and carboxy terminal collagen type I in
      plasma oxidative stress markers such as total anti-oxidant capacity, malondialdehyde, and
      protein carbonyl were evaluated. Furthermore, oxidative stress will be evaluated in
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells by measurement of expression and activity of magnesium
      superoxide dismutase,catalase and Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2.
