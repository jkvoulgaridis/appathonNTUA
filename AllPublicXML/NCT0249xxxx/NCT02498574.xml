  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A promising form of enhancing brain function non-invasively involves stimulating the brain
      using weak magnetic or electric currents. This method is becoming increasingly popular in
      both clinical and commercial circles; a number of portable, at-home devices are available on
      the commercial market for personal use. In this study, the investigators aim to determine
      factors associated with the enhancement of cognitive and motor learning following
      transcranial direct-current stimulation in healthy young adults. Understanding how
      participants respond to brain stimulation is critical to maximizing the effectiveness of
      stimulation and determining its potential as a performance-enhancing aid for mental tasks.
      Future developments of this study may also inform the capacity of brain stimulation to act as
      non-drug alternative to treatment for cognitive decline.

      This study involves a single session of anodal tDCS, applied over the motor cortex, while
      performing a task of motor dexterity. Pre and post stimulation evaluations will assess any
      effects of the stimulation on motor and cognitive performance.
