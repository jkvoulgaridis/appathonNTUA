  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare treatment with a fixed-dose combination (FDC) of
      imipenem/relebactam/cilastatin (IMI/REL) with a FDC of piperacillin/tazobactam (PIP/TAZ) in
      participants with hospital-acquired or ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (HABP or
      VAPB, respectively). The primary hypothesis is that IMI/REL is non-inferior to PIP/TAZ in the
      incidence rate of all-cause mortality.
