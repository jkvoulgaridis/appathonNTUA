  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare treatment with a fixed-dose combination (FDC) of
      imipenem/relebactam/cilastatin (IMI/REL) with a FDC of piperacillin/tazobactam (PIP/TAZ) in
      participants with hospital-acquired or ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (HABP or
      VAPB, respectively). The primary hypothesis is that IMI/REL is non-inferior to PIP/TAZ in the
      incidence rate of all-cause mortality.

          <description>Participants received piperacillin 4000 mg + tazobactam 500 mg as a FDC administered IV every 6 hours for a minimum of 7 days, up to 14 days. At the start of PIP/TAZ treatment, participants were treated empirically with 600 mg open-label linezolid administered IV every 12 hours until MRSA was ruled out. Participants with confirmed MRSA infection continued to receive 600 mg linezolid every 12 hours for a minimum of 7 days, up to 14 days total.</description>
