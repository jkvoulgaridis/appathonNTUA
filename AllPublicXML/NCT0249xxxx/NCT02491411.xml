    <textblock>
      This pilot trial studies how well dexamethasone and re-treatment with enzalutamide work in
      treating patients with prostate cancer that has spread to other places in the body
      (metastatic), does not respond to hormone therapy (hormone-resistant), and was previously
      treated with enzalutamide and docetaxel. Dexamethasone treatment may be able to reverse one
      resistance mechanism to enzalutamide therapy (overabundance of receptors for dexamethasone
      and other glucocorticoids inside cancer cells) and allow for renewed therapeutic sensitivity
      to enzalutamide. Androgens (a type of male hormone) can bind to androgen receptors found
      inside prostate cancer cells, which may cause the cancer cells to grow. Enzalutamide may stop
      the growth of prostate cancer cells by blocking the activity of the cancer cell androgen
      receptors. Giving dexamethasone prior to re-treatment with enzalutamide may be a treatment
      for prostate cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rate to enzalutamide (Enza)
      after treatment with dexamethasone (Dex) therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Objective response rate to Enza in patients with measurable disease on computed tomography
      (CT) scan using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria.

      II. Time to PSA progression (based upon Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 [PCWG2] criteria) for
      treatment with Dex.

      III. Effect of each treatment on quality of life as assessed by patient completion of
      validated instruments (Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy [FACIT]-Fatigue
      Scale, RAND Short Form-36 [RANDSF-36]).

      IV. PSA response rates to Dex for patients who are androgen receptor splice variant 7 (AR-V7)
      positive and AR-V7 negative, respectively, at study entry.

      V. Response rates to Enza for patients who are AR-V7 positive and AR-V7 negative,
      respectively, at study entry.

      VI. Percentage of patients who are AR-V7 positive at study entry who are AR-V7 negative at
      time of initiation of Enza, or vice-versa.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive dexamethasone orally (PO) once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity until there is evidence
      of PSA progression, clinical disease progression, or radiographic disease progression. At
      time of progression, dexamethasone will be stopped via a rapid taper over one week if
      patients were treated for over 30 days. Patients then receive enzalutamide PO once daily on
      days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 3 courses in the absence of clinical
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.

            <description>Patients receive dexamethasone PO once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity until there is evidence of PSA progression, clinical disease progression, or radiographic disease progression. At time of progression, dexamethasone will be stopped via a rapid taper over one week if patients were treated for over 30 days. Patients then receive enzalutamide PO once daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 3 courses in the absence of clinical disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
