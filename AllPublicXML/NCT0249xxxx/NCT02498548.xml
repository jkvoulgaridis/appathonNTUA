    <textblock>
      This project will characterize lower extremity eccentric muscle function among individuals
      who have undergone locomotor training after spinal cord injury and will evaluate the effect
      of downhill training at moderate speeds - targeted to rehabilitation eccentric function of
      the knee.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lower extremity eccentric motor control is is critically important for locomotor function but
      is impaired after spinal cord injury (SCI). Even after treadmill training, preliminary
      evidence indicates that eccentric deficits persist among individuals with SCI. This proposal
      aims to characterize eccentric motor control of the muscles about the knee during locomotion
      and evaluate the efficacy of downhill gait training at moderate speeds as an intervention to
      improve eccentric function of the knee joint during walking.

          -  skin wounds in regions where harness or hands provide support

          -  pregnancy. Note: Persons who are pregnant will not be enrolled as exercise tolerance

             equipment)

        Note: Use of anti-spasticity and other medications (dose, frequency) will be monitored
        throughout training and used as a confounding variable in the analyses.
