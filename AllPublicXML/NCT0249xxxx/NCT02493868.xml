  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of intranasal esketamine plus an oral
      antidepressant compared with an oral antidepressant (active comparator) plus intranasal
      placebo in delaying relapse of depressive symptoms in participants with treatment-resistant
      depression (TRD) who are in stable remission after an induction and optimization course of
      intranasal esketamine plus an oral antidepressant.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind (neither the researchers nor the participant know what
      treatment the participants is receiving), active-controlled, multicenter (more than 1 study
      site) study in participants with TRD to assess the efficacy of intranasal esketamine plus an
      oral antidepressant compared with an oral antidepressant (active comparator) plus intranasal
      placebo in delaying relapse of depressive symptoms. The study will consist of 5 phases:
      Screening/Prospective Observational Phase (4-7weeks) for direct-entry participants only,
      Open-label Induction Phase (4-weeks) for direct-entry participants only, Optimization Phase
      (12-weeks; open-label for direct-entry participants and double-blind for transferred-entry
      participants), Maintenance Phase (variable duration; double-blind for all participants) and
      Follow-up Phase (2-weeks). Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Total of 719 participants were enrolled out of which 705 were included in the analysis. 14 participants were excluded due to premature closure of a site due to quality and data integrity issues.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Out of 705 participants, 437 (direct entry [DE] participants) entered in induction (IND) phase and 268 participants (150 transferred-entry [TE] participants from study ESKETINTRD3001 [NCT02417064] and 118 participants from study ESKETINTRD3002 [NCT02418585]) entered in this study in optimization (OP) phase.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Intranasal Esketamine + Oral AD</title>
          <description>Open-label induction (IND) phase (DE): received 56 or 84 milligram intranasal esketamine solution twice weekly with open-label oral AD (one of: duloxetine/escitalopram/sertraline/venlafaxine extended release [XR]), once daily for 4 weeks. OP phase (DE+TE): received intranasal esketamine (same dose) solution once per week for first 4 weeks, then once per week/once every other week based on severity of depressive symptoms, and continued same oral AD from IND phase for 12 weeks. MA phase (DE+TE): Participants were randomized (at end of OP phase) to receive intranasal esketamine (same dose) once weekly/once every other week based on depressive symptoms and continued same oral AD from IND phase. Follow-up (FU) phase: participants received no intranasal esketamine but continued oral AD for 2 weeks unless determined to not be clinically appropriate. Participants who were non-responders at end of IND phase or who were early terminated at any phase proceeded directly to FU phase.</description>

          <title>Oral AD + Intranasal Placebo</title>
          <description>Open-label induction phase: No intervention was administered. Optimization phase (transferred-entry participants): received intranasal esketamine matching placebo solution once per week for the first 4 weeks, then once per week or once every other week depending on severity of depressive symptoms with open-label oral antidepressant (AD) (one of: duloxetine/escitalopram/sertraline/venlafaxine XR), once daily for 12 weeks. Maintenance (MA) phase (DE+TE participants): Participants were randomized (at the end of optimization phase) to receive intranasal esketamine placebo with oral AD from optimization phase. Follow-up Phase: participants received oral AD for 2 weeks of the follow-up phase unless it was determined to not be clinically appropriate. Participants who were non-responders at end of IND phase or who were early terminated at any phase proceeded directly to FU phase.</description>

        <title>Time to Relapse in Participants With Stable Remission (Maintenance Phase)</title>
        <description>Relapse is defined as any of following: Montgomery-asberg depression rating scale (MADRS) total score greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 22 for 2 consecutive assessments separated by 5-15 days and/or hospitalization for worsening depression or any other clinically relevant event to be suggestive of a relapse of depressive illness such as suicide attempt/completed suicide/hospitalization for suicide prevention; If hospitalized, start date of hospitalization will be date of relapse, if not hospitalized date of event will be used. MADRS: clinician-rated scale to measure depression severity and to detect changes due to antidepressant treatment. It has 10 items, scored from 0-6 (not present/normal-severe/continuous symptoms), with total score of 60. Higher scores mean more severe condition. Stable remission: MADRS total score less than or equal to (&lt;=) 12 for at least 3 of last 4 weeks of OP phase, with 1 excursion total score greater than (&gt;) 12 or one missing assessment at OP week 13 or 14.</description>
        <time_frame>Time from randomization to the first relapse during the maintenance phase (up to 92 Weeks)</time_frame>
        <population>Full (stable remitters) analysis set included all the randomized participants who were in stable remission at the end of the optimization phase and received at least 1 dose of intranasal study drug and 1 dose of oral AD during the maintenance phase.</population>

            <description>Open-label induction (IND) phase (DE): received 56 or 84 milligram intranasal esketamine solution twice weekly with open-label oral AD (one of: duloxetine/escitalopram/sertraline/venlafaxine extended release [XR]), once daily for 4 weeks. OP phase (DE+TE): received intranasal esketamine (same dose) solution once per week for first 4 weeks, then once per week/once every other week based on severity of depressive symptoms, and continued same oral AD from IND phase for 12 weeks. MA phase (DE+TE): Participants were randomized (at end of OP phase) to receive intranasal esketamine (same dose) once weekly/once every other week based on depressive symptoms and continued same oral AD from IND phase. Follow-up (FU) phase: participants received no intranasal esketamine but continued oral AD for 2 weeks unless determined to not be clinically appropriate. Participants who were non-responders at end of IND phase or who were early terminated at any phase proceeded directly to FU phase.</description>

Optimization phase (transferred-entry participants): received intranasal esketamine matching placebo solution once per week for the first 4 weeks, then once per week or once every other week depending on severity of depressive symptoms with open-label oral antidepressant (AD) (one of: duloxetine/escitalopram/sertraline/venlafaxine XR), once daily for 12 weeks. Maintenance phase (DE+TE participants): Participants were randomized (at the end of optimization phase) to receive intranasal esketamine placebo with oral AD from optimization phase. Follow-up Phase: Participants received oral AD for 2 weeks of the follow-up phase unless it was determined to not be clinically appropriate. Participants who were non-responders at end of IND phase or who were early terminated at any phase proceeded directly to FU phase.</description>

          <description>Relapse is defined as any of following: Montgomery-asberg depression rating scale (MADRS) total score greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 22 for 2 consecutive assessments separated by 5-15 days and/or hospitalization for worsening depression or any other clinically relevant event to be suggestive of a relapse of depressive illness such as suicide attempt/completed suicide/hospitalization for suicide prevention; If hospitalized, start date of hospitalization will be date of relapse, if not hospitalized date of event will be used. MADRS: clinician-rated scale to measure depression severity and to detect changes due to antidepressant treatment. It has 10 items, scored from 0-6 (not present/normal-severe/continuous symptoms), with total score of 60. Higher scores mean more severe condition. Stable remission: MADRS total score less than or equal to (&lt;=) 12 for at least 3 of last 4 weeks of OP phase, with 1 excursion total score greater than (&gt;) 12 or one missing assessment at OP week 13 or 14.</description>

        <description>PHQ-9 is a 9-item, self-report scale assessing depressive symptoms. Each item is rated on a 4-point scale (0 = Not at all, 1 = Several Days, 2 = More than half the days, and 3 = Nearly every day). The participant's item responses are summed to provide a total score (range of 0 to 27) with higher scores indicating greater severity of depressive symptoms. The severity of the PHQ-9 is categorized as follows: None-minimal (0-4), mild (5-9), moderate (10-14), moderately severe (15-19) and severe (20-27). The change from baseline in PHQ-9 total score, (LOCF data) at endpoint was reported. The last post baseline observation was carried forward as the endpoint.</description>

Each item is rated on a 4-point scale (0 = Not at all, 1 = Several Days, 2 = More than half the days, and 3 = Nearly every day). The participant's item responses are summed to provide a total score (range of 0 to 27) with higher scores indicating greater severity of depressive symptoms. The severity of the PHQ-9 is categorized as follows: None-minimal (0-4), mild (5-9), moderate (10-14), moderately severe (15-19) and severe (20-27). The change from baseline in PHQ-9 total score, (LOCF data) at endpoint was reported. The last post baseline observation was carried forward as the endpoint.</description>

        <description>GAD-7 is a brief and validated 7-item self-report assessment of overall anxiety. Participants respond to each item using a 4-point scale with response categories of 0=not at all, 1=several days, 2=more than half the days, and 3=nearly every day. Item responses are summed to yield a total score with a range of 0 to 21, where higher scores indicate more anxiety. The recall period is 2 weeks. The severity of the GAD-7 is categorized as follows: None (0-4), Mild (5-9), Moderate (10-14) and Severe (15 -21). Item responses are summed to yield a total score (range of 0 to 21), with higher scores indicating more anxiety. The change from baseline in GAD-7 total score, (LOCF data), at endpoint was reported.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 Items Total Score at Endpoint in Participants With Stable Response (But Not in Stable Remission) (Maintenance Phase)</title>
        <description>GAD-7 is a brief and validated 7-item self-report assessment of overall anxiety. Participants respond to each item using a 4-point scale with response categories of 0=not at all, 1=several days, 2=more than half the days, and 3=nearly every day. Item responses are summed to yield a total score with a range of 0 to 21, where higher scores indicate more anxiety. The recall period is 2 weeks. The severity of the GAD-7 is categorized as follows: None (0-4), Mild (5-9), Moderate (10-14) and Severe (15 -21). Item responses are summed to yield a total score (range of 0 to 21), with higher scores indicating more anxiety. The change from baseline in GAD-7 total score, (LOCF data), at endpoint was reported. The last post baseline observation was carried forward as the endpoint.</description>

        <description>EQ-5D-5L consists of EQ-5D-5L descriptive system and EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS). EQ-5D-5L descriptive system comprises of 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each has 5 levels of perceived problems (1-no problem, 2-slight problems, 3-moderate problems, 4-severe problems, 5-extreme problems). Participant selects answer for each of 5 dimensions considering response that best matches his/her health &quot;today&quot;. Responses were used to generate a Health Status Index (HSI). HSI ranges from 0 (dead) to 1.00 (full health). EQ VAS self-rating records the respondent's own assessment of his/her overall health status at time of completion, on a scale of 0 (worst health you can imagine) to 100 (best health you can imagine). Sum score ranges from 0 to 100 where, sum score = (sum of the scores from the 5 dimensions minus 5) *5. Higher score indicates worst health state.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in EuroQol-5 Dimension-5 Level Sum Score at Endpoint in Participants With Stable Response (But Not in Stable Remission) (Maintenance Phase)</title>
        <description>EQ-5D-5L consists of EQ-5D-5L descriptive system and EQ VAS. EQ-5D-5L descriptive system comprises of 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each has 5 levels of perceived problems (1-no problem, 2-slight problems, 3-moderate problems, 4-severe problems, 5-extreme problems). Participant selects answer for each of 5 dimensions considering response that best matches his/her health &quot;today&quot;. Responses were used to generate a HSI. HSI ranges from 0 (dead) to 1.00 (full health). EQ VAS self-rating records the respondent's own assessment of his/her overall health status at time of completion, on a scale of 0 (worst health you can imagine) to 100 (best health you can imagine). Sum score ranges from 0 to 100 where, sum score = (sum of the scores from the 5 dimensions minus 5) *5. Higher score indicates worst health state.</description>

The first 3 items assess disruption of 1: work/school 2: social life 3: family life/home responsibilities using a 0-10 rating scale. It also has one item on days lost from school or work and one item on days when underproductive. The score for the first 3 items are summed to create a total score of 0-30 where a higher score indicates greater impairment. The recall period is 7 days. Scores &lt;= 4 for each item and &lt;= 12 for the total score are considered response. Scores &lt;= 2 for each item and &lt;= 6 for the total score are considered remission. The change from baseline in SDS total Score, (LOCF data), at endpoint was reported. The last post baseline observation was carried forward as the endpoint.</description>

Scores &lt;= 4 for each item and &lt;= 12 for the total score are considered response. Scores &lt;= 2 for each item and &lt;= 6 for the total score are considered remission. The change from baseline in SDS total Score, (LOCF data), at endpoint was reported. The last post baseline observation was carried forward as the endpoint.</description>

OP phase (DE+TE): received intranasal esketamine (same dose) solution once per week for first 4 weeks, then once per week/once every other week based on severity of depressive symptoms, and continued same oral AD from IND phase for 12 weeks. MA phase (DE+TE): Participants were randomized (at end of OP phase) to receive intranasal esketamine (same dose) once weekly/once every other week based on depressive symptoms and continued same oral AD from IND phase. Follow-up (FU) phase: participants received no intranasal esketamine but continued oral AD for 2 weeks unless determined to not be clinically appropriate.

          <description>The SDS is a participant-reported outcome measure and is a 5-item questionnaire used and accepted for assessment of functional impairment and associated disability. The first 3 items assess disruption of 1: work/school 2: social life 3: family life/home responsibilities using a 0-10 rating scale. It also has one item on days lost from school or work and one item on days when underproductive. The score for the first 3 items are summed to create a total score of 0-30 where a higher score indicates greater impairment. The recall period is 7 days. Scores &lt;= 4 for each item and &lt;= 12 for the total score are considered response. Scores &lt;= 2 for each item and &lt;= 6 for the total score are considered remission.
