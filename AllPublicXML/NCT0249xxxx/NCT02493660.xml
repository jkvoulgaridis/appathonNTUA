      This is a non-inferiority, prospective, single blinded, multi-center, randomized, controlled,
      pivotal study evaluating the safety and effectiveness of the InSpace™ device as a primary
      surgical treatment for full thickness MRCT in comparison to Partial Repair of a full
      thickness MRCT performed during an arthroscopic procedure.

        Main Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Positive diagnostic imaging by MRI of the index shoulder indicating a full thickness
             Massive Rotator Cuff Tear (MRCT), measuring ≥ 5 cm in diameter involving ≥ two tendons
             (confirmed Intra-operatively)

          -  Functional deltoid muscle and preserved passive range of motion on physical
             examination

          -  Documented VAS score of &gt; 30 mm pain

          -  Failed non-operative treatment of at least 4 months

          -  Patient in general good health,independent, and can comply with all post-operative
             evaluations and visits.

        Main Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known allergy to the device material (copolymer of PLA and -ε-caprolactone)

          -  Evidence of the following conditions:

               1. significant gleno-humeral or acromiohumeral arthritis

               2. full thickness cartilage loss as seen on MRI

               3. gleno-humeral instability (excessive translation of the humeral head on the
                  glenoid fossa)

               4. pre-existing deltoid defect or deltoid palsy

               5. major joint trauma, infection or necrosis

               6. partial thickness tears of the supraspinatous

               7. fully reparable rotator cuff tear [Tear of less than 5 cm in diameter (or &lt; 4
                  cm2) with retractable tendon that can be fully repaired]

          -  The subject requires concomitant subscapularis repair and/or labral repair

          -  Previous surgery of the index shoulder in the past 1 year, excluding diagnostic
             arthroscopy

          -  The subject's condition is bilateral and rotator cuff repair is scheduled or to be
             scheduled over the course of this study for the contra lateral shoulder

          -  Major medical condition that could affect quality of life and influence the results of
             the study (e.g. HIV or other immunosuppressive conditions, active malignancy in the
             past 5 years, acute MI, CVA, etc.)

          -  Documented evidence of a history of drug/alcohol abuse within 12 months of enrollment

          -  The subject's condition represents a worker's compensation case

          -  The subject has implanted metallic devices (e.g., cardiac pacemakers, insulin pumps,
             nerve stimulators), medically implanted clips or other electronically, magnetically or
             mechanically activated implants that would contraindicate undergoing a MRI scan or has
             claustrophobia that would inhibit ability to undergo a MRI scan .

          -  The subject is physically or mentally compromised (e.g., currently being treated for a
             psychiatric disorder, senile dementia, Alzheimer's disease, etc.), to the extent that
             the Investigator judges the subject to be unable or unlikely to remain compliant to
             follow-up

          -  The subject is receiving prescription narcotic pain medication for conditions
             unrelated to the index shoulder condition

          -  The subject currently has an acute infection in the area surrounding the surgical
             site.
