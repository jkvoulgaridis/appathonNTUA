    <textblock>
      This study is to review how the uterus heals after having open fetal surgery. Open fetal
      surgery causes a scar perhaps two: one from the open fetal surgery and a second from delivery
      by cesarean section; rarely, the same area of your uterus was used for both open fetal
      surgery and delivery. From other studies of surgery performed on a uterus, some of the
      uterine scars do not heal well. This study's intervention uses sterile saline to spread open
      the inside of the uterus. The saline is slowly injected into the uterus using a catheter. An
      ultrasound called a sonohysterogram is performed to take pictures of the uterus, its inside
      and the walls of the uterus. In this way, the healed areas from the uterine surgery can be
      seen with ultrasound and evaluated. This is performed at least 6 months after delivery.

      Primary Outcome:

      Measure the depth of the scar and location of the scar 6 months or longer after delivery.

      This is an Investigator initiated, prospective study reviewing medical records and performing
      a sonohysterogram on non-pregnant women at 6 or more months after delivery of an infant who
      received open fetal repair.

      An evaluation is completed at SSM Cardinal Glennon (CG), Fetal Care Institute (FCI) of a
      woman who has decided to have open fetal surgery to complete a fetal repair before the infant
      is born.

        -  After open fetal surgery participant will be monitored and delivered appropriately.

        -  After the infant is born investigators will review the mother's and infant's electronic
           health records and FCI database records

        -  6 months or more after delivery of an infant who has received open fetal repair the
           participant will go to Saint Louis University (SLU) Care for a sonohysterogram to
           evaluate the healing process.

    <description>Average myometrium will be calculated, measured by the sonohysterogram. The myometrium will be measured caudad and cephalad of the niche and averaged ((Caudad side in mm + Cephalad side in mm)/2)=Average myometrium thickness The myometrium at niche will be measured (niche mm). Average myometrium-niche mm= niche thinning (mm).
Niche thinning / Average myometrium thickness= Percentage of thinning at the niche.
Ex:
Average thickness at niche: 0.5 mm Caudad myometrium thickness: 1.5 mm Cephalad myometrium thickness: 1.5 mm
1.5mm + 1.5mm= 3mm/ 2= 1.5mm (average Myometrium Thickness)

      <recruitment_details>Recruitment period was June, 2013 through August, 2016. Patients were recruited for study during fetal surgery evaluation in the St. Louis Fetal Care Institute office. If patients were interested in participating in the study, the research nurse contacted the patient after delivery and set up an appointment at 6 months postpartum.</recruitment_details>
