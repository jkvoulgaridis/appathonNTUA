  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety and tolerability of
      JNJ-42165279 in participants with major depressive disorder (MDD) with anxiety symptoms who
      have had inadequate response to treatment with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor
      (SSRI) or serotonergic/noradrenergic reuptake inhibitor (SNRI).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, double-blind (neither physician nor participant knows the treatment
      that the participant receives), placebo-controlled, randomized, parallel-group study in
      participants with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) with Anxious Distress. Participants who had
      treatment initiated with a SSRI/SNRI allowed by the protocol will be evaluated at the
      investigation site. The site assessment will be reviewed and validated by an independent
      central rater. The review will include the clinical history of MDD, SSRI/SNRI treatment of
      adequate dose and duration for the current episode of depression, and current symptom
      severity on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS17). Enrolled participants will be
      maintained on SSRI/SNRI treatment throughout the study to determine whether additional
      treatment with JNJ-4216579 can reduce the symptoms of MDD with anxious distress.The study
      will consist of 3 phases: a Screening Phase of up to 4 weeks, an 11-week double-blind
      Treatment Phase, and a 3-week post-treatment (follow up) Phase. The double-blind treatment
      Phase of the trial will consist of 3 periods. The first period is a placebo lead-in of
      double-blind duration, after which participants will enter the treatment period when they
      will be randomly assigned to JNJ-42165279 or continuation on placebo for 6 weeks.
      Participants who successfully complete the treatment period prior to the end of Week 11, will
      be treated with placebo for the remaining time of the double-blind phase of the study, which
      will vary depending on the duration of the placebo lead-in for the specific participant. The
      total study duration for each participant will be approximately 18 weeks. Efficacy and safety
      of JNJ-42165279 will be evaluated. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the
      study.

    <measure>Change from Baseline to Endpoint on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS17) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The HDRS17 is a clinician-administered rating scale designed to assess the severity of symptoms in participants diagnosed with depression with a score range of 0 to 52. Questions are related to symptoms such as depressed mood, guilt feelings, suicide, sleep disturbances, anxiety levels and weight loss. The higher the score, the more severe the depression.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline to Endpoint on the Hamilton Anxiety Rating scale (HAM-A6) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The HAM-A6 is a 6-item subscale derived from the original Hamilton Anxiety scale (HAM-A). The rating scale measures the severity of anxiety symptomatology. Higher scores represent more severe anxiety symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline to Endpoint on the SIGH-A (Structured Interview Guide of the Hamilton Anxiety Scale 14-item HAM-A) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The (HAM-A) is a 14-item scale designed to measure anxiety in individuals. Each question reflects a symptom of anxiety and physical as well as mental symptoms are represented. The answers range from 0 which signifies a complete lack of that symptom to 4, which indicates a very severe show of anxiety with that symptom.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline to Endpoint on the Hamilton Anxiety Rating scale (HAM-D6) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The HAM-D6 is a 6-item subscale derived from the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS17). The rating scale measures the severity of depressive symptomatology. Higher scores represent more severe depressive symptoms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline to Endpoint in the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS17) Anxiety/Somatization Factor Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The anxiety/somatization factor total score derived from HDRS scale. It includes six items from the original 17-item version: psychic anxiety, somatic anxiety, gastrointestinal somatic symptoms, general somatic symptoms, hypochondriasis, and insight. The scale measures the severity of anxious depression. The higher the score, the more severe anxiety symptoms.</description>

    <time_frame>Pre-dose and 2 to 4 hours post-dose on Day 14, 35, 63 and 77</time_frame>
    <description>AUC(0-t) is the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from time 0 to Dosing Interval (t). AUC can be used as a measure of drug exposure. It is derived from drug concentration and time so it gives a measure how much and how long a drug stays in a body.</description>
