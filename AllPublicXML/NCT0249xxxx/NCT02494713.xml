  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study for men who have locally-advanced prostate cancer and are eligible to undergo
      prostatectomy. Standard treatment is prostatectomy alone, but there is a chance that cancer
      may spread to other organs in the future, even after the prostate is removed. If this were to
      occur, standard treatment would be androgen deprivation therapy (ADT; hormone therapy that
      blocks testosterone) plus chemotherapy. Clinical trials suggest that neoadjuvant treatment
      (treatment given before primary therapy) may prevent a recurrence. The purpose of this
      research study is to assess the safety and benefit of ADT plus chemotherapy given before
      prostate removal.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-arm study of neoadjuvant ADT and chemotherapy in subjects with
      non-metastatic, locally-advanced prostate cancer who are eligible for radical prostatectomy.

      Patients will be treated with 4 monthly injections of degarelix along with two 8-week cycles
      of chemotherapy. Each cycle of chemotherapy will consist of 6 weeks of chemotherapy and 2
      weeks of rest. In the absence of toxicity or disease progression, patients will receive 2
      cycles of treatment prior to radical prostatectomy.

      The primary endpoint will be complete or near-complete pathologic response.

      Safety will be assessed on any patient receiving at least one dose of study drug by the
      reporting of adverse events, vital signs and by the assessment of findings on physical exam
      and routine safety laboratory determinations. The severity of adverse events and certain
      abnormal laboratory findings will be assessed according to the NCI CTCAE V4.03.

      Laboratory-based studies will evaluate the following:

        -  Complete metabolic profile

           o BUN, creatinine, alkaline phosphatase, ALT/AST, total bilirubin, LDH, calcium,
           albumin, glucose, magnesium, uric acid, phosphorous

        -  Electrolytes

           o Sodium, potassium, chloride, CO2 content

        -  Hematology

             -  CBC with differential, platelet count

             -  PT, INR, PTT

        -  Testosterone

        -  Biomarkers

             -  PSA

             -  CTCs
