  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to conduct a randomized controlled trial with English and
      Spanish-speaking adolescents to compare the effectiveness of an adolescent &quot;asthma question
      prompt list&quot; with a supportive educational video intervention with usual care.

      The hypothesis of this study is that by showing the parents and adolescents the educational
      video and then providing the adolescents with the one-page &quot;asthma question prompt lists&quot; to
      use during their visits will improve: (a) asthma control, (b) adolescent self-efficacy in
      managing asthma, and (c) adolescent quality-of-life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study uses a randomized controlled trial design stratified by provider to assess the
      impact of an adolescent &quot;asthma question prompt list&quot; combined with a supportive educational
      video emphasizing the importance of adolescent involvement and question-asking on
      communication during pediatric visits. This application is based on Social Cognitive Theory.
      Self-confidence or self-efficacy is a central component of Social Cognitive Theory (SCT)
      Application of Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) in asthma populations has shown that technical
      advice from providers is one external factor that can improve asthma management
      self-efficacy. Additionally, personal beliefs, such as outcome expectations, and family
      factors, such as parent and adolescent responsibility for asthma self-management, have been
      shown to affect adolescent self-efficacy and disease management outcomes. Prior work has
      found that adolescent self-efficacy in asthma management correlates strongly with health
      status, adherence, asthma medication device technique, asthma symptoms, and impact of illness
      on the family.

      All adolescents will have their medical visits audio recorded. The adolescent will be
      interviewed after his/her medical visit while his/her caregiver/parent completes a survey at
      the time of study enrollment. This same procedure will be used when the adolescent and
      caregiver/parents return for the 6- and 12-month follow-up visits.

    <time_frame>12 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>This will be measured via the 5-item Asthma Control Test, responses are summed to indicate a score ranging from 5 (poor asthma control) to 25 (complete asthma control). A higher score means a better outcome. A score of above 19 is considered &quot;well controlled&quot;.</description>

    <measure>Adolescent Asthma Management Self-efficacy Score</measure>
    <time_frame>12 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Adolescent asthma management self-efficacy was measured using a 14-item scale that has been shown to have a reliability of 0.87. Prior work in asthma has found asthma management self-efficacy to change in response to an intervention. Scores range from 14 to 70 and a higher score means a better outcome.</description>

    <measure>Asthma Quality-of-life Score</measure>
    <time_frame>12 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Adolescent quality-of-life was measured as a continuous variable. The investigators used the standardized version of the Juniper pediatric asthma quality-of-life questionnaire. The questionnaire contains 23 items and has a reliability of 0.84. Scores can range from 1.0 to 7.0, and a higher score means a better outcome.</description>
