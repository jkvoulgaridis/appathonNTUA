    <textblock>
      Masitinib is a selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is thought to promote survival via
      modulation of immunostimulation-mediated anticancer effects and modulation of the tumor
      microenvironment. The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      masitinib in combination with gemcitabine as compared with single agent gemcitabine in
      advanced or metastatic epithelial ovarian cancer patients who are refractory to platinum
      treatment. This is an open-label, randomized, active-controlled, phase 2/3 study. The study's
      primary efficacy measure will be overall survival. Masitinib will be prescribed until disease
      progression (or treatment switch to next line of treatment), death, limiting toxicity or
      patient consent withdrawal. The study design is a two-stage adaptive design, meaning that it
      includes a prospectively planned opportunity for modification of one or more specified
      aspects of the study (for example patient enrollment).

    <description>Progression Free Survival (PFS) [Time Frame: From day of randomization to disease progression or death, assessed for a maximum of 60 months] Progression Free Survival is defined as the time from the randomization date until the date of earliest evidence of disease progression or death, for participants who progressed or died before subsequent cancer therapy. Disease progression will be assessed by CT scan according to RECIST criteria recommendations.</description>

        Main inclusion criteria:

          1. Female patient, with histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced / metastatic
             epithelial ovarian cancer (including primary peritoneal and primary fallopian tube
             cancer), which is either:

               -  First line platinum-refractory ovarian cancer (progression during first-line
                  platinum-based chemotherapy)

               -  First line platinum-resistant ovarian cancer (relapsing within 6 months after the
                  end of first-line chemotherapy);

               -  Candidate to third line of treatment (refractory, resistant, or sensitive to 2nd
                  line platinum-based therapy or patients who progressed after other type of
                  chemotherapy in 2nd line).

          2. Patient with adequate organ function per laboratory tests evaluations

        Main exclusion criteria:

          1. Patient intolerant to gemcitabine

          2. Patient who has not recovered from any significant treatment toxicities prior to
             baseline (≥Grade 2)

          3. Pregnant or nursing female patient
