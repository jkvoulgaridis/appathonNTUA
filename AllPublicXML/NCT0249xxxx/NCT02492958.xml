        <description>Systemic reactions included fever, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, fatigue, muscle and joint pain (other than at the injection site) and recorded by using an e-diary. Fever was graded as 37.5 to 38.4 degree Celsius (C), 38.5 to 38.9 degree C, 39.0 to 40.0 degree C and greater than (&gt;) 40.0 degree C. Vomiting was graded as mild (1-2 times in 24 hours), moderate (&gt;2 times in 24 hours) and severe (required intravenous hydration). Diarrhea was graded as mild (2-3 loose stools in 24 hours), moderate (4-5 loose stools in 24 hours) and severe (&gt;=6 loose stools in 24 hours). Headache, fatigue, muscle pain and joint pain were graded as mild (no interference with activity), moderate (some interference with activity) and severe (significant, prevented daily activity).

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAE) Reported After Day 29 Visit Through Month 12</title>
        <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received investigational product without regard to possibility of causal relationship. SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly or deemed medically significant for any other reason. A treatment emergent AE was defined as an event that emerged during the study that was absent before administration of investigational product, or worsened relative to the pre-administration state. AEs reported during this time period included both SAEs and newly diagnosed chronic medical disorders (NDCMD). A NDCMD was defined as a disease or medical condition that was not identified prior to study start and was expected to be persistent or otherwise long-lasting in its effects.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAE) Reported After Day 29 Visit Through Month 12</title>
          <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received investigational product without regard to possibility of causal relationship. SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly or deemed medically significant for any other reason. A treatment emergent AE was defined as an event that emerged during the study that was absent before administration of investigational product, or worsened relative to the pre-administration state. AEs reported during this time period included both SAEs and newly diagnosed chronic medical disorders (NDCMD). A NDCMD was defined as a disease or medical condition that was not identified prior to study start and was expected to be persistent or otherwise long-lasting in its effects.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants With Coagulation Abnormalities at Day 5</title>
          <description>Coagulation analysis included the following parameters: prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), platelet aggregation (AGG) (with adenosine diphosphate [ADP], with arachidonic acid, and with collagen) and fibrinogen activity. PT and APTT were scaled as Grade 1= mild; Grade 2= moderate; Grade 3= severe; or Grade 4. Coagulation abnormality was defined as at least 1 grade abnormal value for PT and APTT, and deviation from local laboratory range for platelet aggregation assay and fibrinogen activity assay. Percentage of participants with abnormal values in coagulation parameters are reported in this outcome measure.</description>
          <population>Safety population included all participants who received at least 1 dose of investigational product and had safety data available after vaccination. Here N signifies number of participants who were evaluable for this outcome measure.</population>

        <title>Antigen-specific Competitive Luminex Immunoassay (cLIA) Geometric Mean Titers (GMTs)</title>
        <description>Geometric mean titer is commonly used to assess the immunogenicity of vaccine. Antibody GMTs as measured by cLIA for ClfA and MntC and corresponding 2-sided 95 percent (%) confidence intervals (CIs) were evaluated. CIs were computed by back transforming the CIs generated for means of the titers on the log scale based on the Student t distribution.</description>

        <description>Geometric mean titer is commonly used to assess the immunogenicity of vaccine. Antibody GMTs as measured by OPA for CP5 and CP8 and corresponding 2-sided 95 percent CIs were evaluated. CIs were computed by back transforming the CIs generated for means of the titers on the log scale based on the Student t distribution.</description>

        <title>Geometric Mean Fold Rise (GMFR) for Staphylococcus Aureus Antigen-specific cLIA Titers From Baseline to Day 11, 15, 29 and Month 3</title>
        <description>GMFRs of anti-Staphylococcus aureus cLIA for ClfA and MntC were computed. CIs which are reported below were computed by back transforming the CIs generated for the mean fold rise on the log scale based on the Student t distribution. GMFRs were computed as the fold rise in titer value at specified time point compared to baseline.</description>

        <description>GMFR of anti-Staphylococcus aureus FBI for ClfA was computed. CIs which are reported below were computed by back transforming the CIs generated for the mean fold rise on the log scale based on the Student t distribution. GMFRs were computed as the fold rise in titer value at specified time point compared to baseline.</description>
