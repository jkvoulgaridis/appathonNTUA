  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to provide continued access to rilpivirine (RPV) for
      participants who were treated with RPV in a clinical development pediatric study with
      rilpivirine and who, at the time of roll-over, experience and are expected to continue
      experiencing clinical benefit from RPV treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), multicenter (more
      than one hospital or clinical site work on a study), roll-over study to provide continued
      access to RPV for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infected participants. All
      enrolled participants will continue to receive RPV in combination with an
      investigator-selected background regimen consisting of other antiretrovirals (ARVs).
      Participants will continue to receive RPV in this study until one of the following criteria
      is met (whichever comes first) as determined in the study protocol: they meet at least one of
      the withdrawal criteria, or the participant has been treated in this roll-over study for 4
      years (48 months) or older than 12 years of age and can continue RPV treatment outside of
      this roll-over study by switching to locally available RPV (if commercially available and
      reimbursed, or accessible through another source [example: access program or government
      program]) or other locally available RPV-based regimens.
