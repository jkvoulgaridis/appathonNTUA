    <textblock>
      This Phase 3 pivotal efficacy trial will examine the effects of HLD200 (methylphenidate) in
      patients aged 6-12 years with ADHD in a laboratory classroom setting. This study has a 6-week
      open-label treatment optimization period followed by a one week randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled test phase.

    <measure>Swanson, Kotkin, Agler, M-Flynn and Pelham Combined Score (SKAMP CS) - Model-adjusted Average of All Post-dose Time Points Assessed During a Laboratory Classroom Test Day (Visit 9).</measure>
    <time_frame>12-hours from 8:00 am to 8:00 pm</time_frame>
    <description>The SKAMP is a validated, 13-item, observer-rated scale designed to assess the level of impairment of classroom-observed behaviors (Wigal and Wigal, 2006). Items 1 through 4 assess subject attention; items 5 through 8 assess deportment; items 9 through 11 assess quality of work; while items 12 and 13 assess subject compliance with teacher/classroom rules. Each individual item is rated on a 7-point scale from 0 (normal, no impairment) to 6 (maximal impairment). When all individual item scores are summed together, they produce a 13-item combined score that ranges from 0 to 78, with higher scores signifying greater impairment. In the present study, the SKAMP rating scale was utilized across 9 sessions occuring at 8:00 am, 9:00 am, 10:00 am, 12:00 pm, 2:00 pm, 4:00 pm, 6:00 pm, 7:00 pm, and 8:00 pm of the laboratory classroom day. Successful training of qualified individuals on the SKAMP scale was required before raters were allowed to perform study assessments.</description>

    <measure>Parent Rating of Evening and Morning Behavior Revised, Morning Subscale (PREMB-R AM).</measure>
    <time_frame>PREMB-R AM mean subscale score for the 2-days prior to Visit 9.</time_frame>
    <description>The PREMB-R is an 11-item rating scale designed to assess at-home functional impairments in children with ADHD during both early morning (AM) and late afternoon/evening (PM) time periods. With demonstrated validity and reliablility (Faraone et al., 2015), the AM subscale total score (sum of items 1 to 3) was designated in this study as a key secondary endpoint. Items are scored from 0 (none) to 3 (a lot), with higher scores signifying greater impairment of function. The PREMB-R rating scale was completed by parents during the 2-days prior to study visits at the beginning and end of the open-label period (Visits 2 and 8, respectively), as well as at the end of the randomized, double-blind period (Visit 9). At each visit, these ratings were used only for review by the clinician (MD, PhD, DO, licensed social worker, or any trained mental health professional approved by the sponsor) as part of a structured interview to enable collection of a clinician-rated PREMB-R AM subscale score.</description>

             study and study-related procedures.

          2. Serious structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious heart rhythm

             study-related procedures.

          5. Active suicidal ideation as evidenced by an ideation score of 2 or greater on the

        <title>Swanson, Kotkin, Agler, M-Flynn and Pelham Combined Score (SKAMP CS) - Model-adjusted Average of All Post-dose Time Points Assessed During a Laboratory Classroom Test Day (Visit 9).</title>
        <description>The SKAMP is a validated, 13-item, observer-rated scale designed to assess the level of impairment of classroom-observed behaviors (Wigal and Wigal, 2006). Items 1 through 4 assess subject attention; items 5 through 8 assess deportment; items 9 through 11 assess quality of work; while items 12 and 13 assess subject compliance with teacher/classroom rules. Each individual item is rated on a 7-point scale from 0 (normal, no impairment) to 6 (maximal impairment). When all individual item scores are summed together, they produce a 13-item combined score that ranges from 0 to 78, with higher scores signifying greater impairment. In the present study, the SKAMP rating scale was utilized across 9 sessions occuring at 8:00 am, 9:00 am, 10:00 am, 12:00 pm, 2:00 pm, 4:00 pm, 6:00 pm, 7:00 pm, and 8:00 pm of the laboratory classroom day. Successful training of qualified individuals on the SKAMP scale was required before raters were allowed to perform study assessments.</description>

        <title>Parent Rating of Evening and Morning Behavior Revised, Morning Subscale (PREMB-R AM).</title>
        <description>The PREMB-R is an 11-item rating scale designed to assess at-home functional impairments in children with ADHD during both early morning (AM) and late afternoon/evening (PM) time periods. With demonstrated validity and reliablility (Faraone et al., 2015), the AM subscale total score (sum of items 1 to 3) was designated in this study as a key secondary endpoint. Items are scored from 0 (none) to 3 (a lot), with higher scores signifying greater impairment of function. The PREMB-R rating scale was completed by parents during the 2-days prior to study visits at the beginning and end of the open-label period (Visits 2 and 8, respectively), as well as at the end of the randomized, double-blind period (Visit 9). At each visit, these ratings were used only for review by the clinician (MD, PhD, DO, licensed social worker, or any trained mental health professional approved by the sponsor) as part of a structured interview to enable collection of a clinician-rated PREMB-R AM subscale score.</description>

    <reported_events>
      <time_frame>Adverse events were collected across the duration of the study (up to 13-weeks). However, an adverse event is considered treatment-emergent during the randomized, placebo-controlled phase only if it started on or after the first dose of double-blind study medication, but before the last dose of double blind study medication plus 72 hours as reflected in the table below.</time_frame>
      <desc>Adverse events were recorded by study staff at every post-screening study visit based on spontaneous report from subjects/parents, regardless of causality. However, sleep-related adverse event were directly solicited from subjects/parents by study staff using a structured interview format to assessing sleep disturbances (e.g., issues with sleep onset, quality and quantity), rather than obtained from spontaneous reporting.</desc>
