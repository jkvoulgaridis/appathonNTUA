  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the effectiveness of aquatic therapy on a range of MS-related
      symptoms such as cognition, mood, fatigue and quality of life (QOL).

      Aim 1. Examine the impact of aquatic exercise on cognitive abilities. The proposed study will
      test the hypotheses that, compared to the wait-list control group, the treatment group will
      demonstrate significantly greater improvements in cognitive outcomes, specifically:
      processing speed, executive functioning, working memory and long-term memory.

      Aim 2. The current study will examine the impact of an aquatic exercise on fatigue, mood,
      wellness, QOL and physical functioning. Specifically the investigators predict that aquatic
      exercise will lead to improvements in: 1.Fatigue 2. Health related QOL 3. Depression/anxiety
      4. Self-efficacy 5. Physical Functioning (i.e. gait and walking).

      Aim 3: Examine the long-term effects of aquatic exercise on all outcome measures.

    <description>The treatment group will participate in an eight week aquatic exercise program during weeks 2-9 of the study. The aquatic exercise program will consist of 45 minute classes held 3 days/week for 8 weeks (18 hours total). The program is based on guidelines provided by the National Multiple Sclerosis Society (NMSS) and will be led by an aquatic fitness instructor certified to teach individuals with MS at the YMCA in Randolph, NJ.. The exercises will focus on improving flexibility, balance and strength. Equipment such as water mitts, paddles, noodles and bands will be used to increase the level of difficulty as needed.</description>
