    <textblock>
      The purpose of the protocol is to demonstrate the safety and the efficacy of a single
      injection of a new formulation of Clostridium Botulinum toxin type A haemagglutinin complex
      (BTX A HAC NG) to improve the appearance of moderate to severe glabellar lines (the lines
      between the eyebrows) and to assess the long term efficacy and safety of BTX-A-HAC NG after
      repeated injections.

    <textblock>
      This is a multicentre study conducted in two periods. Subjects will first be enrolled to
      enter the double blind (DB) period Cycle 1. Subjects who are eligible for retreatment will
      then be offered to enter open label (OL) Cycles 2 to 5 as DB roll-over subjects. Once
      recruitment of the DB period is complete, the study will enrol additional BTX-naïve subjects
      (hereafter referred to as OL de novo subjects) into the OL period Cycle 1. All OL de novo
      subjects who are eligible for retreatment will also be offered to enter OL Cycles 2 to 5. A
      total of 580 subjects (180 subjects randomised in the DB period and an additional 400 de novo
      subjects in the OL period) are planned to complete the study.

        <title>The Percentage of Responders at Day 29 Cycle 1 as Measured by Investigator's Live Assessment (ILA) of Glabellar Lines at Maximum Frown: DB Period</title>
        <description>The appearance of glabellar lines at maximum frown was assessed in the DB period at the Day 29 follow-up visit using the ILA, a validated 4-point photographic scale of glabellar line severity. A responder was defined as having a severity grade of none (Grade 0) or mild (Grade 1) at a given visit and a severity grade of moderate (Grade 2) or severe (Grade 3) at baseline (Day 1 Cycle 1). The adjusted percentage of responders (determined by multivariate logistic regression analysis) at Day 29 of Cycle 1 is presented.</description>

        <title>The Percentage of Responders on Day 29 Cycle 1 Who Remained Responders on Days 57 and 85 as Measured by the ILA at Maximum Frown: DB Period</title>
        <description>The appearance of glabellar lines at maximum frown was assessed in the DB period at post treatment follow-up visits using the ILA, a validated 4-point photographic scale of glabellar line severity. A responder was defined as having a severity grade of none (Grade 0) or mild (Grade 1) at a given visit and a severity grade of moderate (Grade 2) or severe (Grade 3) at baseline (Day 1 Cycle 1). The percentage of responders (unadjusted) at Day 29 of Cycle 1 who still fulfilled the criteria for a responder at Days 57 and 85 is presented.</description>

        <title>The Percentage of Responders at Each Post-treatment Visit to the Study Centre as Measured by the Subject's Self-Assessment (SSA) at Maximum Frown: DB Period</title>
        <description>The appearance of glabellar lines at maximum frown was assessed using the SSA, a validated 4-point categorical scale of glabellar line severity, in the DB period at post-treatment follow-up visits. A responder was defined as having a severity grade of no wrinkles (Grade 0) or mild wrinkles (Grade 1) at maximum frown at a given visit and a severity grade of moderate (Grade 2) or severe (Grade 3) wrinkles at baseline (Day 1 Cycle 1). The adjusted percentage of responders (determined by multivariate logistic regression analysis) at Days 8, 29, 57 and 85 of Cycle 1 is presented.</description>

        <title>The Median Time to Onset of Treatment Response Based on the Subject's Diary Card: DB Period</title>
        <description>Subjects were asked to record their assessment of study treatment response on a diary card on Days 1 to 7 at approximately the same time each day. Subjects were asked to respond 'yes' or 'no' to the following question: 'Since being injected have you noticed an improvement in the appearance of your glabellar lines (lines between your eyebrows)?' The time to onset of response was defined as the first day the subject responded 'yes' to this question.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline at All Post-treatment Visits in the FACE-Q Satisfaction With Facial Appearance Overall Scale: DB Period</title>
        <description>FACE-Q is a subject-reported outcome instrument to evaluate the experience and outcomes of aesthetic facial procedures from the subject's perspective. One of three scales that was selected for this study was the satisfaction with facial appearance overall scale. This consisted of 10 items with 4 possible answers for each: 1 (Very Dissatisfied), 2 (Somewhat Dissatisfied), 3 (Somewhat Satisfied) and 4 (Very Satisfied). The least squares mean change from baseline at post-treatment visits of Rasch transformed scores is presented. The Rasch transformed score was calculated by adding the 10 items (scored from 1 to 4) and converting the score to a scale from 0 (most dissatisfied) to 100 (most satisfied) using a conversion table.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline at All Post-treatment Visits in the FACE-Q Psychological Well-being Scale: DB Period</title>
        <description>FACE-Q is a subject-reported outcome instrument to evaluate the experience and outcomes of aesthetic facial procedures from the subject's perspective. One of three scales that was selected for this study was the psychological well-being scale. This consisted of 10 items with 4 possible answers for each: 1 (Definitely disagree), 2 (Somewhat disagree), 3 (Somewhat agree) and 4 (Definitely agree). The least squares mean change from baseline at post-treatment visits of Rasch transformed scores is presented. The Rasch transformed score was calculated by adding the 10 items (scored from 1 to 4) and converting the score to a scale from 0 (worst) to 100 (best) using a conversion table.</description>

            <description>During the DB period, subjects were randomised to receive a single treatment of BTX-A-HAC solution 50 U.
50 U (0.25 mL) BTX-A-HAC was administered as five injections of 10 U (0.05 mL) each into one of five predefined sites across the glabellar region.
Subjects who completed the DB treatment (Cycle 1) were eligible to continue to the OL period to receive further BTX-A-HAC treatment.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline at All Post-treatment Visits in the FACE-Q Aging Appearance Appraisal Visual Analogue Scale (VAS): DB Period</title>
        <description>FACE-Q is a subject-reported outcome instrument to evaluate the experience and outcomes of aesthetic facial procedures from the subject's perspective. One of three scales that was selected for this study was the aging appearance appraisal VAS. The VAS ranged from -15 ('I look 15 years younger') to +15 ('I look 15 years older'), with 0 indicating 'I look my age'. Subjects were asked to circle one number on the VAS indicating how many years younger or older they thought they looked compared to their actual age, with lower scores indicating a better outcome and higher scores a worse outcome. The least squares mean change from baseline at post-treatment visits is presented.</description>

        <title>The Percentage of Responders at Each Post-treatment Visit as Measured by the ILA at Maximum Frown: LT Analyses</title>
        <description>The appearance of glabellar lines at maximum frown was assessed in the OL period at post-treatment follow-up visits using the ILA, a validated 4-point photographic scale of glabellar line severity. A responder was defined as having a severity grade of none (Grade 0) or mild (Grade 1) at a given visit and a severity grade of moderate (Grade 2) or severe (Grade 3) at baseline. The cycle baseline was defined as the last measurement collected prior to the study treatment injection of the corresponding cycle. The percentage of responders (unadjusted) at each post-treatment visit for Cycles 1 to 5 is presented. Cycle 1 corresponds to the first administration of BTX-A-HAC solution and includes the DB Cycle 1 of subjects who were treated with BTX-A-HAC solution, the Cycle 1 of de novo subjects and Cycle 2 of subjects who were randomised to receive placebo in the DB period.</description>

Each treatment cycle included a single treatment with 50 U (0.25 mL) BTX-A-HAC administered as five injections of 10 U (0.05 mL) each into one of five predefined sites across the glabellar region, and treatments were separated by at least 12 weeks.</description>

        <title>The Percentage of Responders at Each Post-treatment Visit as Measured by the ILA at Rest: LT Analyses</title>
        <description>The appearance of glabellar lines at rest was assessed in the OL period at post-treatment follow-up visits using the ILA, a validated 4-point photographic scale of glabellar line severity. A responder was defined as having a severity grade of none (Grade 0) or mild (Grade 1) at a given visit and a severity grade of moderate (Grade 2) or severe (Grade 3) at baseline. The cycle baseline was defined as the last measurement collected prior to the study treatment injection of the corresponding cycle. The percentage of responders (unadjusted) at each post-treatment visit for Cycles 1 to 5 is presented. Cycle 1 corresponds to the first administration of BTX-A-HAC solution and includes the DB Cycle 1 of subjects who were treated with BTX-A-HAC solution, the Cycle 1 of de novo subjects and Cycle 2 of subjects who were randomised to receive placebo in the DB period.</description>
        <time_frame>Days 8, 29, 57 and 85 of Cycles 1 - 5 (up to 15 months).</time_frame>
        <population>The LTA population consisted of all subjects included in the DB period or as de novo subjects in the OL period who received at least one injection of BTX-A-HAC solution in the OL period. Only subjects with data available at the timepoints of testing are presented.</population>

            <title>BTX-A-HAC Solution 50 U - LT Analyses</title>
            <description>Eligible subjects who completed the DB Cycle 1 treatment were able to receive further treatment in the OL period (OL Cycles 2 to 5). Additional BTX-naïve (de novo) subjects were enrolled into the OL period to receive treatment with BTX-A-HAC during OL Cycle 1, and if eligible for retreatment de novo subjects received retreatment in OL Cycles 2 to 5.
Each treatment cycle included a single treatment with 50 U (0.25 mL) BTX-A-HAC administered as five injections of 10 U (0.05 mL) each into one of five predefined sites across the glabellar region, and treatments were separated by at least 12 weeks.</description>

        <title>The Percentage of Responders at Each Post-treatment Visit as Measured by the SSA at Maximum Frown: LT Analyses</title>
        <description>The appearance of glabellar lines at maximum frown was assessed using the SSA, a validated 4-point categorical scale of glabellar line severity, in the OL period at post-treatment follow-up visits. A responder was defined as having a severity grade of no wrinkles (Grade 0) or mild wrinkles (Grade 1) at maximum frown at a given visit and a severity grade of moderate (Grade 2) or severe (Grade 3) wrinkles at baseline. The cycle baseline was defined as the last measurement collected prior to the study treatment injection of the corresponding cycle. The percentage of responders (unadjusted) at each post-treatment visit for Cycles 1 to 5 is presented. Cycle 1 corresponds to the first administration of BTX-A-HAC solution and includes the DB Cycle 1 of subjects who were treated with BTX-A-HAC solution, the Cycle 1 of de novo subjects and Cycle 2 of subjects who were randomised to receive placebo in the DB period.</description>
        <time_frame>Days 8, 29, 57 and 85 of Cycles 1 - 5 (up to 15 months).</time_frame>
        <population>The LTA population consisted of all subjects included in the DB period or as de novo subjects in the OL period who received at least one injection of BTX-A-HAC solution in the OL period. Only subjects with data available at the timepoints of testing are presented.</population>

            <description>Eligible subjects who completed the DB Cycle 1 treatment were able to receive further treatment in the OL period (OL Cycles 2 to 5). Additional BTX-naïve (de novo) subjects were enrolled into the OL period to receive treatment with BTX-A-HAC during OL Cycle 1, and if eligible for retreatment de novo subjects received retreatment in OL Cycles 2 to 5.
Each treatment cycle included a single treatment with 50 U (0.25 mL) BTX-A-HAC administered as five injections of 10 U (0.05 mL) each into one of five predefined sites across the glabellar region, and treatments were separated by at least 12 weeks.</description>

        <title>The Percentage of Responders at Each Post-treatment Visit to the Study Centre as Measured by the Subject's Level of Satisfaction With the Appearance of Their Glabellar Lines: LT Analyses</title>
        <description>The subject's level of satisfaction with the appearance of their glabellar lines was assessed in the OL period at post-treatment follow-up visits of each treatment cycle using a 4-point categorical scale. A responder was defined as having a satisfaction rating of very satisfied (Grade 0) or satisfied (Grade 1) at a given visit and a satisfaction rating of dissatisfied (Grade 2) or very dissatisfied (Grade 3) at baseline. The cycle baseline was defined as the last measurement collected prior to the study treatment injection of the corresponding cycle. The percentage of responders (unadjusted) at each post-treatment visit for Cycles 1 to 5 is presented. Cycle 1 corresponds to the first administration of BTX-A-HAC solution and includes the DB Cycle 1 of subjects who were treated with BTX-A-HAC solution, the Cycle 1 of de novo subjects and Cycle 2 of subjects who were randomised to receive placebo in the DB period.</description>
        <time_frame>Days 8, 29, 57 and 85 of Cycles 1 - 5 (up to 15 months).</time_frame>
        <population>The LTA population consisted of all subjects included in the DB period or as de novo subjects in the OL period who received at least one injection of BTX-A-HAC solution in the OL period. Only subjects with data available at the timepoints of testing are presented.</population>

            <description>Eligible subjects who completed the DB Cycle 1 treatment were able to receive further treatment in the OL period (OL Cycles 2 to 5). Additional BTX-naïve (de novo) subjects were enrolled into the OL period to receive treatment with BTX-A-HAC during OL Cycle 1, and if eligible for retreatment de novo subjects received retreatment in OL Cycles 2 to 5.
Each treatment cycle included a single treatment with 50 U (0.25 mL) BTX-A-HAC administered as five injections of 10 U (0.05 mL) each into one of five predefined sites across the glabellar region, and treatments were separated by at least 12 weeks.</description>

        <title>Median Time to Retreatment in LT Analysis</title>
        <description>The median time to onset of the next eligible treatment cycle is presented for Cycles 1 to 4.
Cycle 1 corresponds to the first administration of BTX-A-HAC solution and includes the DB Cycle 1 of subjects who were treated with BTX-A-HAC solution, the Cycle 1 of de novo subjects and Cycle 2 of subjects who were randomised to receive placebo in the DB period.
Subjects who were not subsequently retreated after a given cycle were excluded from the summary of time to retreatment at that cycle.</description>
        <time_frame>Cycles 1 - 4 (up to 12 months).</time_frame>
        <population>The LTA population consisted of all subjects included in the DB period or as de novo subjects in the OL period who received at least one injection of BTX-A-HAC solution in the OL period. Only subjects with data available at the timepoints of testing are presented.</population>

            <title>BTX-A-HAC Solution 50 U - LT Analyses</title>
            <description>Eligible subjects who completed the DB Cycle 1 treatment were able to receive further treatment in the OL period (OL Cycles 2 to 5). Additional BTX-naïve (de novo) subjects were enrolled into the OL period to receive treatment with BTX-A-HAC during OL Cycle 1, and if eligible for retreatment de novo subjects received retreatment in OL Cycles 2 to 5.
Each treatment cycle included a single treatment with 50 U (0.25 mL) BTX-A-HAC administered as five injections of 10 U (0.05 mL) each into one of five predefined sites across the glabellar region, and treatments were separated by at least 12 weeks.</description>

          <title>Median Time to Retreatment in LT Analysis</title>
          <description>The median time to onset of the next eligible treatment cycle is presented for Cycles 1 to 4.
Cycle 1 corresponds to the first administration of BTX-A-HAC solution and includes the DB Cycle 1 of subjects who were treated with BTX-A-HAC solution, the Cycle 1 of de novo subjects and Cycle 2 of subjects who were randomised to receive placebo in the DB period.
Subjects who were not subsequently retreated after a given cycle were excluded from the summary of time to retreatment at that cycle.</description>
          <population>The LTA population consisted of all subjects included in the DB period or as de novo subjects in the OL period who received at least one injection of BTX-A-HAC solution in the OL period. Only subjects with data available at the timepoints of testing are presented.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline at All Post-treatment Visits in the FACE-Q Satisfaction With Facial Appearance Overall Scale: LT Analyses</title>
        <description>FACE-Q is a subject-reported outcome instrument to evaluate the experience and outcomes of aesthetic facial procedures from the subject's perspective. One of three scales that was selected for this study was the satisfaction with facial appearance overall scale. This consisted of 10 items with 4 possible answers for each: 1 (Very Dissatisfied), 2 (Somewhat Dissatisfied), 3 (Somewhat Satisfied) and 4 (Very Satisfied). The mean change from baseline at post-treatment visits of Rasch transformed scores is presented. The Rasch transformed score was calculated by adding the 10 items (scored from 1 to 4) and converting the score to a scale from 0 (most dissatisfied) to 100 (most satisfied) using a conversion table.</description>

            <description>Eligible subjects who completed the DB Cycle 1 treatment were able to receive further treatment in the OL period (OL Cycles 2 to 5). Additional BTX-naïve (de novo) subjects were enrolled into the OL period to receive treatment with BTX-A-HAC during OL Cycle 1, and if eligible for retreatment de novo subjects received retreatment in OL Cycles 2 to 5.
Each treatment cycle included a single treatment with 50 U (0.25 mL) BTX-A-HAC administered as five injections of 10 U (0.05 mL) each into one of five predefined sites across the glabellar region, and treatments were separated by at least 12 weeks.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline at All Post-treatment Visits in the FACE-Q Psychological Well-being Scale: LT Analyses</title>
        <description>FACE-Q is a subject-reported outcome instrument to evaluate the experience and outcomes of aesthetic facial procedures from the subject's perspective. One of three scales that was selected for this study was the psychological well-being scale. This consisted of 10 items with 4 possible answers for each: 1 (Definitely disagree), 2 (Somewhat disagree), 3 (Somewhat agree) and 4 (Definitely agree). The mean change from baseline at post-treatment visits of Rasch transformed scores is presented. The Rasch transformed score was calculated by adding the 10 items (scored from 1 to 4) and converting the score to a scale from 0 (worst) to 100 (best) using a conversion table.</description>

        <population>The LTA population consisted of all subjects included in the DB period or as de novo subjects in the OL period who received at least one injection of BTX-A-HAC solution in the OL period. Only subjects with data available at the timepoints of testing are presented.</population>

            <description>Eligible subjects who completed the DB Cycle 1 treatment were able to receive further treatment in the OL period (OL Cycles 2 to 5). Additional BTX-naïve (de novo) subjects were enrolled into the OL period to receive treatment with BTX-A-HAC during OL Cycle 1, and if eligible for retreatment de novo subjects received retreatment in OL Cycles 2 to 5.
Each treatment cycle included a single treatment with 50 U (0.25 mL) BTX-A-HAC administered as five injections of 10 U (0.05 mL) each into one of five predefined sites across the glabellar region, and treatments were separated by at least 12 weeks.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline at All Post-treatment Visits in the FACE-Q Aging Appearance Appraisal VAS: LT Analyses</title>
        <description>FACE-Q is a subject-reported outcome instrument to evaluate the experience and outcomes of aesthetic facial procedures from the subject's perspective. One of three scales that was selected for this study was the aging appearance appraisal VAS. The VAS ranged from -15 ('I look 15 years younger') to +15 ('I look 15 years older'), with 0 indicating 'I look my age'. Subjects were asked to circle one number on the VAS indicating how many years younger or older they thought they looked compared to their actual age, with lower scores indicating a better outcome and higher scores a worse outcome. The mean change from baseline at post-treatment visits is presented.</description>

        <population>The LTA population consisted of all subjects included in the DB period or as de novo subjects in the OL period who received at least one injection of BTX-A-HAC solution in the OL period. Only subjects with data available at the timepoints of testing are presented.</population>

            <description>Eligible subjects who completed the DB Cycle 1 treatment were able to receive further treatment in the OL period (OL Cycles 2 to 5). Additional BTX-naïve (de novo) subjects were enrolled into the OL period to receive treatment with BTX-A-HAC during OL Cycle 1, and if eligible for retreatment de novo subjects received retreatment in OL Cycles 2 to 5.
Each treatment cycle included a single treatment with 50 U (0.25 mL) BTX-A-HAC administered as five injections of 10 U (0.05 mL) each into one of five predefined sites across the glabellar region, and treatments were separated by at least 12 weeks.</description>
