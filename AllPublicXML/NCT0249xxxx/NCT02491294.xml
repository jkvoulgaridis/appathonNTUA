      Fuel for Fun: Cooking with Kids Plus Parents and Play (FFF), is an integrated research,
      extension, and education project targeting 4th grade students. Its long-term goal of reducing
      the risk of childhood obesity will be addressed by promoting healthful food and activity
      environments, policies and behaviors through: 1) building and testing the efficacy of a 4th
      grade comprehensive school- and family-based intervention, 2) applying it to an after-school
      setting to broaden its reach, and, 3) disseminating both versions through outreach.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fuel for Fun: Cooking with Kids Plus Parents and Play (FFF) is based on existing,
      evidence-based components: the experiential Cooking with Kids curriculum, the SPARK Active
      Recreation program; principles of behavioral economics in school cafeterias and homes; the
      online About Eating 5-lesson module based on eating competence concepts, and a family-based
      FFF component specifically designed for this intervention.

      Each component addresses policy and environment in addition to behavior change at school and
      home. The main research project - school-based FFF - will be implemented in 8 low-to-moderate
      income schools for two years using an asynchronous design that allows for assessment of the
      school-based program alone and in combination with both parent programs. Changes in fruit and
      vegetable intake (measured by self-report, cafeteria plate waste) and activity levels
      (measured by self-report and accelerometry) are primary outcomes, with measured BMI as a
      secondary outcome. Subsequent studies will involve the development of an after-school version
      and adoption of FFF by other districts.

      University students will gain valuable research experience and school and Extension educators
      will receive important childhood obesity prevention training. The project's long term goal is
      consistent with the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) goal of improving the
      nation's nutrition and health by promoting the development of healthy eating and activity
      habits in children.

    <description>using a standard protocol, we will measure height and weight of all participating students and then calculate BMI z-scores</description>
