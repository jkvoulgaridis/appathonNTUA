Responses to each question range from 1 (severe problem) to 7 (normal health). Total IBDQ score is the sum of the responses to the individual IBDQ questions, and ranges from 32 to 224 with higher scores indicating a better quality of life.</description>

        <description>CDAI is used to assess the symptoms of participants with Crohn's Disease. Scores generally range from 0 to 600, where remission of Crohn's disease is defined as CDAI &lt; 150, and very severe disease is defined as CDAI &gt; 450.
The analysis over time was performed for the DB placebo-controlled period (Week 0 to Week 4), with comparisons between active treatment and placebo groups. The analysis over time was also performed for Any Adalimumab set (the entire study on or after the first dose of adalimumab), with only summary statistics for adalimumab treatment. (Note: the analysis window for the 'Any Adalimumab Set' is different from that used for the ITT population. For the Any Adalimumab Set, the Baseline Visit date is the date when the first dose of adalimumab was received, and was counted as Day 1 or Week 0.)</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved Clinical Remission (CDAI &lt; 150) Plus A Reduction in Hs-CRP of at Least 50% From Baseline Over Double-Blind Weeks 0-4</title>
        <description>CDAI is used to assess the symptoms of participants with Crohn's Disease. Scores generally range from 0 to 600, where remission of Crohn's disease is defined as CDAI &lt; 150, and very severe disease is defined as CDAI &gt; 450.
The analysis over time was performed for the DB placebo-controlled period (Week 0 to Week 4), with comparisons between active treatment and placebo groups. The analysis over time was also performed for Any Adalimumab set (the entire study on or after the first dose of adalimumab), with only summary statistics for adalimumab treatment.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved Clinical Response (Decrease in CDAI ≥ 70 Points From Baseline) Over Double-Blind Weeks 0-4</title>
        <description>CDAI is used to assess the symptoms of participants with Crohn's Disease. Scores generally range from 0 to 600, where remission of Crohn's disease is defined as CDAI &lt; 150, and very severe disease is defined as CDAI &gt; 450.
The analysis over time was performed for the DB placebo-controlled period (Week 0 to Week 4), with comparisons between active treatment and placebo groups. The analysis over time was also performed for Any Adalimumab set (the entire study on or after the first dose of adalimumab), with only summary statistics for adalimumab treatment.</description>

        <description>CDAI is used to assess the symptoms of participants with Crohn's Disease. Scores generally range from 0 to 600, where remission of Crohn's disease is defined as CDAI &lt; 150, and very severe disease is defined as CDAI &gt; 450.
The analysis over time was performed for the DB placebo-controlled period (Week 0 to Week 4), with comparisons between active treatment and placebo groups. The analysis over time was also performed for Any Adalimumab set (the entire study on or after the first dose of adalimumab), with only summary statistics for adalimumab treatment.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in CDAI Over Double-Blind Weeks 0-4</title>
        <description>CDAI is used to assess the symptoms of participants with Crohn's Disease. Scores generally range from 0 to 600, where remission of Crohn's disease is defined as CDAI &lt; 150, and very severe disease is defined as CDAI &gt; 450.
The analysis over time was performed for the DB placebo-controlled period (Week 0 to Week 4), with comparisons between active treatment and placebo groups. The analysis over time was also performed for Any Adalimumab set (the entire study on or after the first dose of adalimumab), with only summary statistics for adalimumab treatment.</description>
