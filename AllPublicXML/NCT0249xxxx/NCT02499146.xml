  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As part of the global clinical development program for Palbociclib, studies are planned in
      cancer patients in China. An assessment of Palbociclib pharmacokinetics in Chinese patients,
      as required by the Chinese Health Authorities, is therefore warranted. In addition, safety
      and efficacy will be also evaluated.

      The single and multiple 125 mg oral dose pharmacokinetics of Palbociclib will be
      characterized.

    <description>PFS was defined as the time from Cycle 1 Day 1 to date of first documentation of disease progression (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Documentation of progression was by objective disease assessment as defined by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor (RECIST) (version 1.1). Objective status of PD was defined as a &gt;=20% increase in the sum of diameters of target measurable lesions above the smallest sum observed (over baseline if no decrease in the sum was observed during therapy), with a minimum absolute increase of 5 mm; or unequivocal progression of pre-existing lesions for non-target disease; or appearance of new lesions.</description>

    <description>ORR was the percentage of participants with an objective response (complete response [CR] or partial response [PR]). Per RECIST (version 1.1), objective status of CR: target lesions and non-target diseases achieved CR, without new lesions; objective status of PR: target lesions achieved CR or PR while non-target diseases were non-CR/non-PD, indeterminate or missing, and without new lesions. For target lesions, CR: complete disappearance of all target lesions except nodal disease (target nodes must decrease to normal size); PR: &gt;=30% decrease under baseline of the sum of diameters of all target measurable lesions. For non-target diseases, CR: disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker levels; non-CR/non-PD: persistence of any non-target lesions and/or tumor marker level above the normal limits; Indeterminate: progression had not been determined and &gt;=1 non-target sites were not assessed or assessment methods were inconsistent with those used at baseline.</description>

The definitions for objective status of CR, PR, and PD per RECIST (version 1.1) can be found in the previous Outcome Measures. Per RECIST (version 1.1), objective status of SD: target lesions achieved SD (i.e., did not qualify for CR, PR or PD) while non-target diseases were assessed as non-CR/non-PD, indeterminate or missing, and there were no new lesions.</description>

    <description>The pRb was one of the skin biomarkers and samples were assayed using immunohistochemistry (IHC) method. Ratio over baseline was calculated by dividing the H-score value for pRb at each specified time point by baseline value. The H-score value, which could range from 0 to 300 (strongest expression) with higher score representing stronger expression, was calculated from the total of each individual intensity of staining (0 [negative], 1+ [weak], 2+ [moderate], 3+ [strong]) multiplied by the percentages of cells (0 to 100) that represented that staining.</description>

        <description>ORR was the percentage of participants with an objective response (complete response [CR] or partial response [PR]). Per RECIST (version 1.1), objective status of CR: target lesions and non-target diseases achieved CR, without new lesions; objective status of PR: target lesions achieved CR or PR while non-target diseases were non-CR/non-PD, indeterminate or missing, and without new lesions. For target lesions, CR: complete disappearance of all target lesions except nodal disease (target nodes must decrease to normal size); PR: &gt;=30% decrease under baseline of the sum of diameters of all target measurable lesions. For non-target diseases, CR: disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker levels; non-CR/non-PD: persistence of any non-target lesions and/or tumor marker level above the normal limits; Indeterminate: progression had not been determined and &gt;=1 non-target sites were not assessed or assessment methods were inconsistent with those used at baseline.</description>

        <description>The pRb was one of the skin biomarkers and samples were assayed using immunohistochemistry (IHC) method. Ratio over baseline was calculated by dividing the H-score value for pRb at each specified time point by baseline value. The H-score value, which could range from 0 to 300 (strongest expression) with higher score representing stronger expression, was calculated from the total of each individual intensity of staining (0 [negative], 1+ [weak], 2+ [moderate], 3+ [strong]) multiplied by the percentages of cells (0 to 100) that represented that staining.</description>
