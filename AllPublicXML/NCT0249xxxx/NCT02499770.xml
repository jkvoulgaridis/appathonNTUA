  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to investigate the potential clinical benefit of trilaciclib (G1T28) in
      preserving the bone marrow and the immune system, and enhancing chemotherapy antitumor
      efficacy when administered prior to carboplatin and etoposide in first line treatment for
      patients with newly diagnosed extensive-stage SCLC.

      The study consists of 2 parts: a limited open-label, dose-finding portion (Part 1), and a
      randomized double-blind portion (Part 2). Both parts include 3 study phases: Screening Phase,
      Treatment Phase, and Survival Follow-up Phase. The Treatment Phase begins on the day of first
      dose with study treatment and completes at the Post-Treatment Visit. Approximately, 90
      patients will be enrolled in the study; 20 patients in the Part 1 and 70 patients in the Part
      2 portion.

    <description>Severe (Grade 4) neutropenia was defined as at least 1 ANC value &lt;0.5 × 10^9/L during the treatment period. Within each cycle, the duration (days) of severe neutropenia was defined as the number of days from the date of the first ANC value of &lt;0.5 × 10^9/L observed between start of cycle and end of cycle to the date of the first ANC value ≥0.5 × 10^9/L that met the following criteria: 1) occurred after the ANC value of &lt;0.5 × 10^9/L and 2) no other ANC values &lt;0.5 × 10^9/L occurred between this day and end of cycle. The duration of severe neutropenia only included participants who had at least 1 severe neutropenia event in the cycle, and censoring rules were applied for unresolved severe neutropenia in a cycle. For the treatment period, the overall duration of severe neutropenia was the median value among the durations from all cycles.</description>

    <measure>Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of Trilaciclib in Cycle 1, Part 1</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 1 and 3 of Cycle 1 for a 21-day cycle</time_frame>
    <description>Cmax of trilaciclib in plasma was determined from individual concentration-time data by non-compartmental analysis methods. The actual sampling times in relation to dosing were used. For estimation of Cmax, a concentration that was below the limit of quantification (BLQ) was assigned a value of zero if it occurred in a profile before the first measurable concentration. If a BLQ value occurred after a measurable concentration in a profile, and was followed by a value above the lower limit of quantification, then the BLQ was treated as missing data. If a BLQ value occurred at the end of the collection interval (after the last quantifiable concentration) it was treated as missing data. If two BLQ values occurred in succession after Cmax, the profile was deemed to have terminated at the first BLQ value and any subsequent concentrations were omitted.</description>

    <description>Tumor response was assessed by CT or MRI. PFS was defined as the time (months) from date of first dose date of study drug for participants in Part 1 until date of documented disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. More specifically, PFS was determined using all the assessment data up until the last evaluable visit prior to or on the date of i) disease progression as defined by RECIST 1.1 or by clinical criteria as determined by the investigator; or ii) withdrawal of consent; or iii) receiving subsequent anticancer therapy, whichever was earlier. For PFS determined using response data derived programmatically, either clinical progression or progression by RECIST (whichever came first) was considered. Median and inter-quartile range of PFS were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>The study was conducted at 71 centers in the United States of America and Europe. The first participant enrolled on 26 June 2015 and the last participant completed on 22 February 2019. For Part 1, participants were enrolled from 26 June 2015 to 30 September 2016 and for Part 2, participants were enrolled from 06 October 2016 to 25 April 2017.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants were screened within 14 days prior to first study drug administration. Informed consent and brain scans were obtained up to 28 days prior to first study drug administration. A total of 122 participants were enrolled (24 in Part 1 and 98 in Part 2), of which 96 were assigned to treatment.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Part 1: Dose Finding/Expansion</title>
          <description>The 1st cohort in Part 1 received trilaciclib 200 mg/m^2, IV once daily on Days 1 to 3 of each 21-day E/P cycle. The 2nd cohort in the Phase 1b dose-finding portion of Part 1 &amp; the Phase 2a expansion cohort in Part 1 received trilaciclib 240 mg/m^2, IV once daily on Days 1 to 3 of each 21-day E/P cycle. Participants received standard E/P chemotherapy in 21-day cycles. Carboplatin dose was calculated using the Calvert formula with a target AUC = 5 (maximum 750 mg) IV on Day 1. Etoposide 100 mg/m^2 was given IV daily on Days 1, 2, &amp; 3 of each 21-day cycle. Trilaciclib was only given with E/P therapy. If E/P therapy was discontinued, trilaciclib was also to be discontinued. The interval between doses of trilaciclib on successive days was not greater than 28 hours &amp; between the dose of trilaciclib &amp; the first dose of chemotherapy on a given day (etoposide or carboplatin) not greater than 4 hours.</description>

          <description>Eligible participants were randomized (1:1) to trilaciclib or placebo administered IV once daily on Days 1 to 3 with etoposide and carboplatin on Day 1 and etoposide on Days 2 and 3 of 21-day cycles (E/P). Randomization was stratified by ECOG performance status (0 to 1 versus 2). Participants received trilaciclib 240 mg/m^2 (recommended dose from Part 1) or placebo IV once daily on Days 1 to 3 of each 21-day E/P chemotherapy cycle. Participants received standard E/P chemotherapy in 21-day cycles. The carboplatin dose was calculated using the Calvert formula with a target AUC = 5 (maximum 750 mg) IV on Day 1, and 100 mg/m^2 etoposide was administered IV daily on Days 1, 2, and 3 of each 21-day cycle. The interval between doses of trilaciclib/placebo on successive days was not greater than 28 hours and between the dose of trilaciclib/placebo and the first dose of chemotherapy on a given day (etoposide or carboplatin) was not greater than 4 hours.</description>

        <title>Incidence of Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Related AEs, Related SAEs, and AEs Leading to Study Drug Discontinuation in Part 1</title>
        <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a medicinal product that did not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. TEAEs were defined as any AE that started on or after the first dose of study drug and up to the last dose +30 days. SAEs were defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose resulted in death, was life threatening, required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or was a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Relatedness to study drug was assessed by the investigator. Related refers to those events that were Possibly, Probably, or Definitely Related. AEs with an unknown/not reported onset date were also included.</description>

Within each cycle, the duration (days) of severe neutropenia was defined as the number of days from the date of the first ANC value of &lt;0.5 × 10^9/L observed between start of cycle and end of cycle to the date of the first ANC value ≥0.5 × 10^9/L that met the following criteria: 1) occurred after the ANC value of &lt;0.5 × 10^9/L and 2) no other ANC values &lt;0.5 × 10^9/L occurred between this day and end of cycle. The duration of severe neutropenia only included participants who had at least 1 severe neutropenia event in the cycle, and censoring rules were applied for unresolved severe neutropenia in a cycle. For the treatment period, the overall duration of severe neutropenia was the median value among the durations from all cycles.</description>

        <description>Cmax of trilaciclib in plasma was determined from individual concentration-time data by non-compartmental analysis methods. The actual sampling times in relation to dosing were used. For estimation of Cmax, a concentration that was below the limit of quantification (BLQ) was assigned a value of zero if it occurred in a profile before the first measurable concentration. If a BLQ value occurred after a measurable concentration in a profile, and was followed by a value above the lower limit of quantification, then the BLQ was treated as missing data. If a BLQ value occurred at the end of the collection interval (after the last quantifiable concentration) it was treated as missing data. If two BLQ values occurred in succession after Cmax, the profile was deemed to have terminated at the first BLQ value and any subsequent concentrations were omitted.</description>

        <description>Cmax of etoposide and free and total carboplatin in plasma were determined from individual concentration-time data by non-compartmental analysis methods. The actual sampling times in relation to dosing were used. For estimation of Cmax, a concentration that was BLQ was assigned a value of zero if it occurred in a profile before the first measurable concentration. If a BLQ value occurred after a measurable concentration in a profile, and was followed by a value above the lower limit of quantification, then the BLQ was treated as missing data. If a BLQ value occurred at the end of the collection interval (after the last quantifiable concentration) it was treated as missing data. If two BLQ values occurred in succession after Cmax, the profile was deemed to have terminated at the first BLQ value and any subsequent concentrations were omitted.</description>

        <description>Severe (Grade 4) neutropenia was defined as at least 1 ANC value &lt;0.5 × 10^9/L during the treatment period. Within each cycle, the duration (days) of severe neutropenia was defined as the number of days from the date of the first ANC value of &lt;0.5 × 10^9/L observed between start of cycle and end of cycle to the date of the first ANC value ≥0.5 × 10^9/L that met the following criteria: 1) occurred after the ANC value of &lt;0.5 × 10^9/L and 2) no other ANC values &lt;0.5 × 10^9/L occurred between this day and end of cycle. The duration of severe neutropenia only included participants who had at least 1 severe neutropenia event in the cycle, and censoring rules were applied for unresolved severe neutropenia in a cycle. For the treatment period, the overall duration of severe neutropenia was the median value among the durations from all cycles.</description>

        <title>Best Overall Tumor Response Based on Assessments in Part 1</title>
        <description>Tumor response was assessed by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Overall visit response by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 was derived programmatically using data from target lesions (TLs), non-target lesions (NTLs), &amp; new lesions. Tumor response data were used to determine each participant's time point response &amp; best overall response (BOR). Complete response (CR) was disappearance of all TLs, any pathological lymph nodes selected as TLs must have reduced in short axis to &lt;10 mm. Partial response (PR) was at least a 30% decrease from baseline in the sum of diameters of TLs, as long as criteria for progressive disease (PD) were not met. PD was a ≥20% increase in the smallest sum of diameters of TLs since treatment started (including baseline) and an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. Stable disease (SD) was neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, end of every two 21-day cycles, up until disease progression to a maximum of the time at least 70% overall survival (OS) events observed (a maximum of 4 years)</time_frame>
        <population>Response evaluable analysis set included all participants in the safety analysis set who had at least 1 post-baseline tumor assessment, or clinical progression as noted by the investigator before their first post-baseline tumor scan, or who died due to disease progression before their first post-baseline tumor scan.</population>

        <description>Tumor response was assessed by CT or MRI. PFS was defined as the time (months) from date of first dose date of study drug for participants in Part 1 until date of documented disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. More specifically, PFS was determined using all the assessment data up until the last evaluable visit prior to or on the date of i) disease progression as defined by RECIST 1.1 or by clinical criteria as determined by the investigator; or ii) withdrawal of consent; or iii) receiving subsequent anticancer therapy, whichever was earlier. For PFS determined using response data derived programmatically, either clinical progression or progression by RECIST (whichever came first) was considered.

        <description>OS was calculated as the time (months) from date of first dose of study drug for participants in Part 1 to the date of death due to any cause. Participants who did not die during the study were censored at the date last known to be alive. Participants lacking data beyond the day of first dose of study drug had their survival time censored at day of first dose of study drug. OS was not censored if a participant received other anti-tumor treatments after the study drugs. Median and inter-quartile range of OS were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method.</description>

        <title>Best Overall Tumor Response Based on Assessments in Part 2</title>
        <description>Tumor response was assessed by CT or MRI. Overall visit response by RECIST v1.1 was derived programmatically using data from TLs, NTLs, &amp; new lesions. Tumor response data were used to determine each participant's time point response &amp; BOR. CR was disappearance of all TLs, any pathological lymph nodes selected as TLs must have reduced in short axis to &lt;10 mm. PR was at least a 30% decrease from baseline in the sum of diameters of TLs, as long as criteria for PD were not met. PD was a ≥20% increase in the smallest sum of diameters of TLs since treatment started (including baseline) and an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. SD was neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD.</description>

        <title>Best Overall Tumor Response Based on BICR Assessments in Part 2</title>
        <description>Tumor response was assessed by CT or MRI. Overall visit response by RECIST v1.1 was determined by BICR. Tumor response data were used to determine each participant's time point response &amp; BOR. CR was disappearance of all TLs, any pathological lymph nodes selected as TLs must have reduced in short axis to &lt;10 mm. PR was at least a 30% decrease from baseline in the sum of diameters of TLs, as long as criteria for PD were not met. PD was a ≥20% increase in the smallest sum of diameters of TLs since treatment started (including baseline) and an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. SD was neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD.</description>

        <title>PFS Based on Assessments in Part 2</title>
        <description>Tumor response was assessed by CT or MRI. PFS was defined as the time (months) from date of first dose date of study drug for participants in Part 1 until date of documented disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. More specifically, PFS was determined using all the assessment data up until the last evaluable visit prior to or on the date of i) disease progression as defined by RECIST 1.1 or by clinical criteria as determined by the investigator; or ii) withdrawal of consent; or iii) receiving subsequent anticancer therapy, whichever was earlier. For PFS determined using response data derived programmatically, either clinical progression or progression by RECIST (whichever came first) was considered. Median and inter-quartile range of PFS were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method.</description>

        <description>In addition to deriving severe (Grade 4) neutropenia using the method described for the primary endpoints, an approach was applied that accounted for participants who did not experience a severe neutropenia event in Cycle 1. For the post-hoc analysis, severe neutropenia was defined as at least 1 ANC value &lt;0.5 × 10^9/L during the treatment period. In Cycle 1, the duration (days) of severe neutropenia was defined as the number of days from the date of the first ANC value of &lt;0.5 × 10^9/L observed between start of cycle and end of cycle to the date of the first ANC value ≥0.5 × 10^9/L that met the following criteria: 1) occurred after the ANC value of &lt;0.5 × 10^9/L and 2) no other ANC values &lt;0.5 × 10^9/L occurred between this day and end of cycle. The duration of severe neutropenia was set to 0 for participants who did not experience severe neutropenia in Cycle 1. Data from unscheduled visits and the actual assessment date (rather than visit date) were included in the derivation.</description>
