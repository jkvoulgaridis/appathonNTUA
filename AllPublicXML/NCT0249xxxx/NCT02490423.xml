  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine whether a complex, data-driven protocol for assessing patient needs
      and providing &quot;nudges&quot; (reminders to be adherent with medication prescriptions) improves
      adherence with cardiovascular medications. This will be accomplished by performing a 12-month
      clinical trial of patients with an indication for statin therapy. Participants will be
      randomized to either an intervention or standard-of-care arm and will be followed via passive
      electronic means to determine if they are adherent with medication prescriptions.

    <measure>Adherence with taking prescribed statin medications.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 (±1) months</time_frame>
    <description>Adherence will be measured by examining the passively-collected data regarding the filling and refilling of the subject's prescriptions that are available electronically through SelectHealth data and calculating the proportion of time during the followup period that each subject had medication (number of days in which the medication was available after a prescription was filled divided by the total length of the follow-up period).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adherence with taking other individual cardiovascular medications.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 (±1) months</time_frame>
    <description>Adherence with other individual cardiovascular medications (including beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, P2Y12 inhibitors/antiplatelets, diuretics, angiotensin receptor blockers, angiotensin-receptor neprilysin inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, vasodilators, anti-arrhythmia medications, niacin, cholesterol absorption inhibitors (ezetimibe), fibrates, digoxin, and warfarin/anticoagulants). Adherence will be measured by examining the passively-collected data regarding the filling and refilling of the subject's prescriptions that are available electronically through SelectHealth data and calculating the proportion of time during the followup period that each subject had medication (number of days in which the medication was available after a prescription was filled divided by the total length of the follow-up period).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adherence with taking all cardiovascular medications.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 (±1) months</time_frame>
    <description>Adherence will be measured as a composite of cardiovascular medications including statins, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, P2Y12 inhibitors/antiplatelets, diuretics, angiotensin receptor blockers, angiotensin-receptor neprilysin inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, vasodilators, anti-arrhythmia medications, niacin, cholesterol absorption inhibitors (ezetimibe), fibrates, digoxin, and warfarin/anticoagulants. Adherence will be measured by examining the passively-collected data regarding the filling and refilling of the subject's prescriptions that are available electronically through SelectHealth data and calculating the proportion of time during the followup period that each subject had medication (number of days in which the medication was available after a prescription was filled divided by the total length of the follow-up period).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adherence with prescribed lifestyle changes.</measure>

    <description>Adherence with prescribed lifestyle changes (i.e., smoking cessation, physical activity, and heart-healthy diet) will be obtained through electronic medical record review.</description>
