  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Though technology is integrated into the lives of our target population, use of any
      particular technology will depend on the content delivered, aesthetic appeal, and overall
      design. Based on the completion and analysis of data from Phase 1, the investigators were
      able to obtain feedback on HIV-negative male couples' attitudes toward the original content
      in the prevention toolkit modules. The research team, along with the web-developers, used
      this feedback to specifically tailor the content of the modules to fit the unique needs of
      the intervention's target population: at risk HIV-negative male couples. For Phase 2, the
      investigators conducted focus groups at each site to help identify strengths and potential
      areas for improvement of the prevention toolkit, which will be incorporated before piloting
      it in the intervention for Phase 3 of this project. After assessing the acceptability of the
      prevention toolkit, including the content of modules, aesthetic appeal, and overall design
      with HIV-negative male couples target population, the research team will pilot test whether
      the RCT with the prevention toolkit will help reduce HIV risk through formation and adherence
      to a sexual agreement, reduction in occurrences of condomless anal sex with casual sex
      partners, and increase testing behaviors among at-risk HIV-negative male couples. The
      interactive website, herein referred to as the &quot;HIV prevention toolkit&quot; will contain unique
      modules about sexual agreements and effective HIV prevention strategies.
