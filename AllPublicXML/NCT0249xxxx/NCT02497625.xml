    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of minimal intervention and therapeutic
      alliance in pain, specific and general disability, global perceived effect, empathy,
      credibility and expectation of improvement in patients with chronic non-specific low back
      pain

    <textblock>
      Low back pain remains a global public health problem. The classification of patients in low
      back pain subgroups aims to optimize the health system and provide the quantity and the type
      of proper technique for each patient. Several factors may influence physical therapy. The
      therapeutic alliance may be defined as harmony or social connection between the therapist and
      the patient and may influence the treatment effect. The aim of this study is to evaluate the
      effectiveness of the addition of the therapeutic alliance to a minimum intervention for the
      treatment of chronic non-specific low back pain with low risk of psychosocial factors.
