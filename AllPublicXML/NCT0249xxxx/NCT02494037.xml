  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study describes the three-year survival outcome of consecutively recruited advanced
      stage breast, colorectal, ovarian and pancreatic cancer patients receiving advanced
      integrative oncology (AIO) treatment at one of the participating North American advanced
      integrative oncology specialist clinics. This study also aims to describe AIO treatments
      recommended by naturopathic oncologists for these advanced stage cancer patients and pilot
      the collection and evaluation of health-related quality of life data on a subset of Canadian
      AIO-treated patients.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is estimated that between 50 and 80% of cancer patients in the United States (US)
      supplement their conventional oncology treatment regimen with some form of complementary or
      alternative medicine therapy or practice. A smaller percentage of these patients receive
      medical treatment from naturopathic doctors (NDs) who are board certified in naturopathic
      oncology (Fellows of the American Board of Naturopathic Oncology, FABNO) or have equivalent
      experience in caring for cancer patients and from traditional Chinese medicine (TCM)
      providers with advanced training in oncology (DAOM or physicians with training in TCM). This
      level of care is being defined here as advanced integrative oncology (AIO). AIO clinics
      provide comprehensive science- and experience-based naturopathic and Chinese medical oncology
      integrated with each patient's conventional medical treatment.

      Although there have been some studies of complementary and alternative medicine use by cancer
      patients, little is known about the effectiveness of the naturopathic medicine and TCM
      provided to people with cancer in an integrative setting. While there is scientific evidence
      supporting specific treatments that are commonly used, systematic study of their
      effectiveness (especially when used in combination as commonly recommended) is virtually
      non-existent. An early step in the evaluation of clinical outcomes associated with AIO is to
      take a health service approach and seek to answer the question: &quot;Does exposure to AIO
      services improve the clinical outcomes of patients with advanced stage cancer?&quot;

      The survival outcome of consecutively recruited advanced stage breast, colorectal,
      pancreatic, and ovarian cancer patients treated at multiple naturopathic oncology clinics in
      North America will be tracked and compared to outcomes published in the current medical
      literature and by SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results) in order to address the
      fundamentally important question of whether or not AIO has a beneficial impact on survival.
      Involvement of a total of seven active AIO clinics from Canada and the US will allow the
      recruitment of a sufficient sample size to address this question as well as provide outcomes
      that are generalizable for AIO across North America.

    <description>AIO treatment recommendations for cancer and conventional oncology treatment data will be collected to describe the cancer treatments recommended and/or used by cancer patients across the treatment cohort. AIO treatment recommendations will be abstracted from AIO chart notes for all study participants for the first AIO clinic visit and up to 3 years. Concurrent conventional oncology treatment data will also be abstracted from conventional oncology medical charts.</description>

    <time_frame>Prior to first AIO clinic visit and 3 and 6 months and 1, 2 and 3 years thereafter.</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported HRQOL data will be collected from a subgroup of Canadian AIO-treated patients (N=80) who had at least two AIO visits within three months of first AIO clinic visit using validated questionnaires commonly used in integrative oncology research settings. Instruments to be used in the HRQOL assessment include the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) to measure general health status and function, Measure Yourself Concerns and Wellbeing (MYCaW) to identify cancer-related concerns, and Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS) to assess common cancer symptoms.</description>

    <description>A sub group of Canadian AIO-treated patients (N=80) will be enrolled to estimate direct healthcare, direct non-healthcare, and indirect non-healthcare costs from a societal perspective. This includes costs incurred by the healthcare payer (i.e. government or private insurers), the patient/family (i.e. co-payment or full payment for medicines and/or care) and by the society at large (i.e. costs of reduced productivity). Patients will self-report these costs using questionnaires developed by the research team in collaboration with a health economist.</description>

    <time_frame>Within 2 weeks of FOC and 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years thereafter.</time_frame>
    <description>A Sub group of Canadian AIO-treated patients (N=3-6 for each cancer type) and NDs at each Canadian clinic will be enrolled to understand the benefits and challenges of AIO care from a qualitative perspective. Through interviews conducted by a qualitative researcher, we will help to more fully understand the experiences of study participants and the subjective impact of naturopathic interventions both from the perspective of the study participants themselves and from the perspective of their ND.</description>
