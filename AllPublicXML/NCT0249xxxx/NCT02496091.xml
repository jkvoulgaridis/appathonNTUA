  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed as a retrospective and multi-center study. The study population is US
      individuals previously restored with titanium and gold-shaded titanium ATLANTIS abutments.
      The study includes retrospective data collection from the medical records and data collection
      from one prospective study visit with a clinical examination.The primary objective is to
      evaluate success. Success is defined as that the study implant and abutment are in situ and
      no Adverse Device Effects related to the study implant, abutment or adjacent peri-implant
      tissues are reported during the study.

    <measure>Study Position Implant and Abutment Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Minium of 2 years and a maximum of 8 years of use.</time_frame>
    <description>Survival defined as study position implant and abutment in situ during study. The presence of the study position implant and abutment in the mouth was recorded. The implant and abutment had to be the ones included in the permanent prosthetic restoration when it was delivered / installed.
Each study position was categorized as survived (No/Yes). It was categorized as survived=Yes when both had been in situ during study. It was categorized as survived=No when either the implant or abutment had been lost during study.</description>

    <time_frame>Minium of 2 years and a maximum of 8 years of use.</time_frame>
    <description>Presence of plaque was evaluated at four surfaces around each study position (mesial, facial, distal and lingual). Plaque was recorded as presence or absence of plaque by visual inspection.</description>

    <description>PPD was evaluated at four surfaces around each study position (mesial, facial, distal and lingual), using a periodontal probe. PPD was measured as the distance from the mucosal margin to the bottom of the probeable pocket in whole millimetre. PPD mean values per study positon were calculated.</description>

    <measure>Evaluation of the Periimplant Mucosa Condition - By Assessment of BoP</measure>
    <time_frame>Minium of 2 years and a maximum of 8 years of use.</time_frame>
    <description>Condition of the periimplant mucosa by assessment of Bleeding on Probing (BoP). BoP was evaluated at four surfaces around each study position (mesial, facial, distal and lingual), using a periodontal probe.
BoP was recorded as presence or absence of bleeding when probing to the bottom of the pocket. Presented as % of positions that show presence of bleeding on probing at time of the follow-up visit.</description>

    <measure>Marginal Bone Level Change</measure>
    <time_frame>Minium of 2 years and a maximum of 8 years of use.</time_frame>
    <description>Marginal bone level (MBL) determined from radiographs and expressed as the distance from a reference point on the implant to the most coronal bone-to-implant contact on the mesial and distal aspect of the implant. Marginal bone level expressed in millimeters at the study follow-up visit was compared to values obtained at delivery of permanent restoration i.e. loading (baseline), or within the first 12 months after loading.</description>

        The study population is individuals who received ATLANTIS abutments, between 2010 and 2013,
        connected to implants from BIOMET 3i, Straumann, Nobel Biocare or DENTSPLY Implants (only
        ASTRA TECH Implant System) replacing one or more teeth, in any position in the mouth, as
        part of a permanent prosthetic restoration. The partially dentate individuals have received
        either single-unit crowns or fixed partial or full dentures. The abutments need to be
        titanium or gold-shaded titanium.
