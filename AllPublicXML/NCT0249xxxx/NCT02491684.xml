    <textblock>
      A study to investigate if inhaled Interferon beta-1a is safe and tolerated, and can prevent
      or reduce the severity of asthma attacks when administered to asthma patients at the onset of
      symptoms of common cold or influenza
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist of a Pre-Treatment Phase followed by a Treatment Phase. Patients are
      screened and enter the Pre-Treatment phase where they remain until they develop symptoms of a
      common cold or the flu. During this Pre-Treatment Phase patients will be asked daily if they
      think they have a common cold or the flu. When the patient answers yes to the question that
      he/she is coming down with a common cold or the flu, arrangements are made to evaluate the
      patient at the study site and, if eligible, enters the Treatment Phase. Baseline assessments
      are performed and the patient is randomized 1:1 to receive 24 μg (metered dose) inhaled
      Interferon beta-1a or placebo once daily for 14 days (delivered by the I-neb® device [Philips
      Respironics]). Treatment should start as soon as possible but no later than 48 hours after
      the onset of the first of the common cold or flu symptoms. Patients will be assessed with
      regards to exacerbations and changes in respiratory symptoms and reliever medication use at
      home using an ePRO device. Lung function will be measured both at home by the patients and at
      the study site. There will be five clinical visits during the Treatment Phase and two visits
      after the end of treatment; efficacy and safety will be monitored until 2-3 weeks after end
      of treatment when a final follow-up visit will take place.

      The study population will comprise adult asthmatic patients on a maintenance treatment of
      medium to high dose inhaled corticosteroids and a second controller medication (eg, long-
      acting β2 agonist), with a documented history of at least two severe exacerbations within the
      last 24 months, of which at least one has occurred during the last 12 months, and it is
      suspected by the patient that these aforementioned exacerbations were triggered by an upper
      respiratory tract infection (ie, related to symptoms of a common cold or the flu).

    <measure>Proportion of Patients With a Severe Asthma Exacerbation During 14 Days of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 - 14 of the treatment phase.</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation of the efficacy of inhaled AZD9412 compared to placebo in preventing severe exacerbations during the 14 day treatment phase following the onset of an URTI in asthmatic patients.
A severe exacerbation was defined as worsening asthma symptoms and
use of systemic corticosteroids (or a temporary increase of at least 2-fold in a stable oral corticosteroid background dose) for at least 3 consecutive days and/or
an unscheduled visit or emergency room visit due to asthma symptoms that required at least 1 dose of systemic corticosteroids and/or
an in-patient hospitalisation due to asthma requiring at least 1 dose of systemic corticosteroids.
The number of patients with severe asthma exacerbations with onset during the treatment phase is presented for each treatment group.</description>

    <description>Evaluation of the efficacy of inhaled AZD9412 compared to placebo in preventing moderate exacerbations within 7, 14 and 30 days after the start of treatment (Day 1).
A moderate exacerbation was defined as a temporary increase in maintenance therapy in order to prevent a severe event supported by a sustained (2 or more days) worsening in at least one key control metric, including asthma score, rescue use, night time awakening or morning peak expiratory flow.
The numbers of patients with moderate exacerbations with onset during Days 1 - 7, Days 1 - 14 and Days 1 - 30 are presented for each treatment group.
With respect to the Day 1-7 analysis, the model did not converge so the analysis could not be performed.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 1 of treatment phase up to 30 days post-randomisation.</time_frame>
    <description>The duration of each individual moderate or severe exacerbation was calculated as:
Cessation date of exacerbation - Start date of exacerbation + 1.
The start date of a severe exacerbation was defined as the start date of systemic corticosteroids or increase of systemic corticosteroids or emergency room visit or hospital admission, whichever occurred first. The stop date was defined as the last day of systemic corticosteroids/increase of systemic corticosteroids or hospital discharge, whichever occurred last.
The start date of a moderate exacerbation was defined as the first day of increase in temporary maintenance therapy. The stop date was defined as the last day of this treatment.
The mean duration of moderate or severe exacerbations is presented for each treatment group.</description>

    <measure>Change in Asthma Control From Baseline up to 30 Days as Measured by the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-6)</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline up to 30 days after start of treatment phase.</time_frame>
    <description>The ACQ-6 consists of 6 questions to assess asthma control, each question measured on a 7-point scale scored from 0 (totally controlled) to 6 (severely uncontrolled). The ACQ-6 total score is computed as the un-weighted mean of the responses to the 6 questions. Baseline assessments were taken as the last non-missing assessment prior to randomisation.
The change from baseline at Visit 4 (Day 7 +/- 1), at Visit 6 (Day 14 +/- 1) and at Visit 8 (Day 30) is presented for the total score and for each of the 6 questions.</description>

    <measure>AUC for Change in Daytime and Night-time Asthma Symptom Score From Baseline up to 30 Days</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline up to 30 days after start of treatment phase.</time_frame>
    <description>Asthma symptoms during night-time and daytime were recorded by the patient each morning and evening in the Asthma Daily Diary on a daily basis. Symptoms were recorded using a scale of 0 to 3 where 0 indicates no asthma symptoms up to an absolute score of 3. Baseline assessments were taken as the last non-missing assessment prior to randomisation. The total daily asthma symptom score was calculated by taking the sum of the night-time and daytime asthma scores recorded each day. The outcome variable is the area under the curve (AUC) for change from baseline in day-time, night-time and total daily asthma symptom scores over Days 1-14, Days 1-7, Days 8-14 and Days 15-30.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Health-related Quality of Life as Measured by the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ[S]) From Baseline up to 30 Days</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline up to 30 days after start of treatment phase.</time_frame>
    <description>The AQLQ(S) was used to assess health-related quality of life and consisted of 32 questions. Patients were asked to score each of the questions on a 7-point scale ranging from 7 (no impairment) to 1 (severe impairment). The questions were allocated to 4 domains assessing:
activity limitation,
symptoms,
emotional function, and
environmental stimuli
The overall score was calculated as the mean of the responses to all questions. The mean change in overall score from baseline at Visit 6 (Day 14+/-1) and Visit 8 (Day 30) are presented.</description>

      <recruitment_details>First patient enrolled: 21 July 2015; Last Patient Last Visit: 24 November 2016. The study was performed at 39 sites in 7 countries including Argentina, Australia, Colombia, France, South Korea, Spain and the United Kingdom.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>349 patients enrolled (signed informed consent) and 228 were not randomised. 121 patients met randomisation criteria and entered the pre-treatment phase. Patients were treated after developing symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) if they met all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria for the treatment phase.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>AZD9412</title>
          <description>Patients were randomised to receive investigational product AZD9412 (interferon beta-1a) in the treatment phase.
Eligible patients entered the pre-treatment phase until they developed symptoms of a common cold or flu (URTI). Patients were evaluated at a study site for eligibility to enter the treatment phase as soon as possible but no later than 48 hours after the onset of the first symptoms of an URTI.
Patients randomised to the AZD9412 group received 6 Million International Units (MIU) (24 micrograms [mcg] metered dose) inhaled AZD9412 once daily for 14 days, delivered by the I-neb® device.
Patients continued their regular asthma maintenance treatment, and were assessed for exacerbations, changes in respiratory symptoms and reliever medication use using an electronic Patient Reported Outcome (ePRO) device at home.</description>

        <title>Proportion of Patients With a Severe Asthma Exacerbation During 14 Days of Treatment</title>
        <description>Evaluation of the efficacy of inhaled AZD9412 compared to placebo in preventing severe exacerbations during the 14 day treatment phase following the onset of an URTI in asthmatic patients.
A severe exacerbation was defined as worsening asthma symptoms and
use of systemic corticosteroids (or a temporary increase of at least 2-fold in a stable oral corticosteroid background dose) for at least 3 consecutive days and/or
an unscheduled visit or emergency room visit due to asthma symptoms that required at least 1 dose of systemic corticosteroids and/or
an in-patient hospitalisation due to asthma requiring at least 1 dose of systemic corticosteroids.
The number of patients with severe asthma exacerbations with onset during the treatment phase is presented for each treatment group.</description>
        <time_frame>Day 1 - 14 of the treatment phase.</time_frame>

Eligible patients entered the pre-treatment phase until they developed symptoms of a common cold or flu (URTI). Patients were evaluated at a study site for eligibility to enter the treatment phase as soon as possible but no later than 48 hours after the onset of the first symptoms of an URTI.
Patients randomised to the AZD9412 group received 6 MIU (24 mcg metered dose) inhaled AZD9412 once daily for 14 days, delivered by the I-neb® device.
Patients continued their regular asthma maintenance treatment, and were assessed for exacerbations, changes in respiratory symptoms and reliever medication use using an ePRO device at home.</description>

        <description>Evaluation of the efficacy of inhaled AZD9412 compared to placebo in preventing moderate exacerbations within 7, 14 and 30 days after the start of treatment (Day 1).
A moderate exacerbation was defined as a temporary increase in maintenance therapy in order to prevent a severe event supported by a sustained (2 or more days) worsening in at least one key control metric, including asthma score, rescue use, night time awakening or morning peak expiratory flow.
The numbers of patients with moderate exacerbations with onset during Days 1 - 7, Days 1 - 14 and Days 1 - 30 are presented for each treatment group.
With respect to the Day 1-7 analysis, the model did not converge so the analysis could not be performed.</description>

The change from baseline at Visit 4 (Day 7 +/- 1), at Visit 6 (Day 14 +/- 1) and at Visit 8 (Day 30) is presented for the total score and for each of the 6 questions.</description>
          <population>The ITT analysis set consisted of all randomised patients who received at least 1 dose of investigational product and had some post-dose data available.
Patients with non-missing values were included in the analysis.</population>

        <title>AUC for Change in Daytime and Night-time Asthma Symptom Score From Baseline up to 30 Days</title>
        <description>Asthma symptoms during night-time and daytime were recorded by the patient each morning and evening in the Asthma Daily Diary on a daily basis. Symptoms were recorded using a scale of 0 to 3 where 0 indicates no asthma symptoms up to an absolute score of 3. Baseline assessments were taken as the last non-missing assessment prior to randomisation. The total daily asthma symptom score was calculated by taking the sum of the night-time and daytime asthma scores recorded each day. The outcome variable is the area under the curve (AUC) for change from baseline in day-time, night-time and total daily asthma symptom scores over Days 1-14, Days 1-7, Days 8-14 and Days 15-30.</description>
        <time_frame>From baseline up to 30 days after start of treatment phase.</time_frame>
        <population>The ITT analysis set consisted of all randomised patients who received at least 1 dose of investigational product and had some post-dose data available.
Patients with non-missing values were included in the analysis.</population>

            <description>Patients were randomised to receive investigational product AZD9412 (interferon beta-1a) in the treatment phase.
Eligible patients entered the pre-treatment phase until they developed symptoms of a common cold or flu (URTI). Patients were evaluated at a study site for eligibility to enter the treatment phase as soon as possible but no later than 48 hours after the onset of the first symptoms of an URTI.
Patients randomised to the AZD9412 group received 6 MIU (24 mcg metered dose) inhaled AZD9412 once daily for 14 days, delivered by the I-neb® device.
Patients continued their regular asthma maintenance treatment, and were assessed for exacerbations, changes in respiratory symptoms and reliever medication use using an ePRO device at home.</description>

        <title>Change in the Proportion of Night-time Awakening Using the ePRO Questionnaire From Baseline up to 30 Days</title>
        <description>Night-time awakenings due to asthma symptoms were recorded by the patient in the Asthma Daily Diary each morning by answering the question whether he/she woke up during the night due to asthma symptoms with a 'yes' or 'no' response.
Biweekly means were calculated as the percentages of times the subject answered 'yes' over a period of 14 sequential days. Biweekly means are presented for the periods over Days 2-15 and Days 16-30.</description>
        <time_frame>From baseline up to 30 days after start of treatment phase.</time_frame>
        <population>The ITT analysis set consisted of all randomised patients who received at least 1 dose of investigational product and had some post-dose data available.
Patients with non-missing values were included in the analysis.</population>

            <description>Patients were randomised to receive investigational product AZD9412 (interferon beta-1a) in the treatment phase.
Eligible patients entered the pre-treatment phase until they developed symptoms of a common cold or flu (URTI). Patients were evaluated at a study site for eligibility to enter the treatment phase as soon as possible but no later than 48 hours after the onset of the first symptoms of an URTI.
Patients randomised to the AZD9412 group received 6 MIU (24 mcg metered dose) inhaled AZD9412 once daily for 14 days, delivered by the I-neb® device.
Patients continued their regular asthma maintenance treatment, and were assessed for exacerbations, changes in respiratory symptoms and reliever medication use using an ePRO device at home.</description>

        <title>Change in Health-related Quality of Life as Measured by the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ[S]) From Baseline up to 30 Days</title>
        <description>The AQLQ(S) was used to assess health-related quality of life and consisted of 32 questions. Patients were asked to score each of the questions on a 7-point scale ranging from 7 (no impairment) to 1 (severe impairment). The questions were allocated to 4 domains assessing:
activity limitation,
symptoms,
emotional function, and
environmental stimuli
The overall score was calculated as the mean of the responses to all questions. The mean change in overall score from baseline at Visit 6 (Day 14+/-1) and Visit 8 (Day 30) are presented.</description>
        <time_frame>From baseline up to 30 days after start of treatment phase.</time_frame>
        <population>The ITT analysis set consisted of all randomised patients who received at least 1 dose of investigational product and had some post-dose data available.
Patients with non-missing values were included in the analysis.</population>

            <description>Patients were randomised to receive investigational product AZD9412 (interferon beta-1a) in the treatment phase.
Eligible patients entered the pre-treatment phase until they developed symptoms of a common cold or flu (URTI). Patients were evaluated at a study site for eligibility to enter the treatment phase as soon as possible but no later than 48 hours after the onset of the first symptoms of an URTI.
Patients randomised to the AZD9412 group received 6 MIU (24 mcg metered dose) inhaled AZD9412 once daily for 14 days, delivered by the I-neb® device.
Patients continued their regular asthma maintenance treatment, and were assessed for exacerbations, changes in respiratory symptoms and reliever medication use using an ePRO device at home.</description>

        <description>Patients measured morning FEV1 at home and recorded the results using the ePRO device. Baseline assessments were taken as the last non-missing assessment prior to randomisation.
The mean AUC for change from baseline is presented for the periods Days 1-14, 1-7, 8-14 and 15-30.</description>
        <time_frame>From baseline up to 30 days after start of treatment phase.</time_frame>
        <population>The ITT analysis set consisted of all randomised patients who received at least 1 dose of investigational product and had some post-dose data available.
Patients with non-missing values were included in the analysis.</population>

            <description>Patients were randomised to receive investigational product AZD9412 (interferon beta-1a) in the treatment phase.
Eligible patients entered the pre-treatment phase until they developed symptoms of a common cold or flu (URTI). Patients were evaluated at a study site for eligibility to enter the treatment phase as soon as possible but no later than 48 hours after the onset of the first symptoms of an URTI.
Patients randomised to the AZD9412 group received 6 MIU (24 mcg metered dose) inhaled AZD9412 once daily for 14 days, delivered by the I-neb® device.
Patients continued their regular asthma maintenance treatment, and were assessed for exacerbations, changes in respiratory symptoms and reliever medication use using an ePRO device at home.</description>

          <description>Patients were randomised to receive investigational product AZD9412 (interferon beta-1a) in the treatment phase.
Eligible patients entered the pre-treatment phase until they developed symptoms of a common cold or flu (URTI). Patients were evaluated at a study site for eligibility to enter the treatment phase as soon as possible but no later than 48 hours after the onset of the first symptoms of an URTI.
Patients randomised to the AZD9412 group received 6 Million International Units (MIU) (24 micrograms [mcg] metered dose) inhaled AZD9412 once daily for 14 days, delivered by the I-neb® device.
Patients continued their regular asthma maintenance treatment, and were assessed for exacerbations, changes in respiratory symptoms and reliever medication use using an electronic Patient Reported Outcome (ePRO) device at home.</description>
