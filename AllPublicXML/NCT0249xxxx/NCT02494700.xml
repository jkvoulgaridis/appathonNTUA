    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well ultra low dose orbital radiation therapy works in
      treating patients with stage I-IV low grade (indolent) B-cell lymphoma or mantle cell
      lymphoma involving the orbit of the eye (space enclosed by the borders of the eye socket).
      Orbital radiation therapy uses external beam radiation to destroy cancer cells. Using ultra
      low dose orbital radiation therapy may be effective in treating indolent B-cell lymphoma or
      mantle cell lymphoma involving the eye and may have fewer side effects.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the efficacy of ultra low dose 4 Gray (Gy) orbital radiation, measured as
      local orbital control (i.e. local control within the radiation field), in patients with
      limited and advanced stage low grade B lymphocyte (B cell) lymphoma and mantle cell lymphoma
      involving the ocular adnexa.

      II. To evaluate the efficacy of ultra low dose 4 Gy orbital radiation, measured as complete
      response, in patients with limited and advanced stage low grade B cell lymphoma and mantle
      cell lymphoma involving the ocular adnexa.

      III. To evaluate the acute and chronic toxicity of radiation to the orbit.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine if dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging can predict response
      to ultra low dose radiation therapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo low dose orbital external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) on 2 consecutive
      days. Patients experiencing stable or progressive disease after 12-16 weeks of EBRT undergo
      additional low dose orbital EBRT over 10 fractions. Patients experiencing partial response or
      minimal response 1 year after EBRT also undergo low dose orbital EBRT over 10 fractions.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3-4 months for 6-8
      months, every 6-12 months for up to 2 years, and then periodically thereafter.
