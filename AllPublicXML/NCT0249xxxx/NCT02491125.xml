  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A human dietary intervention study will be performed in overweight to obese subjects with a
      slow gastrointestinal transit time comparing the effects of a soluble prebiotic fibre vs.
      placebo on gut health, including gut microbiota composition, gastrointestinal transit time,
      metabolic health and quality of life.
