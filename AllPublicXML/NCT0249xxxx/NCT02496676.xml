  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - X-linked immunodeficiency with magnesium defect, Epstein-Barr virus infection, and
      neoplasia syndrome is called XMEN syndrome. In this genetic condition, the cells have less
      magnesium than normal. This makes it hard for the body to fight infections. Researchers want
      to see if magnesium supplements can make it easier for the body to fight infection.

      Objective:

      - To see if magnesium supplements can strengthen the immune system and reduce the amount of
      Epstein-Barr virus in people with XMEN syndrome.

      Eligibility:

      - People ages 6 and older who have XMEN syndrome

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with:

        -  Medical history

        -  Physical exam

        -  CT scan: Participants will drink a contrast and may get dye through an IV in the arm.
           They will lie in a machine that takes pictures of the body.

        -  EKG: Small sticky patches on the body will trace heart rhythm.

        -  Blood tests

        -  The study has 2 parts.

        -  Participants doing both parts will participate for 1 year and visit the clinic about 15
           &lt;TAB&gt;times. These visits will include a physical exam and blood and urine tests.

        -  Participants doing only the first part finish in 6 months and have fewer visits.

        -  For study part 1, participants will take magnesium pills for 3 months and placebo pills
           for another 3 months.

        -  At 3 and 6 months, they will have physical exam, medical history, blood and urine tests,
           &lt;TAB&gt;and an EKG.

        -  If the magnesium pills are not helpful, participants will do study part 2.

        -  They will be admitted to the hospital for 4 5 days to get magnesium for 3 days through
           an arm vein.

        -  They will take magnesium pills for another 6 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      X-linked immunodeficiency magnesium defect, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection and neoplasia
      (XMEN) syndrome is a primary immunodeficiency caused by the loss of expression of the
      magnesium transporter 1 (MAGT1). This syndrome is associated with CD4 lymphopenia, chronic
      EBV infection in most patients, and EBV-related lymphoproliferative disorders. The loss of
      MAGT1 leads to impaired T cell activation and decreased expression of the activator receptor,
      NKG2D on natural killer (NK) cells and CD8 T cells, leading to decreased EBV-specific
      cytolytic function of these cells. Results of previous studies suggest that magnesium
      supplementation may be a viable therapeutic option for patients with XMEN.

      The proposed study has 2 parts, and patients will be divided into 2 cohorts. Patients in
      cohort 1 (high EBV group) will have baseline blood EBV viral load greater than or equal to
      5,000 copies/mL or EBV log greater than or equal to 3.7 IU/mL. Patients in cohort 2 (low/no
      EBV group) will have baseline blood EBV viral load &lt;5,000 copies/mL or EBV log &lt;3.7 IU/mL.
      Part I is a randomized, double-blind, lacebocontrolled, crossover study to evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of oral magnesium L-threonate in patients with XMEN syndrome. Within each
      cohort, patients will be randomized to receive escalating doses of either placebo or oral
      magnesium L-threonate for 12 weeks. Patients will then receive the crossover treatment
      (magnesium or placebo) for an additional 12 weeks. For patients who experience a 0.5-log
      decrease in the number of EBV-infected B cells (cohort 1) or a greater than or equal to
      2-fold increase in NKG2D receptor expression on CD8 T cells (cohort 2) with oral magnesium as
      compared to placebo, the study will be complete. Patients who do not meet this efficacy
      outcome will undergo a 2-week washout period and proceed to Part II, an openlabel,
      non-randomized evaluation of intravenous magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) followed by oral magnesium
      L-threonate. These patients will be hospitalized to receive 3 days of intravenous MgSO4 in 3
      daily doses totaling 30 mg/kg/day. They will then restart escalating doses of oral magnesium
      L-threonate and continue for the remaining 24 weeks of Part II. If conducted, Part II will
      allow for secondary analyses to compare different durations of magnesium supplementation.
