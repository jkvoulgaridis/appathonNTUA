      Examine the effects of N-acetylcysteine on PTSD symptoms, craving and substance use in
      veterans with PTSD and comorbid substance use disorders.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With the increased number of military veterans returning from conflicts in Afghanistan and
      Iraq diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), there is a high vulnerability of
      these individuals to develop a substance use disorder (SUD). While there have been a host of
      studies focused largely on dopaminergic mechanisms of drug reward, they have not led to the
      development of adequate treatments for either preventing people diagnosed with PTSD from
      developing SUD or for treating comorbid PTSD/SUD. Based on extensive work with addictive
      drugs and preliminary data from our group, the investigators propose that stress impairs
      prefrontal cortex regulation of the basal ganglia habit circuitry and this pathology renders
      PTSD patients susceptible to developing SUD. Moreover, the known effects of addictive drugs
      to further impair prefrontal regulation are synergistic with this pathology, thereby making
      treatment of comorbid PTSD/SUD particularly difficult. Preclinical studies have revealed that
      glutamate levels within the nucleus accumbens have been implicated in drug seeking behavior
      in the animal model of relapse. The amino acid precursor N-acetylcysteine (NAC) appears to
      restore glutamate to normal levels and may also prevent glutamate levels from spiking
      following subsequent stimulant use. The primary goal of the proposed study is to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of N-acetylcysteine in preventing relapse in drug dependent individuals
      with PTSD or subthreshold PTSD. Veterans with substance use disorders who have achieved at
      lease one week of abstinence will be randomized to either placebo or NAC (2400-3600mg/day)
      for 8 weeks.

    <description>Clinician Administered PTSD Scale IV (CAPS) The CAPS IV measures seventeen symptoms based on intensity and frequency. Intensity and frequency scores are summed to create a severity score for each question. Severity scores are summed to get a total score. A higher total score indicates a higher severity of PTSD symptoms.The full range for CAPS IV is 0-136.</description>

    <description>Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) The BDI measures presence and severity of depression. It has 21 questions that are rated from 0-3 with a highest possible score of 63. A higher score indicates a higher severity of depression.</description>

    <measure>Craving</measure>

    <description>PTSD Checklist - Military (PCL-M) The PCL-M is a seventeen question self-report, scored on a scale from 1 to 5, with possible scores ranging from 17 to 85. The scores from each question are summed to get a total score (17-85). A higher total indicates a higher severity of PTSD symptoms.</description>

          <title>Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</title>
          <description>PTSD was measured using the CAPS IV and the PCL-M.
The CAPS IV measures seventeen symptoms based on intensity and frequency. Intensity and frequency scores are summed to create a severity score. Severity scores are summed to get a total score. A higher total score indicates a higher severity of PTSD symptoms. The full range for CAPS IV is 0-136.
The PCL-M is a seventeen question self-report, scored on a scale from 1 to 5, with possible scores from 17 to 85. The scores are summed to get a total score. A higher total indicates a higher severity of PTSD symptoms.</description>

            <groups_desc>A series of hierarchical linear regression analyses were conducted to examine the effects of treatment group (NAC or placebo) on PTSD symptomatology, craving, substance use, and depression. Baseline levels of the respective outcome measures were entered in Step 1 of the model to adjust for any baseline differences. Treatment group was entered as the predictor in Step 2. The significance threshold was set at a p-value of .05 (two-sided) for all statistical tests.</groups_desc>

          <description>Eligible participants were randomized to either NAC (2400 mg/day) or placebo for 8 weeks. The starting dose of NAC was 1200 mg twice daily (2400 mg/day). All NAC and placebo capsules contained riboflavin 25 mg, which was used as a biomarker for medication compliance.
N-acetylcysteine: NAC pills were administered each week. NAC is a N acetyl pro-drug of the naturally-occurring amino acid cystine. NAC is a white, crystalline powder with the molecular formula C5H9NO3S and with a molecular weight of 163.2.</description>

          <title>Placebo</title>
          <description>Identical appearing placebo capsules were dispensed. All NAC and placebo capsules contained riboflavin 25 mg, which was used as a biomarker for medication compliance. Study medications (USP-grade NAC and matched placebo capsules) dispensed to participants by the medical clinician or study staff. Treatment assignment followed a pre-arranged randomization scheme and was carried out by study personnel at the pharmacy (i.e., personnel not involved in clinical management of participants to preserve the double-blind design).
Placebo: Identical looking placebo pills were administered each week.</description>
