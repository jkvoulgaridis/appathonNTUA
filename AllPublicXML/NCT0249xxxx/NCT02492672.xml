  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current registry is being undertaken to assess the long-term (12 month) safety and
      tolerability of Venofer in the pediatric population with chronic kidney disease that requires
      intravenous iron maintenance therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a multicenter, observational, prospective registry collecting long-term
      (12-month) safety, tolerability, and laboratory data. Subjects will be screened for inclusion
      criteria if on hemodialysis (HD), peritoneal dialysis (PD) or have non-dialysis dependent
      (NDD) chronic kidney disease (CKD).

      Treatment-emergent adverse events (adverse events starting from the time of the 1st dose of
      Venofer administered on study) will be collected via site entry of data into a web-based
      system. Each research investigator will be responsible for entering adverse event information
      on the appropriate clinical research form as well as reporting such events to the sponsor.

      Number of Subjects: 50 evaluable subjects (i.e., took at lease one dose of Venofer and have
      safety data recorded at the 12 month time point).
