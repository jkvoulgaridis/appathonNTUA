  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this protocol is to determine the effectiveness of using compounded
      topical pain creams for treating neuropathic, nociceptive, or mixed-pain syndromes. Since
      these compounded pain creams may be associated with burning or irritation at the application
      site, and possible systemic effects may present, the secondary objective is to determine the
      relative satisfaction with the creams. The investigators hypothesis is that the active pain
      creams may provide significant benefit compared to placebo cream.

      3.1 Specific Aims

        1. Specific Aim 1 will determine pain relief following treatment with the appropriate
           (based on specified pain) compounded topical pain cream or a placebo cream. The
           investigators hypothesis is that the compounded topical pain creams will provide greater
           pain relief than placebo creams.

        2. Specific Aim 2 will measure the patient satisfaction with the cream (compound or
           placebo). The investigators hypothesis is that the compounded topical pain creams will
           improve patient satisfaction, while the placebo cream will not result in a change in
           patient satisfaction with their pain treatment.

    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators are attempting to determine whether compounded topical pain
      creams are more effective than placebo; as well as measuring the subjects' satisfaction with
      the compounded pain creams. Three different compounded pain creams (specific to the type of
      pain being treated) will be used to examine effectiveness and satisfaction in treating
      neuropathic, nociceptive, or mixed pain syndromes. Up to 399 subjects will be randomized to
      receive a compounded pain cream or placebo. The type of pain cream to be used will be based
      on the subjects' pain diagnosis. Pain relief will be measured by a 0-10 Numeric Rating Scale
      and satisfaction by a 1-5 Likert Satisfaction Scale. The outcome measures will include a
      'positive outcome' defined as a two point or greater reduction in average pain (as measured
      by a NRS) and a score of greater than 3 (on a 1-5 Likert scale measuring satisfaction) at
      1-month. The investigators will use the Rand Corporation SF-36 to measure changes in health
      status during enrollment. Subjects who obtain benefit at 1-month will be followed at
      3-months, while those who fail to obtain benefit (i.e., ≥ 2 point reduction in NRS with a
      greater than 3 Likert satisfaction score) will exit the study to receive alternative care.
      Patients will be given a pain diary so that their NRS can be calculated at follow up visits.

    <description>The SF-36 is a 36 item Short Form Health Survey that is used to measure changes in health status. It is a set of generic, coherent, and easily administered quality-of-life measures. It is a validated measure of 8 domains including emotional health and physical function, with lower scores translating to greater disability.</description>

    <description>The 5-point Likert Satisfaction Scale is a 5 point scale that is used to measure the subjects opinion/perception of their satisfaction with the compounded product. The scale ranges from 1-5; with 1 denoting &quot;very unsatisfied&quot; and 5 signifying &quot;very satisfied.&quot;</description>

    <description>Subjects with neuropathic pain will receive a neuropathic pain cream combined of Ketamine 10%/Gabapentin 6%/Clonidine 0.2% and Lidocaine 2% or placebo. They will be told to use the pain cream 3 times per day. Each will receive cream in identical dispensers. Cream is dispensed by rotating the base of the device and each rotation also produces a clicking sound. The number of clicks will be standardized so that all doctors utilize the same prescription depending on the size of the patient's pain location.</description>
