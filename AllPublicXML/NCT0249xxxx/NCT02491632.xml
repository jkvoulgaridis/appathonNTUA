  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well physical activity and dexamethasone work in
      reducing cancer-related fatigue in patients with cancer that has spread to other places in
      the body and usually cannot be cured or controlled with treatment (advanced). Dexamethasone
      is approved for the treatment of tiredness, pain, and nausea. Physical activity may help
      improve cancer-related fatigue by improvement in symptoms, distress, and overall well-being.
      It is not yet known whether high dose or low dose dexamethasone combined with physical
      activity works better in reducing fatigue in patients with advanced cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      1. To determine the feasibility, adherence, and satisfaction with physical activity (PA) plus
      dexamethasone (PA+ DEX).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore the preliminary efficacy of PA+ Hi Dex group (PA for 4 weeks plus high dose
      dexamethasone for 1 week) and PA + Lo Dex groups (PA for 4 weeks plus low dose dexamethasone
      for 1 week) on cancer-related fatigue (CRF) as measured by Functional Assessment of Chronic
      Illness Therapy‐Fatigue (FACIT-F) at the end of one week.

      II. To explore the effects of PA+ Hi Dex on the various dimensions of CRF (Patient-Reported
      Outcomes Measurement Information System-Fatigue [PROMIS-F]), i.e., affective/emotional
      (Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale [HADS]); physical/behavioral (the Multidimensional Fatigue
      Symptom Inventory-Short Form [MFSI-SF], Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index), physical activity and
      function (30 second sit-to stand test, six minute walk test) before and after treatment.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive high-dose dexamethasone orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for 7 days.
      Patients also follow a graded resistance exercise program 3 days a week and a walking regimen
      at least 5 days a week for 4 weeks. The frequency, duration, and intensity of the exercises
      will be evaluated and adjusted as necessary.

      ARM II: Patients receive low-dose dexamethasone PO BID for 7 days. Patients also follow a
      graded resistance exercise program 3 days a week and a walking regimen at least 5 days a week
      for 4 weeks. The frequency, duration, and intensity of the exercises will be evaluated and
      adjusted as necessary.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at day 29 and again after 1 month.

    <time_frame>Baseline to 8 days</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by Functional Assessment of Cancer Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F) subscale, a well-validated quality of life instrument. The 13-item fatigue subscale is a patient-rated assessment of intensity of fatigue and its related symptoms on a scale of 0 to 4. This scale has been shown to have strong internal consistency (α = 0.93-0.95), sensitivity of 0.92, and specificity of 0.6923.</description>

    <description>Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory-Short Form (MFSI-SF) consists of 30 items designed to assess the multidimensional nature of fatigue. Ratings are summed to obtain scores for 5 subscales (general fatigue, physical fatigue, emotional fatigue, mental fatigue, and vigor) Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory-Short Form (MFSI-SF) 0-4 (Not at all 0, A little 1, Moderately, Quite a bit 3, Extremely 4)</description>

    <measure>Change in Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System-Fatigue scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 2 months after the last day of physical activity</time_frame>
    <description>Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS F-SF) consists of seven items that measure both the experience of fatigue and the interference of fatigue on daily activities over the past week Examples of items are: &quot;How often did you feel tired,&quot; and &quot;How often were you too tired to take a bath/shower&quot;. Response options are on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 = never to 5 =always. One item, &quot;How often did you have enough energy to exercise strenuously,&quot; is reverse scored. The total score is used in the analysis and is obtained by summing keyed scores of all items. Scores can range from 7 to 35, with higher scores indicating greater fatigue.</description>
