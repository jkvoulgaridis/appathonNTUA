  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single country, multi-center study in participants with ulcerative
      colitis (UC) treated with adalimumab. Up to 147 participants are enrolled at approximately 20
      sites. The baseline assessment is performed prior to the first dose of adalimumab (Visit 1).
      Study visits are conducted at weeks 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48 and 56 after baseline in accordance
      with clinical practice. All participants will have one Follow-up for safety approximately 70
      days after the last dose of adalimumab.

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single-country, multi-center study in UC patients treated with
      adalimumab. The prescription of adalimumab is at the discretion of the physician in
      accordance with clinical practice and label, is made independently from this study, and
      preceded the decision to offer the patient the opportunity to participate in this study.

      Up to 147 subjects are planned to be enrolled at approximately 20 sites. The baseline
      assessment is performed prior to the first dose of adalimumab (Visit 1). Participants are
      administered adalimumab 160 mg at Week 0, 80 mg at Week 2, and then 40 mg every other week
      per the Korean label. Study visits are conducted at Weeks 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48 and 56 after
      baseline in accordance with clinical practice. All participants had one Follow-up for safety
      approximately 70 days after the last dose of adalimumab.

      Clinical response is assessed at Week 8, and participants with clinical response at Week 8
      can continue on adalimumab treatment as per Korean reimbursement guidelines. Clinical
      response is defined as a decrease from baseline in the total Mayo score by at least 3 points
      and at least 30% with an accompanying decrease in rectal bleeding subscore of at least 1
      point or absolute rectal bleeding sub-score of 0 or 1.

    <description>Durable clinical response was defined as reduction in complete Full Mayo score of ≥3 points and ≥30% from Baseline (Week 0) with an accompanying decrease in rectal bleeding subscore of ≥1 point or absolute rectal bleeding subscore of ≤1 point at both Week 8 and 56. Clinical response was defined as reduction in complete full Mayo score of ≥3 points and ≥30% from Baseline (Week 0) with decrease in rectal bleeding subscore of ≥1 point or absolute rectal bleeding subscore of ≤1 point at Week 8. The Mayo score is a tool designed to measure disease activity for ulcerative colitis. The Mayo score ranges from 0 (normal or inactive disease) to 12 (severe disease) and is calculated as the sum of 3 subscores (stool frequency, rectal bleeding, endoscopy, and physician's global assessment [PGA]), each of which ranges from 0 (normal) to 3 (severe disease).

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Were Week 8 Responders With Durable Clinical Response at Week 56</title>
        <description>Durable clinical response was defined as reduction in complete Full Mayo score of ≥3 points and ≥30% from Baseline (Week 0) with an accompanying decrease in rectal bleeding subscore of ≥1 point or absolute rectal bleeding subscore of ≤1 point at both Week 8 and 56. Clinical response was defined as reduction in complete full Mayo score of ≥3 points and ≥30% from Baseline (Week 0) with decrease in rectal bleeding subscore of ≥1 point or absolute rectal bleeding subscore of ≤1 point at Week 8. The Mayo score is a tool designed to measure disease activity for ulcerative colitis. The Mayo score ranges from 0 (normal or inactive disease) to 12 (severe disease) and is calculated as the sum of 3 subscores (stool frequency, rectal bleeding, endoscopy, and physician's global assessment [PGA]), each of which ranges from 0 (normal) to 3 (severe disease). A negative change in Mayo score indicates improvement.</description>

Clinical response was defined as reduction in complete full Mayo score of ≥3 points and ≥30% from Baseline (Week 0) with decrease in rectal bleeding subscore of ≥1 point or absolute rectal bleeding subscore of ≤1 point at Week 8. The Mayo score is a tool designed to measure disease activity for ulcerative colitis.

Clinical response was defined as reduction in complete full Mayo score of ≥ 3 points and ≥ 30% from Baseline (Week 0) with an accompanying decrease in rectal bleeding subscore of ≥ 1 point or absolute rectal bleeding subscore of ≤ 1 point at Week 8.

          <description>Steroid free response was defined as participants who were in clinical response without the use of systemic steroids within the past 8 weeks prior to assessment (in Week 8 clinical responders).Clinical response was defined as reduction in complete full Mayo score of ≥ 3 points and ≥ 30% from Baseline (Week 0) with an accompanying decrease in rectal bleeding subscore of ≥ 1 point or absolute rectal bleeding subscore of ≤ 1 point at Week 8. The Mayo score is a tool designed to measure disease activity for ulcerative colitis. The Mayo score ranges from 0 (normal or inactive disease) to 12 (severe disease) and is calculated as the sum of 3 subscores (stool frequency, rectal bleeding, endoscopy, and PGA), each of which ranges from 0 (normal) to 3 (severe disease). A negative change in Mayo score indicates improvement.</description>

          <title>Change in Full Mayo Score From Baseline to Week 8 in Participants Who Were Clinical Responders at Week 56</title>
          <description>Clinical response was defined as reduction in complete full Mayo score of ≥ 3 points and ≥ 30% from Baseline (Week 0) with an accompanying decrease in rectal bleeding subscore of ≥ 1 point or absolute rectal bleeding subscore of ≤ 1 point at Week 8. The Mayo score is a tool designed to measure disease activity for ulcerative colitis. The Mayo score ranges from 0 (normal or inactive disease) to 12 (severe disease) and is calculated as the sum of 3 subscores (stool frequency, rectal bleeding, endoscopy, and physician's global assessment [PGA]), each of which ranges from 0 (normal) to 3 (severe disease). A negative change in Mayo score indicates improvement.</description>

        <description>Fecal calprotectin is an indicator of inflammation in the colon with higher levels indicative of higher levels of inflammation. Clinical response was defined as reduction in complete full Mayo score of ≥3 points and ≥30% from Baseline (Week 0) with an accompanying decrease in rectal bleeding subscore of ≥1 point or absolute rectal bleeding subscore of ≤1 point at Week 8. The Mayo score is a tool designed to measure disease activity for ulcerative colitis. The Mayo score ranges from 0 (normal or inactive disease) to 12 (severe disease) and is calculated as the sum of 3 subscores (stool frequency, rectal bleeding, endoscopy, and PGA), each of which ranges from 0 (normal) to 3 (severe disease). A negative change in Mayo score indicates improvement.</description>

        <description>Composition of fecal microbiota (16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) gene sequencing) was measured at Week 0, Week 8, and Week 56. Fecal bacterial composition was determined using 16S sequencing. The obtained sequences were analyzed using the Ezbiocloud database and 16S microbiome pipeline to assess composition and diversity.</description>

      <time_frame>Safety data were collected from the time of the participant's registration into the study until 70 days after study completion. Serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported to AbbVie from the time the physician obtained the participant's authorization to use and disclose information (or the participant's informed consent) until 70 days following the intake of the last dose of adalimumab taken during the study.</time_frame>
      <desc>As per the study protocol, all SAEs and adverse events (AEs) leading to adalimumab discontinuation were actively solicited. Any non-serious AEs were collected as spontaneous reports if AbbVie was notified. All SAEs and AEs leading to adalimumab discontinuation during this study period were reported to AbbVie regardless of their causal relationship to adalimumab.</desc>
