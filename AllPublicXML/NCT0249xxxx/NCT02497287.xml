  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (the researchers and participants know the treatment the participant is
      receiving), multicenter (more than 1 study site), long-term safety and efficacy study of
      intranasal esketamine plus an oral antidepressant in participants with treatment-resistant
      depression (TRD). Participants will enter the study either directly (direct-entry
      participants) or after completing the Double-Blind Induction Phase of ESKETINTRD3005
      (transferred-entry participants). The study consists of 4 phases: Screening Phase (4 weeks),
      Open-Label Induction Phase (4 weeks), Open-Label Optimization/Maintenance phase (48 weeks),
      and Follow up Phase (4 weeks). Transferred entry non-responders in the ESKETINTRD3005 may
      enter study at the Open-Label Induction Phase and responders in the ESKETINTRD3005 may enter
      Optimization/Maintenance phase. In the Open-Label Induction Phase, participants will
      self-administer flexibly-dosed intranasal esketamine (participants who are less than (&lt;) 65
      years old self-administer 56 mg or 84 mg dose, participants who are greater than or equal to
      (&gt;=) 65 years old self-administer 28 mg, 56 mg or 84 mg dose) twice weekly for 4 weeks. The
      starting dose for all participants &gt;= 65 years old will be 28 mg. In addition, each
      direct-entry participants will be assigned to receive 1 of 4 selected oral antidepressant
      medications (escitalopram or sertraline or duloxetine or venlafaxine extended release [XR]),
      initiated on Day 1 of the open-label induction phase and continued through the duration of
      the study. Transferred-entry participants will continue their same antidepressant from
      ESKETINTRD3005 through the duration of this study. Participants who are responders at the end
      of the Open-Label Induction phase and transferred-entry responder participants (from study
      ESKETINTRD3005) will enter the Optimization/Maintenance Phase where intranasal esketamine
      treatment sessions will be reduced from that in the induction phase (twice weekly) to weekly
      for the first 4 weeks of this phase, and then individualized to either once weekly or once
      every other week based on the severity of depressive symptoms. Participants' safety and
      depressive symptoms will be assessed and monitored throughout the study.

    <time_frame>Baseline (IND) up to the Endpoint (last post-baseline assessment value during 52 weeks of OP/MA Phase)</time_frame>
    <description>Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT) measures performance in verbal memory, learning, and long-term recall in which a list of words is read up to three times. Approximately 20-25 minutes later, a delayed recall trial and a recognition trial are completed. The delayed recall requires free recall of any words remembered. The recognition trial is composed of 24 words, including the 12 target words and 12 false-positives. When scoring the HVLT, the three learning trials are combined to calculate a total recall score (0-36); the delayed recall trial creates the delayed recall score (0 -12); the retention (%) score (0-100%) is calculated by dividing the delayed recall trial by the higher of learning trial 2 or 3; and the recognition discrimination index is comprised by subtracting the total number of false positives from the total number of true positives. A higher score = higher cognition.</description>

The first three items assess disruption of (1) work/school, (2) social life, and (3) family life/home responsibilities using a 0 to 10 rating scale. The score for the first three items are summed to create a total score of 0 to 30 where a higher score indicates greater impairment and a negative change in score indicates improvement. Missing data was imputed using LOCF method and the last post baseline observation during the phase was carried forward as the &quot;Endpoint&quot;.</description>

    <description>Response is defined as greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 50 % reduction from baseline in the MADRS total score. MADRS measures depression severity, detects changes due to AD treatment. It consists 10 items (evaluate apparent sadness, reported sadness, inner tension, sleep, appetite, concentration, lassitude, interest level, pessimistic thoughts, suicidal thoughts), scored from 0 (item not present or normal) to 6 (severe or continuous presence of the symptoms), summed for a total possible score of 0 to 60. Higher scores indicate more severe condition. Negative change in score indicates improvement.

    <description>Response is defined as &gt;= 50 % reduction from baseline (IND phase) in PHQ-9 total score. PHQ-9 is a 9-item, self-reporting scale assessing depressive symptoms. Each item was rated on a 4-point scale (0 = Not at all, 1 = Several Days, 2 = More than half the days, and 3 = Nearly every day), with a total score range of 0-27. The scores are summed for a total score ranging from 0-27. A higher score indicates greater severity of depression. Severity of PHQ-9 categorized as follows: none-minimal (0-4), mild (5-9), moderate (10-14), moderately severe (15-19), severe (20-27). The recall period is 2 weeks. Negative change in score indicates improvement.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>In this study participants from study ESKETINTRD3005 (NCT02422186) were enrolled (transferred entry [TE]). ESKETINTRD3005 is referred as TRD3005 in the draft.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Total 802 participants were enrolled (direct-entry [DE]=691 + TE from study ESKETINTRD3005 =111). Among 111 TE participants, 88 participants (non-responders from ESKETINTRD3005) joined induction (IND) phase and 23 participants (responders from ESKETINTRD3005) did not join IND phase and directly entered in optimization/maintenance (OP/MA) phase.</pre_assignment_details>

        <group group_id="P1">
          <title>Intranasal Esketamine + Oral Antidepressant</title>
          <description>Participants enrolled directly or TRD3005 non-responders self-administered intranasal Esketamine (Esk) twice a week for 4 weeks as age dependent flexible dose according to titration regimen for 56 or 84 milligram (mg) (&lt;65 years) and 28, 56 or 84 mg (&gt;=65 years) in IND phase. Participants who met response criteria at end of IND phase, entered OP/MA phase and received intranasal esketamine weekly from week 5-8 of OP/MA phase. From Week 9-52, participants received Esk either weekly or every other week based on MADRS score. TE (TRD3005 responders) joined OP/MA phase and received intranasal Esk 28, 56 or 84 mg weekly until week 8. DE participants initiated new oral antidepressant (AD) (1 of: duloxetine/escitalopram/sertraline/venlafaxine extended release [XR]) on Day 1 of IND phase and continued during IND and OP/MA phase. TE participants continued same oral AD from TRD3005. No intranasal Esk was given in follow-up phase and same oral AD was continued at investigator’s clinical judgement.</description>

Participants who met response criteria at end of IND phase, entered OP/MA phase and received intranasal esketamine weekly from week 5-8 of OP/MA phase. From Week 9-52, participants received Esk either weekly or every other week based on MADRS score. TE (TRD3005 responders) joined OP/MA phase and received intranasal Esk 28, 56 or 84 mg weekly until week 8. DE participants initiated new oral antidepressant (AD) (1 of: duloxetine/escitalopram/sertraline/venlafaxine extended release [XR]) on Day 1 of IND phase and continued during IND and OP/MA phase. TE participants continued same oral AD from TRD3005. No intranasal Esk was given in follow-up phase and same oral AD was continued at investigator’s clinical judgement.</description>

        <description>This battery is a series of computerized cognition tests (detection, identification, one card learning, one back and groton maze learning) designed to measure reaction time, visual learning and memory, and executive function/sequencing. The DET is a measure of psychomotor function and uses a well-validated simple reaction time. In this outcome measure, speed of performance of participants (calculated as mean of the logarithmic base 10 transformed reaction times) for correct responses was reported. Total score ranges from 2 to 3.3 log 10 milliseconds (msec). Lower score indicates better performance. Higher change from baseline indicates better performance.</description>

Participants who met response criteria at end of IND phase, entered OP/MA phase and received intranasal esketamine weekly from week 5-8 of OP/MA phase. From Week 9-52, participants received Esk either weekly or every other week based on MADRS score. TE (TRD3005 responders) joined OP/MA phase and received intranasal Esk 28, 56 or 84 mg weekly until week 8. DE participants initiated new oral antidepressant (AD) (1 of: duloxetine/escitalopram/sertraline/venlafaxine extended release [XR]) on Day 1 of IND phase and continued during IND and OP/MA phase. TE participants continued same oral AD from TRD3005. No intranasal Esk was given in follow-up phase and same oral AD was continued at investigator’s clinical judgement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R) Score: Total Recall</title>
        <description>Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT) measures performance in verbal memory, learning, and long-term recall in which a list of words is read up to three times. Approximately 20-25 minutes later, a delayed recall trial and a recognition trial are completed. The delayed recall requires free recall of any words remembered. The recognition trial is composed of 24 words, including the 12 target words and 12 false-positives. When scoring the HVLT, the three learning trials are combined to calculate a total recall score (0-36); the delayed recall trial creates the delayed recall score (0 -12); the retention (%) score (0-100%) is calculated by dividing the delayed recall trial by the higher of learning trial 2 or 3; and the recognition discrimination index is comprised by subtracting the total number of false positives from the total number of true positives. A higher score = higher cognition.</description>

When scoring the HVLT, the three learning trials are combined to calculate a total recall score (0-36); the delayed recall trial creates the delayed recall score (0 -12); the retention (%) score (0-100%) is calculated by dividing the delayed recall trial by the higher of learning trial 2 or 3; and the recognition discrimination index is comprised by subtracting the total number of false positives from the total number of true positives. A higher score = higher cognition.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Endpoint in Patient Health Questionnaire - 9 (PHQ-9) Total Score During IND Phase</title>
        <description>PHQ-9 is a 9-item, self-reporting scale assessing depressive symptoms. Each item was rated on a 4-point scale (0 = Not at all, 1 = Several Days, 2 = More than half the days, and 3 = Nearly every day), with a total score range of 0-27. A higher score indicates greater severity of depression. Severity of PHQ-9 categorized as follows: none-minimal (0-4), mild (5-9), moderate (10-14), moderately severe (15-19), severe (20-27). The recall period is 2 weeks. Negative change in score indicates improvement. Missing data was imputed using LOCF method and the last post baseline observation during the phase was carried forward as the &quot;Endpoint&quot;.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Endpoint in GAD-7 Total Score During OP/MA Phase</title>
        <description>GAD-7 is brief and validated 7-item self-reported assessment of overall anxiety. Participants respond to each item using a 4 point scale with response categories: 0=not at all, 1=several days, 2=more than half the days, and 3=nearly every day. Item responses are summed to yield a total score ranges from 0 to 21, higher scores indicate more anxiety. Negative change in score indicates improvement. Severity of the GAD-7 is categorized as follows: None (0-4), Mild (5-9), Moderate (10-14), Severe (15 -21). Missing data was imputed using LOCF method and the last post baseline observation during the phase was carried forward as the &quot;Endpoint&quot;.</description>

        <description>EQ-5D-5L consists of EQ-5D-5L descriptive system and EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS). EQ-5D-5L descriptive system comprises of 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each has 5 levels of perceived problems (1-no problem, 2-slight problems, 3-moderate problems, 4-severe problems, 5-extreme problems). Participant selects answer for each of 5 dimensions considering response that best matches his/her health &quot;today&quot;. Responses were used to generate a Health Status Index (HSI). HSI ranges from -0.148 to 0.949 and is anchored at 0 (health state value equal to dead) and 1 (full health). EQ VAS self-rating records the respondent's own assessment of his/her overall health status at time of completion, on a scale of 0 (worst health you can imagine) to 100 (best health you can imagine). Sum score ranges from 0 to 100 where, sum score = (sum of the scores from the 5 dimensions minus 5) *5. Higher score indicates worst health state.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Response as Assessed by PHQ-9 Total Score During IND Phase</title>
        <description>Response is defined as &gt;= 50 % reduction from baseline (IND phase) in PHQ-9 total score. PHQ-9 is a 9-item, self-reporting scale assessing depressive symptoms. Each item was rated on a 4-point scale (0 = Not at all, 1 = Several Days, 2 = More than half the days, and 3 = Nearly every day), with a total score range of 0-27. The scores are summed for a total score ranging from 0-27. A higher score indicates greater severity of depression. Severity of PHQ-9 categorized as follows: none-minimal (0-4), mild (5-9), moderate (10-14), moderately severe (15-19), severe (20-27). The recall period is 2 weeks. Negative change in score indicates improvement. Missing data was imputed using LOCF method and the last post baseline observation during the phase was carried forward as the &quot;Endpoint&quot;.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With an Increase Score From Predose at Any Time in Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale (CADSS) Total Score During IND Phase</title>
        <description>The CADSS used to measure present-state dissociative symptoms, and to assess treatment-emergent dissociative symptoms. It comprises 23 subjective items divided into 3 components: depersonalization (with score range from 0 to 28), derealization (with score range from 0 to 52), and amnesia (with score range from 0 to 8). Participants responses are coded on a 5-point scale (0 = &quot;Not at all&quot;, 1 = &quot;Mild&quot;, 2 = &quot;Moderate&quot;, 3 = 'Severe&quot; and 4 = &quot;Extreme&quot;). The total score is sum of the 23 items and range from 0 to 92, where 0 (best) and 92 (worst). A higher score indicates a more severe condition.</description>
        <time_frame>Predose, up to 1.5 hours postdose (up to end of IND phase [Week 4])</time_frame>
        <population>The full (IND) analysis set included all participants who received at least 1 dose of intranasal study medication or 1 dose of oral AD in open-label IND phase (for direct-entry and transferred-entry non-responder participants). Here, 'N' (number of participants analyzed) signifies those participants who were evaluable for this outcome measure.</population>
