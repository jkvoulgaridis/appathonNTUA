  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Invasive fungal infections (IFI) in immunocompromised patients pose a major challenge for
      diagnostics designed to permit timely onset of appropriate treatment. The aim of the current
      clinical-diagnostic studies, one in in pediatric and one in adult patients at high risk of
      IFI, is to test newly developed diagnostic approaches to invasive fungal infections in
      relation to established procedures. The studies will be performed in a prospective, blinded
      fashion, and represent a work package within the FUNGITECT grant supported by the European
      Commission. The studies will focus on analyses of blood-samples from patients with febrile
      neutropenia during treatment of acute leukaemia and other tumour entities, and patients
      undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation treated with intensive chemotherapy.

      Samples from immunosuppressed patients with febrile neutropenia (NP - defined as fever ≥
      38.5ºC and &lt;500 ANC) will be taken:

        -  at the start of neutropenic fever

        -  after 24 hours

        -  after 48 hours

        -  before the start of antimycotic therapy, if pertinent

        -  at the end of antimycotic therapy, if pertinent

      The results ot analyses by a panfungal PCR screening assay developed at our institution
      (European patent No 1960536) and methods newly developed during the FUNGITECT project will be
      compared with conventional methods for fungal diagnostics such as HR (High Resolution)-CT,
      serological testing, histology and fungal culture. Additionally, genomic approaches will be
      employed to investigate host- and pathogen-related factors of susceptibility, pathogenicity
      and antimycotic resistance.
