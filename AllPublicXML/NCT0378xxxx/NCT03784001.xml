  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gratitude - an emotion felt when an individual receives something beneficial from other
      people or entities - has been shown to positively affect well-being. Beginning in 2003,
      &quot;count your blessings&quot; interventions - in which participants list items they are grateful
      for, and gratitude letter writing interventions were designed to cultivate gratitude.
      Gratitude interventions have many positive outcomes; they can increase well-being and life
      satisfaction (Froh, Sefick, &amp; Emmons, 2008) and increase self-esteem (Rash, Matsuba, &amp;
      Prkachin, 2011) to name a few.

      Knowing the benefits of gratitude prior to an intervention could affect participant behavior
      and health outcomes. Past studies have illustrated that sharing information about treatments
      changes expectations and improves outcomes (Zion &amp; Crum, 2018). For instance, overt medical
      treatments are more effective than hidden ones (Colloca, Lopiano, Lanotte, &amp; Benedetti,
      2004).

      The proposed study is designed to evaluate whether expectations about intervention efficacy
      can enhance the benefits of a brief gratitude intervention. Specifically, the investigators
      will test if providing information on the benefits of gratitude will enhance intervention
      outcomes. This 3-armed randomized controlled trial will have the following conditions:
      gratitude + expectation, gratitude, and events control. Participants will be undergraduate
      college students and the online intervention will last two weeks.

      Participants in the two gratitude conditions will login to an online form three times a week
      for two weeks and make entries of up to five things they are grateful for. The form for
      participants in the gratitude + expectation condition will also provide information about
      benefits of gratitude. An everyday events control will be used to provide a neutral
      comparison condition. This group will be instructed to type up to five things or events of
      note from their day on their form.

      Outcome measures will be collected via an online survey before and immediately after the
      intervention. The primary outcome is well-being and the secondary outcomes are sleep quality
      and quantity, state gratitude, positive affect, healthcare self-efficacy, stress, and
      depressive symptoms. The investigators predict that participants in the gratitude +
      expectation condition will have enhanced intervention outcomes compared to participants in
      comparison conditions.

      Overview: Potential participants will be recruited from an undergraduate psychology class.
      Participants will have one week after initial study advertisement to read the consent form
      and decide if they wish to participate. When participants turn in a signed consent form, they
      will be officially enrolled in the study and issued a personal identification (PI) number to
      use throughout the study.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three conditions: gratitude + expectations,
      gratitude, or an everyday events control condition. Participants will be emailed six
      different times, once every two days, with a link to an anonymous Google form. Each Google
      form will instruct participants to type either a short gratitude list (for gratitude +
      expectations and gratitude conditions) or an events list (for everyday events control), and
      will have a section for participants to enter their personal identification numbers.
      Additionally, the first form will include a demographics questionnaire and the first and
      sixth forms will include questionnaires assessing all outcomes of interest.The primary
      outcome of interest is well-being. The secondary outcomes of interest are sleep, state
      gratitude, healthcare self-efficacy, stress, and depressive symptoms.

      Participants in the gratitude + expectations condition will have a statement at the top of
      their Google form about the benefits of gratitude. Examples of these statements are:
      &quot;Practicing gratitude may increase social connectedness&quot; and &quot;Cultivating gratitude was shown
      to improve school satisfaction in a sample of students&quot;. By the end of the study,
      participants will have completed six gratitude or everyday events lists and two
      questionnaires.

      Interventions:

        1. Gratitude + No Expectations: Participants in the gratitude condition will practice a
           counting your blessings intervention for two weeks. Participants will be instructed to
           list up to five things they are grateful for every two days for the two weeks of the
           intervention (six times total).

        2. Gratitude + expectations: Participants in this condition will be given the same
           instructions as the gratitude condition and will also be given the regular reminders of
           the benefits of gratitude.

        3. Everyday events: Participants will be instructed to list up to five details about their
           day, such as activities they engaged in, or conversations they had. Participants will
           make these lists every two days for two weeks (six times total).

      Questionnaires:

      Self-report questionnaires with high test-retest reliability and internal validity will be
      administered at baseline and post intervention to access changes in outcomes of interest,
      such as well-being, depressive symptoms, and anxiety.

      Questionnaires administered only at baseline: Communication and Attitudinal Self-Efficacy
      Scale (CASE) and demographic questionnaire

      Questionnaires administered pre- and post-intervention: Mental Health Continuum-Short Form,
      Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Sleep Disturbance Scale,
      Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) duration items, Modified Differential Emotions Scale,
      Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), Perceived Stress Scale 4

    <measure>Mental Health Continuum-Short Form (MHC-SF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at Pre- and Post- Intervention (2 weeks apart)</time_frame>
    <description>Hedonic well-being, eudaimonic well-being, and overall well-being were assessed at baseline and post-intervention. Well-being was measured with the Mental Health Continuum-Short Form (MHC-SF; Keyes, 2009). Participants rated how often they felt 14 different emotions or statements, such as &quot;happy&quot; and &quot;satisfied with life&quot;. Items are rated on a 6-point likert scale (0 = never, 5 = everyday). This measure assesses both hedonic and eudaimonic well-being. The MHC-SF is both reliable and valid for use with young adults (Robitschek &amp; Keyes, 2009). Total scores are created by the sum of scores for all 14 items, with a range of 0-70. Higher scores indicate greater overall well-being.</description>

    <description>Well-being was measured with the Mental Health Continuum-Short Form (MHC-SF; Keyes, 2009). Participants rated how often they felt 14 different emotions or statements, such as &quot;happy&quot; and &quot;satisfied with life&quot;. Items are rated on a 6-point likert scale (0 = never, 5 = everyday), with higher numbers indicating greater well-being. This measure assesses both hedonic and eudaimonic well-being. The MHC-SF is both reliable and valid for use with young adults (Robitschek &amp; Keyes, 2009). The Hedonic Well-Being Subscale is the sum of items 1-3 on the Mental Health Continuum Short-Form. Total scores range from 0-15, with higher scores indicating greater hedonic well-being. Scoring a 4 or 5 on at least one of the 3 items on the Hedonic Well-Being Subscale indicates a diagnosis of flourishing mental health.</description>

    <measure>Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Sleep Disturbance Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at Pre- and Post- Intervention (2 weeks apart)</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep quality was measured with the 8-item PROMIS sleep disturbance short form (Yu et al., 2012). Participants rated their level of agreement with eight different statements about their sleep in the past seven days such as &quot;My sleep was restless&quot; and &quot;I had difficulty falling asleep&quot;. Participants rated each item on a 5 point scale (1 = not at all, 5 = very much). Items 2, 3, 7, and 8 were reverse scored. The total score of the PROMIS Sleep Disturbance Scale is the sum of the scores for all 8 items. Total scores range from 8-40, with higher scores indicating more severe sleep disturbance.</description>

    <measure>Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) Duration Items</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at Pre- and Post- Intervention (2 weeks apart)</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep quantity was measured with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index Duration Items (PSQI-4), which asks participants questions such as when they went to bed and when they woke up in the morning (Buysse et al., 1989). PSQI duration items are questions 1-4 on the PSQI, which measure how much sleep respondents have been getting. Higher hours of sleep is a better outcome.</description>

    <measure>Modified Differential Emotions Scale (MDES): Positive Emotions Subscale</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at Pre- and Post- Intervention (2 weeks apart)</time_frame>
    <description>Positive affect was measured with the ten-item Positive Emotions (PE) subscale of the Modified Differential Emotions Scale (mDES) (Fredrickson, Tugade, Waugh, and Larkin, 2003). Participants rated how often they felt ten different groups of positive emotions such as &quot;amused, fun-loving, silly&quot; on a 5-point scale (0 = not at all, 4 = most of the time). The average of the items was calculated to measure positive affect, with higher numbers indicating greater positive affect.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived Stress Scale - 4 (PSS-4)</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at Pre- and Post- Intervention (2 weeks apart)</time_frame>
    <description>Stress was measured with the 4-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-4; Cohen, Kamarack, and Mermelstein, 1983). Participants rated how often they felt a certain way in the last week on four different items such as &quot;How often have you felt confident about your ability to handle your personal problems?&quot; and &quot;How often have you felt that things were going your way?&quot; on a 5- point scale (0 = never, 4 = very often). The total score of the PSS-4 is the sum of all 4 items. Total scores range from 0-16, and higher scores indicate greater perceived stress.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D)</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at Pre- and Post- Intervention (2 weeks apart)</time_frame>
    <description>Depressive symptoms were measured by the Center for Epidemiological Studies - Depression Scale (CES-D, Radloff, 1977). Participants rated how often they experienced 20 different statements such as &quot;I was bothered by things that usually don't bother me&quot; and &quot;I felt like everything I did was an effort&quot; in the past week. Participants scored each item on a 4-point scale (0 = rarely or none of the time 3 = all of the time). The total score for the CES-D is the sum of all 20 items, with a range of 0-60, with higher scores indicating greater depressive symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Modified Differential Emotions Scale (MDES): State Gratitude</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at Pre- and Post- Intervention (2 weeks apart)</time_frame>
    <description>State gratitude was measured with item one of the mDES (Fredrickson, Tugade, Waugh, and Larkin, 2003), which asks participants how often they felt &quot;grateful, appreciative, or thankful&quot; in the past two weeks. Participants rated this item on a 5-point scale (0 = not at all, 4 = most of the time), with a higher number indicating higher feelings of gratitude.</description>

        <title>Mental Health Continuum-Short Form (MHC-SF)</title>
        <description>Hedonic well-being, eudaimonic well-being, and overall well-being were assessed at baseline and post-intervention. Well-being was measured with the Mental Health Continuum-Short Form (MHC-SF; Keyes, 2009). Participants rated how often they felt 14 different emotions or statements, such as &quot;happy&quot; and &quot;satisfied with life&quot;. Items are rated on a 6-point likert scale (0 = never, 5 = everyday). This measure assesses both hedonic and eudaimonic well-being. The MHC-SF is both reliable and valid for use with young adults (Robitschek &amp; Keyes, 2009). Total scores are created by the sum of scores for all 14 items, with a range of 0-70. Higher scores indicate greater overall well-being.</description>

        <description>Well-being was measured with the Mental Health Continuum-Short Form (MHC-SF; Keyes, 2009). Participants rated how often they felt 14 different emotions or statements, such as &quot;happy&quot; and &quot;satisfied with life&quot;. Items are rated on a 6-point likert scale (0 = never, 5 = everyday), with higher numbers indicating greater well-being. This measure assesses both hedonic and eudaimonic well-being. The MHC-SF is both reliable and valid for use with young adults (Robitschek &amp; Keyes, 2009). The Hedonic Well-Being Subscale is the sum of items 1-3 on the Mental Health Continuum Short-Form. Total scores range from 0-15, with higher scores indicating greater hedonic well-being. Scoring a 4 or 5 on at least one of the 3 items on the Hedonic Well-Being Subscale indicates a diagnosis of flourishing mental health.</description>

Gratitude + Expectations Intervention: Participants will be emailed six different times, once every two days, with a link to an anonymous Google form. Each Google form will instruct participants to type a short gratitude list of up to five items. Participants will have a statement at the top of their Google form about the benefits of gratitude. Examples of these statements are: “Practicing gratitude may increase social connectedness” and “Cultivating gratitude was shown to improve school satisfaction in a UK sample of students”.</description>

          <title>Mental Health Continuum-Short Form (MHC-SF): Hedonic Well-Being SubScale</title>
          <description>Well-being was measured with the Mental Health Continuum-Short Form (MHC-SF; Keyes, 2009). Participants rated how often they felt 14 different emotions or statements, such as &quot;happy&quot; and &quot;satisfied with life&quot;. Items are rated on a 6-point likert scale (0 = never, 5 = everyday), with higher numbers indicating greater well-being. This measure assesses both hedonic and eudaimonic well-being. The MHC-SF is both reliable and valid for use with young adults (Robitschek &amp; Keyes, 2009). The Hedonic Well-Being Subscale is the sum of items 1-3 on the Mental Health Continuum Short-Form. Total scores range from 0-15, with higher scores indicating greater hedonic well-being. Scoring a 4 or 5 on at least one of the 3 items on the Hedonic Well-Being Subscale indicates a diagnosis of flourishing mental health.</description>

        <description>Sleep quality was measured with the 8-item PROMIS sleep disturbance short form (Yu et al., 2012). Participants rated their level of agreement with eight different statements about their sleep in the past seven days such as &quot;My sleep was restless&quot; and &quot;I had difficulty falling asleep&quot;. Participants rated each item on a 5 point scale (1 = not at all, 5 = very much). Items 2, 3, 7, and 8 were reverse scored. The total score of the PROMIS Sleep Disturbance Scale is the sum of the scores for all 8 items. Total scores range from 8-40, with higher scores indicating more severe sleep disturbance.</description>

Participants rated how often they felt ten different groups of positive emotions such as &quot;amused, fun-loving, silly&quot; on a 5-point scale (0 = not at all, 4 = most of the time). The average of the items was calculated to measure positive affect, with higher numbers indicating greater positive affect.</description>

          <title>Modified Differential Emotions Scale (MDES): Positive Emotions Subscale</title>
          <description>Positive affect was measured with the ten-item Positive Emotions (PE) subscale of the Modified Differential Emotions Scale (mDES) (Fredrickson, Tugade, Waugh, and Larkin, 2003). Participants rated how often they felt ten different groups of positive emotions such as &quot;amused, fun-loving, silly&quot; on a 5-point scale (0 = not at all, 4 = most of the time). The average of the items was calculated to measure positive affect, with higher numbers indicating greater positive affect.</description>

        <description>Stress was measured with the 4-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-4; Cohen, Kamarack, and Mermelstein, 1983). Participants rated how often they felt a certain way in the last week on four different items such as &quot;How often have you felt confident about your ability to handle your personal problems?&quot; and &quot;How often have you felt that things were going your way?&quot; on a 5- point scale (0 = never, 4 = very often). The total score of the PSS-4 is the sum of all 4 items. Total scores range from 0-16, and higher scores indicate greater perceived stress.</description>
