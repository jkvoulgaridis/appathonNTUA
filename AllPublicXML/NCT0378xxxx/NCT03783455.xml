  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BACKGROUND: Current medical treatment strategies for knee osteoarthritis (OA) are aimed at
      pain reduction and symptom control. The Non-Arthroscopic Joint Lavage (NAJL) is included
      inside the therapeutic algorithm of knee OA when other therapies are contraindicated or have
      lost effectiveness. The large variety of potentially invasive interventions available (joint
      lavage included) has raised the need to assess their efficacy. The objective of this study is
      to compare the short-term effectiveness of five treatment strategies in patients with knee
      osteoarthritis (OA).

      METHODS: It was conducted a randomized prospective study involving 150 patients of whom 76.7%
      were females. The age range was 40-81 years. All patients had knee OA according to the
      American College of Rheumatology criteria, with Kellgren-Lawrence radiographic grades II and
      III. Patients were assigned to five groups, 1) non-arthroscopic joint lavage (NAJL) (n= 30),
      2) NAJL plus hyaluronic acid (HA) (n= 32), 3) NAJL plus corticosteroid (CS) (n= 32), 4) HA
      (n= 31), 5) CS (n= 25). Evaluations took place at baseline, one and three months after
      enrollment. Demographic variables, Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis
      Index (WOMAC) and Lequesne scores were recorded. Statistical analysis included mixed analysis
      of variance, post-hoc comparisons with Sidak's adjustment, and multiple linear regression
      using as outcome WOMAC total at 3 months.

      TRIAL REGISTRATION: The protocol of the study was approved by the &quot;Hospital Universitario
      Reina Sofía&quot; Ethics Committee, under the number 1996, in the Minutes 208 of 29 May 2012.

    <measure>WOMAC 3.1 Index total</measure>
    <time_frame>WOMAC total at 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The WOMAC (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities) index is used to assess patients with osteoarthritis of the hip or knee and contains 24 questions, targeting areas of pain, stiffness and physical function. It can be used to monitor the course of the disease or to determine the effectiveness of anti-rheumatic medications. In the study it was used the validated Spanish version of the 5-point adjectival scale format (possible answers are none -0 points-, slight -1 point-, moderate -2 points-, severe -3 points- and extreme -4 points-). The WOMAC measures five items for pain (score range 0-20), two for stiffness (score range 0-8), and 17 for functional limitation (score range 0-68). WOMAC total is the sum of the three components and it ranges from 0 to 96 points, being 96 the worst outcome.</description>

    <time_frame>baseline, at one month and at three months</time_frame>
    <description>Lequesne Index is a ten question questionnaire that asseses pain and function in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee. It is composed by five questions about pain, being three of them from 0 to 2, and two of them from 0 to 1 point, two questions about maximum distance walked (from 0 to 6 points one and from 0 to 2 the second) and four questions about activities of daily living (from 0 to 2). The total values is the sum of all questions points and range from 1 to 24, being 1-4 mild handicap, 5-7 moderate, 8-10 severe, 11-13 very severe, and &gt;14 extremely severe handicap.</description>

The anesthetic was allowed to act, and an access way was then opened with a No. 16 abocat. Any effusion in the joint was drained. Then, approximately 100 mL of cold saline was instilled through the outer access way. Once the knee was distended, a further 5 mL of local anesthetic was injected into the inner mediopatellar zone, and a new abocat guide was used to establish the inner drainage way. The lavage proper involved instillation of 4 L of cold (8ºC) saline at a constant flow-rate using a dropper line connected to the entry way; the inner zone was also connected to another, free-fall dropper.</description>
