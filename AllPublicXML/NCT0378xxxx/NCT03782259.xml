  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is an unmet need for Cardiovascular Disease risk reduction in patients with Type 2
      Diabetes. In recent trials there has been promising findings of more effective glucose
      management and reductions in overall CVD events and hospitalization for heart failure with
      SGLT-2 inhibition. Using the capability of cardiac MRI with T1- and T2-mapping in assessments
      of myocardial fibrosis and inflammation, the investigators propose to conduct a clinical
      trial to investigate the effects of SGLT-2 inhibition with dapagliflozin on myocardial
      fibrosis and inflammation as assessed by cardiac MRI with T1- and T2-mapping in patients with
      type-2 diabetes.

      Over approximately 12 months subjects will have 6 clinical visits at the investigators
      research clinic. During this time subjects will be randomized to receive either active 10mg
      dapagliflozin or a matching placebo. 2 MRI scans at one of the two UW research imaging
      centers will take place. One at randomization and the second scan will occur approximately 12
      months after the first scan.

      Given the unmet needs for CVD risk reduction in patients with T2DM, the promising findings of
      more effective glucose management and reductions in overall CVD events and hospitalization
      for heart failure with SGLT-2 inhibition demonstrated in recent trials, and the capability of
      cardiac MRI with T1- and T2-mapping in assessments of myocardial fibrosis and inflammation,
      the investigators propose to conduct a staged research program using adaptive study design to
      investigate the effects of SGLT-2 inhibition with dapagliflozin on myocardial fibrosis and
      inflammation as assessed by cardiac MRI with T1- and T2-mapping in patients with type-2
      diabetes.

      A total of 60 subjects with &gt;=18 years of age, type-2 diabetes history &gt;=5 years and HbA1C
      7-10% will be randomized at 1:1 to Dapagliflozin 10mg or matching placebo once daily for 1
      year. All subjects will be followed every 3 months for clinical and laboratory evaluations
      and assessments. All subjects will undergo CMRI at baseline and 1 year.

      The primary myocardial fibrosis endpoint is change in extracellular volume fraction (ECV) as
      assessed by T1-mapping over 12 months. ECV combines native and contrast-enhanced T1 mapping.
      The change of the T1 relaxation rate (i.e., 1/T1) in blood between pre- and post-contrast
      imaging is converted with the blood hematocrit into a reference for plasma T1, which serves
      as reference for the T1 changes in tissue.
