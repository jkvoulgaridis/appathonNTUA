  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates ways of improving radiologists performance of the classification of
      CT-scans as cancerous or non-cancerous. Participants interact with an AI to classify CT-scans
      under three different conditions.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The three conditions are as follows: &quot;probabilistic classification&quot;, where the radiologist
      diagnoses scans using an AI cancer likelihood score; &quot;classification plus detection&quot;, where
      the radiologist see detecting lung nodules in addition to the AI's probabilistic
      classification score before making her own examination of the CT-scan; and &quot;classification
      with delayed detection&quot;, where the radiologist identifies regions of interest independently
      of the AI and then sees the AI's detected ROIs.

After identifying their own ROIs, the radiologist then can see ROIs identified by the AI that represent lung nodules before making final decisions.</description>
