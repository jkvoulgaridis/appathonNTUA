  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine if therapeutic exercise before anticancer treatment
      will mitigate the onset or extent of cardiotoxicity comparing to therapeutic exercise
      performed during anticancer treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The positive relationship between physical exercise and cancer is widely justified in the
      literature, but an emerging research line warns of its capacity to improve the effectiveness
      and reduce the toxicity of cancer treatment (responsible for the appearance of side effects
      and comorbidities), that overload the health care system. To date, there is a lack of
      knowledge in different subjects: the possibility of implementing individualized exercise
      programs in clinical environment to mitigate the side effects of cancer treatment; the best
      moment in natural history of the disease to perform therapeutic exercise; and a tailored dose
      of exercise that maximizes its benefits.

      In this context, the present study will evaluate the effects of a therapeutic exercise
      program conducted previously at the beginning of the cancer treatment, in the treatments'
      toxicity against the same program conducted during cancer treatments in women with breast
      cancer, and its positive effects on both clinical and biological variables and their possible
      impact on disease-free survival.

      This study will be conducted in 3 phases with 110 participants in total: phase 1: a pilot
      study be carried out to check the feasibility of the proposed physical exercise program;
      phase 2: to test the effectiveness of the program ATOPE performed prior to surgical medical
      treatment against the same made during treatment, with a randomized controlled clinical
      trial; and phase 3: in which it will be integrated into the health service and a larger
      project will be requested at the international level.

    <description>With the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) version 3.0. It is used to asses quality of life. It contains 30 items with both multi-item scales and single-item measures. Values are assigned between 1 and 4 (1: not at all, 2: a little, 3: enough, 4: a lot) according to the patient's responses to the item, only in items 29 and 30 evaluate with a score of 1 to 7 (1: lousy, 7: excellent). The scores obtained are standardized and a score between 0 and 100 is obtained, which determines the level of cancer impact on the patient of each of the scales. The high values in the scales of global health and function state indicate a better CV, while in the scale of symptoms it would indicate a decrease in CV since it indicates the presence of symptoms associated with cancer.</description>

    <description>European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Breast Cancer-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-BR23). It is a breast cancer module of EORTC QLQ-C30. This module contains 23 items assessing symptoms and side effects related to different treatment modalities, body image, sexuality, and future perspective. After the scoring procedures for the QLQ-C30, all scale and single-item scores are linearly transformed to a 0 to 100 scale. For the functional scales and single items (ie, body image, sexuality, and future perspective), higher scores represent a better level of functioning. For the symptom scales and single item, a higher score represents a higher level of symptoms.</description>
