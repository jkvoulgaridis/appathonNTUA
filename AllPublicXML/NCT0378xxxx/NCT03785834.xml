  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Investigators wish to study the value of dermatologic testing assessments in
      differentiating between cellulitis and pseudocellulitis in the inpatient setting. The
      Investigators propose that by utilizing cutaneous biopsies and tissue cultures in patients
      that have been admitted to inpatient internal medicine teams, the investigators may be able
      to improve multiple measures of hospital efficiency in patients presenting with
      cellulitis-like symptoms, by more accurately recognizing cellulitis from pseudocellulitis.
      The patient will undergo encrypted digital imaging for his or her condition. This image will
      then be sent to the study investigators, along with basic clinical information on the skin
      evaluation form. The study investigators will develop a differential diagnosis and then the
      patient will undergo a skin biopsy. The patient will then be randomized to one of two arms
      using a random number generator: A) Skin biopsies and tissue cultures recorded and published
      in patient's medical chart as they would be in a standard of care procedure B) Skin biopsies
      and tissue cultures consultation performed but not published in the patient's medical chart
      unless medically necessary. Information will be collected from medical records in IHIS.
      Patients will be contacted by phone 30 days after discharge.
