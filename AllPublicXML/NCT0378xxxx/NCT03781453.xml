  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With funding from the Alberta Ministry of Labour (Grant #095244772), a program called
      POWERPLAY (www.powerplayatwork.com), designed to promote men's health at work, will be
      evaluated in workplaces in Alberta.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In year 1, this project includes two main research components: 1. A pragmatic (real world)
      study will be conducted employing a quasi-experimental (not a randomized controlled trial),
      before and after design to evaluate the effectiveness of the POWERPLAY program. 2. An
      integrated set of research activities (systematic review, sleep behaviors and consultation
      groups) will be used to provide the basis for developing recommendations for promoting sleep
      health in male-dominated workplaces, and inform the development and testing of a POWERPLAY
      sleep health module (REST-UP) in Year 2.

    <measure>Moderate to Vigorous Physical Activity</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Minutes of Moderate to Vigorous physical activity will be assessed using self-report at baseline and follow-up using the Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire (Godin &amp; Shephard, 1985). The Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire contains three self-report questions that assess both the average frequency and duration (in minutes) of mild, moderate, and vigorous activities during free time over a typical week. Frequency and minutes are multiplied to obtain minutes per week (range from 0 and up). Weekly moderate and vigorous activity minutes will be summed and compared from baseline to follow-up, with higher scores indicating more activity. In addition, a cutoff of 150 minutes in 7 days will be used to classify participants as meeting or not meeting Canadian guidelines for physical activity at baseline and follow-up.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mental Wellness</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Mental well-being will be assessed using the well validated Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (SWEMWBS) (Haver, Akerjordet, Caputi, Furunes, &amp; Magee, 2015; Tennant et al., 2007) at baseline and follow-up. Participants respond to 7-items (e.g., &quot;I've been feeling optimistic about the future&quot;) on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from none of the time (1) to all of the time (5), with higher scores reflecting greater mental well-being. The SWEMWBS is scored by summing the score for each of the seven items (possible range 7-35).</description>
