  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the feasibility, effectiveness, and dissemination potential of an
      innovative strategy for improving access to effective sleep health care for adolescents. The
      study will test an adaptation of the Transdiagnostic Sleep and Circadian Intervention
      (TranS-C), a brief sleep intervention with demonstrated efficacy for improving sleep and
      mental health outcomes in youth.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This adaptation is designed to address the following key challenges to accessing care: (1) to
      overcome the challenge of low availability of qualified providers as a barrier to treatment
      access, we have adapted TranS-C for online and mobile device delivery (referred to as
      mTranS-C), thereby leveraging the high rates of mobile phone and internet use in adolescents;
      (2) to further increase access we will disseminate mTranS-C within primary care services, a
      proven strategy for improving access to behavioral health care; and (3) we focus on
      low-income communities, where there is a higher prevalence of sleep problems and low access
      to services.

    <measure>Strengths &amp; Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and at months 2 and 5</time_frame>
    <description>The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) is a validated 25 item behavioral screening questionnaire. Individual items are rated 'Somewhat True' (always scored as 1), 'Not True'(score is typically 0 except when reverse scored) and 'Certainly True' (score is typically 2 except when reverse scored). The SDQ comprise 5 scales (Prosocial, Peer Problems, Hyperactivity, Conduct and Emotional Problems) of 5 items each. For each of the 5 scales the score can range from 0 to 10 if all items were completed. These scores can be scaled up pro-rata if at least 3 items were completed, e.g. a score of 4 based on 3 completed items can be scaled up to a score of 7 (6.67 rounded up) for 5 items. A total difficulties score is generated by summing scores from all the scales except the prosocial scale. The resultant score ranges from 0 to 40, and is counted as missing of one of the 4 component scores is missing.</description>
