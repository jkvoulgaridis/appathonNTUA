      Objective: To investigate the interaction effects of vitamin D supplementation and aerobic
      exercises on balance control and physical performance in children with Down syndrome (DS).

      Methods: Forty-five children with DS ranging in age from 8 to 12 years will be selected and
      will participate in this study. They will be assigned randomly using sealed envelopes into
      three equal groups (A, B and C). Group A will consist of 15 children and will receive the
      conventional physical therapy program (CPTP) only. Group B will consist of 15 children and
      will receive the CPTP plus the aerobic exercises. Group C also will consist of 15 children
      and will receive the CPTP, the aerobic exercises and Vitamin D supplementation in the form of
      an oral dose of vitamin D3 1000 IU (Cholecalciferol). The program of treatment will be 3
      days/week for 12 weeks. Evaluation of balance by using the biodex balance system and physical
      performance by using the six-minute walk test (6MWT) will be conducted at baseline and after
      12 weeks of the treatment program.

    <description>Aerobic exercises:
Children in groups B and C will receive aerobic exercises in the form of bicycle ergometer and treadmill training for 15 min 3 days/week for 12 weeks. The procedure and goals of exercise will be explained to all children before starting the exercise program. The child will stop exercising immediately if he feels pain, fainting or shortness of breath.
Vitamin D supplementation:
Children in group C only will receive vitamin D supplementation in the form of an oral daily dose of vitamin D3 1000 IU (Cholecalciferol) for 12 weeks.</description>
