  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this trial is to investigate the relative bioavailability of BI 730357
      in plasma when given as oral single dose together with multiple oral doses of itraconazole
      (Test, T) as compared to when given alone as oral single dose (Reference, R)

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male subjects according to the assessment of the investigator, as based on a
             complete medical history including a physical examination, vital signs (blood pressure
             (BP), pulse rate (PR)), 12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG), and clinical laboratory tests

          -  Age of 18 to 50 years (inclusive)

          -  Body mass index (BMI) of 18.5 to 29.9 kg/m2 (inclusive)

             accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and local legislation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any finding in the medical examination (including blood pressure (BP), pulse rate (PR)
             or Electrocardiogram (ECG)) deviating from normal and assessed as clinically relevant
             by the investigator

          -  Repeated measurement of systolic blood pressure outside the range of 90 to 140 mmHg,
             diastolic blood pressure outside the range of 50 to 90 mmHg, or pulse rate outside the
             range of 45 to 90 bpm

          -  Any laboratory value outside the reference range that the investigator considers to be
             of clinical relevance

          -  Any evidence of a concomitant disease assessed as clinically relevant by the
             investigator

          -  Gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic,
             immunological or hormonal disorders

          -  Cholecystectomy or other surgery of the gastrointestinal tract that could interfere
             with the pharmacokinetics of the trial medication (except appendectomy or simple
             hernia repair)

          -  Diseases of the central nervous system (including but not limited to any kind of
             seizures or stroke), and other relevant neurological or psychiatric disorders

          -  History of relevant orthostatic hypotension, fainting spells, or blackouts

             medication or its excipients)

          -  Use of drugs within 30 days of planned administration of trial medication that might
             reasonably influence the results of the trial (including drugs that cause QT/QTc
             interval prolongation)

          -  Intake of an investigational drug in another clinical trial within 60 days of planned
             administration of investigational drug in the current trial, or concurrent
             participation in another clinical trial in which investigational drug is administered

          -  Smoker (more than 10 cigarettes or 3 cigars or 3 pipes per day)

          -  Inability to refrain from smoking on specified trial days

          -  Alcohol abuse (consumption of more than 30 g per day)

          -  Drug abuse or positive drug screening

          -  Blood donation of more than 100 mL within 30 days of planned administration of trial

             administration of trial medication or during the trial

          -  Inability to comply with the dietary regimen of the trial site

          -  A marked baseline prolongation of QT/QTc interval (such as QTc intervals that are
             repeatedly greater than 450 ms) or any other relevant Electrocardiogram (ECG) finding
             at screening

          -  A history of additional risk factors for Torsade de Pointes (such as heart failure,
             hypokalaemia, or family history of Long QT Syndrome)

          -  Subject is assessed as unsuitable for inclusion by the investigator, for instance,
             because the subject is not considered able to understand and comply with study
             requirements, or has a condition that would not allow safe participation in the study

        In addition, the following trial-specific exclusion criteria apply:

          -  Liver enzyme (ALT, AST, GGT) values above upper limit of normal at the screening
             examination

          -  History of drug-induced liver injury

          -  History of heart failure, or any evidence of ventricular dysfunction in the history

          -  History of hereditary fructose intolerance
