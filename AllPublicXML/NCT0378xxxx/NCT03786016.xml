  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study assesses differences in biological and behavioral domains that relate to
      individual adaptation and resiliency to an isolated, confined and controlled environment, and
      evaluates the effect of confinement, work, monotony, and social and physical isolation on
      stress resiliency and well-being.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to obtain novel information that will be used to help identify
      individuals who are resilient to the stressors of prolonged human spaceflight, thereby
      encouraging the successful completion of exploration missions and the preservation of health
      over the life of an astronaut. This study leverages the National Institute of Mental Health
      (NIMH) Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) heuristic framework to conduct experimental studies to
      identify biological domains (molecular, circuitry, physiology) and behavioral domains that
      relate to individual adaptation and resiliency (as well as behavioral vulnerability) in
      spaceflight-relevant confined environments. This study focuses specifically on differences
      among participants in their tolerance of and adaptability to simulated conditions of
      spaceflight such as confinement, work, monotony, and social/physical isolation that impact
      behavioral health and performance.

    <description>Subjects will spend 8 days/7 nights continuously in an isolated and confined unit with up to 3 other subjects. Subjects will participate in daily, timed activities such as space-relevant computer simulations, team tasks, and cognitive performance testing. Subjects will also experience altered environmental conditions (such as changes in lighting, sound and ambient temperature) while in the isolation unit. Subjects will receive orders from &quot;mission control&quot; who will monitor activity in the isolation unit and direct subjects throughout the 8-day study.</description>
