             -responsive

          -  Subjects must be judged by the investigator to be inadequately controlled by current
             therapy, have recognizable/identifiable &quot;Off&quot; and &quot;On&quot; states (motor fluctuations),
             and have a minimum of 2.5 hours of &quot;Off&quot; time per day

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is cognitively impaired and is not able to safely and effectively manage the
             drug delivery system and the diaries and is not able to adhere to the study.

          -  Subject is considered by the investigator to be an unsuitable candidate to receive
