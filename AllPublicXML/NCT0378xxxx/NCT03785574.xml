      The purpose of present study is to provide clinical evidences for the appropriate management
      of molar pregnancy with lung nodule. The hydatidiform mole patients with lung nodule ≥1.0cm
      will be randomized into 2 groups: A. treated with chemotherapy immediately, B. follow up
      until hCG level met FIGO diagnostic criteria of GTN (B1) or hCG level declined to normal
      spontaneously (B2). Lung nodule &lt;1.0cm will directly treated as group C

      The hydatidiform mole patients with lung nodule ≥1.0cm will be randomized into 2 groups: A.
      treated with chemotherapy immediately, B. follow up until hCG level met FIGO diagnostic
      criteria of GTN (B1) or hCG level declined to normal spontaneously (B2). The clinical
      characteristics of patients were compared, especially chemotherapy cycles to achieve hCG
      normalization and failure to first-line chemotherapy.

      Lung nodule &lt;1.0cm will directly treated as group C: follow up until hCG level met FIGO
      diagnostic criteria of GTN (C1) or hCG level declined to normal spontaneously (C2)
