  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives are a) to determine the scores of general self-efficacy (GSE) and oral hygiene
      related self-efficacy (OHSE) b) to evaluate the relations between the scores of GSE and OHSE
      c) to examine the changes in OHSE scores and the relationship between OHSE and PI scores
      after motivation and oral hygiene instructions. OHSE scores could be an indicator in
      predicting daily plaque control of patients. Also, it may be needed to show greater interest
      about motivation and oral hygiene instructions especially for smokers and OHSE-low group
      patients.

      All study patients (n=210) between the ages of 35 to 60 with inflammatory periodontal
      diseases filled out questionnaires regarding GSE and OHSE. Subgroups including OHSE-low
      (n=26) and OHSE-high (n=26) groups were selected after performing &quot;cut off&quot; on OHSE scores of
      all study patients. In both subgroups, plaque index (PI) values were determined, and
      motivation and oral hygiene instructions were performed at baseline. PI measurements and OHSE
      questionnaire were repeated at 1 and 3 months.

    <description>Motivation and oral hygiene instructions were received OHSE-high and OHSE-low groups. After showing the modified-Bass tooth brushing technique and interdental cleaning on the model, patients were followed up while brushing and flossing their teeth to correct misapplications. It was advised to brush teeth twice a day and use the interdental cleaning devices once a day.</description>
