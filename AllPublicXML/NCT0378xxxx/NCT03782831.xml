  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of transarterial
      chemoembolization (TACE) combined with programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) antibody
      compared with TACE Alone in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is the first-line treatment for patients with
      unrestable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) at intermediate-stage. Programmed cell death
      protein-1 (PD-1) antibody is effective and safe for advanced HCC. No study has compared the
      efficacy and safety of TACE plus PD-1 antibody and TACE alone. Thus, the investigators
      carried out this prospective randomized control study to find out it.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>PFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of first documentation of disease progression based on modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST), or date of death, whichever occurred first.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>OS was defined as the duration from the date of randomization until the date of death from any cause. Participants who were lost to follow-up were censored at the last date the participant was known to be alive, and participants who remained alive were censored at the time of data cutoff.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>ORR was defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on mRECIST. CR was defined as disappearance of any intratumoral arterial enhancement in all target lesions. PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of viable (enhancement of arterial phase) target lesions taking as reference to the baseline sum of the diameters of target lesions.</description>
