  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with early breast cancer and accessible tumor lesions (1.00 to 10 ml volume) that
      are eligible to either surgical removal of their tumor or neoadjuvant chemotherapy will be
      injected with the IMP. Patients will be either treated with placebo (buffer alone, 12
      patients) or with TriMix mRNA at three dose levels [8 at dose level I (1mg/ml), 8 at dose
      level II (3mg/ml), and 8 at dose level III (6mg/ml). The volume injected in this group will
      be adjusted to the tumour volume to ensure a perfusion of around 33% of the tumour volume
      (33% +/- 5%). Therefore, depending on the patients' tumour size, 500, 1000 or 2000 µl of
      TriMix mRNA solution or placebo solution will be injected into each tumor. Each patient will
      receive three administrations of TriMix prior to start of general treatment (surgery or
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy) separated by one week (7 days +/- 2 days) interval. The last
      administration will be performed 2 days preoperatively or start of neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

      The tumor and peripheral blood samples will be analyzed for immunological changes. If it is
      decided by the multidisciplinary team that neoadjuvant therapy is more appropriate for the
      patient, a second tumor biopsy (instead of surgical resection) will be taken 2 days after
      third administration of TriMix mRNA to assess immunological changes within the tumor.
      Similarly, patients that refuses to undergo surgery or to receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy
      can be enrolled into the trial, if they accept three administrations of TriMix followed by a
      second tumor biopsy.

      The study will start with recruitment of the placebo group. The enrollment of the first three
      patients in each cohort with Trimix mRNA will be staggered with at least one day between the
      first dose of each individual patient. One week after the third patient of a cohort received
      the third TriMix mRNA administration, an overall evaluation of the safety and tolerability of
      this cohort will be done by the principal investigator. The results will be reviewed by an
      in-house dose evaluation committee overseeing the safety and tolerability of TriMix mRNA.

    <masking_description>Subjects will not know whether an active or non-active substance is being injected. The choice for TriMix or placebo will take place according to the predefined schedule and can not be influenced by the patient or the investigator. Only after the comparison of the tumour tissue before (the initial biopsy where the diagnosis was made) and after (obtained at second biopsy or surgery) the intratumoral injection, it will be known whether mRNA or non-active product was used for the injection.</masking_description>
