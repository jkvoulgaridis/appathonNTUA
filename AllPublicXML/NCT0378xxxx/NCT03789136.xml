  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Cancer cachexia is a complex metabolic syndrome characterized by clinically
      relevant loss of muscle mass with or without loss of fat mass. To determine how treatment
      methods can be most effective, full insight in changes in gene expression, body composition,
      muscle function and muscle metabolism are of great importance.

      Objective: Main aim of the study is to investigate the differences in gene expression, body
      composition, muscle function and muscle metabolism in colon cancer patients compared to
      controls.

      Study design: Observational study Study population: 40 colon cancer patients undergoing a
      tumor resection (30 primary tumor and 10 liver metastases) and 15 control patients undergoing
      an inguinal hernia repair (♂, 10) or an abdominal hysterectomy (♀, 5).

      Main study parameters/endpoints: Primary study parameter will be gene expression
      (transcriptomic and polymerase chain reaction analyses of muscle biopsies). Secondary
      parameters will be body composition (determined in available CT scans and bio impedance
      analysis and with DEXA), muscle function parameters (grip and knee flexion/extension strength
      and measured in a biopsy), metabolic markers (measured in fat and muscle biopsies),
      biochemical markers (measured in blood/serum) and gene expression of fat biopsies.

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group
      relatedness: The investigators expect no additional risk for the subjects due to the proposed
      measurements. Biopsies will be taken during the planned operation and therefore is not
      expected to cause a significant increase in burden for the patient. All other measurements
      are non-invasive, observational measurements with no risk of any harmful side effects.

        40 colon cancer (CC) patients (♀ and ♂) undergoing primary tumor resection operation (30
        patients) or liver metastases surgery (10 patients) and 15 control patients undergoing an
        inguinal hernia repair (♂, 10) or an abdominal hysterectomy (♀, 5) will be included in the
        study. Since the investigators do not know the number of patients in the colon cancer group
        willing to cooperate in the study, the investigators decided to take 5 patients of each
        control group (50% men and women). Note: during the study the investigators see more men
        than women joining the study so therefore the investigators raised the number of male
        controls to 10.
