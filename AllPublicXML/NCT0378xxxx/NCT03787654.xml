  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is to determine the effect of electroacupuncture in female patients with
      urgency-predominant mixed urinary incontinence. A three-arm non-inferior randomized
      controlled trial (RCT) using electroacupuncture, sham electroacupuncture and solifenacin with
      a total sample of 282 is proposed.

      The hypothesis is that the improvement (difference in number of urgency urinary incontinence
      episodes between baseline and 12-week evaluation) in the electroacupuncture group would be
      50% or less of the difference in the improvement between the Solifenacin and the sham
      electroacupuncture groups.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mixed urinary incontinence (MUI) features complaint or involuntary loss of urine associated
      with urgency and also with effort or physical exertion or on sneezing or coughing. It is
      regarded as urgency-predominant mixed urinary incontinence (UMUI) when sudden sensation of
      voiding accompanied by uncontrolled incontinence domains the symptoms. UMUI can bring shame
      and inconvenience to patients.

      As first-line medicine for urge-predominant urinary incontinence, Solifenacin can reduce
      urgency urinary incontinence episodes in 24 hours. However, the side effects tend to bring
      about poor compliance among patients.

      Acupuncture might be effective in treating UMUI. Previous research indicated that
      electroacupuncture might be noninferior to pelvic floor muscle training plus Solifenacin in
      reducing the urgency incontinence episodes of UMUI women. However, that study didn't focuse
      on UMUI exclusively, thus unable to decide whether electroacupuncture is effective in the
      treatment of UMUI.

    <description>ICIQ-UI-SF was a questionnaire developed by the International Consultation on Incontinence to evaluate the severity of incontinence and impact to QoL in the past four weeks. It contains four items: frequency, amount of leakage, impact of UI on QoL and a separate item to indicate the cause of incontinence. The score was the sum of the first three items, providing a total score ranging from 0 to 21 with a higher score indicating worse symptoms and greater impact on QoL.</description>
