  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a lifelong condition which causes the lungs and digestive system to
      become clogged with thick, sticky mucus. This leads to recurrent chest infections and reduced
      nutrient absorption from food. The average age at death is 31 years, usually from respiratory
      failure. The nutritional status of people with CF (PWCF) is important to help them live
      healthier and longer.

      It is recommended that adults with CF achieve a BMI of 23 for males and 22 for females.
      However, fewer than 50% of adults with CF achieved that target BMI despite effective
      nutritional support to help weight gain. There is a clear need for a behavioural intervention
      that can help PWCF use the available nutritional support.

      This is a feasibility study to try out a multi-component behavioural intervention supported
      by a nutrition app. The intervention is designed to help PWCF use their nutritional support
      to gain weight. It will focus on testing the methods and procedures to be used on a larger
      scale, improving the behavioural intervention and estimating how many people are needed for
      the larger trial.

      Eligible patients will be invited to participate, and the investigators anticipate recruiting
      6 participants. The participants will have 6 weeks of intensive intervention, which will
      include a mix of clinic visits, home visits and telephone calls followed by 6 weeks of
      maintenance phase. Data will be collected during clinic visits at baseline, week 6 and week
      12 along with weight monitoring at home.

      The investigators will interview each participant at the end of the study period to improve
      the intervention and study processes based on participant feedback.

      The investigators hypothesised that using a nutrition app, along with regular input from a
      dietitian, will help PWCF to use the available nutritional support.
