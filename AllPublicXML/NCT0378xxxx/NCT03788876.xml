  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary transplantation aims to increase patient survival and quality of life in relation
      to functional aspects. It is observed that the decrease in muscle mass and pulmonary changes
      are some complications that can be found in the post-transplant patient due to immobility.
      Thus, Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES) rehabilitation is of paramount importance
      for the recovery of the individual, both in the functional aspects, and in the minimization
      in the time of hospitalization.The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of
      NMES on the thickness and strength of the quadriceps femoris muscle, pulmonary function,
      endothelial function, functional capacity, muscle biochemical markers, arterial blood gas
      analysis and water balance of patients after lung transplantation through a randomized
      clinical trial. Patients will be randomized into two groups: EENM group: will receive the
      application of NMES associated with physiotherapy and control group: who will receive only
      the physiotherapy protocol of the Hospital of Clinics of Porto Alegre (HCPA) and Irmandade da
      Santa Casa de Misericórdia de Porto Alegre.

      Pulmonary transplantation aims to increase patient survival and quality of life in relation
      to functional aspects. It is observed that the decrease in muscle mass and pulmonary changes
      are some complications that can be found in the post-transplant patient due to immobility.
      Thus, NMES rehabilitation is of paramount importance for the recovery of the individual, both
      in the functional aspects, and in the minimization in the time of hospitalization.The
      objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of NMES on the thickness and strength of
      the quadriceps femoris muscle, pulmonary function, endothelial function, functional capacity,
      muscle biochemical markers, arterial blood gas analysis and water balance of patients after
      lung transplantation through a randomized clinical trial. Patients will be randomized into
      two groups: EENM group: will receive the application of NMES associated with physiotherapy
      and control group: who will receive only the physiotherapy protocol of the HCPA. The NMES
      training will be applied once a day (30 minutes of application per session, increasing one
      minute every two days and reducing the OFF time), until the discharge of the Intensive Care
      Unit (ICU). The patient will continue with the application also in the Hospitalization Units
      of the HCPA and Irmandade da Santa Casa de Misericórdia de Porto Alegre until the hospital
      discharge. The following outcomes will be evaluated: thickness and strength of the quadriceps
      muscle, pulmonary function, endothelial function, functional capacity, mobility, muscle
      biochemical markers, arterial blood gas analysis, water balance and length of stay in the
      ICU, time and success of weaning from invasive mechanical ventilation and survival rate
      through medical records analysis.

    <description>The MRC score is obtained by evaluating 12 muscle groups in the upper extremities (wrist extensors, elbow flexors, and shoulder abductors) and lower limbs (dorsal ankle flexors, knee extensors, and hip flexors). Each muscle group will be given a score between 0 (complete paralysis) and 5 (normal strength), and the total score can range from 0 to 60 points.</description>
