  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study was performed in participants suffering from fibromyalgia and investigated efficacy
      after treatment with several doses of GRT9906 versus placebo. Furthermore, it was to be found
      out if treatment with GRT9906 was safe and well-tolerated.

      This Phase 2 study had a randomized, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      crossover, multiple-administration design.

      The objectives of the study were the following:

        -  To assess the multiple-dose analgesic efficacy and safety of an oral prolonged-release
           (PR) tablet formulation of GRT9906 at daily doses between 80 and 240 milligrams (mg) in
           comparison to placebo in participants with moderate to severe pain due to primary
           fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS).

        -  To compare the tolerability of multiple-dose GRT9906 PR to placebo in participants with
           primary FMS.

        -  To generate data that could be used, in combination with data from other studies, to
           explore the population pharmacokinetic analysis and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic
           (PK/PD) properties of GRT9906 PR.

      The study consisted of 5 phases:

        1. Enrollment including tapering, if necessary, and washout (at least 1 week) of previous
           medication.

        2. First treatment period with 1-week titration and 5-weeks dosing on participant's last
           well-tolerated titration dosage.

        3. Interim washout period of at least 1 week.

        4. Second treatment period with 1-week titration and 5-weeks dosing on participant's last
           well-tolerated titration dosage.

        5. Final washout period of at least 1 week, terminated by a Follow-up Visit.

    <measure>Average Pain Intensity over last 3 days of treatment period</measure>
    <time_frame>Last 3 days of treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>Participants recorded their daily current pain intensity in an electronic diary from the Enrollment Visit until the day of the last visit in the second treatment period using an 11-point Numerical Rating scale (NRS) ranging from 0 = no pain to 10 = pain as bad as you can imagine. Each treatment period lasted for 6 weeks. For the primary endpoint, the average daily current pain intensity over the last 3 days prior to the last visit per treatment period was calculated.</description>

    <description>Participants recorded their daily current pain intensity in an electronic diary from the Enrollment Visit until the day of the last visit in the second treatment period using an 11-point Numerical Rating scale (NRS) ranging from 0 = no pain to 10 = pain as bad as you can imagine. Each treatment period lasted for 6 weeks. The average daily current pain intensities over the last 3 days of the initial washout period (before randomization) and over Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 per treatment period were calculated.</description>

    <measure>Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>At Enrollment Visit (Visit 1), on Day 1, Day 22, and Day 42 per treatment period, and at Final Visit (14 days after last dose in treatment period 2)</time_frame>
    <description>The FIQ is a 10-item self-administered questionnaire measuring physical functioning, work status, depression, anxiety, sleep, pain, stiffness, fatigue, and well-being over a 1-week period. Each of the 10 items has a maximum possible score of 10 with a higher score indicating a greater impact of the syndrome on the patient. The FIQ total score is calculated by a weighted sum of the 10 items. The FIQ total score and sub-scores for FIQ items for fatigue, tiredness on awakening, and stiffness were calculated.</description>

    <measure>Tender Point Index (TPI)</measure>
    <time_frame>At Enrollment Visit (Visit 1), on Day 1, Day 22, and Day 42 per treatment period, and at Final Visit (14 days after last dose in treatment period 2)</time_frame>
    <description>Digital palpation with an approximate force of 4 kg was applied at 18 tender point sites. A tenderness scale was applied to the tenderness at each tender point site examined: non-tender (0), tender without physical response (1), tender plus wince or withdrawal (2), exaggerated withdrawal (3), too painful to touch (4). The sum of the tenderness severities at all 18 sites was the TPI. The expected range for normal controls is 0-5, for participants with fibromyalgia 11-72.</description>

    <measure>Average Pain Threshold (APT)</measure>
    <time_frame>At Enrollment Visit (Visit 1), on Day 1, Day 22, and Day 42 per treatment period, and at Final Visit (14 days after last dose in treatment period 2)</time_frame>
    <description>A Fischer algometer was used for this purpose. The foot piece was placed on the skin at the site of each tender point. The axis of the instrument was held firmly in place by a finger or thumb and vertical to the skin surface. The participant was informed that they &quot;will at first feel only pressure but then it will change to pain&quot;. The participant was to say &quot;now&quot; at the exact time when the pressure feeling changed to a pain feeling. The algometer applied pressure was advanced at a rate of 1 kg/second. When the participant indicated &quot;now&quot; the examiner withdrew the instrument and read the gauge pressure in kg to one decimal place. A value was recorded for algometry at each of the 18 tender points. The average of these 18 values has been defined as the APT.</description>

    <time_frame>At Enrollment Visit (Visit 1), on Day 1, Day 22, and Day 42 per treatment period, and at Final Visit (14 days after last dose in treatment period 2)</time_frame>
    <description>The duration of morning stiffness during the past 7 days was assessed by answering 3 questions, each with 5 categories of &quot;no stiffness&quot; and &quot;1 hour&quot;, &quot;2 hours&quot;, &quot;3 hours&quot;, or &quot;5 hours&quot;. Questions were &quot;During the past 7 days, on average, how long did your morning stiffness last until it began to improve/maximum improvement occurred/how long did it take to get going properly?&quot;.</description>

    <measure>Major Depression Inventory (MDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>At Enrollment Visit (Visit 1), on Day 1, Day 22, and Day 42 per treatment period, and at Final Visit (14 days after last dose in treatment period 2)</time_frame>
    <description>The MDI scale is a 10-item self-administered questionnaire for assessing major depression according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) and International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) as well as measuring severity of depressive states. Each item is scored on a Likert scale from 0 to 5. Treatment outcome is measured by the sum of the 10 individual items. In addition to the total score, a MDI rating scale was defined as follows: No sign of Depression: MDI total score below 20; Mild Depression: MDI total score of 20 to 24; Moderate Depression: MDI total score of 25 to 29; Severe Depression: MDI total score of 30 and more.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in Sleep Problem Scale (SPS) total score</measure>
    <time_frame>At Enrollment Visit (Visit 1) and on Day 42 per treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>The SPS is a 4-item questionnaire assessing sleep problems over a 1-month period, covering the following dimensions: delay of sleep onset, difficulty staying asleep, awakening too early, and tiredness after usual amount of sleep. Response categories comprised: Not at all (score 0), 1-3 days (1), 4-7 days (2), 8-14 days (3), 15-21 days (4), and 22-31 days (5). The SPS total score is calculated as the sum of the 4 individual items. Greater levels of sleep problems are indicated by higher scores. The SPS total score is calculated as the sum of the 4 individual items. Changes from baseline (Visit 1) for the SPS total score at Day 42 are calculated per treatment period.</description>
