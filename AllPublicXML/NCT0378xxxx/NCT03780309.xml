  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sedentary (n=24) adults ≥18 yr with elevated BP to established hypertension were enrolled
      into this randomized clinical trial entitled, 'Blood Pressure UtiLizing Self-Monitoring after
      Exercise study or PULSE'. Participants were randomly assigned to either an exercise only
      (EXERCISE; n=12) or exercise plus BP self-monitoring (EXERCISE+PEH) (n=12) group. All
      participants participated in a 12 wk supervised moderate intensity aerobic exercise training
      program 40 min/d for 3 d/wk. In addition, they were encouraged to exercise at home ≥30 min/d
      for 1-2 d/wk. All participants self-monitored exercise with a traditional calendar recording
      method and heart rate (HR) monitor. In addition to traditional exercise self-monitoring
      (EXERCISE), individuals in the EXERCISE+PEH group were given a home BP monitor to assess home
      BP twice daily (in the morning upon awakening and in the evening) and prior to and after
      voluntary home exercise sessions. Resting BP, peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak), physical
      activity, dietary and salt intake, and antihypertensive medication adherence were measured
      before and after the 12 wk supervised exercise training program. In addition, integrated
      social-cognitive predictors of exercise that included questionnaires on exercise
      self-efficacy, barriers self-efficacy, outcome expectations for exercise, exercise intention,
      and affective responses to exercise were measured before and after the 12 wk supervised
      exercise training program. Four weeks following the completion of exercise training,
      self-reported exercise levels were assessed during a telephone interview in both groups.
      Among EXERCISE+PEH only, self-monitoring of BP was also self-reported during this telephone
      interview.

    <description>Exercise adherence to the 12 wk supervised portion of the aerobic exercise training program was calculated as the percent of supervised exercise sessions completed divided by the total number of supervised sessions possible (# of supervised sessions performed ÷ total number of possible supervised sessions X 100%). In this calculation, the total number of possible sessions was calculated as: 3 supervised exercise training days per wk for 12 wk = 36 sessions with a maximum possible adherence of 100% (e.g., 36÷36 X 100% =100%).</description>

    <description>The BP response to aerobic exercise training was calculated in two ways and in units 'mmHg': (1) in the laboratory (post training resting BP - pre training resting BP) during the control visits (Visits 1 or 2 vs. Visit 4 or 5); and (2) under ambulatory conditions (post training ambulatory BP - pre training ambulatory BP) following the control visits (Visits 1 or 2 vs. Visit 4 or 5) over the awake, sleep, and 19 hr.</description>
