  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will establish the acceptability and feasibility of enrolling and retaining heavy
      drinking Veterans with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) in an 8-week, randomized cross-over
      design trial of active VR working memory retraining (WMR). This study will also seek to
      establish the efficacy of active VR-WMR to increase performance in executive function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will employ a physically active VR working memory retraining (VR-WMR)
      regimen utilizing components of Blue Goji VR Active Gaming. The synthesis of physical
      activity and an enriched VR environment is expected to yield superior working memory training
      stemming from greater neurological activation. This enhanced working memory training task
      will result in greater motivation to engage and complete a training regimen, thus fostering
      greater improvements in executive function than traditional working memory training tasks;
      ultimately resulting in increased self-control over alcohol use and other high-risk
      behaviors.

    <measure>System Usability Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>A validated measure of technology usability will be administered at end of study to assess the usability of Active VR-WMR.The System Usability Scale (SUS) is a reliable 10 item questionnaire with five response options for respondents; from Strongly agree to Strongly disagree used to measure product usability. The participant's scores for each question are converted to a new number, added together and then multiplied by 2.5 to convert the original scores of 0-40 to 0-100. An SUS score above a 68 would be considered above average and anything below 68 is below average.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The Client Satisfaction Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>A validated measure of client satisfaction with an intervention will be administered at the end of study to evaluate satisfaction with Active VR-WMR. Items are scored on a Likert scale from 1 (low satisfaction) to 4 (high satisfaction) with different descriptors for each response point. Total scores range from 8 to 32, with higher scores indicating greater satisfaction. A standard mean rating of â‰¥ 24 will be considered acceptable.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Working Memory</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in working memory in each arm will be evaluated. Working Memory consists of well validated WAIS-IV Arithmetic and Digit Span Subscales. Working memory will be the average of the scaled scores (ss) of each subscale, with a mean (M) = 10 and a standard deviation (SD) = 3. The subtest ss range from 1 to 19.</description>
