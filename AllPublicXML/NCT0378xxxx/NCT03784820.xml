  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary
      effectiveness of a novel couple-based intervention for binge-eating disorder (BED) relative
      to an established evidence-based individual treatment (cognitive-behavioral therapy-enhanced;
      CBT-E) in a community clinic setting.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clinicians' options for BED treatment are inadequate. Treatments for BED have demonstrated
      efficacy in controlled settings with specialist therapists and expert supervision, but much
      less in known about the effectiveness of BED interventions and whether the transition of
      evidence-based treatments to the community results in poorer outcomes. UNITE activates a key
      resource by incorporating an important part of the patient's social environment (the partner)
      into treatment. The investigators hypothesize that UNITE will show preliminary evidence of
      being superior to CBT-E in achieving binge abstinence via engaging ED-related relationship
      targets, including improved (a) communication around the disorder, (b) disorder-specific
      interpersonal problem-solving/ behavioral change skills, and (c) partner-assisted emotion
      regulation. The investigators will assess targeted relationship domains with observational
      and speech prosody measures during clinic interactions and self-reports reflecting
      experiences outside the clinic. Because the couple is learning how to work together to
      address BED, the investigators hypothesize that maintenance of gains will show evidence
      consistent with superiority in UNITE.

    <intervention_model_description>Participants will be randomized to either couple therapy (UNITE) or individual therapy (CBT-E) for binge-eating disorder and will receive 16 1-hour sessions of the respective treatment. All study hypotheses will be tested using recommended Intent-To-Treat (ITT) methods. Differential treatment effects in individual functioning variables will be tested using 2 (time) x 2 (treatment) mixed-effect ANOVAs for binge-purge frequency and eating disorder outcomes and 2 (partner) x 3 (time) x 2 (treatment) mixed-effect ANOVAs for psychological outcomes. (Some variables will have 4 time points). Differential treatment effects in target relationship variables will be tested using 2 (partner) x 2 (time) x 2 (treatment) mixed-effect ANOVAs for all outcomes except vocally encoded emotional arousal. Differential treatment effects of vocally encoded emotional arousal will be tested using repeated-measures Actor Partner Interdependence Models (RM-APIMS).</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Couple communication measured by observational coding of recorded couple conversations</measure>
    <time_frame>From Pre-treatment through Post-treatment Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>Couple communication will be assessed by rating of a 10-minute videotaped conversation in which the couple is asked to share thoughts, feelings, and concerns about some aspect of the patient's binge-eating disorder. Ratings will be based on the Couples Interaction Rating System (CIRS), a 19-item observational coding system that assesses communication behaviors, as well as the Social Support Interaction Rating System (SSIRS), an 18-item observational coding system that assesses affective expression and supportive behavior. All items of both systems will be rated by trained observers on a 9-point Likert scale. Items from the two systems will be combined to create positivity (3 items, range 3-27) and negativity (7 items, range 7-63) subscales based on well-accepted combined scoring. Higher scores indicate greater positivity or negativity respectively.</description>

    <time_frame>From Pre-treatment through Post-treatment Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>Couple interpersonal problem-solving/behavior change skills will be assessed by rating of a 10-minute videotaped conversation in which the couple is asked to problem-solve on some aspect of the patient's binge-eating disorder and attempt to agree upon behavioral changes that they will make. Ratings will be based on the Couples Interaction Rating System (CIRS), a 19-item observational coding system that assesses communication behaviors, as well as the Social Support Interaction Rating System (SSIRS), an 18-item observational coding system that assesses affective expression and supportive behavior. All items of both systems will be rated by trained observers on a 9-point Likert scale. Items from the two systems will be combined to create the problem-solving subscale (4 items, range 4-36) based on well-accepted combined scoring. Higher scores indicate greater problem-solving capabilities.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Partner-assisted emotion regulation assessed with Vocally encoded emotional arousal</measure>
    <time_frame>From Pre-treatment through Post-treatment Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>Two 10-minute video-taped interactions during which the couple is asked to share thoughts, feelings, and concerns about some aspect of the patient's binge-eating disorder and to problem-solve on some aspect of the patient's binge-eating disorder, respectively. Vocally encoded emotional arousal will be measured using fundamental frequency (f0) from patients' and partners' speech. F0 is a spectral analysis-based measure of speech prosody that refers to the lowest frequency harmonic of the speech sound wave, created by the opening and closing of the vocal folds while air flows outward from the lungs during speech production. Emotion regulation is indicated by one's ability to return to a stable set-point after being perturbed from that set-point. Stronger regulation is indicated by a faster return to the set-point. The range of fundamental frequency for speech in adult men and women is approximately 75-300hz.</description>
