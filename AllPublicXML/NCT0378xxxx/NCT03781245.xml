  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      &quot;All the Right Moves for Subcontractors&quot; aims to improve safety, health and well-being,
      through the development of a communication infrastructure with supplemental tools where
      construction workers and company mangers (project, operations and safety) work together to
      collaboratively identify problems and strategies to improve their conditions of work. The
      intervention is grounded in the key characteristics of integrated organizational
      interventions to improve workers' health safety and well-being detailed in Harvard Center for
      Work, Health and Well-being's Implementation Guidelines (McLellan et al, 2016).

      The intervention involves a cyclical approach through which the research team facilitate a
      participatory process to identify workers' health concerns, prioritize these concerns, use an
      action planning process to identify and operationalize solutions, and develop a
      company-specific evaluation plan to measure change. We will evaluate this program by
      measuring safety climate, health climate, pain and injury and health behaviors.
