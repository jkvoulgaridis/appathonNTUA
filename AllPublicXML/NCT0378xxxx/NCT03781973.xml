  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adolescents with type 1 diabetes face particular challenges related to having a chronic
      illness that requires daily intensive self-management and medical follow-up during a period
      when their social, developmental, educational, and family situations are in flux. When
      transitioning from pediatric to adult care, over a third of youth have a care gap of &gt;6
      months. During this vulnerable period youth are at risk for acute life-threatening
      complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis, and for poor glycemic control, which confers an
      increased risk of chronic diabetes complications. Gaps in care may be a result of
      deficiencies in transition processes causing some young people to be poorly prepared for
      adult care and dissatisfied with the transition process. Ineffective transition can lead to
      decreased frequency of diabetes visits and an increased risk of adverse events in young
      adulthood. Further, risk factors such as psychiatric comorbidity and behavioural problems in
      adolescents with type 1 diabetes are associated with poor outcomes in early adulthood.
      Quality improvement initiatives can be designed to optimize care processes such as referral
      systems to adult diabetes providers.

      Our overall objective is to optimize care and outcomes for youth with diabetes as they
      transition to adult care.

      Specific Aim 1: To improve glycemic control in youth around the time of transition from
      pediatric to adult diabetes care Specific Aim 2: To evaluate the fidelity and quality of a
      quality improvement intervention designed to improve transition care processes and to
      identify contextual factors associated with variation in outcomes.
