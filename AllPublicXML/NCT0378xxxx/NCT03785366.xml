          -  Willing to use the study drug as the sole form of contraception;

          -  Willing to accept a risk of pregnancy;

          -  Subjects who are age 21 or older, at time of informed consent, must have a normal
             papanicolaou test (Pap) or atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance
             (ASC-US) with negative high risk human papilloma virus (HPV) test result within the
             appropriate screen timeframe per American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical
             Pathology (ASCCP) guidelines, and prior to the study IUD insertion. Alternatively, the
             subject must have had a colposcopy performed within the appropriate screen timeframe,
             and prior to the study IUD insertion that showed no evidence of dysplasia requiring
             treatment per ASCCP guidelines, or treatment was performed and follow-up at least 6
             months after the treatment showed no evidence of disease by clinical evaluation;

          -  Able and willing to comply with all study tests, procedures, assessment tools and
             follow-up;

          -  Able and willing to provide and document informed consent and Authorization for
             Release of Protected Health Information (PHI). Unemancipated subjects under 18 years
             old must provide assent and have written parental consent documented on the consent
             form consistent with local legal requirements;

          -  Plan to reside within a reasonable driving distance of a research site for the

             the study IUD is placed;

          -  History of previous IUD complications, such as perforation, expulsion, or pregnancy
             with IUD in place;

          -  Pain with current IUD;

          -  Use of ParaGard IUD within the past 3 months

          -  Any general health, mental health or behavioral condition that, in the opinion of the
