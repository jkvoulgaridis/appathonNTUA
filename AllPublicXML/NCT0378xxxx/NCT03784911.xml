  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess how bone density and body composition changes over a
      cancer patient's treatment via SOZO measurements, DEXA scan (bone density and whole body
      composition), performance status tests, food log, urine color test, and other study
      assessments. These assessments will begin after cancer diagnosis but prior to intervention,
      and continue during treatment and at post-treatment visits.

      This is an observational, prospective device use study. 50 subjects will be enrolled in the
      study. The study will look at the changes in the participants body composition as they go
      through cancer treatment using the SOZO device. The SOZO device is intended to estimate the
      following body composition parameters: Fluid status (TBW, ECF, ICF), Total body composition
      (fat free mass, fat mass, % of weight), Metabolic report (active tissue mass, extracellular
      mass, basal metabolic rate), Skeletal muscle mass, Phase angle, Body mass index (BMI),
      Weight, and Hydration index (Hy-Dex) analysis. Participants will have 5 study visits during
      the course of their cancer treatment where SOZO measurements will be taken as well as other
      study measurements.

    <description>Participants' body composition will be estimated using a SOZO device at 5 different time points across their cancer treatment. Participant will also complete questionnaires and physical assessments during each study visit. These include waist &amp; hip measurements, weight/BMI, brief fatigue inventory, timed up and go test, cancer distress assessment, ECOG performance status, hand grip strength test, and 24-hour food recall. DEXA scans will be performed before treatment and after completion of treatment.</description>

    <description>SOZO device will estimate fluid status, total body composition, metabolic report, skeletal muscle mass, phase angle, body mass index, weight, and hydration index analysis. SOZO measurements will be performed before the start of cancer treatment, at the 1/4, 1/2, and 3/4 time points of treatment, and after completion of treatment. Participants be asked to fast for at least 8 hours before each visit, but water may be consumed to ensure they are well-hydrated. Participants will be asked to provide a urine sample at each visit and to report the color of your urine to the staff so they can determine how well hydrated the participants are. If not hydrated to the extent needed, participants will be asked to drink water and repeat the urine sample again after 30 minutes.</description>

    <description>DEXA scan bone density reading with hip and spine measurements as well as a whole body composition scan will be performed. Where DEXA cannot be collected on the same day as other study assessments, Weight/BMI, Urine Color, and SOZO should all be collected (or repeated if already done) to coincide with the DEXA scan if SOZO is available at DEXA location.</description>
