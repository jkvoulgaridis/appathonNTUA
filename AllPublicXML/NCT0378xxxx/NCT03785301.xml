      Flash glucose monitoring (FGM) is a newly introduced Glucose Monitoring system. The aim of
      the study is to assess the eﬀect of FGM on glycemic control compared with standard blood
      glucose monitoring (SMBG) using a randomised controlled study design in adults with type 2
      diabetes. Subjects will use unmasked FGM once a month or SMBG to monitor glucose level for 3
      months. Patients in the SMBG group will wear masked FGM to collect glycaemic variability data
      for comparison to the intervention group of the study. The primary outcome, HbA1c, will be
      cpmpared at baseline and 3 month. Glucose control parameters provided by unmasked and masked
      FGM will be compared in the two groups, including mean blood glucose (MBG), coefficient of
      variation (CV), area under the curve (AUC), Time in Range(TIR), etc.

    <description>Freestyle Libre Flash Glucose Monitoring will be used in diabetic patients once a month for therr months to monitor glucose level. Patients could scan the sensor to get the glucose level at any time as they want. They could alter thier diet and exercise according to the glucose levels. Patients will be required to keep track of food and exercise during wearing FGM sensor. Physicians would adjust patients' medication according their glucose profile provided by FGM, A1c, and diet and exercise every month.</description>
