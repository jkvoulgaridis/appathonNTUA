  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate biopsy was offered to 47 consecutive patients with prostate-specific antigen (PSA)
      over 4 ng/dl or suspicious digital rectal examination (DRE) of whom 16 had undergone a
      biopsy. Comprehensive validated questionnaires at TIME 0 (pre-biopsy), TIME 1 (before
      diagnosis, 20 days after biopsy) and TIME 2 (after diagnosis, 40 days after biopsy) accessed
      patients' erectile (IIEF-5) and voiding (IPSS) functions, Beck scales measured anxiety (BAI),
      hopelessness (BHS) and depression (BDI), added to the emotional thermometers including five
      visual analog scales for distress, anxiety, depression, anger and need for help. Mann-Whitney
      or Friedman tests were obtained among times and studied variables.

      A prospective, longitudinal and observational study in which the sexually active patients
      were evaluated in the Urology Department of the city of Paulínia, submitted to biopsy guided
      by transrectal ultrasound after ethics committee approval (355.357).

      Consecutive patients who were attended by urologist and present prostate cancer suspicions
      (PSA&gt; 4 ng / dL and/or rectal examination (TR) were submitted a BXP. They were evaluated at
      three different moments of the biopsy:

        -  Seven days before the biopsy procedure (T0);

        -  20 days after the biopsy, upon receiving the histopathological result, before becoming
           aware of it (T1);

        -  40 days after the biopsy, 20 days after being aware of the test result (T2). Sixty-one
           consecutive patients were invited to participate in the study, 10 of them had no active
           sexual life and 9 answered the questionnaires only at the first moment, were excluded;
           47 responded at three times (T0, T1, and T2).

      Validated instruments were applied - IIEF-5 (erectile function); - IPSS (voiding function); -
      Beck scales - BAI (anxiety), BHS (hopelessness), BDI (depression); and - Emotional
      thermometers.

      The comparison among the moments (T0, T1, and T2) was performed through Friedman (analysis of
      variance) for repeated measures with the variables transformed in stations. The comparison
      between patients and variables was performed using the Mann-Whitney test. The sample power
      was calculated and the level of significance considered was 5%.
