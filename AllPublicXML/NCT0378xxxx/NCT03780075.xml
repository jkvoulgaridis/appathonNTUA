  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In prior studies, the investigators synthesized 177Lu-EB-PSMA-617 by conjugating a truncated
      Evans Blue (EB) molecule and DOTA chelator onto PSMA-617 and labeled it with 177Lu to
      increase the tumor accumulation and retention for radioligand therapy，and then the
      investigators evaluated the dosimetry of 177Lu-EB-PSMA-617 and response to single low-dose
      treatment in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer(mCRPC). This study
      was performed to evaluate the safety and therapy response to 177Lu-EB-PSMA-617 in patients
      with mCRPC.

      This is an open-label, randomized study. Different groups with doses of 1.11GBq (30 mCi),
      1.85GBq (50 mCi) and 3.7GBq (100 mCi)of 177Lu-EB -PSMA617 will be injected intravenously. All
      patients will undergo 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT scans before and after the treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer (PC) is the second most common cancer worldwide in men, with persistently
      high numbers dying from this disease. Recent studies have demonstrated the possibility of
      177Lu-PSMA-617 therapy as a viable treatment option in mCRPC. To increase tumor accumulation
      and retention for radioligand therapy, and reduce dosage of 177Lu, the investigators
      conjugated a truncated Evans blue (EB) molecule and DOTA chelator onto PSMA-617 (EB-PSMA-617)
      and label it with 177Lu.

      The study is open-label and patients will be divided into three groups and monitored
      throughout the 6 to 10-month treatment period for survival, disease progression, and adverse
      events to evaluate the safety and therapy response to the 177Lu-EB-PSMA-617.
