  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The major problem in stroke survivors that is being addressed in this research project is
      walking asymmetry, i.e., difference between the legs during walking (e.g. steps on the more
      affected side are longer than the other). A potential solution to this problem is using new
      technology like virtual reality during walking training to make stroke survivors have a
      better sense of their asymmetry. A second problem that we aim to address in this study is
      whether asymmetry is accurately felt by the stroke survivors and how we can address it. Our
      ongoing work on the effects of virtual reality on learning new walking tasks in stroke
      survivors indicates that virtual reality maybe particularly important for those with walking
      asymmetry. In this study, we plan to recruit stroke survivors who have such asymmetries
      during walking and have them learn a new walking task in virtual reality. We will also test
      the stroke survivors to determine if there is a relationship between how well they learn the
      new task with their ability to feel asymmetry accurately.

      Stroke survivors show a deterioration in bilateral coordination during gait that impacts
      functional mobility and quality of life. Such deterioration includes spatial (e.g. step
      length) and temporal (e.g. step time) inter-limb asymmetries during walking (gait asymmetry).
      While restoration of gait symmetry through adaptive exercise as in split-belt training is an
      answer, it is compounded by deficits of perception that is common in stroke survivors. One
      solution to this problem is the use of augmented visual feedback such as virtual reality
      (VR). Such augmented visual inputs during training can help remove sensory conflicts that
      commonly exist during gait rehabilitation (e.g. static visual input versus motion perception
      through proprioceptive input during treadmill walking). The PI's ongoing research
      investigating the effects of VR on gait adaptation in stroke survivors indicates that the
      impact of VR is dependent on the subject's baseline gait asymmetry such that the effect of VR
      is potentially higher in those who have large baseline asymmetries. Therefore, in the current
      proposal, to determine if this hypothesis is correct, chronic stroke survivors who are above
      and below a specific asymmetry threshold will be recruited and assessed for the effect of VR
      on a split-belt treadmill paradigm. In the second aim, the effect of VR on the transfer of
      split-belt adaptation to a preferred walking trial will be assessed. Since stroke survivors
      also suffer from major perceptual deficits related to symmetry, in the third aim, the effect
      of VR on gait adaptation on four groups of stroke survivors will be analyzed those with
      deficits only in perceiving visual asymmetry, only gait asymmetry, both deficits or neither.
