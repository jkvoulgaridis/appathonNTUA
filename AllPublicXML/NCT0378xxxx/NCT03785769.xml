  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this randomized clinical trial is to evaluate the survival of restoration
      with high viscosity glass ionomer cement (HVGIC) with pre-etching with polyacrilic acid
      compared with no pre-etching in order to treat occlusoproximais caries lesion in primary
      molars, as well as the impact of those treatments in the caries lesion progression, the
      cost-efficacy of the procedures and the discomfort reported by the patient. Children of 4 to
      8 years will be selected in the Pediatric Dentistry Clinic of Universidade Ibirapuera. 192
      teeth will be randomized in 2 experimental groups: (1) HVGIC restoration with pre-etching and
      (2) HVGIC restoration with no pre-etching. Will be considered as primary outcome the survival
      of the restoration evaluated after 6, 12, and 24 months by two trained examiners. The carious
      lesions progression will be evaluated after 24 months of follow-up. The time of the
      treatments and the cost of the materials will be considered to estimate the cost-efficacy of
      each treatment. The discomfort reported by the participant will be measured after each
      procedure following the Wong-Baker scale. For the primary outcome, Kaplan-Meier survival and
      the Long-Rank test will be used in order to compare the two groups. Cox regression will be
      performed in order to evaluate thee influence of explanatory variables on the outcome.
