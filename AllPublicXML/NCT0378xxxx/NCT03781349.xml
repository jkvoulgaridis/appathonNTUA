      The aim of this study was to clarify the effectiveness of physiotherapeutic intervention
      through the TENS or MENS in conjunction with kinesiotherapy in patients with partial
      thickness rotator cuff tear.

      The primary characteristic of a rotator cuff tear is pain, while muscle weakness appears as a
      secondary feature, leading to further disability.

    <description>MENS are applied through placement of six electrodes (size of 4x4cm), of which four were placed exactly like the TENS electrodes and the other two, one in the palm and the other at the height of the asteroid ganglion. Duration of the intervention was 24 min for a total of 15 sessions. The frequency was 50 Hz and the intensity was 100 Î¼A.</description>

    <description>TENS are applied through the placement of four electrodes on either side of the deltoid muscle, on the front and back surfaces of the shoulder joint for 20 min and each patient received 15 sessions (five per week). A constant current of high frequency was used (100 HZ) and its intensity was initiated at 10mA and was then gradually increased to 15mA</description>
