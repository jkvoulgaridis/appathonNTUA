    <textblock>
      This is a single centre, prospective, non-randomised healthy volunteer study to be undertaken
      at University College Hospital London.

      The study will be used to demonstrate the safe use of the MediSieve blood filtration system
      in healthy volunteers prior to undertaking clinical trials on patients with relevant
      pathologies.
