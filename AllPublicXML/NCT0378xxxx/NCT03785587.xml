  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hyperhidrosis is a disorder of abnormal excessive sweating. Primary hyperhidrosis (armpits,
      hands, and feet) affects approximately 4.8% of the US population and is believed to be caused
      by an overactive cholinergic response of the sweat glands. Sofpironium bromide (BBI-4000) is
      a novel soft-drug in development for the topical treatment of hyperhidrosis. This Phase 2
      study will assess the long-term safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of
      sofpironium bromide gel applied topically to pediatric subjects with axillary hyperhidrosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, phase 2 long-term study designed to evaluate the safety, local
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of sofpironium bromide gel when applied topically
      to the axillae.

      Subjects will apply the gel once daily at bedtime, to both axillae.

      A maximum of 24 subjects, will be enrolled to receive sofpironium bromide gel, 15%.

      Adverse events, vital signs, and local tolerability assessments will be collected at each
      visit. Urine pregnancy tests will be taken throughout the course of the study for women of
      child bearing potential. Blood and urine samples will be collected and analyzed for
      pharmacokinetics, routine hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis parameters at specified
      visits. Patient-reported outcome assessments will be recorded during the study at predefined
      time points.

      The study will be comprised of a total of 8 scheduled visits to take place over a 26 week
      period.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female subject ≥9 to &lt;17 years of age in good general health.

          -  Diagnosis of primary axillary hyperhidrosis that meets all the following criteria: (a)
             HDSM-Ax of 2 - 4 inclusive at both the Screening Visit (Visit 1) and Baseline Visit
             (Visit 2). (b) Symptoms of axillary hyperhidrosis for greater than or equal to 6
             months' duration prior to enrollment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  In the Investigator's opinion, any skin or subcutaneous tissue conditions of the
             axilla(e), (i.e., the axillary area should be deemed otherwise &quot;normal&quot;, besides the
             hyperhidrosis diagnosis, and free of blisters, large boils or sinus tracts,
             significant scarring or open wounds).

          -  Prior use of any prohibited medication(s) or procedure(s) within the specified
             timeframe for the treatment of axillary hyperhidrosis: (a) Botulinum toxin to the
             axillary area within 9 months of enrollment. (b) Axillary thermolysis, sympathectomy
             or surgical procedures of the axillary area at any time in the past. (c) Serotonergic
             agonist (or drugs that increase serotonin activity including SSRIs), beta-blocker,

             had a recent change in hyperhidrosis frequency or severity for 3 months prior to
             enrollment; they may be included. Doses of these agents should not be altered during
             the course of the study. (d) Any topical treatment for hyperhidrosis, requiring a

             as sage tablets, chamomile, valerian root and St. John's Wort) within 14 days of
             enrollment.

          -  Use of any cholinergic drug (e.g., bethanechol) within 30 days of enrollment.

          -  Use of any anti-anxiety and/or anti-depressant, amphetamine product or drugs with
             known anticholinergic side effects is prohibited with the following exceptions: (a) If
             a subject has been on a stable dose of an anti-anxiety and/or anti-depressant drug and
             has not had a recent change in hyperhidrosis frequency or severity for 3 months; they
             may be included. (b) An amphetamine product may be allowed if the dose has been stable
             for greater than or equal to 6 months without change in hyperhidrosis frequency or
             severity for 3 months. (c) Drugs with known anticholinergic side effects (taken within
             the last 30 days), including dry mouth, blurred vision, may be allowed based on the
             Principal Investigator's assessment.

          -  Known causes of hyperhidrosis or known history of a condition that may cause
             hyperhidrosis (i.e., hyperhidrosis secondary to any known cause such hyperthyroidism,
             diabetes mellitus, medications, etc.).

          -  Subjects with hyperhidrosis symptoms initiated or exacerbated with menopause.

             hyperplasia (BPH), neurological conditions, psychiatric conditions, Sjögren's
             syndrome, Sicca syndrome, or cardiac abnormalities that may alter normal sweat
