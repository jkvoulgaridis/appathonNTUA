  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I/II trial to evaluate the efficacy of APG-115 +/- Carboplatin for the
      treatment p53 wild-type malignant salivary gland cancer.

      Part 1 consists of 2 arms, arm A is APG-115 mono-therapy and arm B is APG-115 + Carboplatin;

      Part 2 is single arm based on the outcome of part 1
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label multi-institution phase I/II study with an initial randomized component
      then followed by a planned single-arm phase. Arms will be monitored using the time-to-event
      continual reassessment method (TITE-CRM). In the initial randomized phase, patients will be
      randomized to one of two arms: Arm A (APG115 alone) or Arm B (APG115 + Carboplatin) at a
      ratio of 1:2. After 14 patients have been accrued in Arm A and 28 patients have been accrued
      to Arm B, responses will be tabulated. The outcomes of the arms will be considered, and a
      single arm will be selected for further study in part 2 of the study. Response rate (defined
      as CR or PR after cycle 2) will be the foremost consideration for deciding on the most
      promising arm; in addition, a comprehensive evaluation of the available data including
      toxicity and PK data will also be considered. After an arm has been chosen to advance an
      additional 20 patients will be accrued.
