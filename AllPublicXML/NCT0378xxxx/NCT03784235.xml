  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to examine whether individuals with unilateral patellofemoral pain (PFP) have
      increased subchondral bone remodelling and thus increased 18F Sodium Fluoride (18F-NaF)
      uptake in the painful knee compared to the opposite knee measured by simultaneous positron
      emission tomography and computed tomography (PET/CT) and to examine whether the increased
      uptake is associated with pain intensity, with patient-reported function and with pain
      localization. Furthermore we aim to investigate the effect of an acute patellofemoral loading
      bout and 12 weeks of resistance training on bone activity.
