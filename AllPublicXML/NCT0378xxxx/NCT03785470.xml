  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if short-term adoption of a Westernized lifestyle
      characterized by physical inactivity and increased consumption of fructose will result in
      metabolic and vascular dysfunction. Healthy individuals aged 18-45 years old will undergo an
      acute period of physical inactivity (10 days) coupled with increased fructose consumption.
      Augmented fructose consumption will be achieved via commercially available soda beverages
      which are high in fructose. Vascular and metabolic function measures will be performed before
      and after the 10-day intervention.

    <textblock>
      Men and women who regularly engage in &gt;10,000 steps per day, age 18-45 years, body mass index
      &lt; 30 kg/m2, and with no history of chronic disease will be recruited. Subjects who are
      eligible will undergo an acute period of physical inactivity (10 days) coupled with increased
      fructose consumption (6 cans/day). Physical activity levels will be assessed via a pedometer
      to quantify if individuals achieve &lt;5000 steps/day. Vascular and metabolic function measures
      will be performed before and after the 10-day intervention.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>carotid femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV)</measure>
    <time_frame>this will be assessed at baseline and at the final visit (10 days)</time_frame>
    <description>It is the gold standard non-invasive index of arterial stiffness. Transit time between carotid and femoral pressure waves is calculated using the foot-to-foot method. cfPWV is calculated as distance traveled by the pulse wave (i.e., femoral location-sternal notch minus sternal notch-carotid location) divided by pulse transit time. All the measurements will be done by the same technician</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Brachial artery flow mediated dilation (FMD)</measure>
    <time_frame>this will be assessed at baseline and at the final visit (10 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Brachial artery FMD will be assessed at baseline and at 10 days. FMD is a measurement of conduit artery endothelial function. FMD is assessed immediately after each PWV measurement. Shear rate AUC until peak diameter is calculated as stimulus for FMD and used in covariate analysis. All measurements will be performed by the same technician.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Insulin-stimulated leg blood flow</measure>
    <time_frame>this will be assessed at baseline and at the final visit (10 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will be instrumented with EKG for contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEU) measurements. We will perform a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp to evaluate microvascular perfusion of skeletal muscle via CEU. Insulin will be infused at a constant rate to mimic postprandial insulin concentrations and glucose maintained at fasting values via a variable 20% dextrose infusion. At baseline and in the steady state phase of the insulin clamp, we will assess microvascular perfusion in the vastus lateralis muscle using CEU (IE-33, Philips Ultrasound), via infusion of perflutren lipid microspheres. Microvascular perfusion will be assessed as an A-value. A is the video intensity plateau after complete replenishment reflecting relative microvascular blood volume (MBV).</description>
