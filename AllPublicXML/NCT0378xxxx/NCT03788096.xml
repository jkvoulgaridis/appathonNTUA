  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, 2-arm, single-blind, randomized controlled clinical feasibility trial design
      is planned. Forty CCI survivors will be randomized (1:1) to either the PS-PICS (peer support)
      intervention or usual care (control) group.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Randomized participants will complete 4 study assessments: 1) baseline data at hospital
      discharge; 2) baseline data post-hospital discharge and before the start of the weekly peer
      support intervention; 3) post-intervention at the conclusion of the 90-day weekly peer
      support intervention; and 4) follow-up at 6-months post-hospital discharge. The weekly peer
      support intervention will be delivered by a small pool of critical illness survivor peers
      (mentors) recruited from the study site from previous research. Peer support mentors will be
      trained in peer support and MI, and will deliver 3 months of weekly MI interventions
      (phone-based) to CCI survivors randomized to the intervention group. Participants randomized
      to the usual care group will not receive the weekly peer support/MI intervention but will
      receive the usual discharge planning services currently provided at hospital discharge.
      Participants in both groups will be contacted by the research team for 4 telephone-based
      assessments. The design will allow us to test the feasibility and potential impact of the
      PS-PICS intervention on social relationship measures, depression and self-management. Data
      collection and analyses are guided by the Individual and Family Self-Management Theory. The
      Individual and Family Self-Management Theory illustrates the interaction of the process of
      self-management with risk and protective factors, and short-term and long-term outcomes.

    <description>The Measure includes a scale. Please provide the following scale information:
Specify the full (unabbreviated) scale name and construct (i.e., indicate what the scale measures if not clear from name).
Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Fatigue Scale Include all scale ranges (i.e., minimum and maximum scores) required to interpret any values. For example, if the *total* score is reported, the *total* range should be provided. If *subscale* scores are reported, the range for each *subscale* should be provided.
The scale range is 0-65. The total score will be reported. For each scale range provided, specify which values are considered to be a better or worse outcome (e.g., Do higher values represent a better or worse outcome?).
The maximum total score is 65. Higher values represent higher levels of fatigue.
If subscales are combined to compute a total score, consider indicating how subscales are combined (summed, averaged, etc.).
