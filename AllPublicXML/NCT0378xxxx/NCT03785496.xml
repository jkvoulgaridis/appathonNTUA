  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To evaluate efficacy of combination of MCS110 and PDR001 by Objective Response rate by irRECIST(Immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors)</measure>
    <time_frame>Repeated tumor imaging will be performed every 2 cycle (each cycle is 21 days) after baseline imaging</time_frame>
    <description>In the first stage of the trial, 22 patients will be recruited, and their tumor response will be assessed irRECIST criteria, which is widely used tumor assessment criteria in immuno-oncology agent trials. The best response until 6 months according to irRECIST will be evaluated, and this trial will proceed to second stage if three or more respondents (irPR or irCR) are observed among 22 patients. The response (irPR or irCR) should be confirmed by next disease assessment(6 weeks/2cycles after initial response).
Subjects who discontinue trial treatment for a reason other than recurrence will move into the Follow-Up Phase and should be assessed every 16 weeks (± 14 days) by radiologic imaging to monitor disease status.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To evaluate antitumor efficacy of MCS110 and PDR001: PFS(Progression-Free Survival)</measure>
    <time_frame>Biopsies will be taken during the screening period (e.g., within 7 days before treatment [pre-dose]), on treatment (Day 22 of first dose) and post-treatment (e.g., within 28 days after progression)</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the time between the day of first cycle and the date of first documentation of progression or date of death, whichever occurs first. Documentation of progression will be defined as per irRECIST criteria based on investigator assessment. Patients without documented progression or death will be censored at the date of last tumor assessment (or, if no tumor assessments are performed after the baseline visit).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To evaluate antitumor efficacy of MCS110 and PDR001: OS(Overall survival)</measure>
    <time_frame>Biopsies will be taken during the screening period (e.g., within 7 days before treatment [pre-dose]), on treatment (Day 22 of first dose) and post-treatment (e.g., within 28 days after progression)</time_frame>
    <description>OS is defined as the time between the day of first cycle and the date of death. Patients without documented death will be censored at the date of last contact.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To evaluate antitumor efficacy of MCS110 and PDR001: DCR(Disease control rate)</measure>
    <time_frame>Biopsies will be taken during the screening period (e.g., within 7 days before treatment [pre-dose]), on treatment (Day 22 of first dose) and post-treatment (e.g., within 28 days after progression)</time_frame>
    <description>DCR is defined as the percentage of patients with cancer who have achieved complete response, partial response and stable disease to a therapeutic intervention in clinical trials of anticancer agents. irRECIST will be used in this study for assessment of tumor response. While either CT or MRI may be utilized, as per irRECIST, CT is the preferred imaging technique in this study.</description>

    <description>MCS110 and PDR001 will be administered once every 3 weeks via i.v. infusions over 1 hour and30 minutes, respectively. The drugs will be administered separately with at least a 30 min break between the two antibodies. Infusions of each antibody can be extended to up to 2 hours if clinically indicated. Both study drugs may be infused using the same i.v. access site. The same administration sequence must be followed for all patients, i.e. PDR001 should be infused first. If an infusion reaction occurs after administration of PDR001, the subsequent MCS110 infusion must be delayed until it is safe for the patient to receive MCS110 based on the clinical discretion of the investigator. The delay between PDR001 and MCS110 infusions can be up to 4 hours if clinically indicated.</description>

             dose of MCS110 for patients who stopped PDR001 and continued MCS110 alone for more
             than 60 days. Highly effective contraception methods include:

               -  Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of
                  the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
                  contraception

               -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without
                  hysterectomy) total hysterectomy or tubal ligation at least 1.5 months before
                  taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive
                  status of the woman has been confirmed by follow-up hormone level assessment

               -  Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). For female patients on
                  the study the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that
                  patient.

               -  Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or placement
                  of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS), or other forms of
                  hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate &lt;1%), for
                  example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception. In case of use
                  of oral contraception women should have been stable on the same pill for a
                  minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment. Women are considered
                  post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have had over 12
                  months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile
                  age appropriate (e.g. generally 40-59 years), history of vasomotor symptoms (e.g.
                  hot flushes) in the absence of other medical justification or have had surgical
                  bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy), total hysterectomy, or
                  tubal ligation at least 1.5 months ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only
                  when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow-up hormone
                  level assessment is she considered not of child bearing potential.

         20. Sexually active males unless they use a condom during intercourse while taking
             treatment and for150 days after the last dose of PDR001 or 90 days after the last dose
             of MCS110 for patients who stopped PDR001 and continued MCS110 alone for more than 60
             and should not father a child in this period. A condom is required to be used also by
             vasectomized men in order to prevent delivery of the drug via seminal fluid.
