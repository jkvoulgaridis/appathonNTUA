      D-CARE: The Dementia Care Study

      This pragmatic randomized clinical trial of 2150 persons with dementia and their caregivers,
      at four diverse clinical trial sites in the United States, will compare the effectiveness and
      cost-effectiveness of 18 months of health systems-based dementia care provided by a Dementia
      Care Specialist (nurse practitioner or physician assistant) who works within the heath system
      versus community-based dementia care provided by a Care Consultant (social worker or nurse)
      who works at a Community-Based Organization (CBO).

      The trial will also compare the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of both models versus
      enhanced usual care.

      D-CARE: The Dementia Care Study

      Objective: To determine the comparative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of two
      evidence-based models of comprehensive dementia care, as well as the effectiveness and
      cost-effectiveness of both models versus enhanced usual care.

      Design: A pragmatic randomized 3-arm superiority trial. The unit of randomization is the
      patient/caregiver dyad.

      Duration: 6 years. This includes 18 months for recruitment of study participants, 18 months
      of interventions/usual care, and simultaneously 18 months of follow-up for research purposes.

    <measure>Severity of Dementia-related Behavioral Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>The severity of symptoms of psychopathology in persons with dementia as measured by the Neuro-Psychiatric Inventory Questionnaire - Severity (NPI-Q Severity). The NPI-Q Severity is a validated survey that assesses the caregiver's perception of the severity of 12 dementia-related psychiatric and behavioral symptoms. NPI-Q Severity score ranges from 0-36 with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms. The outcome will be a least squares marginal mean based on follow-up measurements at 3, 6, 12 and 18 months.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Caregiver Distress</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>The level of caregiver distress/strain as measured by the Modified Caregiver Strain Index (MCSI). The MCSI is a 13-item validated tool used to assess severity of caregiver strain. The index targets financial, physical, psychological, and social aspects of strain and is scored from 0 to 26 with higher scores indicating greater levels of strain. The outcome will be a least squares marginal mean based on follow-up measurements at 3, 6, 12 and 18 months.</description>

    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Distress of caregivers due to the symptoms of psychopathology in persons with dementia as measured by the Neuro-Psychiatric Inventory Questionnaire - Distress (NPI-Q Distress). The NPI-Q Distress scale is a validated survey that assesses the level of distress experienced by the caregiver in response to dementia-related psychiatric and behavioral symptoms. NPI-Q Distress score ranges from 0-60 with higher scores indicating more severe distress. The outcome will be a least squares marginal mean based on follow-up measurements at 3, 6, 12 and 18 months.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Severity of Depression in Caregivers</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>The severity of depression in caregivers as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8). PHQ-8 is an 8-item validated tool used to assess depressive symptoms in the caregiver using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual IV (DSM-IV) criteria for major depression and is scored from 0-24 with scores &gt;10 indicating moderate symptoms and scores &gt;20 indicating severe depressive symptoms. The outcome will be a least squares marginal mean based on follow-up measurements at 3, 6, 12 and 18 months.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Caregiver Self-Efficacy: 4-item self-efficacy scale</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Caregivers' ability to manage dementia-related problems and ability to access help is measured with a 4-item self-efficacy scale [range, 1 to 5 (best)] measuring the caregiver's self-efficacy for caring for the patient with dementia and for accessing help, including community resources. The outcome will be a least squares marginal mean based on follow-up measurements at 6 and 18 months.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life of People with Dementia: QOL-AD</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life as measured by the Quality of Life in Alzheimer's Disease (QOL-AD). The QOL-AD is a 13-item instrument scored 4-52 (higher scores indicate better quality of life) that can be administered to persons with dementia and caregivers. It has demonstrated sensitivity to psychosocial intervention correlates with health-utility measures, is widely translated and used internationally and can be used by people with Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) scores as low as three. The outcome will be measured at 18 months.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Cost-Effectiveness Relative to Severity of Dementia-related Behavioral Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>The cost-effectiveness of the interventions compared to usual care is the ratio of incremental net costs to incremental effects of the NPI-Q-Severity. Thus, the ratio will be the net costs per unit change in NPI-Q-Severity. Costs will be taken from the perspective of Medicare. The net costs of the interventions are the costs of training for and doing the intervention less the cost offsets of reduced medical care and caregiving, if any, they bring about. The intervention costs, primarily labor, will be collected at the sites.</description>

    <description>Dementia care that is based in the health care system, which partners with community-based organizations to provide comprehensive, coordinated, patient-centered care. The health system-based dementia care arm uses a Dementia Care Specialist (Nurse Practitioner or Physician Assistant) supervised by a physician to tailor and facilitate dementia care delivery in collaboration with the primary care physician (co-management). The Health Systems-Based Dementia Care arm is based on UCLA's Alzheimer's and Dementia Care Program.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Dementia care that is based in community organizations, which gives equal attention to patients and their primary family or friend caregivers. The community-based dementia care arm uses Care Consultants (Social Workers or Nurses). Patients with dementia are engaged in the program whenever possible. Caregivers can be the sole program participant, when patients are too impaired. The program establishes a long-term relationship between Care Consultants and families. The exact content of assistance provided is tailored to the preferences of individual patients and caregivers, and is holistic in the range of potential concerns of problems addressed. The Community-Based Dementia Care arm is based on the Benjamin Rose Institute on Aging's Care Consultation Program.</description>
