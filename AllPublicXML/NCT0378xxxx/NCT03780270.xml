      The purpose of this study is to evaluate

        1. the additional therapeutic benefit of Curodont Repair for the treatment early occlusal
           carious lesions on permanent teeth in children compared fluoride varnish alone

        2. the tooth gel Curodont Protect when using it after Curodont Repair instead of fluoride
           varnish

      Objectives: The purpose of this study is to evaluate

        1. the additional therapeutic benefit of Curodont Repair for the treatment early occlusal
           carious lesions on permanent teeth in children compared fluoride varnish alone

        2. the tooth gel Curodont Protect when using it after Curodont Repair instead of fluoride
           varnish

      Methods: 90 patients with early occlusal lesions (ICDAS-II:2-3) on permanent molars and
      pre-molars will be allocated in this randomized, controlled, single blinded study to one of
      the two test groups (Test1: Curodont™ Repair+Fluoride Varnish; Test2: Curodont
      Repair+Curodont Protect) or control (Fluoride Varnish) group.

      Lesions will be assessed at baseline and recalls after 3, 6 and 12 months regarding caries
      activity (Nyvad), clinical status (ICDAS-II) and with Diagnodent®. Visual Analog Scale (VAS)
      in addition to the Global Impression of Change Questionnaire will also be used for the
      evaluation of the outcome.
