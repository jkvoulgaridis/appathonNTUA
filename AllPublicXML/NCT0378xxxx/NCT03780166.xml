        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinically documented and confirmed diagnosis of pemphigus vulgaris: minimum of 6
             months of pemphigus vulgaris diagnosis; positive for anti-desmoglein (DSG)1 or DSG3;
             Pemphigus Disease Area Index score of 8 to 45 points; active skin, scalp, or mucosal
             lesions.

          -  Disease progression after treatment with standard therapies that are known to confer
             clinical benefit, or intolerant to treatment; there is no limit to the number of prior
             treatment regimens.

          -  Willingness to avoid pregnancy or fathering children.

          -  If required, willing to receive Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia prophylaxis during
             the study period.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding female.

          -  Participants with pemphigus vulgaris who are treatment-naive.

          -  Use of protocol-specified medications within defined periods before baseline.

          -  Evidence or history of clinically significant infection or protocol-defined medical
             conditions

          -  Laboratory values outside the protocol-defined range at screening.

          -  Known or suspected allergy to parsaclisib or any component of the study drug.

          -  Known history of clinically significant drug or alcohol abuse in the last year before
             baseline.

          -  Inability or unlikeliness of the participant to comply with the dose schedule and
             study evaluations, in the opinion of the investigator.

          -  Any condition that would, in the investigator's judgment, interfere with full
             participation in the study, including administration of study drug and attending
             required study visits; pose a significant risk to the participant; or interfere with
             interpretation of study data.
