      squamous cell carcinoma after chemotherapy with apatinib mesylate
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label, multi-center, phase II clinical trial initiated by a
      investigator to observe and evaluate the efficacy of apatinib in the treatment of patients

    <description>It is recommended that the initial dose of apatinib is 500mg po qd. Adjust the dose to 750mg po qd or maintain the original dose according to the patient's medication response for about 2 weeks. If there is grade III or above, or grade II and above non-hematologic toxicity, allow the dose to be lowered 2 times.</description>

    <description>The chemotherapeutic drug chosen by the investigator (if not used in the previous treatment regimen, it cannot be selected).
The choice of chemotherapy regimen is based on the medication habits of the drug delivery doctor and the specific circumstances of the patient.
In addition, the following regimens may be selected as monotherapy or combination: docetaxel 60-75 mg/m2d1 q3w; irinotecan 150-180 mg/m2 d1 q2w until disease progression or patient decease. If the adverse event grade 3 and above Or non-hematologic toxicity of grade II and above appeared, allowing the dose to be lowered twice.</description>
