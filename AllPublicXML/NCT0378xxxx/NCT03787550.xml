  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is a multi-center, open-label, observational study aimed to understand the
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the commonly used sedative, analgesic and antibiotic
      drugs in adult patients supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), by
      measuring the plasma concentrations and the clinical effect of dexmedetomidine, midazolam,
      butorphanol, remifentanil, sufentanil, propofol, linezolid, tigecycline, teicoplanin,
      caspofungin, voriconazole and meropenem.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hospital mortality</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 60 days.</time_frame>
    <description>The hospital mortality is calculated as the number of deaths of the enrolled patients divided by the number of the total enrolled patient, and often presented as percentage.</description>

    <description>The data from the patients in the model building group will be used to build the population PK/PD model.

    <arm_group_label>Model validation group</arm_group_label>
    <description>The data from the patients in the model building group will be used to build the population PK/PD model. Two to three blood samples will be collected during at least one dose interval at the steady-state, including one sample from the start of ECMO and one at the end of ECMO.</description>

    <description>The sedatives (dexmedetomidine, midazolam, propofol), analgesics (butorphanol, remifentanil, sufentanil), and six antibiotics (linezolid, voriconazole, tigecycline, teicoplanin, caspofungin and meropenem) will be used according to the clinical need.</description>

        The patients undergoing ECMO will be invited to participate. At least 2-12 subjects will be
        enrolled to build a pharmacokineic model for each drug, and 1-4 subjects for external
        validation for each drug. The investigators plan to study the sedatives, analgesics and
        antibiotics with the initial sample size at 36 in total.
