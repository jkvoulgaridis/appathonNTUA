  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients were randomized into 2 groups:

        -  Vitamin E: Vitamin E ointment will be applied during 8 weeks

        -  Nitroglycerin: Nitroglycerin ointment will be applied during 8 weeks

      Healing rate of chronic anal fissure in patients receiving Nitroglycerin ointment and
      subjects patients receiving Vitamin E ointment were evaluated .

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients were randomly assigned to experimental and control groups: those patients receiving
      vitamin E ointment (Experimental Group - EG) and those receiving glyceryl trinitrate ointment
      (Control Group - CG).

      Treatments:

      Glyceryl trinitrate ointment (GTO): Commercially available aluminium tubes containing 0.4
      glyceryl trinitrate ointment (Rectogesic, proStrakan Group, Galashiels, UK) were purchased
      from pharmacies. The dosage for all the patients was 375 mg of ointment (containing 1.5 mg of
      glyceryl trinitrate), applied with a gloved finger to the distal anal canal, every 12 hours
      for an 8-week period.

      Vitamin E acetate ointment (VEA): Commercially available plastic tubes containing VitaminE
      acetate ointment (Filme Olio, Hulka SRL, Italy) were purchased from pharmacies. The dosage
      for all the patients was 1ml, applied with a gloved finger to the distal anal canal, every 12
      hours for an 8-week period.

      Healing rate of chronic anal fissure was investigated.
