      The study subject population will consist to up to 30 subjects who meet the
      inclusion/exclusion criteria. All subjects will be monitored for a period of 6 months post
      last treatment.

      An study results will be assessed on the following:

        -  POSAS - Patient Observer Scar Assessment

        -  ASAS - Acne Scar Severity Scale

        -  Subject Satisfaction Scale
