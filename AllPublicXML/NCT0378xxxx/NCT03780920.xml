  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Positional cranial deformities (PCD), plagiocephaly and brachycephaly are a common reason for
      pediatric consultation, which has increased significantly since the recommendation to lay
      babies on their backs to prevent unexpected infant death (ILD). CPD is a source of concern
      for parents about their impact on psychomotor development and the aesthetic risk of
      deformity. The High Authority for Health (HAS) will soon put in place recommendations with a
      fact sheet for health professionals and the public. The aim of this research is to study
      whether early treatment of rotation disorders and hypertonia in newborns by manual
      osteopathic techniques would prevent the occurrence of positional deformities of the skull.

      The main objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of an early osteopathic treatment on the
      rate of CPP (plagiocephalic and postural brachycephalia) at 4 months in newborns at risk.

      the secondary objective is: to evaluate the effectiveness of an early osteopathic treatment
      on the quality of life of the child at 4 months.

      Methodology: Controlled, randomized monocentric two-arm parallel study between (1)
      osteopathic follow-up and (2) osteopathy-free follow-up. The inclusion period will be 18
      months and the follow-up period is 4 months.

      Procedure: The two groups will be evaluated at 3 days and 4 months. The experimental group
      will benefit from an osteopathic treatment of 3 days of life to 4 months with a frequency of
      3 to 4 sessions. Both groups will benefit from sleeping, carrying, positioning and
      stimulation advice.

      The perspectives are:

        -  the decrease in the prevalence of CPP after early osteopathic treatment.

        -  Defining a decision algorithm for early osteopathic treatment.

        -  Subject to recommendations on the indication of early osteopathic treatment in neonates
           at risk.
