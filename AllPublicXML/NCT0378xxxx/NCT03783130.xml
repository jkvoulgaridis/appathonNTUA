  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus, which is the virus that causes AIDS. There is
      currently no licensed vaccine to prevent HIV infection. Researchers want to test a vaccine
      called Trimer 4571 for the first time. It was made at the National Institutes of Health and
      contains no HIV. It will be given mixed with a substance called alum to boost the body s
      immune response to the vaccine. Alum has been used in licensed vaccines for over 60 years and
      has been found to be safe.

      Objectives:

      To see if the vaccine Trimer 4571 is safe, well-tolerated, and to study immune responses to
      it.

      Eligibility:

      Healthy adults ages 18-50 years

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with a physical exam and blood tests. They must agree to not
      become pregnant and to avoid behavior that will put them at high-risk for HIV infection
      during the study.

      Participants will have about 15 study visits over about 9 months.

      The first 6 participants will get a low dose of the vaccine mixed with alum.

      Once that is deemed safe, 10 new participants will get a higher dose.

      All participants will be randomly assigned to get the vaccine by injection in a muscle or
      under the skin.

      All participants will get a total of 3 vaccine injections over 20 weeks. Each visit where
      participants receive the vaccine will last about 5 hours. Participants will be watched after
      each injection. Participants able to get pregnant will have a pregnancy test before each
      injection.

      Participants will get a thermometer and record their temperature and symptoms every day for 1
      week after each injection. They will also check the injection site for redness, swelling, or
      bruising.

      At follow-up visits, participants will have blood drawn and be checked for health changes or
      problems. Follow up visits will last about 1-2 hours.

    <textblock>
      Design:

      This is a Phase I, open-label, dose escalation study to evaluate the dose, safety,
      tolerability, and immunogenicity of VRC-HIVRGP096-00-VP (Trimer 4571) with aluminum hydroxide
      suspension (alum) as adjuvant in a three-injection regimen. The hypotheses are that the
      vaccine will be safe and tolerable and will induce detectable immune responses. The primary
      objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the investigational vaccine at three
      doses administered with alum. Secondary objectives are to evaluate humoral and cellular
      immunogenicity of the investigational vaccine regimens.

      Study Products:

      VRC-HIVRGP096-00-VP (Trimer 4571) was developed by the Vaccine Research Center (VRC),
      National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). The soluble HIV-1 envelope
      product consists of an HIV-1 envelope (Env) trimer variant, derived from clade A, strain
      BG505, with stabilizing mutations and engineered disulfide bonds, specifically recognized by
      broadly neutralizing antibodies and resists gp120 conformational change caused by CD4
      binding. Injections will be administered intramuscularly (IM) and subcutaneously (SC) in a 1
      mL volume by needle and syringe. The product is provided at a 500 mcg/mL concentration in 3
      mL glass vials filled to 1.2 +/- 0.10 mL. Adjuvant is an aluminum hydroxide suspension (alum)
      provided in a sterile, pyrogen-free suspension at a concentration of 5 mg/mL in 3 mL glass
      vials filled to 0.7 +/- 0.10 mL.

      Subjects:

      Healthy adults ages 18 to 50.

      Study Plan:

      Subjects will receive VRC-HIVRGP096-00-VP at doses of 100 mcg or 500 mcg, both with 500mcg
      alum field mixed, administered via IM or SC injections. A dose escalation evaluation will
      occur to ensure the safety data support proceeding to the higher dose. Subjects will be
      evaluated for safety and immune responses through blood collection at specified timepoints
      throughout the study. The study schema is below:

      --------------------

      Group 1: Subjects = 3; Route = IM; Dose (mcg) = 100; Day** 0, Week** 8, Week** 20

      Group 2: Subjects = 3; Route = SC; Dose (mcg) = 100; Day** 0, Week** 8, Week** 20

      Group 3: Subjects = 5; Route = IM; Dose (mcg) = 500; Day** 0, Week** 8, Week** 20

      Group 4: Subjects = 5; Route = SC; Dose (mcg) = 500; Day** 0, Week** 8, Week** 20

      Total = *16 Subjects

      **500 mcg of alum will be field mixed with Trimer 4571 for all groups

      *Up to 25 subjects may be enrolled if needed to evaluate safety or immunogenicity.

      Duration:

      Subjects will be followed for 40 weeks.
