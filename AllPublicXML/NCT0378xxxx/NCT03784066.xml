    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label, prospective, pilot phase I/II study with focus on
      translational research and on the evaluation of the biological changes that are observed in
      sequential tumor tissue acquisition in patients with newly diagnosed advanced (stage IV) oral
      cavity SCC. Patients are treated with Durvalumab (arm A) or Durvalumab + Tremelimumab (arm B)
      after biopsy-confirmed diagnosis of locally advanced resectable SCCHN of the oral cavity.
      After surgery, the standard of care treatment is radiotherapy, and, depending on risk
      assessment concurrent cisplatin. Patients will be treated with Durvalumab (arm A) or
      Durvalumab and Tremelimumab (arm B) during six additional cycles, starting from day one of
      the postoperative radiotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Durvalumab has shown activity in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Locally
      advanced resectable cancers of this type represent a challenge, as the majority of these
      patients still die from this disease in spite of surgery, radio- and chemotherapy.

      Checkpoint inhibitors have recently proven to prolong life in recurrent/metastatic SCCHN, and
      several new molecules are currently tested in clinical trials in this indication, including
      PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA-4 antibodies, either as single agent or in combination. These compounds
      might represent a valuable treatment for SCCHN patients in the adjuvant setting, given the
      favorable toxicity profile. Combination of Durvalumab (PD-L1 inhibition) and Tremelimumab
      (CTLA-4 inhibition) is currently tested in recurrent/metastatic head and neck cancer, and
      compared to Durvalumab as single agent, and to standard of care chemotherapy.

      In this study both options, i.e. durvalumab as a single agent or Durvalumab in combination
      with Tremelimumab, will be tested in a randomized fashion. Randomization would be used to
      reduce selection bias, in a non-comparative study. Newly diagnosed patients with SCCHN of the
      oral cavity, will be treated with a single dose of Durvalumab with or without Tremelimumab
      two weeks before scheduled surgery.

      When patients are first diagnosed with a resectable oral SCC, a biopsy is taken to confirm
      the diagnosis, and surgery is planned. This standard practice thus involves sequential tissue
      harvesting, both at the time of biopsy as well as the final resection specimen, making it
      possible to observe hallmarks of immune response when patients are treated once with
      Durvalumab with or without Tremelimumab after confirmation of the diagnosis on biopsy, but
      before surgery.
