  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to investigate the Norwegian adult achondroplasia population regarding degree
      and extent of symptoms and clinical manifestations and how this population manages in daily
      life, including demographics, physical function, and work participation.

      The present study aims to investigate the degree and extent of spinal stenosis, chronic pain,
      sleep apnoea, impaired hearing, cardiovascular risk factors and body composition in Norwegian
      adults with achondroplasia. The study will also explore these factors' impact on physical
      function, ability to perform daily activities, work participation and needs for assistive
      devices and social benefits. The study is conducted in collaboration with the Norwegian
      Restricted Growth Association, and TRS National Resource Centre for Rare Disorders, Sunnaas
      Rehabilitation Hospital, Lovisenberg Hospital and Oslo University Hospital.

    <description>Describe prevalence of medical complications in a cohort of Norwegian adults with achondroplasia using interview, clinical examination and review of medical records. Data on spinal stenosis will be obtained by face-to-face interview, clinical examination, and review of medical charts including MRI-scans. Assessment of sleep apnoea will include an overnight sleep registration (polygraphy). Hearing will be assessed by standardized examination including audiometry, tympanometry and impedance measurements</description>

    <measure>Describe prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors in adults with achondroplasia, and investigate body composition.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Cardiovascular risk factors, including smoking habits and blood pressure, will be recorded by interview and clinical examination, and will also include a fasting blood sample for lipids, glucose, HbA1C, thyroid, kidney and liver function tests. Body composition will be assessed by anthropometric measures (height in cm, weight in kg, waist circumference in cm, and hip circumference in cm), BMI will be calculated, and body fat content and distribution will be assessed by using MRI.</description>
