  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type A aortic dissection is an emergency condition, defined by the appearance of an intimal
      flap within the ascending aorta. Urgent treatment is required, with surgical replacement of -
      at minima - the tubular portion of the ascending aorta.

      After surgery, a majority of patients will still have a residual aortic dissection involving
      the aortic arch and/or the descending aorta. Long-term survival in these patients can be
      hindered by the apparition of an aneurysmal progression of the dissected aorta, with risk of
      rupture, thrombose and/or embolism. Consequently, this condition requires frequent follow-up
      imaging examinations, usually by Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA), to monitor the
      extension of the dissection and the diameters of the dissected aorta. Patient management is
      therefore based on passive follow-up of the disease, as no definitive clinical or imaging
      features can predict the potential evolution (or the absence of) towards an aneurysmal
      evolution.

      Therefore, one can understand the important need for accurate predictors of aneurysmal
      dilatation of post-operative residual dissection.

      CTA has the ability to visualize the intimal flap motion, by averaging at least 3 or 4
      cardiac cycles over a non-gated arterial acquisition.

      This intimal flap mobility varies greatly between patients, between the localization and the
      extension of the dissection, and between acute and chronic dissections. It is thought that
      chronic dissections with immobile flap might be less prone to aneurysmal evolution.

      The investigators hypothesize that this mobility could be a prognostic marker for the
      evolution towards aortic dilatation: flap that would remain highly mobile after initial
      surgery could be an additional marker towards an aneurysmal evolution, while immobile flap
      could be on the contrary a marker of stability.

      Intimal flap motion can already be qualitatively and quantitatively assessed in CTA when
      ECG-synchronization is used. However, this technique has a limited availability and
      significantly increases the total radiation dose, therefore limiting its use in routine
      practice. Being able to quantify this marker using routine non ECG-gated CTA could be a
      significant addition to the literature, as it is currently unknown if this is
      feasible/relevant.
