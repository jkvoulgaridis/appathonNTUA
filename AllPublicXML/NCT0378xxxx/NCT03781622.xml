    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted as a feasibility clinical investigation to collect safety and
      technical performance data of the WOLF Thrombectomy Device for the removal of thrombus in the
      neurovasculature.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study has been designed as a prospective, non-randomized, multi-center, feasibility
      clinical investigation to evaluate the safety and device technical performance of the WOLF
      Thrombectomy Device in removing thrombus from an occluded large intracranial vessel(s) in
      patients with acute ischemic stroke. The device may be used alone or as an adjunct to
      intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and/or to other traditional, thrombectomy
      modalities.

    <description>Technical Success defined as the ability to achieve a revascularization rate (Thrombolysis in cerebral infarction [TICI] 2b/3) of ≥50% with the first pass of the WOLF Thrombectomy device. Revascularization is assessed by the investigator using fluoroscopy and after the first pass of the device is assessed using the TICI scale. Additional passes will be performed as necessary and the total number of attempts to achieve revascularization documented.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female subjects age ≥18 years (no upper limit).

          2. NIHSS &gt; 6 at the time of baseline neuro imaging.

          3. Endovascular treatment intended to be initiated within 60 minutes of qualifying
             neuroimaging and intended vessel recanalization within 90 minutes of qualifying
             neuroimaging.

          4. Stroke symptom onset within 24hrs of when groin puncture can be obtained.

          5. Anterior and posterior circulation large vessel occlusion as confirmed through neuro
             imaging (CT/CTA/mCTA/MRI/MRA).

          6. Neurovascular imaging (CTA/mCTA and or MRA) must include the aortic arch, cervical
             vessels and intracranial circulation.

          7. Advanced neurovascular imaging is required for patients when groin puncture can be
             obtained after 6 hours and before 24 hours (multiphase CTA, CT Perfusion or perfusion
             diffusion imaging).

          8. The occlusion is located in a proximal intracranial artery (carotid artery, M1 segment
             of the MCA, or proximal M2 divisions) of the anterior circulation for patients after 6
             hours and before 24 hours.

          9. There is imaging and clinical evidence of small core and large areas at risk, defined
             in the previous trials (DAWN &amp; DEFUSE 3) as either:

             i. NIHSS ≥10 and either 0-21 ml core infarct (≥80 years old) or 0-31 ml core infarct
             (&lt;80 years old), or NIHSS≥20 and 31 to &lt;51ml core infarct and &lt;80 years old (DAWN
             trial criteria).

             OR ii. Ischemic core volume is &lt; 70 ml, mismatch ratio is &gt;/= 1.8 and mismatch volume*
             is &gt;/= 15 ml (DEFUSE 3 trial criteria).

         10. Pre-stroke disability limited to patients with mRS ≤ 2.

         11. Written informed consent to participate given by subject or legal / authorized
             representative per local ethics committee requirements.

          2. Absence of large vessel occlusion on neuro imaging.

          3. Presence of existing or preexisting large vessel infarction.

          4. Angiographic evidence of excessive arterial tortuosity or access that precludes the
             WOLF device from reaching the thrombus.

          5. Known hemorrhagic diathesis, coagulation factor deficiency, or oral anticoagulant
             therapy with INR &gt;2.5.

          6. Patient has a known hypersensitivity to contrast media.

          7. Medical reasons the procedure cannot be performed (i.e. patient is experiencing
             active, uncontrolled bleeding, etc.)

          8. Subject is known to be currently enrolled in another investigational trial that could
             interfere with the endpoint analysis of this trial.

          9. ASPECT &lt; 5 or &gt; 1/3 MCA vascular territory compromised as evidenced by CT or MRI.

         10. Significant mass effect and mid-line shift.

         11. Any evidence of intracranial hemorrhage on imaging.

         12. For posterior circulation large vessel occlusion evidence of completed significant
             brain stem infarction.

         13. Posterior circulation after 6 hours.

         14. Patients are known to have severe psychiatric disorders, substance abuse, or other
             reason for being unable to follow trial follow-up instructions.

         15. Subject has a known significant concomitant illness with a life expectancy of &lt;6
             months.

         16. Subject has a known allergy to nickel.

         17. Subject has a known history of severe intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD).

         18. Subject is unlikely to be able and willing to comply with site standard medical follow
             up to 90 days.
