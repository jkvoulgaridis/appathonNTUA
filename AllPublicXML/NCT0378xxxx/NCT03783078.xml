  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, open-label, multicenter, efficacy, and safety study of pembrolizumab in
      adult and pediatric participants with previously untreated advanced Merkel Cell Carcinoma
      (MCC). The primary objective of the trial is to assess the objective response rate, as
      assessed by blinded independent central review per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
      Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a
      maximum of 5 target lesions per organ, following administration of pembrolizumab.
