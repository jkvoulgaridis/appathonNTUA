      The Prospective REgistry of Stable Angina manaGEment and Treatment (PRESAGE) is an
      observational study on an all-comer stable angina population hospitalised in a highly
      specialized cardiovascular centre with cardiac surgery facilities. The aim of the study is to
      assess the clinical characteristics, treatment modalities, early and long-term outcomes in
      this population.

      The Prospective REgistry of Stable Angina manaGEment and Treatment (PRESAGE) is a
      single-center, observational study recruiting consecutive patients with stable angina, who
      were diagnosed and treated in the 3rd Chair and Department of Cardiology in the Silesian
      Centre for Heart Diseases in Zabrze, Poland. The Silesian Centre for Heart Diseases is a
      highly specialised cardiology centre with cardiac surgery facilities

      The main objective of the PRESAGE Registry is to clarify the overall clinical characteristics
      of patients with stable angina, their demographics and clinical profile, current management,
      early and long-term outcomes, with regard to the administered treatment.

      The diagnosis of stable angina was based on clinical characterization, coronary angiography,
      and the current guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology. Patients with vasospastic
      and/or microvascular angina were also included to the registry. Performance of coronary
      angiography is the criterion of the enrolment in the registry.

      Patients with acute coronary syndromes are excluded from the analysis.

      Data collection is patient-based (not event-based).

      Complete patient demographics: medical history, complete hospitalization data (diagnostic and
      therapeutic) and in-hospital results are collected in an electronic form by the attending
      physician. The patients are under constant follow-up for all-cause mortality and major
      cardiac adverse events.
