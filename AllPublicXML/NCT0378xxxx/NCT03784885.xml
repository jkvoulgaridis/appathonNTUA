      This is a Phase 2 prospective, randomized controlled, double-blind, multi-center study to
      evaluate the immunogenicity, safety and tolerability of AD07030, a trivalent influenza virus
      antigens vaccine, given intranasally in healthy adult volunteers.

      About 358 healthy subjects, meeting all the eligibility criteria will be enrolled into the
      study and randomized into 3 study groups (in 2:2:1 ratio) to receive either the study vaccine
      at one of the dose levels of adjuvant AD07010 (30μg or 45μg LTh(αK)) in combination with
      hemagglutinin (HA) antigens or to receive control vaccine consisting of HA antigens alone.
      The 3 study groups are as follows:

        -  Group 1: 22.5μg HA with 30μg AD07010

        -  Group 2: 22.5μg HA with 45μg AD07010

        -  Group 3: 22.5μg HA alone Each subject will receive intranasal administration of 2 doses
           of IP (study or control vaccine) at same dosages, given 7 days apart on study Day 1 and
           Day 8. Solicited local and general AEs will be recorded after each vaccination in the
           subject's diary card for up to 7 days (the vaccine administration day and 6 days
           following it). Subjects will be followed up for monitoring of safety and immunogenicity
           for 180 days. AE and SAE and concomitant medication/vaccination will be collected
           throughout the study. There will be total of 6 study visits and a telephone call.
