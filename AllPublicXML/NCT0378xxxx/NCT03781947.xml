  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A Phase I, open-label, single centre study investigating the pharmacokinetics, safety and
      pharmacodynamics of a single dose of teverelix TFA, a gonadotrophin releasing hormone
      antagonist, via subcutaneous or intramuscular route of administration in healthy male
      volunteers
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is:

      • To characterise the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of teverelix following single dose,
      subcutaneous (s.c.) and intramuscular (i.m.) administration of teverelix TFA in healthy male
      subjects

      The secondary objectives of the study are:

        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of teverelix TFA after single s.c. and i.m.
           injections in healthy male subjects

        -  To evaluate pharmacodynamics (PD) effects of teverelix following single dose, s.c. and
           i.m. administration of teverelix TFA in healthy male subjects

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Provide voluntarily agreement to participate in this study and sign an Independent
             Ethics Committee (IEC)-approved informed consent prior to performing any of the
             screening procedures.

          2. Males of any ethnic origin, between 40 to 70 years of age (inclusive) at the screening
             visit.

          3. Healthy, determined by pre-study medical evaluation (medical history, vital signs,
             physical examination, standard 12-lead ECG and clinical laboratory evaluations).

             If a vital sign or ECG assessment is outside of the reference range at the screening
             visit or admission, the assessment may be repeated once to rule out any error.

          4. Body mass index (BMI) between 20.0 and 34.9 kg/m2 (inclusive) at the screening visit
             and on admission.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Clinically relevant history of cardiovascular, respiratory, hepatic, renal,
             pancreatic, gastrointestinal, metabolic, endocrine, neurological, dermatological,
             immunological, psychiatric or other diseases/disorders as determined by the Principal
             Investigator or designee, or evidence of such diseases/disorders during the screening
             period.

          7. History of clinically relevant allergies or idiosyncrasies to medication or food.

          8. History of regular alcohol consumption exceeding 21 units per week within 2 years of
             study entry.

          9. History of illicit drug abuse within 2 years of study entry.

             outside of the reference range at the screening visit or admission, the assessment may
             be repeated once to rule out laboratory error.

         12. An estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt; 90 mL/min, based on creatinine
             clearance calculation by the Cockcroft Gault formula and normalised to an average
             surface area of 1.73m2, at the screening visit.

         13. Positive results in any of the tests for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), total
             hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb), hepatitis C antibody (anti-HCV) or human
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies, at the screening visit.

         14. Positive urine test for ethanol and/or drugs of abuse at the screening visit or
             admission.

         15. Use of prescription, non-prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) medications

             screening visit.

         17. Donation of blood (&gt; 500 mL) or blood products within 2 months (56 days) prior to the
             screening visit.

         18. Unwilling to avoid consumption of coffee and caffeine-containing products within 48
             hours prior to admission until discharge from the study centre, as well as from 48
             hours before ambulatory visits.

         19. Unwilling to avoid use of alcohol or alcohol-containing foods, medications or
             beverages, within 48 hours prior to admission until discharge from the study centre,
             as well as from 48 hours before ambulatory visits.

         20. Unwilling to abstain from vigorous exercise from 72 hours prior to admission until
             discharge from the study centre, as well as from 72 hours before ambulatory visits.

             restrictions, the nature, scope and possible consequences of the clinical study.

         22. Subject is unlikely to comply with the protocol requirements, instructions and study
             related restrictions; e.g., uncooperative attitude, inability to return for follow-up
             visits and improbability of completing the clinical study.

         23. Subject has any concurrent condition that, in the opinion of the Principal
             Investigator, would make the subject unsuitable for participation in the clinical
             study.

         24. Subject is an employee or the close relative of an employee of the Sponsor or the
             clinical research organisation (CRO) involved in the clinical study.

         25. Vulnerable subjects defined as individuals whose willingness to volunteer in a
             clinical study may be unduly influenced by the expectation, whether justified or not,
             of benefits associated with participation, or of a retaliatory response from senior
             members of a hierarchy in case of refusal to participate (e.g., persons in detention,
             minors and those incapable of giving consent).
