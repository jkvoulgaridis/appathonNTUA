  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In previous studies,the investigators found that POF (A combination of oxaliplatin,
      fluorouracil and Paclitaxel) regimen appears to be of good efficacy and is well tolerated in
      patients with advanced gastric cancer. Apatinib is an orally antiangiogenic agent. It was
      approved and launched in China in 2014 as a 3rd-line treatment for patients with advanced
      gastric cancer. Therefore, investigators conducted the dose escalation phase I study to
      explore the safety of combination of apatinib and POF as first-line treatment for advanced
      gastric cancer. Now the investigators are going to start a phase 2 trial with apatinib 500mg
      + POF as second-line therapy to investigate the efficacy and safety in the patients with
      advanced gastric cancer.
