      The method &quot;Collaborative and Proactive Solutions&quot; (CPS) was developed by Dr. Ross Greene,
      Harvard University, and provides a more compassionate and accurate way to understand and help
      kids with social, emotional, and behavioral challenges. The underlying theory is that
      challenging behavior is caused by lagging cognitive skills, commonly in the domains of
      flexibility/adaptability, frustration tolerance, and problem‐solving. Thus, challenging
      behavior can be seen as a form of developmental delay, and the most effective way for adults
      to help the children and to facilitate interaction with them is to understand the lagging
      skills behind the behavior and to change their own mindset accordingly. Strategies and
      collaboration become very different when the adult knows this and expects that &quot;kids do well
      if they can&quot;.

      The CPS-method has been evaluated by Ross Greene et al. in United States studies for
      families, in schools, and in institutions for young people with serious behavior problems.
      Our research group published the first Swedish study with the method in 2012, a small open
      pilot study.

      The present study is a randomized controlled trial for approximately 130 children and
      adolescents aged 5-18 years, with neuropsychiatric disorders (for instance Attention Deficit
      Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD), Conduct Disorder (CD),
      Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Tourette syndrome, learning difficulties), children who have
      been assessed at our Child Neuropsychiatry Clinic (CNC), and from the Habilitation Services,
      Child Psychiatry Units or schools in the Göteborg region. Explosive behaviors are among the
      most serious problems for many children with neuropsychiatric disorders and the demand for
      treatment programs is great.

    <textblock>
      The &quot;Collaborative Problem Solving&quot; model was developed by Greene for the treatment of youth
      with oppositional behavior, and is now called Collaborative &amp; Proactive Solutions (CPS). The
      aim of CPS is to help caregivers and children practice and learn problem solving strategies
      in collaboration. The theoretical base of the model is that problematic behavior is mainly
      caused by lagging skills, especially regarding frustration tolerance, flexibility and problem
      solving ability. The CPS model engages both the child and the parents in training, and may
      therefore have potential to give long-term improvement of lagging skills in handling
      problematic situations and to change the mindset towards strategies of mutual problem
      solving.

      The CPS model was evaluated in a United States trial comparing CPS to Barkley's Parent
      Management Training program (PMT) in 47 children aged 4-12 years with ODD and affective
      dysregulation. Outcomes were similar between the two methods in most measures post-treatment
      and at 4 months follow-up. A recent larger randomized controlled US trial enrolled 134
      children with ODD, aged 7 - 14 years, who were randomized to three groups (CPS, PMT or
      Waitlist Control). Both treatment groups had equivalent results in treatment response and
      remission of diagnostic status (50% were much to very much improved and no longer met
      diagnostic criteria), and both were superior to the WLC condition.

      The first Swedish study of CPS, published by our research team 2012, was a small open pilot
      trial of 3 months CPS for 17 families and children aged 7-13 years, with ADHD, ODD and
      explosive behavior, showed promising results. At post-treatment 53% of the children were much
      or very much improved on global symptom and function ratings (Clinical Global
      Impression-Improvement; CGI-I rating 1-2), and after another 6 months when the children with
      severe residual ADHD symptoms also had received stimulant medication, 81% reached CGI-I
      levels of 1-2.

      Thus previous research has suggested that CPS is an effective treatment for ODD in youth, but
      confirmation from large randomized controlled trials with long-term follow-up is needed to
      strengthen the scientific support, and effectiveness in samples of children with various
      neurodevelopmental disorders has not yet been documented. Oppositional and explosive behavior
      is a major problem among youth with neurodevelopmental disorders and the demand for treatment
      strategies is great.

      Research questions

        1. Can the CPS model reduce problematic behaviors? Outcome measures are the rating scales
           Swanson, Nolan and Pelham scale (SNAP-IV), Family Burden of Illness Module (FBIM),
           Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory (ECBI), Clinical Global Impression-Severity scale
           (CGI-S), Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale (CGI-I) (see below).

        2. Can the CPS model contribute to solve specific problem situations. Outcome measure is a
           Problem Rating Scale developed for this study

        3. Can the CPS model improve psychiatric well-being and self-image in the participants?
           Outcome measure is the Beck Youth Inventories.

      Method Experiences from treatment of children with complex neurodevelopmental disorders
      (mainly including autism) have led the therapists in our team to make some autism-adapted
      modifications in interaction and communication.

      The present study is designed to investigate how well CPS works for challenging behaviors in
      well-defined clinical samples of children with complex neurodevelopmental disorders.
      Participants are children and adolescents aged 5-18 years, with any neurodevelopmental
      diagnosis, and with intellectual level in the normal range.

      After neuropsychiatric assessment and diagnosis at our centre or at the Child Psychiatry
      Centres in Gothenburg 130 children and adolescents aged 5-18 years with complex
      neurodevelopmental disorders (i.e. autism, ADHD, learning disorders, dyslexia, tics, and
      Conduct Disorder) and problematic behaviors are invited to participate in the trial. They are
      randomized to a CPS treatment group and a control group. The treatment group receives CPS for
      3 months. The control group receives 3 months of &quot;treatment as usual (TAU)&quot; (that is the
      standard psychoeducation, support and treatment given to all youth after neuropsychiatric
      assessment at our clinic), followed by 3 months of CPS. Outcome measures are collected pre-
      and post-treatment, and after 6 months and one year. During the CPS treatment period the
      parents and children meet the therapists at approximately 10 visits, at which they
      collaborate to find problem solving strategies, which they then practice at home between
      visits.

      Inclusion criteria

        1. Children and adolescents aged 5-18 years with neurodevelopmental disorders and serious
           problematic behaviors.

        2. Intellectual function in the normal range, according to WISC-test and clinical judgment

      4) Participants taking psychoactive medication can be included if the medication has been
      unchanged for at least one month before baseline, and remains unchanged during the treatment
      period.

      Exclusion criteria

        1. Bipolar disorder, psychosis, or other unstable psychiatric or medical disorder which in
           the investigator's judgment makes participation in the trial unsuitable.

        2. Substance use.

      Outcome measures The following measures were collected at baseline (pre-treatment), after the
      treatment/TAU period (post-treatment), after 6 months (6-month follow-up) and 1 year
      (one-year follow-up). To obtain results from different perspectives ratings from four sources
      were used, i.e. from the therapists, parents, children, and rating by independent blinded
      assessors.

      Therapist ratings ALSUP (Assessment of Lagging Skills and Unsolved Problems), Problem Solving
      plan (in which the process of problem solving training is documented), and the Problem Rating
      Scale (in which the severity of the problematic situations before and after treatment is
      rated)

      Parent ratings SNAP-IV - rating scale for ADHD symptoms FBIM - rating scale of family
      stress/burden ECBI - rating of behavior problems

      Child self-rating Beck Youth Inventories: For rating of depression, anxiety, irritability,
      externalizing behavior, and self image (child interviewed).

      Rating of independent blinded assessor CGI-S: Scale for global rating of problem/symptom
      severity (scale from 1-7; 1 no problems, 7 very severe problems) CGI-I: Scale for global
      rating of improvement or deterioration of problems/symptoms (scale from 1-7; 1 very much
      improved, 7 very much worse)
