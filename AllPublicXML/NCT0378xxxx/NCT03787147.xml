  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain intensity as measured by the Visual Analog Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after receiving spinal injection</time_frame>
    <description>Participants are asked to rate their intensity of pain, by completing a Visual Analog Scale (VAS). The VAS consists of lines and emojis used to indicate pain level; the lines range from 0 (= no pain) to 10 (= unbearable pain) and the emojis range from 0 (= no pain) to 5 (= unbearable pain).</description>

    <measure>Anxiety Level as measured by the Visual Facial Anxiety Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after receiving spinal injection</time_frame>
    <description>Participants are asked to rate their anxiety level by completing the Visual Facial Anxiety Scale(VFAS). The VFAS consists of emojis ranging from 0 (= no anxiety) to 5 (highest anxiety).</description>
