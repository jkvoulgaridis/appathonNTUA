      This is a feasibility study to alter the Microsoft Kinect software to be used as a
      rehabilitation tool. The prototype used is still in the early developing stage. The purpose
      of this research study is to develop a prototype of altered Microsoft Kinect Software and
      determine its use in improving the function of the study subjects' weaker extremities. The
      altered software will allow a viewing of the mirror image of the involved limb as it is
      moved. However, the image that is viewed will reflect normal movement even if the limb cannot
      move normally. By viewing normal movement of the weaker limbs the &quot;mirror neuron&quot; network in
      the brain will become activated and will ultimately improve the function of the weaker side.
