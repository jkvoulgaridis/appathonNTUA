  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was conducted to investigate the effect of a person-centered, occupation-based
      intervention program supported with problem-solving strategy in individuals with type 2
      diabetes (T2D).

      Method: The study was a randomized controlled trial, that included intervention (n=33) and
      control group (n=34), between the ages of 18 and 65 years.

    <textblock>
      It was planned as a single-blind, randomized controlled study with 3-month follow-up in
      adults. A total of 67 subjects were randomly allocated to the intervention (n=33) or the
      control group (n=34). This program prepared with consider to meaningful activities for
      individual and overcome to barriers via problem solving. That was designed as 6 modules
      including evaluations, diabetes education and problem-solving therapy. Each module was
      implemented at least 1 session per week, about 60 minutes, and was arranged according to
      individual needs.

    <intervention_model_description>The problem solving therapy is an social cognitive therapy approach. And ıt support to solve meaningfull occupational performance problems realted to diabetes by invdividuals and this way, it helps to improve the self-management of diabetes.We used that with person centered perspective and support to person with education which was perspective of person environment occupation model.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Single (Participant)</masking>
    <masking_description>The study population was 76 individuals whose diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. 9 volunteer individual gave up to participation without for various reasons in the process.That intervention grup (n=33) control group (n=34), between the ages of 18 to 65 years and volunteer individuals.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Canada activity performance measure (COPM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Intervention and control groups' each participants were analyze before the intervention modules with assessment tools. All assessment tools repeated 6 weeks and 3 months later from the intervention modules.</time_frame>
    <description>COPM, measure self-perceived change in problem on occupational performance and satisfaction over time. The COPM enable individuals to identify and prioritize everyday issues that restrict or impact their performance in everyday living. In the first step, occupational therapist interviews with client determine what the individual has done in his/her routine, what he/she wants to do or can not to do in their self-care, productivity and free time. Secondly the client to rate, on a scale of 1 to 10, the importance of each activity. Then confirming with the client the 5 most important problems and record. The client to rate each problem on performance and satisfaction, then calculate the total scores.
Total scores are calculated by adding together the performance or satisfaction scores for all problems and dividing by the number of problems. At reassessment,the client scores each problem again for performance and satisfaction. Calculate the new scores and the change score.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The diabetes empowerment scale (DES)</measure>
    <time_frame>Intervention and control groups' each participants were analyze before the intervention modules with assessment tools. All assessment tools repeated 6 weeks and 3 months later from the intervention modules.</time_frame>
    <description>DES measure the psychosocial self-efficacy of people with diabetes. The scale consists of three factors; managing the psychosocial aspects of diabetes (9 items), assessing dissatisfaction and readiness to change (9 items), setting and achieving diabetes goals (10 items). Each question on the diabetes empowerment scale scores between 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). The total score of the scale, calculated by adding all of the item scores and dividing by 28. High score indicates that the levels of empowerment are high.</description>

    <measure>The Brief COPE</measure>
    <time_frame>Intervention and control groups' each participants were analyze before the intervention modules with assessment tools. All assessment tools repeated 6 weeks and 3 months later from the intervention modules.</time_frame>
    <description>The Brief COPE assess coping style with stress. Brief COPE include 14 subscale such as self-distraction (items 1 and 19), active coping, (items 2 and 7), denial, (items 3 and 8), substance use, (items 4 and 11), use of emotional support, (items 5 and 15), use of instrumental support, (items 10 and 23), behavioral disengagement, (items 6 and 16),venting, (items 9 and 21), positive reframing, items 12 and 17), planning, (items 14 and 25),humor, (items 18 and 28). each options rate range from 1 (ı'm not doing this at all) to 4 (ı'm doing this a lot), and min-max score range from 2 to 8.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>WHO-five well-being index (WHO-5)</measure>
    <time_frame>Intervention and control groups' each participants were analyze before the intervention modules with assessment tools. All assessment tools repeated 6 weeks and 3 months later from the intervention modules.</time_frame>
    <description>The WHO-5 well being index was used to psychometrically sound measure of emotional well-being. The answer for each question are given considering the last 14 days. Each of the 5 items is scored from 5 (all of the time) to 0 (none of the time). The total score changes to ranges from 0 (absence of well-being) to 25 (maximum well-being). The raw score is multiplied by 4 to obtain a percentage score between 0 and 100. When the changes is 10% in raw score, that indicates a significant change.</description>
