  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In order to discover dysphagia scales, which shows meaningful predictability of aspiration
      and functional health status in patients with acute stroke, authors plan to find out more
      predictable indicators than existing penetration-aspiration scale (PAS) to validate their
      predictions and their internal and external validity over 6 months following stroke .

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To determine the dysphagia scale with significant predictions of aspiration and functional
      health status in patients with acute stroke, video-fluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS) will
      be performed to the patients who will be referred for VFSS among stroke patients who would be
      diagnosed by Brain MRI / CT. When any type of dysphagia is found, participant will be
      assigned to the test group (DYS), and when no dysphagia is found, they will be assigned to
      the control group (NOD).

      Numerous kinds of assessment will be conducted before and after VFSS, before discharge, and
      3, 6, and 9 months after the stroke onset.

        Based on the raw data of BMI by Batsis et al's report in 2017 (mean value of two groups:
        28.5 and 27.6, mean SD of two groups: 1.0), authors calculated total numbers of subjects,
        based on the Kang method using G power 3.1. Assuming the between factors analysis using the
        F-test of MANOVA, effect size 0.45, α value ≤0.05, power 0.8, number of groups 2, and
        number of repeated measures 4 were inputted. Supposed that the dropout rate was 20%, 34
        patients in each group were finally calculated.
