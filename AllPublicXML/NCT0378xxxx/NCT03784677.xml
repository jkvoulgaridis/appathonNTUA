    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of SOR-C13 in treating patients
      with solid tumors that have spread to other places in the body (advanced) and does not
      respond to treatment. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as SOR-C13, work in different ways to
      stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing,
      or by stopping them from spreading.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To define the maximum tolerated doses (MTD) of TRPV6 calcium channel inhibitor SOR-C13
      (SOR-C13) in subjects with advanced solid tumor cancers of epithelial origin.

      II. To define the safety profiles of the treatment.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate clinical response signals to the treatment. II. To assess predictive
      biomarkers (baseline molecular mutation status) and/or resistant pathways by comparing
      molecular signatures at baseline versus at time of relapse in patients who have achieved
      objective responses.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive TRPV6 calcium channel inhibitor SOR-C13 intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on
      days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16, 22, and 23. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.
