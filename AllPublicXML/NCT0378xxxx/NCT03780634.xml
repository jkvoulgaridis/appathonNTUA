  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of hepatic artery infusion
      chemotherapy (HAIC) combined with Programmed Cell Death Protein-1 (PD-1) antibody compared
      with HAIC plus sorafenib in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The results of our preliminary pilot study suggested that sorafenib combined with hepatic
      arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) may improve the survivals for advanced hepatocellular
      (HCC). Programmed Cell Death Protein-1 (PD-1) antibody has been proved effective and safety
      for advanced HCC. There is no study about HAIC plus PD-1 antibody. Thus, the investigators
      carried out this prospective randomized control study to compare HAIC plus sorafenib and HAIC
      plus PD-1 antibody.
