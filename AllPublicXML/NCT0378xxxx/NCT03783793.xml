    <textblock>
      Mindfulness training includes a variety of contemplative practices aimed at promoting
      intentional awareness of experience, coupled with attitudes of non-judgment and curiosity.
      Following the success of 8-week, manualized group interventions, mindfulness training has
      been implemented in a variety of modalities, including smartphone apps that seek to replicate
      the success of group interventions. However, although smartphone apps are scalable and
      accessible to a wider swath of population, their benefits remain largely untested. This study
      aimed to investigate a newly developed mindfulness training app called Wildflowers, which was
      co-developed with the laboratory for use in mindfulness research. It was hypothesized that 3
      weeks of mindfulness training through this app would improve subjective well-being,
      attentional control, and interoceptive integration, albeit with weaker effects than those
      published in the 8 week, manualized group intervention literature.

      Background: Mindfulness training includes a variety of contemplative practices aimed at
      promoting intentional awareness of experience, coupled with attitudes of non-judgment and
      curiosity. Following the success of 8-week, manualized group interventions, mindfulness
      training has been implemented in a variety of modalities, including smartphone apps that seek
      to replicate the success of group interventions. However, although smartphone apps are
      scalable and accessible to a wider swath of population, their benefits remain largely
      untested. This study aimed to investigate a newly developed mindfulness training app called
      Wildflowers, which was co-developed with the laboratory for use in mindfulness research. It
      was hypothesized that 3 weeks of mindfulness training through this app would improve
      subjective well-being, attentional control, and interoceptive integration, albeit with weaker
      effects than those published in the 8 week, manualized group intervention literature.

      Methods: Undergraduate students completed 3 weeks of mindfulness training with Wildflowers or
      3 weeks of cognitive training with a game called 2048. State training effects were assessed
      through pre- and postsession ratings of current mood, stress level, and heart rate. Trait
      training effects were assessed through pre- and postintervention questionnaires canvassing
      subjective well-being and behavioral task measures of attentional control and interoceptive
      integration. State and trait training data were analyzed in a multilevel model using emergent
      latent factors (acceptance, awareness, and openness) to summarize the trait questionnaire
      battery.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change on the Perceived Stress Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>0 weeks and 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A 4-item self-report scale that measures the global perception of stress. The scale asks participants about their feelings and thoughts during the last month, and participants indicate on a 5-point Likert scale how often they thought or felt a certain way, with 0 being never and 4 being very often. A higher score on this measure represents higher levels of self-reported stress (worse outcome) with a minimum possible score of 0 and a maximum of 16.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change on the Big Five Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>0 weeks and 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A 44-item self-report scale that measures the 5 dimensions of personality: extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness. On this scale, participants are asked if different characteristics apply to them. For each characteristic queried participants respond on a 5-point Likert scale, with 1 being disagree strongly and 5 being agree strongly. This scale yields 5 scores, one for each of the subscales: extraversion (min-max range: 8-40), agreeableness (min-max range: 9-45), conscientiousness (min-max range: 9-45), neuroticism (min-max range: 8-40), and openness (min-max range: 10-50). Higher values on each of the subscales represent higher levels of that particular personality trait.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change on the Mood Board Circumplex</measure>
    <time_frame>0 weeks and 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The mood board is a visual representation of negative and positive emotions on a spectrum, ranging from intense emotions to mild emotions. This mood board provides a maximum of 32 emotions that a participant can select by clicking on that emotion. This measure yields 4 scores one for each subscale. Each subscale has a minimum possible score of 0 and maximum of 8. Higher values on the intense negative emotions subscale represent greater levels of intense negative emotions (worse outcome). Higher values on the intense positive emotions subscale represents greater levels of intense positive emotions (better outcome). Higher values on the mild negative emotions subscale represents greater levels of mild negative emotions (worse outcome). Lastly, higher values on the mild positive emotions subscale represents greater levels of mild positive emotions (better outcome).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Stress</measure>
    <time_frame>0 minutes and approximately 10 minutes, every day for 3 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Stress was measured using a visual analogue scale on a smartphone app where participants would rate their level of stress by sliding a bar along the scale. They would slide the bar to the green side of the scale if experiencing low levels of stress and to the red side of the scale if experiencing high levels of stress. This is a continuous scale with a minimum possible score of 0 and a maximum score of 1, with higher values representing greater levels of stress (worse outcome). This measurement was taken before and after each use of the smartphone app in their assigned condition.</description>

    <intervention_name>Cognitive Training With 2048</intervention_name>
    <description>The training app for the control condition was based on an open source code for a popular cognitive training app called 2048 that is marketed as a fun and relaxing puzzle game. Within 2048, participants slide numbered tiles around a grid, matching tiles of the same value. Instead of tiles disappearing, as in Candy Crush or other similar grid-sliding games, matching 2 numbered tiles in 2048 combines them into 1 new tile displaying the sum of the previous 2 numbers. For example, two 2-tiles linked side-by-side become a 4-tile, whereas 2 matched 4-tiles become an 8-tile, and so on. The goal is to match tiles until the sum of 2048 is reached on a single tile. There is no time limit.</description>
