  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized 3-month community-based exercise intervention with a control group
      and 2 different exercise groups: walking group and Chinese square dancing group.Eighteen
      communities will be selected in Beijing, and they will be age matched and randomly grouped
      into walking, Chinese square dancing and control groups. Each community will include twenty
      subjects (ten patients with hypertension and ten patients with hypertension complicated with
      diabetes) aged 40-69 years. All exercise sessions will be supervised and subject's exercise
      implementation process will be managed with intelligent equipment. The purpose of the study
      is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of different training programs.

      The demographics data, physical activity questionnaires, blood pressure, blood glucose, blood
      lipids, height, weight and physical fitness （cardiorespiratory fitness，muscle strength,
      muscle endurance, flexibility, body composition） will be measured before and after 3-month
      exercise training .The adverse reactions in the implementation of the interventions will be
      recorded. The primary outcomes are blood pressure and blood glucose.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The global burden of disease study shows that unreasonable diets and physical inactivity are
      the largest health risks facing the world today. In recent years, foreign and domestic
      scholars have gradually introduced the concept of &quot; Exercise is Medicine &quot; guide the the
      public exercise scientifically. However, under the special cultural background of China, it
      is urgent to answer how to help the public to realize reasonable scientific exercise, how to
      choose the popular exercise mode and whether the exercise mode is scientific and effective.

      Previous meta-analysis studies on the improvement of blood pressure and blood glucose by
      walking have been published, but few studies on Chinese square dancing have been conducted.
      Previous studies on whether Chinese square dancing was scientific and effective were mostly
      small sample population studies carried out by Chinese scholars. The research results were of
      large heterogeneity, and the research design lacked reasonable consideration.

      This study intends to select two common exercise mode for scientific evaluation, one is
      walking and the other is Chinese square dancing. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of two common types of exercise (walking and Chinese square dancing) in
      Chinese patients with hypertension and patients with hypertension complicated with diabetes.

The adverse effects of exercise include: cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, aggravation of complications associated with diabetes/hypertension, and sports injuries. Severe adverse events (SAEs) are defined as conditions that result in any of the following outcomes after exercise intervention: death, life-threatening, hospitalization, permanent or significant disability, dysfunction.
If a SAE occurs during the course of the study, the investigator should immediately take appropriate treatment on the subject and terminate the trial.
