  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study aims to evaluate the effect of cognitive stimulation (CS) in participants
      with a diagnosis of moderate and mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment
      (MCI) compared to control subjects not receiving any non-pharmacological interventions.
      Treated participants will receive a structured CS consisting of a wide range of activities
      aimed at the general improvement of social functioning and the maintenance of cognitive
      functions. The study consists of a 24-week treatment phase and a follow-up period of 24
      weeks. During the treatment period, patients will receive two CS sessions a week. At
      baseline, all the participants undergo an extensive neuropsychological evaluation and a
      neurophysiological assessment aimed at studying the frequency of spontaneous blinking (blink
      rate) and cortical excitability and synaptic plasticity by means of the transcranial magnetic
      stimulation (TMS). Neuropsychological and neurophysiological evaluations will be repeated at
      the end of the treatment (week 24) and at the end of the follow-up period (week 48) in order
      to evaluate short- and long-term effects of CS. The hypothesis of this research is that CS
      may improve cognition and the neurophysiological parameters studied in treated participants
      compared to those untreated.

    <description>Change from baseline in Paired Associative Stimulation at Week 24 and 48. Paired associative stimulation is a paradigm combining peripheral nerve stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation over the contralateral primary motor cortex. In healthy humans, Paired Associative Stimulation after-effects last about 30-60 minutes. The extent of facilitatory-Paired Associative Stimulation-induced effects on MEP amplitude ranges from 120% to 160%, while inhibitory-Paired Associative Stimulation may induce a reduction of muscle-evoked potential amplitude that ranges from 60% to 90%.</description>

Normal values: mean Blink Reflex value at rest is 17 blinks/minute; during conversation is 26 blinks/minute; during reading is 4.5 blinks/minute. Cut offs: not applicable.</description>

    <description>Experimental Intervention: The CS shall be carried out in groups (5-7 participants), twice a week. Each session lasts 90 minutes. CS sessions begin with a training for temporal and spatial orientation in which participants are asked to recognize and recall the date and the place with the help of some environmental aids (calendars, clocks, pictures and maps). Then the participants complete an array of cognitive tasks for memory, attention, language, visuo-spatial functions and executive functions. These tasks range from individual paper-and-pencil exercises to verbal-learning exercises that have to be solved by the group.</description>
