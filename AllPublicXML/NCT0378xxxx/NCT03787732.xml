  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Complications are common during tracheal intubation of critically ill patients. Nearly one in
      five patients undergoing intubation in the intensive care unit experiences cardiovascular
      collapse, defined as severe hypotension, vasopressor administration, cardiac arrest or death.
      Cardiovascular collapse during intubation is associated with increased resource utilization
      and decreased survival. Administration of 500 mL of intravenous crystalloid solution
      beginning prior to induction may prevent cardiovascular collapse. The only prior trial
      examining fluid bolus administration during intubation found no effect on cardiovascular
      collapse or clinical outcomes overall, but a hypothesis-generating subgroup analysis
      suggested potential benefit to fluid bolus administration among patients receiving positive
      pressure ventilation between induction and laryngoscopy. Therefore, we propose a randomized
      trial comparing fluid bolus administration versus none with regard to cardiovascular collapse
      among critically adults undergoing intubation with positive pressure ventilation between
      induction and laryngoscopy.

      The PREPARE II trial is a prospective, parallel group, pragmatic, randomized trial comparing
      the effect of a preintubation fluid bolus to no preintubation fluid bolus on the incidence of
      cardiovascular collapse during and after endotracheal intubation in critically ill adults.

      Patients admitted to the study units who are deemed by their clinical team to require
      intubation and fulfill inclusion criteria without meeting exclusion criteria will be
      randomized 1:1 to receive either an intravenous fluid bolus or no intravenous fluid bolus.
      All other decisions regarding airway management will remain at the discretion of the treating
      provider. The trial will enroll 750 patients. Conduct of the trial will be overseen by a Data
      Safety Monitoring Board. An interim analysis will be performed after the enrollment of 375
      patients. The analysis of the trial will be conducted in accordance with a pre-specified
      statistical analysis plan, which will be submitted for publication or made publicly available
      prior to the conclusion of enrollment.

      The primary outcome is cardiovascular collapse - a composite endpoint defined as one or more
      of the following:

        1. Death within 1 hour of intubation

        2. Cardiac arrest within 1 hour of intubation

        3. New systolic blood pressure &lt; 65 mmHg between induction and 2 minutes after completion
           of intubation

        4. New or increased vasopressor receipt between induction and 2 minutes after completion of
           intubation

      The secondary outcome is 28-day in-hospital mortality

    <description>For patients randomized to fluid bolus administration, the bedside nurse will obtain 500 mL of a crystalloid solution of the operator's choosing, connect this volume to intravenous infusion tubing, and attach the tubing to any intravenous catheter or intraosseous device. The crystalloid solution will then be placed above the level of the intravenous or intraosseous device and allowed to infuse by gravity or pressure bag. At any time after the initiation of fluid bolus administration, the operator can choose to begin the procedure by administering sedation. Fluid loading will continue until all 500 mL are infused. Fluid infusing prior to the decision to perform endotracheal intubation will not be altered by the current study.</description>

    <description>For patients randomized to no fluid bolus administration, no additional intravenous crystalloid administration will be initiated between randomization and two minutes after completion of endotracheal intubation. Fluid infusing prior to the decision to perform endotracheal intubation will not be affected by the study. Treating clinicians may initiate a fluid bolus at any time for the treatment of cardiovascular collapse (not considered a protocol violation). Treating clinicians may also initiate a fluid bolus at any time if felt to be mandatory for the safe treatment of the patient (if between randomization and two minutes after intubation and in the absence of cardiovascular collapse this will be recorded as a protocol violation).</description>
