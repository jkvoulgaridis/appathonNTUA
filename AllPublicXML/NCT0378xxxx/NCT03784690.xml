  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot randomized-controlled study will determine the feasibility of large study
      comparing individualized versus standard blood pressure (BP) management in patients
      undergoing cardiac surgery under cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Our hypothesis is that
      maintaining higher BP levels based on preoperative measurements will reduce the incidence of
      major complications (composite outcome).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adequate hemodynamic control is a cornerstone in management in patients undergoing different
      types of surgery. Among all perioperative risk factors, the association between perioperative
      hypotension and adverse clinical outcomes in noncardiac and cardiac surgery patients is well
      defined.

      Numerous factors are responsible for development of perioperative hypotension. They include
      but not limited to perioperative use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and calcium
      channel blockers, hypovolemia, hemodilution, bleeding and inflammatory response syndrome.

      To date, several evidence has been accumulated indicating that intraoperational hypertension
      can be hazardous.

      It was shown that even short durations (1 to 5 min) of an intraoperative mean arterial
      pressure &lt; 55 mmHg were associated with myocardial injuries and acute kidney injury (AKI).

      Results of recent large retrospective cohort study conducted in adult patients who underwent
      cardiac surgery requiring CPB showed that postoperative stroke was strongly associated with
      sustained mean arterial pressure of less than 64 mmHg during cardiopulmonary bypass.

      In patients undergoing CABG the overall incidence of combined cardiac and neurologic
      complications was significantly lower in the group where MAP during CPB was relatively high
      (80-110 mmHg) than in the low pressure group (MAP 50-60 mmHg) (p = 0.026). For each of the
      individual outcomes the trend favored the high pressure group.

      Therefore, MAP may be an important intraoperative therapeutic hemodynamic target to reduce
      the incidence of complications in patients undergoing CPB.

    According to new guidelines, the use of vasopressors to force the MAP during CPB at values
    higher than 80 mmHg is not recommended.

    <description>In the treatment group, the nurse will measure resting blood pressure three times in the ward one day before surgery (after a 5-min rest while lying supine). Average measurement will be used to calculate mean arterial pressure (MAP).
Before and after CPB patients will receive continuous infusion of norepinephrine to maintain MAP within Â± 10% of patients resting MAP. If targeted MAP during CPB could not be achieved after increasing pump-flow (not more than 130%), infusion of norepinephrine will used. After CPB, the choice of vasopressors/inotropes to maintain predefined MAP will be left on attending anesthesiologists based on patient status.</description>

    <description>Standard treatment strategy will be used aiming to maintain pre-bypass and post-bypass MAP at 65-75 mm Hg. MAP during CPB will be maintained at 50-60 mm Hg. If MAP of 50-60 mm Hg during CPB could not be achieved after increasing pump-flow (not more than 130%), infusion of norepinephrine will be started. No vasodilators will be used if MAP will exceed predefined range.</description>
