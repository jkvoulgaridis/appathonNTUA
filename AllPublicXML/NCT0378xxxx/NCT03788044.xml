  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate a new and innovative educational application based on
      targeted education on the adherence level for NOACs (non-vitamin K antagonist oral
      anticoagulants) in AF patients, compared with standard care, online targeted education and
      in-person targeted education.

      Several other parameters (knowledge level, quality of life, symptom burden, self-care
      capabilities, evaluation of educational efforts) will be studied. If resources allow,
      cardiovascular outcomes, cost-effectiveness and cost-utility will also be investigated.

      This substudy is part of the AF-EduCare study (NCT03707873): an extra study arm will be added
      to the main trial in which eligible AF patients (= in possession of a smartphone and capable
      working with their smartphone) will test this new educational application. Not eligible
      patients randomized to this group, will receive standard care.

      This extra study arm will additionally include an anticipated 221 patients (eligible plus not
      eligible patients).

      [An anticipated total of 1259 AF patients will be included for the AF-EduCare study (1038 AF
      patients) plus the AF-EduApp substudy (221 AF patients).]

    <intervention_model_description>AF patients will be divided in four groups (AF-EduCare study and AF-EduApp substudy): one group will have application-based education (AF-EduApp substudy), the second group will have in-person education (AF-EduCare study), the third group will have online education (AF-EduCare study) and the fourth group will receive standard AF care (AF-EduCare study and not eligible for AF-EduApp substudy). NOAC adherence will be compared between these groups.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Patients' adherence to medication (oral anticoagulation), measured by the Medication Events Monitoring System (MEMS).</measure>
    <time_frame>Monitored between 0-12 months and 12-15 months if resources allow.</time_frame>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patients' knowledge level, assessed by the Jessa Atrial fibrillation Knowledge Questionnaire (JAKQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline,1 month,3-,6-,12 months in the application group.(+18-and if applicable at 24-,30-,36 months/at the end of the study in the other intervention groups).In the standard care groups at 12 or 18 months (if applicable at the end of the study).</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire includes 16 knowledge questions: 8 about atrial fibrillation, 5 about oral anticoagulation medication and 3 about vitamine K antagonists or non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants. A total score between 0% and 100% will be generated in which 100% is the best possible score (all questions are answered correctly).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patients' quality of life, assessed by the EQ-5D-3L questionnaire and the Atrial Fibrillation Effect on QualiTy-of-Life (AFEQT) Questionnaire.</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline, 3- and 12 months in the application group.(+18-and if applicable at 36 months/at the end of the study in the other intervention groups.) In the standard care groups at baseline and 12 or 18 months (and if applicable at the end of the study).</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-3L descriptive system includes a total of 5 questions for 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression). Each question has 3 levels (no problems, some problems, and extreme problems). The EQ Visual Analogue Scale records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale where the endpoints are labelled 'Best imaginable health state' (score of 100) and 'Worst imaginable health state' (score of 0).</description>

    <measure>Patients' quality of life, assessed by the Atrial Fibrillation Effect on QualiTy-of-Life (AFEQT) Questionnaire.</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline and 12 months in the application group.(+18-and if applicable at 36 months/at the end of the study in the other intervention groups.) In the standard care groups at baseline and 12 or 18 months (and if applicable at the end of the study).</time_frame>
    <description>The AFEQT is an atrial fibrillation-specific health-related quality of life questionnaire based on 18 questions in the domain of symptoms, daily activities and treatment concerns. A treatment satisfaction score can be calculated based on 2 additional questions. All questions are rated on a 7 point Likert scale. A scoring key is used to determine an overall AFEQT score and a treatment satisfaction score ranging from 0 to 100. A lower score indicates a worse health-related quality of life.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patients' symptom burden, assessed by the Leuven ARrhythmia Questionnaire (LARQ).</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline,3- and 12 months in the application group.(+18-and if applicable at 36 months/at the end of the study in the other intervention groups).In the standard care groups at baseline and 12 or 18 months (and if applicable at the end of the study).</time_frame>
    <description>The LARQ is based on 6 atrial fibrillation-related symptoms: palpitations, shortness of breath, chest pain, syncope, dizziness and fatigue. For each of these symptoms (except syncope), symptom prevalence, occurrence (frequency, duration, severity), distress, circumstances triggering the symptom, and effect on daily activities are requested. Subscale scores on five domains (symptom frequency, duration, effect on daily activities, severity and distress) are calculated by summing the raw scores and transforming them to a 0-100 scale. Higher scores represent a more pronounced symptom burden.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patients' self-care capabilities, assessed by the Self-Care Questionnaire (SCQ).</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline, 3- and 12 months in the application group. (+18-and if applicable 36 months/at the end of the study in the other intervention groups).In the standard care groups at baseline and 12 or 18 months (and if applicable at the end of the study).</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire includes a total of 15 questions. The first 6 questions will be scored on a 1 to 5 Likert scale. 1 is the best score and 5 is the worst score. The other 9 questions measure evolutions of self-care capabilities over time.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patients' satisfaction of the intervention will be assessed by a study specific Patient Reported Outcome Measure (PROM) questionnaire.</measure>
    <time_frame>at 12 months in all intervention groups and 12 or 18 months in the standard care groups.</time_frame>
    <description>The number of questions will depend on the specific group allocation, ranging from a minimum of 4 questions to a maximum of 20 questions. These questions assess patients' satisfaction and opinion about the education provided during the study.</description>
