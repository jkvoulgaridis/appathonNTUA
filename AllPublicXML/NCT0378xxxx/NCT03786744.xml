  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autism is one of those disorders in Autism spectrum disorders (ASD), which characterized by
      social interaction abnormalities, impaired verbal and non-verbal communication, and
      repetitive, obsessive behavior, while the therapeutic effect of current treatments remains
      limited progress.

      The possible reason for ASD is neural hypoperfusion and immune deregulation. The Human
      Umbilical Cord Blood Mononuclear Cells (hUCB-MNCs) have been shown to have the ability to
      modulate the immune response and enhance angiogenesis, suggesting the novel and promising
      therapeutic strategy. In this study, the safety and efficacy of hUCB-MNCs infusion will be
      evaluated in patients with Autism.

      Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are heterogeneous neuro-developed disorders. Autism is the
      most common disorder of the diseases characterized by dysfunctions in response social
      interaction and communication, as well as the presence of repetitive and stereotyped
      behaviors. Recent reports of a sharp increase in the number of children with autism. The
      exact etiology of autism remains unclear. Compliance, the definition of effective treatments
      for autism is particularly difficult.

      Although it has been understood, it can be a question of immune dysregulation. Examination of
      the inflammatory cytokines, dysfunction of the immune system and the immune system. The Human
      Umbilical Cord Blood Mononuclear Cells (hUCB-MNCs) have been shown to have the ability to
      modulate the immune response and enhance angiogenesis, suggesting the novel and promising
      therapeutic strategy. The Our study suggest that infusion of cord blood mononuclear cells
      will affect Autism.
