  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      L. infantum leishmaniasis is endemic in the South of France. For several years, there has
      been an expansion of the territory of sandflies (vector of leishmaniasis), with the
      appearance of cases of canine leishmaniasis in new outbreaks: West of the Occitania region
      (South-West). The transition from asymptomatic to disease depends largely on the immune
      status of the carrier, but many other factors specific to the parasite and host remain poorly
      defined. Asymptomatic carriage is present in a large majority of infected subjects, however,
      to date, only parasite isolates causing the patent form have been characterized.

      In this PHRC, the team wishes to study the genetics of parasite isolates present in
      asymptomatic carriers of the Alpes-Maritimes outbreak and the new Occitanie outbreak as well
      as the genetics of the host.

      The primary objective is the genetic characterization of L. infantum isolates by the
      microsatellite method, present in asymptomatic carriers in southeast and southwestern France.

      The secondary objectives are:

        1. Comparison of the genetic profiles of L. infantum isolates, by microsatellite method,
           from asymptomatic carriers of the new Southwestern outbreak with isolates from
           asymptomatic carriers of the historical Southwestern outbreak.

        2. Comparison of the genetic profiles of L. infantum isolates, by the microsatellite
           method, present in asymptomatic carriers in the Southeast with the profiles of isolates
           present in patients in the same outbreak, for whom a microsatellite study has already
           been obtained previously.

        3. the team is also conducting a preliminary study of the host genetic factors that would
           be associated with asymptomatic carriage by studying the association between potential
           host-related genetic risk factors (HLA typing, NLRP3 gene study) and asymptomatic
           carriage. Indeed, a recent study showed that the NLRP3 gene prevents the development of
           the patent form of leishmaniasis in the mouse model. This preliminary genetic study will
           identify potential host-related factors associated with asymptomatic carriage.

      To meet these objectives, leuco-platelet layer parasites (CLP) obtained via EFS from the 2
      sources of interest will be isolated.

      This project is a research not involving the human person. It is multicentric and
      non-randomized.

      As a result of this research, isolates from asymptomatic carriers of the historical outbreak
      will be studied and compared to those present in new endemic outbreaks, as well as to those
      of patients already studied in a previous study. A better knowledge of parasites circulating
      in asymptomatic carriers will make it possible to study in a comprehensive way the risk
      factors associated with the parasite. In addition, the study of asymptomatic carrying in new
      endemic outbreaks such as Occitania is very original, since no human studies have yet been
      undertaken in this region. The results obtained in this PHRC will be used to understand the
      factors associated with the development of visceral leishmaniasis.
