    <textblock>
      Colonoscopy is a useful tool used in modern medicine and it is increasingly being employed
      for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. PEG is very often used for bowel preparation.
      PEG solutions clean the bowel with less water and electrolyte shifts, primarily by causing
      mechanical effect of large-volume lavage 1. However, there are some cases of hyponatremia
      reported due to the use of PEG. Life-threatening fluid and electrolyte disturbances are more
      likely to occur in patients with risk factors, such as old age, use of SSRIs and thiazide
      diuretics, chronic kidney disease, congestive heart failure or with a history of electrolyte
      abnormalities 2.

      Although sporadic case reports of hyponatremia and other electrolyte imbalances after bowel
      preparation have been reported, but well-designed studies are lacking on this subject.
      Literature search did not reveal any local studies on this subject. This study was designed
      to find frequency of sodium disorders after bowel cleansing by Polyethylene glycol solution
      for colonoscopies in Dr. Ruth K.M. Pfau, Civil Hospital Karachi.
