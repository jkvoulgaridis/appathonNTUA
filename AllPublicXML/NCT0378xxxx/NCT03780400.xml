      This is a multi-phase study that will develop and test an osteoarthritis (OA) primary care
      Physical activity Care Pathway (OA-PCP), a scalable intervention that includes: 1) a
      practical process for physical inactivity screening in primary care, 2) a brief, tailored
      physical activity (PA) counseling intervention via telephone, 3) connection of patients with
      community programs and other resources to support PA, and 4) follow-up with patients to
      deliver additional appropriate counseling and referrals to PA resources.

    <textblock>
      This study will be a single group pilot trial of the OA-PCP. The feasibility and
      acceptability of the OA-PCP will be assessed among n=60 patients with hip and knee OA in two
      primary care clinics. All patients in the trial will participate in the OA-PCP and will
      complete assessments at baseline and 4-month follow-up. Feasibility metrics will include
      rates of recruitment, intervention engagement and retention; acceptability will be assessed
      from both patients and health care providers.

    <description>The intervention includes brief physical activity (PA) counseling delivered via phone by a PA Counselor trained in relevant aspects of PA and motivational interviewing. During the initial call, the PA counselor will assess readiness for change in PA and will utilize appropriate PA counseling components to assess participant's PA preferences/needs, as well as referral to PA resources and goal setting. Approximately two weeks after the initial call, the PA counselor will contact participants to check in on whether they have successfully connected with PA programs or resources discussed, review progress toward PA goals and set new goals. Participants will be provided with linkage to PA programs and resources to include: self-directed, group classes/community, physical therapy and other clinical/supervised programs. Three months after the initial call, the PA counselor will call participants to assess PA and stage of change using appropriate PA counseling components and goal setting.</description>
