      Design

      A cluster randomised controlled feasibility trial with parallel qualitative interviews.

      Trial setting and participants

      In order to achieve sociodemographic diversity in the participant sample, and to ensure
      generalisability of the results, the investigators aim to recruit six GP practices; from
      across rural Devon as well as from each of the cities of Exeter and Plymouth, UK. The minimum
      practice size will be 3,000 patients.

      The investigators aim to recruit an average of three, and at least two, GPs per practice
      (total = 18 GPs). Only permanent GPs will be included to avoid possible loss to follow up
      when recruiting locum GPs, however GPs will not be excluded based on less than full time
      equivalent working hours. The investigators will review the external validity of the sample
      by comparing to relevant external datasets when reporting recruitment, selection procedures
      and participation rates.

      Patients aged 65 and above with known multimorbidity, defined as the presence of two or more
      long-term conditions, will be approached. The investigators will not specify a minimum time
      to be 'long-term', however the condition should be one of: Angina or long-term heart problem;
      arthritis or long-term joint problem; asthma or long-term chest problem; blindness or severe
      visual impairment; cancer in the last five years; deafness or severe hearing impairment;
      diabetes; epilepsy; high blood pressure; kidney or liver disease; long-term back problem;
      long-term mental health problem; long-term neurological problem. This list was adapted from
      the English National General Practice Patient Survey , however the Quality and Outcomes
      Framework indicators of long-term conditions will also be considered in order to identify
      potential participants on practice computer systems. Where dyads of conditions occur within
      the same organ system, e.g. anxiety and depression, these will only be counted once e.g.
      mental health problem.

      Potential patient participants will be identified using an automated algorithm via the
      practice computer system resulting in a 'flag' on patient notes visible to practice staff;
      approximately 800 'flagged' patients in an average 8,000 patient practice. The practice
      administration team will use this 'flag' to identify ten consecutive potential participants
      with pre-booked consultations with each of the three recruited GPs (total = 180 patients).
      These appointments will ideally all be booked on the same day but may span two working days.
      The investigators will aim to recruit at least half of these patients and will not approach
      temporary residents. The sample size has been justified in order to provide effect estimates
      for the primary outcome.

      Vulnerable patients will be identified by the GP and will be excluded from participation in
      the study. Reasons for exclusion will be documented. The presence of carers or third parties
      within the index consultation will be explored during the analysis of consultation data.

      Recruitment

      Non-compliance with all elements of the intervention, at patient, GP or practice level, will
      be taken into account by over-recruiting. Numbers lost to follow up will be reviewed, with
      consideration given to incentivising participants in the future trial if necessary. However,
      it is anticipated that loss to follow up will be minimal.

      Practices will receive an initial letter and follow-up telephone call. Practices will be
      offered a visit at which information will be provided regarding the trial, timeline, and
      staff involvement. Evidence suggests that GPs are more likely to agree to intervention
      studies when they have an interest in the topic, when they believe it will not take too much
      time, and when they appreciate the 'Continuing Professional Development' associated with
      participation. The investigators hope to recruit GPs by highlighting these issues in the
      letter to practices and when contacting individuals by email.

      For each recruited GP, ten consecutive potential participants, with pre-booked consultations,
      will be contacted by post ahead of their appointment. These patients will receive a cover
      letter on practice headed paper, a participant information sheet, a consent form and a
      pre-consultation questionnaire. Patients will be asked to return their questionnaire to the
      research team in a pre-paid stamped addressed envelope ahead of their consultation. Patients
      will be asked to complete the consent form and to bring it along to their consultation with
      the GP so that the GP can confirm consent prior to data collection.

      Randomisation

      The investigators plan to use a cluster randomised design in the future full-scale trial.
      Clusters will be defined at practice level with randomisation following practice recruitment,
      to usual care or to the intervention. Although statistically more powerful, randomising by
      patient would be impractical and vulnerable to contamination. In order to evaluate
      randomisation procedures, to compare the feasibility of potential outcome measures in both
      intervention and control groups, and to compare feasibility measures across different types
      of practice, we will cluster randomise using block randomisation in the feasibility study.
      Block randomisation will be stratified by site; two practices in inner city Plymouth, two
      practices from Exeter and two from rural Devon.

      In order to reduce bias, practice randomisation on a 1:1 allocation (90 patients per arm)
      will be conducted using computer allocation software by an independent statistician. Blinding
      of the research team will not be possible for the purposes of this feasibility study due to
      resource availability. Participants will be informed via participant information sheets that
      their practice will either be assigned to intervention or to control. Participants in the
      intervention arm are likely to be aware that they are receiving more than the standard 'usual
      care'. The investigators will report comparisons in pre- and post-intervention data between
      the control and intervention groups when analysing results. The sample size if sufficient to
      compare standard deviations in the primary outcome between the intervention and control
      group.

      Consent

      Initial consent to identify and approach potential patient participants will be obtained from
      the practice manager. Written consent to participate will be obtained from individual GPs.
      Patients will be asked to complete consent forms received in the post prior to attending for
      their consultation with the GP, however patients will be asked to bring their consent forms
      with them to their consultation and GPs will be asked to confirm this consent at the
      beginning of the consultation. GPs will also have spare consent forms available. Practice
      administration staff will carry out the task of approaching patients; the research team will
      not have access to personal information or patient notes without prior consent from patients
      themselves. Written consent from patients will be obtained for video-recording of the
      consultation. Consent for case note review, and to be approached for subsequent process
      evaluation interviews, will also be confirmed by the GP at the end of the consultation.

      The intervention

      The intervention will incorporate a training workshop for GPs in the use of shared
      decision-making surrounding an index consultation, and a written involvement-facilitating
      tool for patients attending an index consultation with these GPs.

      Data collection

      Data will be collected in both intervention and control groups.

      Descriptive measures: Core data will be collected in respect of participating practices (list
      size, location and deprivation), patients (age, gender, ethnicity, health status), the GPs
      with whom they consult (age, gender, ethnicity, time since qualification), and regarding
      practices (practice size, staffing, rural/urban).

      Process measures: The flow of practices and participants will be documented and summarised in
      a Consort diagram; numbers randomised, recruitment rates and participant attrition (see
      attached figures for blank template diagrams). The investigators will seek to understand
      whether data collection is feasible in the absence of the intervention and whether there are
      differential drop-out or recruitment rates between intervention and control groups.

      Patient reported outcome measures (PROMs): The investigators have previously found that the
      General Practice Patient Survey (GPPS), which uses five-point Likert scales, lends itself
      well to the evaluation of PROMs. A subset of the GPPS will be used in the pre-consultation
      patient questionnaire. The questionnaire will also include an item regarding patients'
      preferences for involvement in decision-making. Patients who do not wish to participate in
      the study, or to receive further contact, will be asked to indicate this with a tick box and
      to return their otherwise blank pre-consultation questionnaire in a prepaid envelope. A
      post-consultation questionnaire will be given to the patient by the GP. With this
      questionnaire we patients will be asked for feedback following the index consultation,
      including patient satisfaction with the healthcare received, the extent to which they felt
      engaged in decision-making about their healthcare, and a measure of patient empowerment. A
      tick box on the post-consultation questionnaire will be a means for patients to opt out of
      process evaluation interviews and/or from having their case notes reviewed.

      GP data collection will consist of a single item on patient consent forms. At the end of the
      consultation, the GP will re-confirm the patient's consent and they will also rate the extent
      to which they engaged the patient in decision-making. These ratings will be compared with
      patient ratings.

      Following consent from patients and GPs, video-recordings will be made of the index
      consultation. These recordings will enable the shared decision-making process to be assessed
      from an observer perspective using the OPTION scale. If multiple decisions are made,
      decisions will be rated separately. It is thought that an average of 2.5 problems are
      discussed between a patient and GP per consultation. Rates of consent to video-recording will
      be evaluated as part of this study. It is thought that video-recording may cause bias in the
      characteristics of doctors and patients who agree to participate in research, however there
      is little evidence that it influences the behaviour of either GPs or patients. Video
      recordings will also capture the nature of the index problem.

      Case note review for 30 consenting patients will take place twelve weeks after initial
      consultation, to gather information regarding re-attendance within 28 days, whether the
      patient was referred for an investigation, and whether the patient was referred to see a
      specialist in secondary care, following the index consultation. The investigators will seek
      to stratify the case notes review in order to include data from under-represented groups e.g.
      males and the oldest patients. Two researchers will carry out case notes review and
      inter-rater reliability will be assessed on the data. Data will be encrypted (as per NHS
      security requirements) and recorded electronically.

      Process evaluation to support feasibility objectives

      A qualitative interview study running alongside the feasibility trial with data integration.

      Process evaluation will take a sequential-explanatory approach, combining deductive and
      inductive methods to investigate whether the theory developed earlier in the fellowship
      holds, but also being open to new data/themes emerging.
