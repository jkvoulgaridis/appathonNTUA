  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 4, multicenter, single-arm, open-label study to evaluate the impact of
      apremilast, either in monotherapy or with stable Methotrexate (MTX), on Magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) outcomes in subjects with active PsA with up to 5 years of disease duration
      (since diagnosis).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 120 subjects will receive apremilast 30 mg BID, after a 5-day titration period,
      with or without MTX. All subjects will be permitted to take NSAIDs and/or low-dose oral
      glucocorticoids (prednisone ≤ 10 mg/day or equivalent) throughout the study. The NSAIDs and
      low-dose oral glucocorticoids must be on a stable regimen for at least 4 weeks prior to
      baseline. MTX (≤ 25 mg/week) will be permitted if treatment duration is ≥ 6 months and on a
      stable regimen for at least 3 months prior to baseline. In addition, Nonsteroidal
      anti-inflammatory drug (NSAIDs), and low-dose glucocorticoids must be continued from Day 1
      through the Week 24 Visit. Change in doses, increase or decrease, and/or discontinuation will
      not be allowed, except for safety reasons or for lack of availability. After the Week 24
      Visit, the doses of MTX, NSAIDs, or glucocorticoids may be adjusted as clinically required.

          9. Must not have been treated with more than 2 csDMARDs

         10. Subjects taking csDMARDs, with the exception of MTX, cyclosporine, or LEF, do not
             require a washout period. However, they must discontinue the csDMARD treatment at
             least one day prior to their Baseline Visit (ie, Visit 2, Day 1)

         11. Subjects who have been previously treated with MTX for &lt; 6 months and who are not on
             stable doses for at least 3 months will require a 28-day washout prior to the Baseline
             Visit (ie, Visit 2, Day 1) to participate in the study

         12. Subjects who have been previously treated with LEF will require a 12-week washout
             prior to the Baseline Visit (ie, Visit 2, Day 1), or treatment with cholestyramine,
             per LEF prescribing label (ie, 8 g cholestyramine 3 times daily for 11 days)

         13. Subjects who have been previously treated with cyclosporine will require a 28-day
             washout prior to the Baseline Visit (ie, Visit 2, Day 1) to participate in the study

         14. If taking MTX (≤ 25 mg/week), continuity of treatment will be allowed if duration of
             treatment is ≥ 6 months and on a stable dose for at least 3 months prior to the
             Baseline Visit (ie, Visit 2, Day 1)

         15. If taking oral glucocorticoids, must be on a stable dose of prednisone ≤ 10 mg/day or

         17. A female of childbearing potential (FCBP)† must have a negative pregnancy test at
             screening and baseline. While on IP and for at least 28 days after taking the last
             dose of IP, a FCBP who engages in activity in which conception is possible must use
             one of the approved contraceptive§ options described below:

             Option 1: Any one of the following highly effective methods: hormonal contraception
             (oral, injection, implant, transdermal patch, vaginal ring); intrauterine device;
             tubal ligation; or partner's vasectomy; OR Option 2: Male or female condom (latex
             condom or non-latex condom NOT made out of natural [animal] membrane [for example,
             polyurethane]); PLUS one additional barrier method: (a) diaphragm with spermicide; (b)
             cervical cap with spermicide; or (c) contraceptive sponge with spermicide.

             † An FCBP is defined as a sexually mature female who 1) has not undergone a
             hysterectomy (the surgical removal of the uterus) or bilateral oophorectomy (the
             surgical removal of both ovaries) or 2) has not been postmenopausal for at least 24
             consecutive months (that is, has had menses at any time during the preceding 24
             consecutive months).

             § The female subject's chosen form of contraception must be effective by the time the
             female subject is screened into the study (for example, hormonal contraception should
             be initiated at least 28 days before screening).

         18. Must be in general good health (except for PsA) as judged by the investigator, based
             on medical history, physical examination, and clinical laboratories. (Note: The
             definition of good health means a subject does not have uncontrolled significant
             comorbid conditions).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The presence of any of the following will exclude a subject from enrollment:

          1. Contraindication to MRI examination including, but not limited to, intracranial metal
             clips, heart pacemakers, insulin pumps, implanted hearing aids, neurostimulators,
             metal hip replacements, profound claustrophobia or inability to lie in the MRI machine
             in an appropriate position to obtain quality images, history of hypersensitivity to
             gadolinium contrast agent

          2. Severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance of less than 30 mL per minute estimated
             by the Cockroft-Gault equation), which would prevent the use of gadolinium enhancement

          3. History of clinically significant (as determined by the investigator) cardiac,
             endocrine, pulmonary, neurologic, psychiatric, hepatic, renal, hematologic,
             immunologic disease, or other major uncontrolled disease

          4. Any condition, including the presence of laboratory abnormalities, which places the
             subject at unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in the study

          5. Prior history of suicide attempt at any time in the subject's lifetime prior to
             signing the informed consent, or major psychiatric illness requiring hospitalization
             within the last 3 years prior to signing the informed consent.

          6. Pregnant or breast feeding

          7. Active substance abuse or a history of substance abuse within 6 months prior to
             screening

In general, Amgen does not grant external requests for individual patient data for the purpose of re-evaluating safety and efficacy issues already addressed in the product labelling. Requests are reviewed by a committee of internal advisors. If not approved, a Data Sharing Independent Review Panel will arbitrate and make the final decision. Upon approval, information necessary to address the research question will be provided under the terms of a data sharing agreement. This may include anonymized individual patient data and/or available supporting documents, containing fragments of analysis code where provided in analysis specifications.
