    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, phase III study to evaluate the efficacy
      and safety of CS1001 in combination with platinum-containing chemotherapy versus placebo in
      combination with chemotherapy in first-line treatment-naive subjects with stage IV non-small
      cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
