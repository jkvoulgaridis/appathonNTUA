  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stoma reversal is associated with high incidence of post-surgical complications, including
      Surgical Site Infections (SSI). Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT) has been successfully
      applied to surgical wound management, reducing the SSIs incidence. This is a randomized
      open-label trial to assess the efficacy of NPWT in decreasing the rate of SSI after stoma
      reversal.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stoma reversal after abdominal resection is associated with several complications, of which
      the most common is wound infection. Surgical Site Infections (SSI) usually result in
      increased long-term complications, such as incisional hernia, prolonged hospital stay,
      increased outpatients visits and medical costs. Negative-Pressure-Wound-Therapy (NPWT) is a
      technique using vacuum dressing, commonly used to promote surgical wound healing, but there
      is a significant lack of knowledge about its safety and efficacy in promoting wound healing
      after stoma closure. This is an interventional, randomized, open label trial to evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of the NPWT (PICOâ„¢ system, Smith&amp;Nephew Healthcare, Hull, UK) on stoma
      wound compared to Standard of Care (SOC).

The EQ5D5L questionnaire comprises 5 dimensions (mobility, self care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression).

The questionnaire also includes a 20 cm vertical, visual analogue scale with endpoints labelled 'the best health you can imagine' and 'the worst health you can imagine'.</description>

    <description>Pain will be measured using the McGill Pain questionnaire. The questionnaire presents a list of 78 words in 20 sections that are related to pain. The users mark the words that best describe their pain (multiple markings are allowed).
