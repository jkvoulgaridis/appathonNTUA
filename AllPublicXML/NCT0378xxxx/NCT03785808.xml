      The objective of this project is to compare the effect of two widely implemented cancer
      diets, differing drastically in macronutrient content, on biomarkers of inflammation,
      compared to a control diet.

      Diet A will be a low-carbohydrate, high-fat ketogenic-type diet with an emphasis on whole
      foods. By limiting carbohydrate, the diet will have an extremely low glycemic load, thereby
      minimizing diurnal glucose and insulin excursions.

      Diet B will be a low-fat, high-carbohydrate whole foods plant-based diet. It will include
      only fiber-rich, low-glycemic index sources of carbohydrates and largely eliminate animal
      protein, which will minimize rapid spikes in blood glucose and insulin and the production of
      IGF-1. This diet is also hypothesized to improve glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity,
      which should further help minimize diurnal glycemic and insulinemic excursions.

      Both diets will be compared to a control diet based on the 2015 USDA Dietary Guidelines for
      Americans (Diet C) in patients suffering from advanced lung cancer as they are completing
      medical therapy.

      The overarching hypothesis motivating this work is that a nutrient dense diet that minimizes
      known factors involved in tumor growth and progression may improve the effectiveness of
      therapy. Our specific hypothesis is that participants following either of the experimental
      diets, A or B, will experience a reduction in biomarkers of insulin resistance and chronic
      inflammation, both of which are known risk factors for progression in lung cancer, and a
      greater median time to progression compared to those on the control diet (Diet C).

    <textblock>
      Little is known about the role of diet in the treatment of lung and other cancers, yet
      physicians are constantly confronted with the question 'what should I eat' by their patients.
      Very few randomized controlled dietary interventions have been carried out in this
      population, hence physicians and dietitians must use their best professional judgement to
      provide nutrition advice to their patients. Because most believe that nutrition is an
      important part of the treatment process, patients are eager to implement dietary
      recommendations and take control of this portion of their medical care. As such, upwards of
      64% of patients use the internet to access health information related to cancer treatment
      with nutrition websites being among the most popular sites visited. However, the dietary
      advice on the internet aimed at cancer patients is highly discrepant, and even so among
      cancer treatment centers and research institutions. Within the National Comprehensive Cancer
      Network (NCCN), of which Fred Hutchinson is a member, only 43% (9 of 21 centers) either
      provide nutritional information on their website or linked to outside websites. Of those,
      roughly half recommended a low-fat diet during cancer treatment and the other half
      recommended a calorie-dense eating plan with the inclusion of high-fat foods. Clearly, this
      presents a potential pitfall for patients as they, without guidance from their physician or
      dietitian, may follow dietary advice that is misleading or potentially harmful.

      While there is a need for further studies to elucidate the role diet plays during the
      treatment of cancers in general, lung cancer in particular is understudied in comparison to
      other types of cancers, and presents a unique opportunity to study the impact of diet during
      treatment. Primarily, lung cancer patients do not typically suffer from constraints to eating
      that affect colorectal, esophageal, or head/throat/neck cancer sufferers. Therefore, diet
      interventions using whole-foods may be fairly well tolerated in this population. A review of
      nutrition interventions in lung cancer patients carried out through October 2012 indicated
      that only three controlled studies in 149 patients had been completed, all of which used
      nutritional supplement products to prevent unintentional weight loss. The authors concluded
      that nutrition interventions in this population are safe and that more research is needed to
      determine optimal nutrition recommendations for advanced, inoperable lung cancers

      . Through the manipulation of diet, it is possible to selectively target key pathways
      involved in cancer growth and proliferation. For instance, it is known that cancer cells
      generate energy through the process of anaerobic glycolysis (the Warburg Effect) which relies
      primarily on glucose as a fuel source. Evidence from in vitro studies of non-small cell lung
      cancer (NSCLC) suggests that reducing the glucose availability from the diet might be
      particularly effective in the treatment of squamous cell carcinomas because the glucose
      transporter (GLUT-1) expression is markedly elevated in these cancer cells and is associated
      with enhanced uptake of, and dependence upon, glucose. Case-control studies show that dietary
      glycemic index is strongly associated with squamous cell carcinoma among NSCLC patients,
      suggesting that dietary strategies that limit carbohydrate may be effective in 'starving'
      these predominately glycolytic cells. A diet pattern in which overall energy is not limited,
      but sources of glucose are selectively reduced, is one mechanism by which cancer progression
      might be abated. Such low-carbohydrate or - in their most extreme form - ketogenic diets,
      which provide energy primarily from fat and protein while minimizing carbohydrates, are
      increasingly shown to be therapeutic for the treatment of glioblastoma and other cancers, as
      well as neurological diseases, including epilepsy, and cardiovascular disease risk factors.

      It is also known that activation of the IGF pathway is critical for tumor cell proliferation,
      invasiveness, and survival in NSCLC and downregulation of this pathway through dietary
      manipulation might also be an effective means to suppress cancer growth. The insulin-like
      growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) is abundantly present on surfaces of tumor cells, and high
      circulating levels of IGF-1, the ligand for the IGF-1R, are a risk factor for future lung
      malignancy. As individuals who consume diets high in protein from animal sources have greater
      levels of circulating IGF-1 compared to those consuming a vegetarian/vegan diet, limiting the
      intake of animal products may be an intriguing dietary strategy that might influence cancer
      progression. In our lab, we have shown that insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance
      improved after subjects adhered to a diet rich in whole grains, legumes, fruits, and
      vegetables, that excluded refined sources of energy (added sugar, refined grains, added fats
      and oils) (Kratz et al. unpublished data). This suggests that such a diet would also reduce
      the diurnal exposure of tumor cells to both glucose and insulin, which would decrease the
      availability of fuel and growth hormones for cancer cells. Taken together, both
      low-carbohydrate/ketogenic diets and low-fat, whole foods plant-based diets could plausibly
      affect pathways involved in cancer growth or progression by minimizing diurnal exposure to
      glucose, insulin, and IGF-1.

    <masking_description>Participants will be randomized to the low-carbohydrate diet (Diet A), the low-fat diet (Diet B), or the USDA control diet (Diet C). Participants will not be informed about the nature of the intervention diets or the hypotheses we aim to test. The participants will know the diets only as &quot;Diet A&quot;, &quot;Diet B&quot;, and &quot;Diet C&quot;. They will be de-briefed about the nature of the diets and our hypotheses by mail after the study has been completed. At that time, we will also offer them a folder with the dietary guidelines and recipes for the diets they had not been randomized to. The reason participants will be blinded about the diets is that knowing the details may create a placebo effect and/or opting into another intervention diet.</masking_description>

    <description>Dietary Intervention A will be a low-carbohydrate/high fat, ketogenic-type diet. The diet will include salads, leafy green and non-starchy vegetables, nuts and seeds, eggs, fish and shellfish, and meats in most meals. Grains and added sugars will be excluded, and starchy vegetables, fruits, berries, and legumes will be limited to below 10% of total calorie intake. In addition full fat yogurt, cheeses, and butter will be allowed in moderate amounts. Participants will be encouraged to eat freely from whole-foods rich in fats such as avocados, nuts, seeds, olives, coconut and to use coconut, medium-chain triglyceride (MCT), olive, and avocado oils for cooking and baking on that diet. Participants will aim to fulfill at least 65% of their total calorie requirements from fats.</description>

    <description>Dietary Intervention B will be low-fat, high carbohydrate whole-foods, plant-based diet. Most animal products and concentrated plant-based protein sources (such as soy isolates) will be excluded. Whole grains, particularly in their cooked form, legumes, vegetables, and fruits will be encouraged while excluding added sugars and refined grains. Added fats and oils will be discouraged on this diet as dietary fat should comprise less than 10% of total energy. Participants can eat freely from all types of fruits, vegetables, and cooked whole grains. Legumes will be emphasized as a replacement for meat and dairy products. Proteins similar to beef, pork, poultry, and dairy products, should be strictly limited, while lean proteins such as eggs, fish, and shellfish may be included occasionally.</description>
