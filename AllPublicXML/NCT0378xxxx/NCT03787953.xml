  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study was designed to analyze the efficacy and safety of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies for
      the treatment of advanced solid tumors.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a real-world study and the case records of patients with advanced solid tumors
      who visited Department of Medical Oncology, Chinese PLA General Hospital from 2015 to 2019
      and received anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibody therapy will be collected in this study. The medical
      data including patient demographic, tumor characteristics, laboratory examination, history of
      treatments, adverse reactions, and so on will be extracted to analyze the effectivity and
      safety of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies and explore the prognosis-relevant factors of advanced
      solid tumors.
