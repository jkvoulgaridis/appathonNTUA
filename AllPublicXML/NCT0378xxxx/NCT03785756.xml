      This is a single centre, randomised, double blind, double-dummy, parallel group ,
      multiple-dose, active and placebo controlled efficacy study to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of ibuprofen 2×300 mg ibuprofen PR tablets in subjects with postoperative dental pain.

      Eligible subjects will complete all screening procedures within 28 days before the surgery
      and randomisation.

      At Screening, subjects will provide written informed consent to participate in the study
      before any protocol specified procedures or assessments are completed. On Day 1, subjects who
      continue to be eligible for study participation after completing screening procedures and
      assessments will undergo extraction of 2 or more third molars. At least 1 of the third molars
      must be a fully or partially bone impacted mandibular molar. If only 2 molars are removed,
      then they must be ipsilateral.

      All subjects will receive local anaesthesia (2% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine).
      Nitrous oxide will be allowed at the discretion of the investigator. Subjects who experience
      moderate to severe pain intensity (a score of ≥ 5 on a numeric rating scale [NRS] from 0-10
      where 0 = no pain, 10 = worst pain ever) within 6 hours after surgery and who continue to
      meet all study entry criteria will be randomised in a 3:3:1 ratio to receive 2×300 mg
      ibuprofen PR tablets every 12 hours (Q12h), 2×200 mg ibuprofen IR tablets every 8 hours
      (Q8h), or placebo. The randomisation will be stratified by baseline pain category (moderate
      or severe) using a categorical scale that includes the categories of none (0), mild (1-4),
      moderate (5-7), and severe (8-10).

      Subjects will re-assess their baseline pain intensity using the NRS immediately before
      receiving study drug (pre-dose, Time 0) and their pain intensity (NRS) and pain relief (5
      point categorical scale) at the following time points (pre-dose, if at one of the dosing
      timepoints of 0, 8, 12 and/or 16 hours): 15, 30, and 45 minutes, and 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
      7, 8, 10, 12, 16, and 24 hours after Time 0; and immediately before each dose of rescue
      medication, if any. For assessments less than 1 hour apart a window of +/-2 min is allowable
      whilst for assessments at least 1 hour apart a +/-5 min window is allowable.

      The double stopwatch method will be used to record the time to perceptible pain relief and
      time to meaningful pain relief during the 8 hours following the first dose or until subject
      takes rescue medication. Subjects will complete a global evaluation of study drug 24 hours
      (+/- 5 minutes) after Time 0 or immediately before the first dose of rescue medication
      (whichever occurs first). Vital signs will be recorded after the subject has been in a
      sitting position for 3 minutes at the following times: before surgery, within 30 minutes
      before Time 0, 12 and 24 hours after Time 0, and/or immediately before the first dose of
      rescue medication. Adverse events (AEs) will be monitored and recorded from the time of
      signing of the informed consent form (ICF) until the Follow up Visit (or Early Termination
      Visit). During the 24 hours following Time 0, subjects will complete efficacy and safety
      assessments. Subjects will remain at the study site overnight and will be discharged on Day
      2.

      Paracetamol / acetaminophen (1000 mg) will be permitted as the initial rescue medication.
      Subjects will be encouraged to wait at least 60 minutes after receiving study drug before
      taking rescue medication. If acetaminophen rescue medication is not effective in relieving
      the subject's pain, 5 mg oxycodone rescue medication may be administered at the discretion of
      the investigator.

      Subjects are not permitted to take any concomitant medications that might confound
      assessments of pain relief, such as psychotropic drugs, antidepressants, sedative-hypnotics
      (other than those permitted for conscious sedation), or other analgesics taken within five
      times of their elimination half-lives (other than those used at the surgery). Selective
      serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors
      (SNRIs) are permitted if the subject has been on a stable dose for at least four weeks prior
      to Visit 1 (screening).

      Other restrictions include the following: alcohol use is prohibited from 24 hours before
      surgery until discharge on Day 2; nothing by mouth from midnight before surgery until 1 hour
      after surgery; clear liquids only are allowed starting 1 hour after surgery until 1 hour
      after dosing; 1 hour after dosing, the subject's diet may be advanced according to standard
      practice.

      Upon discharge from the study site, subjects may be prescribed pain medication for use at
      home according to the standard practice of the study site. On Day 8 (± 2 days), subjects will
      return to the study site for an abbreviated confirmatory physical assessment and AE
      assessments.

    <intervention_model_description>The dental pain model used in this study is a robust and well established postsurgical pain model that produces pain that is predictable in its character, duration, and intensity. The model is widely accepted and has a proven record of assay sensitivity (i.e. separating active drugs from each other, as well as from placebo). The model is frequently used to evaluate NSAID type analgesics. Results from dental pain studies are accepted by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European authorities and have been widely extrapolated to other general pain conditions.</intervention_model_description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Is male or female ≥ 18 and ≤ 50 years of age.

          -  Requires extraction of 2 or more third molars. At least 1 of the third molars must be
             a fully or partially bone impacted mandibular molar. If only 2 molars are removed,
             then they must be ipsilateral.

          -  Experiences moderate to severe pain intensity within 6 hours after surgery, as
             measured by a numeric rating scale (NRS) score of ≥ 5 on a 0-10 scale.

          -  Has a body weight ≥ 45 kg and a body mass index (BMI) ≤ 35 kg/m2.

          -  Female subjects of child-bearing potential must be willing to use a highly effective
             method of contraception throughout the study. A highly effective method of birth
             control is defined as one which results in a low failure rate (i.e. less than 1% per
             year) when used consistently and correctly, such as the following:

               1. surgical sterilisation

               2. contraceptive implants or injectables

               3. combined oral contraceptives

               4. some intrauterine devices (IUDs)

               5. true sexual abstinence, when this is in line with the preferred and usual
                  lifestyle of the subject (periodic abstinence such as calendar, ovulation,
                  symptothermal, or post-ovulation methods; declaration of abstinence for the
                  duration of the trial; or withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
                  contraception), or

               6. vasectomised partner. To be considered not of child-bearing potential, females
                  must be surgically sterile (defined as bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral
                  oophorectomy, or hysterectomy) or post-menopausal (defined as no menses for 12
                  months in women not using hormonal contraception or hormone replacement therapy,
                  confirmed by a follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal
                  range at Screening).

          -  Free of clinically significant abnormal findings as determined by medical history,
             physical examination, vital signs, laboratory tests and ECG.

          -  Is able to provide written informed consent.

          -  Is willing and able to comply with study requirements (including diet and smoking
             restrictions), complete the pain evaluations, remain at the study site overnight, and
             return for followup 7 (± 2) days after surgery.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known hypersensitivity reactions or allergy (e.g., asthma, rhinitis, angioedema or
             urticaria) in response to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, including
             ibuprofen), acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), ingredients of the study drug, or any
             other drugs used in the study, including anaesthetics and antibiotics that may be
             required on the day of surgery.

          -  A history of active or previous peptic ulceration/ haemorrhage, gastrointestinal
             bleeding or perforation, heart failure, renal or hepatic failure, uncontrolled
             hypertension, asthma, nasal polyps, or chronic rhinitis.

          -  Has complications from the tooth extraction or any other clinically significant
             medical history that, in the opinion of the investigator, would affect the subject's
             ability to comply or otherwise contraindicate study participation, including but not
             limited to the following: cardiac, respiratory, gastroenterological, neurological,
             psychological, immunological, haematological, oncological, or renal disease.

          -  Has undergone another dental surgery within 60 days prior to the day of surgery.

          -  A positive urine drugs of abuse screen or alcohol breathalyser test at screening and
             during the study (with the exception of a positive drugs of abuse screen that is a
             consequence of permitted prescription medicines).

          -  If female, has a positive pregnancy test at screening (serum) or on the day of surgery
             prior to surgery (urine), or is lactating.

          -  Has known or suspected, (in the opinion of the investigator), history of alcoholism or
             drug abuse within 2 years of screening or evidence of tolerance or physical dependence
             before dosing with study drug.

          -  Taking any concomitant medications that might confound assessments of pain relief,
             such as psychotropic drugs, antidepressants, sedative-hypnotics (other than those
             permitted for conscious sedation), or other analgesics taken within five times of
             their elimination half-lives. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and
             serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are permitted if the subject
             has been on a stable dose for at least four weeks prior to Visit 1 (screening).

          -  Is considered by the investigator, for any reason (including, but not limited to the
             risks described as precautions, warnings and contraindications in the current version
             of the investigator's brochure (IB) for 300 mg ibuprofen PR tablets), to be an
             unsuitable candidate to receive the study drug.

          -  Has a history of chronic use (defined as daily use for &gt; 2 weeks) of nonsteroidal
             anti-inflammatory (NSAIDs), opiates, or glucocorticoids (except inhaled nasal steroids
             and topical corticosteroids), for any condition within 6 months before dosing with
             study drug.

          -  Has significant difficulties swallowing capsules or tablets or is unable to tolerate
             oral medication.

          -  Previously participated in another clinical study of 300 mg ibuprofen PR tablets, or
             received any investigational drug, device, or therapy within 90 days before screening.

          -  Enrolment of the Investigator, his / her family members, employees and other dependent
             persons.

          -  Failure to satisfy the investigator of fitness to participate for any other reason.
