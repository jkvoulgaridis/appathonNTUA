  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anlotinib has been approved as a third-line treatment for advanced non-small-cell lung
      cancer. A phase II clinical studies of small cell lung cancer (ALTER-1210) also showed that,
      compared with placebo, Anlotinib could improve the patients survival and had less toxic side
      effects after 2-3 line therapy. The purpose of this multicenter, randomized, prospective
      study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of Anlotinib as the maintenance therapy for
      Extensive-stage small cell lung cancer after combined with etoposide and cisplatin
      chemotherapy.
