  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients in the IPCM group (n = 112) received intensive psychotherapy and case management,
      and those in the CAU group (n = 102) received care as usual, including behavioral health
      referrals and/or brief onsite interventions.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      IPCM patients received routine services from both a psychotherapist and separate mental
      health case manager for one year; duration of each appointment was 45 minutes - 1 hour;
      frequency of appointments was weekly or every other week, dependent on participant
      availability. A face-to-face professional interpreter was utilized unless the CVT provider
      was a native Karen speaker.

      Participants in the control group received care as usual, without CVT involvement other than
      administration of the outcome measures. Once randomized, CAU patients could be referred to a
      full range of outpatient and community-based behavioral health services by their primary care
      physician.
