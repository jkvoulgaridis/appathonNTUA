  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed (1) revaluating the efficacy of the Wells' clinical prediction score for an
      inpatient population; and the weight of the presence of thromboprophylaxis treatment on the
      score, and (2) evaluating the correlation of a risk stratification established between a
      physician specialised in thrombosis and any other doctor.
