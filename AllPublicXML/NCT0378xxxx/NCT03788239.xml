      To compare the wound healing after total knee replacement wound closure with staples versus
      subcuticular prolene suture.

      .Informed consent will be taken from all the patients who meet the inclusion and exclusion
      criteria and then will be randomized into one of the two study arms (Arm 1: will undergo
      wound closure with staples and Arm 2 wound closure with subcuticular prolene suture).

      before the start of surgery. The primary investigator will open the sealed envelopes provided
      by the Indus Hospital Research Center's Clinical Research Unit (CRU) that provides the study
      arm allocation. The envelopes will follow the SNOSE protocol i.e. they will be sequentially
      numbered, opaque sealed envelopes. Before opening the envelope, the primary investigator will
      write the patient's medical record number, date and will sign the envelope. The envelope will
      contain carbon paper which will transfer the data allocation paper inside.

    <description>Prolene suture: non-absorbable, sterile surgical suture composed of an isotactic crystalline steroisomer of polypropylene, a synthetic linear polyolefin. After completion of the procedure, deep tissues will closed with subcuticular prolene suture. Compared to the absorbable sutures, prolene is known to cause less infection since it is a monofilament material.
Staples: specialized staples used in surgery in place of sutures to close skin wounds. After completion of the procedure, deep tissues were closed with absorbable braided suture, then the skin will be closed by staples.</description>
