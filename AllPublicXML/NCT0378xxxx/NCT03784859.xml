  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this small feasibility pilot study is to demonstrate that
      implant-based breast reconstruction (after treatment for cancer) can successfully be
      performed without prolonged drain placement, using a tissue expander with a reservoir and
      in-office transcutaneous fluid aspiration. Secondly, the investigators aim to provide enough
      confidence in this technique that a larger study can be performed to demonstrate fewer
      complications (infection, drain-related pain and re-operation rates) when compared to the use
      of conventional tissue expanders and/or implants with prolonged drain placement.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients electing to have staged, implant-based, bilateral breast reconstruction at the time
      of mastectomy (for either cancer or cancer prevention) will undergo a standardized
      subpectoral tissue expander placement (using the Sientra AlloX2 dual-port device) on each
      side of the chest with a single piece of acellular dermal matrix (ADM). A single drain in the
      subcutaneous pocket of each breast will be used and removed on the first post-operative day.
      Patients will be admitted for overnight observation in the hospital. Each post-operative day
      fluid will be aspirated from each reservoir port using a standard sterile technique, and the
      volume recorded. After discharge, patients will be seen in the office within one week of
      discharge and fluid aspirated from each expander using the reservoir ports, and the volume
      shall be recorded. The aspiration will be repeated weekly until expansion is completed and/or
      the amount of fluid aspirated is less than 10 cc.

      Patients will be asked to complete a 7 item multiple-choice questionnaire regarding their
      attitudes about their breast reconstruction, first at completion of tissue expansion and
      finally at their first follow-up visit following placement of permanent breast implants.

      This study utilizes FDA 510k-classified devices that allow removal of fluid without drains,
      in lieu of more conventional expanders, allowing for the avoidance of prolonged drain usage.
