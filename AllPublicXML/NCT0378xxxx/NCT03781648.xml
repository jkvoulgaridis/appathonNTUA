    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer remains the third most common cause of death from cancer worldwide. The
      adenoma detection rate is correlated with quality of colonoscopy and risk of postcolonoscopy
      CRC. Low quality of bowel preparation with fecal residue and brown liquid in the colon may
      lower the adenoma detection rate (ADR). Optimal bowel preparation and novel approaches for
      colonoscopy increases the effectiveness of colonoscopic examination to improve ADR are
      desirable. Water exchange, which significantly increased colon cleanliness both in the right
      colon and the entire colon, is characterized by insertion to the cecum in clear water in lieu
      of gas insufflations. Water exchange led to an increase in ADR and MAP, particularly for the
      improvement in the right colon, providing adequate bowel preparation.

      NBI is an innovative imaging technology which efficiency for the early detection of
      superficial cancers in the head and neck region and the esophagus had been reported
      previously. In the colorectal region, different results have been reported for improvement in
      the adenoma detection rate of NBI compared with that of WLI. All procedures were performed up
      to the cecum by using a high-definition colonoscope (GIF-HQ290I; Olympus Optical ) However,
      whether NBI in high-definition colonoscope can increase the ADR after water exchange
      insertion, remains to be elucidated. The aim of this study was therefore to determine whether
      the use of NBI system as an adjunct to water exchange insertion would improve the ADR

      Design: Prospective single-blinded randomized controlled trial. Patients were randomly
      assigned to control group or study group through a computer-based randomization list by a
      technician. See also inclusion and exclusion criteria.

      Colonoscopy was performed using high-definition colonoscope (GIF-HQ290I) after bowel
      preparation. Experienced endoscopists performed all procedures (each with over 1000
      colonoscopies performed). During the insertion phase, air pump was turned off to avoid
      inadvertent insufflations. Water exchange with infusion pump was used to open the lumen and
      simultaneous suction of infused water to allow passage of the scope in clear water. Suction
      of water can maximize cleanliness and minimize distension. Air pockets at any location of the
      lumen were always aspirated. In a collapsed colon, water turbulence formation at the tip of
      the scope facilitates residual feces removal, salvage cleansing also be provided during
      insertion.

      Cecal intubation was defined as the passage of the scope tip beyond the ileocecal valve with
      visualization of the cecal appendix. After cecal intubation, as much residual water as
      possible was aspirated before beginning the withdrawal phase. In all arms, withdrawal lasted
      at least 6 minutes and was done using air insufflation to obtain adequate distension. A
      stopwatch was used to time the procedures.

      Colon cleanliness was assessed using the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS) [19].
      Cardiopulmonary function was monitored throughout. The amount of water infused and suctioned
      during insertion and withdrawal, and adverse outcomes were recorded. Study end points The
      primary outcome was overall ADR. Secondary outcomes included Right and left colon Adenoma
      Detection Rate. Right and left colon &lt;10 mm Adenoma Detection Rate. Mean adenomas resected
      per procedure. Cecal intubation rate. Cecal intubation time. Total withdrawal time. Amount of
      water used during the procedure.
