  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A nationwide retrospective cohort study. To investigate the real world medication compliance
      and the relation with clinical outcomes.

      The persistence and compliance to dual anti-platelet therapy(DAPT) and dyslipidemia agents
      are important for the patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. But, the
      discontinuation and compliance rate are unknown in the real world setting.

      A nationwide retrospective cohort study. The persistence and compliance to dual anti-platelet
      therapy(DAPT) and dyslipidemia agents are important for the patients undergoing percutaneous
      coronary intervention. The discontinuation and uncompliance may increase a risk. But, the
      discontinuation and compliance rate are not well known in the real world patients undergoing
      bare metal stents(BMS) and drug eluting stents(DES) insertion.

      To investigate the real world medication compliance and the relation with clinical outcomes,
      administrative claim data was extracted from the Korean National Healthcare Insurance(KNHI)
      database.

      All Korean patient date undergoing PCI from January 1, 2011 to December 2011 is extracted. 5
      year clinical outcomes are investigated.

      Primary outcomes are the MACE including all-cause death, revascularization, critically ill
      status, and stroke) classified by the medication compliance. Medication complinace is
      measured by proportion of days covered(PDC)

      Secondary outcomes are the patterns of medication persistence and its outcomes to understand
      critical points.
