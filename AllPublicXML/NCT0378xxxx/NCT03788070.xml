  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to measure the prevalence of preoperative dehydration
      in elective major abdominal urologic surgery when we apply our daily standard operation
      procedures. Secondary objectives are to assess the impact of preoperative dehydration on
      postoperative outcome. The hypothesis is that preoperative dehydration leads to more
      postoperative complications.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The information about the impact of preoperative dehydration on postoperative outcome is
      conflicting. One of the reported difficulties of the studies in this field is to get adequate
      power for statistical significance. The incidence of preoperative dehydration in different
      surgical populations has been reported in about one third of patients. The prevalence in the
      urologic population is not known.

      This is a monocentric observational study with no study intervention. The goal is to
      consecutively include all patients undergoing major urologic surgery during 365 days who meet
      the inclusion criteria to assess the prevalence of preoperative dehydration in elective major
      abdominal urologic surgery when the standard operation procedures of the University Hospital
      Bern are applied.

    <description>Changes in Quality of Recovery using the validated 15 items quality of recovery (QoR-15) score : QoR is a patient reported outcome short questionnaire that measure the quality of recovery after surgery and anaesthesia. It incorporates 5 dimensions of health (patient support, comfort, emotions, physical independence, pain). This is a shortened validated version of the QoR 40 including 15 items. QoR-15, with a score range from 0 to 150 (0 worst possible, 150 best possible), is easy to perform. Recently a meta-analysis showed that QoR 15 fulfils requirements for outcome measurement instruments.</description>

        The project population will be all patients undergoing major urologic surgery at the
        Department of Urology, Inselspital Bern, meeting the inclusion criteria. The number of
        participants depends on the amount of surgeries of patients meeting the inclusion criteria
        taking place during the inclusion period of 365 days.
