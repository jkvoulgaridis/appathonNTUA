    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the anogenital distance measurement differences between transgender male
      individuals and normal healthy female individuals. Half of the participants will be selected
      from the men with a masculine gender identity who were assigned female sex at birth (Woman
      who wanted to be a man). Transgender men will be evaluated with the vaginal examination, and
      anogenital distance will be measured at the time of gynecological medico-legal evaluation
      before the sex reassignment surgery. While the other half of the participants will be
      selected from healthy female individuals, ordinary healthy women will be selected from
      patients who come to the gynecology clinic for another reason (Women with normal sexual
      orientation).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is considerable evidence in human beings and in animal models supporting that
      anogenital distance as a sensitive biomarker of prenatal androgen reflection of reproductive
      health and sexual orientation. Anogenital distance is approximately twice as long in male
      animals compared to female animals, and it is routinely used to determine the natal or
      birth-assigned sex.

      Studies have shown alterations in anogenital distance associated with reproductive health and
      sexual orientation. For instance, shorter anogenital distance has been reported in boys with
      hypospadias and cryptorchidism. Men with reduced testicular volume have significantly shorter
      anogenital distance compared with controls. Increased anogenital distance has been indicated
      in girls with congenital adrenal hyperplasia.

      The investigators hypothesized that a prenatal pathological androgenic environment, resulting
      in a longer anogenital distance, will be able to be associated with a higher risk of sexual
      orientation disorders like transsexualism. This cross-sectional study aimed to assess the
      anogenital distance measurement differences between transgender male persons and normal
      healthy female individuals.

    <description>The women were kindly asked to lay down in the lithotomy position with their thighs at 45° to the examination table. A digital caliper (Mitutoyo 500-752-10 ABSOLUTE Digimatic Coolant Proof Caliper 0-150mm / 0-6&quot;, Mitutoyo Corporation, Japan) was used to measure anogenital distance.
Anogenital distance anus to clitoris: will be measured in centimeters from the anterior clitoral surface to the center of the anus.
Anogenital distance anus to fourchette: will be measured in centimeters from the posterior fourchette to the center of the anus.
Two investigators who were blind to the gynecological status of the women will measure each distance three times, and the mean value of the six measurements of each anogenital distance will be used.</description>

        The study population will be healthy transgender male individuals whose gender identity
        (Male) are different from their birth-assigned sex (Female). These individuals are healthy
        biologically female persons and want to change their gender to male status. In Turkey, if a
        woman wants to change her gender, she has to bring a lawsuit against the birth registration
        office to change her gender to male status. Medico-legal assessments then have to be made
        at a tertiary gynecological center through the court. The participants will be invited to
        the study at the time of medico-legal evaluation before the sex reassignment surgery.
