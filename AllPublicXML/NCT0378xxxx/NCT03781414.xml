  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK) and
      pharmacodynamics (PD) of two CFZ533 dose regimens in liver transplant recipients.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will allow assessment of the ability of CFZ533 to replace Calcineurin inhibitors
      (CNIs) in terms of anti-rejection efficacy, while providing potentially better renal function
      with an expected similar safety and tolerability profile. Results of this study will be used
      to inform the CFZ533 dose and regimen selection for investigation in later phases of clinical
      development.
