  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart attacks and strokes are the leading causes of death in US. High blood viscosity and
      turbulence in blood flow are the key for cardiovascular diseases. Recent research has shown
      that application of a strong magnetic field along the blood flow direction will polarize the
      red blood cells and align them into short chains along the flow, so that the blood viscosity
      in the flow direction is reduced significantly and disturbed motions in the directions
      perpendicular to the flow is suppressed. This makes the blood flow laminar, turbulence
      suppressed, and the possibility of cardiac events reduced. Such magnet treatment also cures
      rouleaux and improves the blood's oxygen function. The lab tests also confirm that the above
      effects last more than 24 hours after one treatment.

      The purpose of this trial is to apply this technology to humans. According to the lab tests,
      this magnetic treatment has the potential to bring the following benefits to the subjects:
      (a)The blood viscosity will be reduced by 10-20% or more. (b) The turbulence in blood
      circulation will be suppressed by the treatment. After the treatment, the blood flow will be
      laminar. As a joint effect of viscosity reduction and turbulence suppression, the blood
      pressure will be lowered by 10-20% or more. (c) The subject's blood oxygen function will be
      improved by the treatment. Especially, if the subject has rouleaux in his/her blood, the
      effect will be significant. (d) The above effects will last for about 24 hours after one
      treatment and slowly decay; however, re-treatment will bring the effects back. (e) Because
      steady laminar blood flow is atheroprotective by active reduction of inflammatory genes, the
      magnetic treatment, reducing disturbed blood flow hemodynamics, would be possible to have a
      long term effect as an anti-atherogenic therapy if the treatment keeps for a while.

      The investigators have just completed the pilot clinical trial. The tests confirm that the
      technology is safe and effective in lowering the blood pressure and the effect lasts about 24
      hours. The present pivotal clinical trials are the continuation and expansion of the pilot
      tests. The successful clinical trials will make this technology available for people in
      preventing heart attack and stroke.

      GOAL: Conduct pivotal clinical trials with Magnetic Blood Pressure Lowering (MBPL) Device,
      developed in this lab, to see how effective it can lower patients' high blood pressure. The
      pilot study has confirmed the safety and performance of the device. The pivotal tests will
      test a large population of subject with hypertension to determine the effectiveness of the
      MBPL device and check if there is any adverse effect.

      RECRUITMENT: For the pivotal clinical trials, subjects in second stage of hypertension will
      be selected: the systolic blood pressure in a range of 140-180 mmHg or diastolic blood
      pressure in a range 90-120 mmHg. For safety, subjects, who have a pacemaker or other metallic
      devices implanted, will not be selected. In addition, any adults unable to consent,
      cognitively impaired adults, and subjects who are not yet adults (infants, children,
      teenagers), pregnant women, and prisoners, will not be admitted.

      STUDY: The MBPL device for clinical trials is made with modification of an electromagnet: A
      bore of 10 cm diameter was made to go through the frame and poles. The device can produce a
      magnetic field close to 1.0 T inside the bore, which is along the axis direction. The trial
      for each subject takes about 20-30 minutes. The subject's blood pressure will be measured
      first. Afterwards, the subject will place his/her right arm into the bore of the
      electromagnet for treatment while the blood pressure is monitored with the left arm. The
      magnetic treatment will last about 15 minutes.

      In order to see how long the effect lasts, the subject needs to return and measure the blood
      pressure again 24 hours after the treatment. The clinical trials are non-invasive. There is
      no medicine or surgery involved.

      ANALYSES: During the magnetic treatment, the MBPL device applies a strong magnetic field
      along the blood flow direction in subjects' right arm. Under the magnetic field, the
      deoxygenated red blood cells are polarized and form short chains along the blood flow
      direction. The blood circulation brings these chains to the whole body. Based on the lab
      results, the blood viscosity along the flow direction will be reduced by 10-20% or more; the
      turbulence in blood circulation will be suppressed by the treatment if the subject has
      turbulence in the blood circulation. As a result, the blood flow will become laminar and the
      blood pressure will be lowered. The above effects will last for about 24 hours after the
      treatment and slowly decay. However, re-treatment will bring the effects back. In long term,
      the magnetic treatment could prevent development of atherosclerotic plaques in blood vessels.
      The effectiveness of the magnetic treatment will be determined by

        -  evaluating the reduction of the systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure
           immediately after the magnetic treatment;

        -  comparing the blood pressure 24 hours after the magnetic treatment with the initial
           blood pressure before the magnetic treatment and evaluating any reduction.
