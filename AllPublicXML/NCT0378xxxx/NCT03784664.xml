  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Blood gases are widely used in emergency and resuscitation services and are the key
      examination for exploring acid-base balance disorders (using pH, PaCO2 and HCO3 ) and gas
      exchange disorders (using PaO2 and PaCO2). This examination can be taken from both venous and
      arterial sample and its analysis depends on the type of blood sample. Currently, several
      studies have already shown the existence of a good correlation of pH and bicarbonates level
      between a venous and arterial sample. Thus, when this examination is prescribed for the
      purpose of highlighting and analyzing an acid-base disorder, venous blood gas is
      theoretically as efficient as arterial blood gas.

      Due to the lack of evidence of benefit for the patient or the health care team of a venous
      blood gas rather than an arterial blood gas in the absence of suspicion of hypoxemia,
      arterial blood gas is currently the standard of care for the analysis of acid-base disorders.
      Indeed, among the university hospitals affiliated to the Paris Diderot University, the
      emergency departments carry out in their vast majority (4 of 5 E.D.) arterial blood gases.
      Demonstration of the superiority of veinous sample over arterial sample regarding pain could
      substantially modify current practices.

      The investigator's main hypothesis is that, in the absence of suspicion of hypoxemia (normal
      oxygen saturation measured by plethysmography), the realization of a venous blood gas for the
      evaluation of the acid-base balance in the context of emergencies is less painful for
      patients, simpler for the health care team and provides sufficient biochemical information
      for the doctor in comparison with an arterial blood gas.
