  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease caused by inherited and/or acquired deficiency in
      production of insulin by the pancreas, or by the ineffectiveness of the insulin produced. It
      has become a major healthcare problem in India. High-quality, low-cost solutions adapted to
      the local context are critical to addressing the current crisis in the management of
      diabetes. Herbal tea consists of tulsi, guava and stevia, which has glucose lowering
      properties.The aim of this trial is to study the effect of a herbal tea in the glycemic
      response in the early type 2 diabetes.
