  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BAY1902607 is a new type of drug under clinical development for different conditions
      including the treatment of endometriosis, i.e. a condition where the tissue that usually
      grows inside the womb grows outside of the womb.

      Itraconazole (ITZ) is an approved drug often used for the treatment of fungal infections and
      possibly inhibits the breakdown of BAY1902607. In this clinical study, BAY1902607 is given
      alone by mouth or in combination with ITZ. Researchers want to learn more how quickly and to
      what extent the study drug BAY1902607 given by mouth to healthy male participants is absorbed
      by the human body, reaches the blood stream and is excreted again. In addition they want to
      find out whether the elimination of the study drug BAY1902607 is influenced by ITZ given at
      the same time.
