    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the efficacy of high-dose fish oil in decreasing rates of
      gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices.
      Half of the patients without history of bleeding will receive fish oil while the other half
      will not. Half of the patients with history of bleeding will receive fish oil while the other
      half will not. Markers of angiogenesis and inflammation, as well as changes in the microbiome
      will be assessed in each group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A potential mechanism of bleeding in patients with continuous-flow left ventricular assist
      devices (CF-LVAD) is dysfunctional angiogenesis. Angiogenesis is a complicated process
      controlled by several markers. Previous studies have shown that elevated Angiopoietin-2 and
      TNF-alpha are associated with bleeding events in CF-LVAD patients.

      Fish oil has anti-inflammatory and potentially anti-angiogenic properties. A retrospective
      study of CF-LVAD patients on high-dose fish oil showed a marked decrease in gastrointestinal
      bleeding rates in these patients. Additionally, these patients had lower levels of
      circulating Angiopoietin-2. Fish oil is known to have an effect on the microbiome, and the
      aforementioned effects may be seen in changes of the microbiota.
