  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A methodical evaluation of novel sound changing principles in CE-labelled Sonova brand
      hearing instruments (e.g. Phonak hearing instruments) is intended to be conducted on hearing
      impaired. These sound changing principles are enabled by respective hearing instrument
      algorithms. The aim of the study is to investigate and asses strength and weaknesses of these
      novel sound changing principles in terms of hearing performance to determine their
      application in hearing instruments (Phase of development). Both, objective laboratory
      measurements as well as subjective evaluations in real life environment will be carried out.
      This will be a controlled, single blinded and randomized active comparator clinical
      evaluation which will be conducted mono-centric at Sonova AG Headquarter based in Staefa.
