  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main OBJECTIVE of this proposal is to extend our preclinical findings on the role of DNA
      damage and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARP) inhibition as a therapy for a devastating
      disease, pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), to early-phase clinical trials. We, and
      others, have published strong evidence that DNA damage accounts for disease progression in
      PAH and showed that PARP1 inhibition can reverse PAH in several animal models1.
      Interestingly, PARP1 inhibition is also cardioprotective. Olaparib, an orally available PARP1
      inhibitor, can reverse cancer growth in animals and humans with a good safety profile, and is
      now approved for the treatment of ovarian cancer in Canada, Europe and the USA. The time is
      thus right to translate our findings in human PAH.

      The primary objective of this Phase 1B study is to confirm the safety of using olaparib in
      PAH patients, and precise the sample size of a future Phase 2 trial. In addition to safety,
      efficacy signals will thus be assessed.

      Overall, 20 well-characterized PAH patients that have been stable for &gt;4 months on standard
      PAH-therapies, as per guidelines will be recruited. The initial Health Canada approval will
      be obtained. Olaparib will be provided by AstraZeneca Canada, but AZ had no input into the
      trial design and will not be involved in the conduct of the trial, analysis, interpretation
      of the results or the final manuscript.

      A 4-week pre-treatment phase will allow ensuring that patients are on stable doses of PAH
      medication.

      Given that PAH is a chronic disease and that patients may be at higher risk for drug-related
      adverse events (e.g. anemia), olaparib will be started at low-dose (100mg BID), then
      up-titrated weekly by 100mg BID up to 200mg BID (n=5, group 1) or 300mg BID (n=15, group 2)
      for a total treatment duration (including the up-titration phase) of 24 weeks. Using 100mg
      and 150mg tablets will allow minimizing the number of tablets taken (e.g. 2 x 150mg tablets
      BID) or adjusting the dose in case of drug-related adverse events (e.g. 250mg BID using 100mg
      and 150mg tablets).

      Patients will be regularly followed to assess whether side effects are observed and whether
      olaparib can be up-titrated.

      At baseline and week 24, a cardiac catheterization will assess changes in pulmonary
      hemodynamics and RV function.

      An end-of-study visit is planned at week 28 week.

                  requirements.

               -  Breast feeding women.

          -  Lifestyle restrictions:

                  active, must agree to the use of TWO highly effective forms of contraception in
                  combination. This should be started from the signing of the informed consent and
                  continue throughout the period of taking study treatment and for at least 1 month
                  after last dose of study drug(s), or they must totally/truly abstain from any
                  form of sexual intercourse.

        Male patients must use a condom during treatment and for 3 months after the last dose of
        olaparib when having sexual intercourse with a pregnant woman or with a woman of
        childbearing potential. Female partners of male patients should also use a highly effective
        form of contraception if they are of childbearing potential. Male patients should not
        donate sperm throughout the period of taking olaparib and for 3 months following the last
        dose of olaparib.

        For details of acceptable methods of contraception refer to Appendix B Acceptable Birth
        Control Methods.
