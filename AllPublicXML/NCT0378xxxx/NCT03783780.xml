      This study is designed to compare the accuracy of a noninvasive measurement of oxygen
      saturation compared to reference values obtained by a laboratory blood gas analyzer. Arterial
      blood samples will be collected from healthy adult subjects while undergoing a desaturation
      procedure wherein the concentration of oxygen inhaled is slowly reduced until the subject's
      arterial oxygen concentration is approximately 70%. During the desaturation, the subject's
      hand and arm without the arterial line will be subjected to motion at various times during
      the study. The subject will then be returned to breathing room air.
