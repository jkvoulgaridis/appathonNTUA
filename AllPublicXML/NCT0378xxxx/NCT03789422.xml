  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spontaneous chronic urticaria (UCS) is a disease that affects 1% of the general population
      with a potentially severe impact on quality of life. Most patients respond favorably to
      long-term antihistamine treatment, but sometimes it is necessary to give a high dose (4 times
      the formal dose, Berlin consensus 2016). These high doses are often accompanied by side
      effects requiring cessation of treatment. The therapeutic alternative is then omalizumab, an
      expensive biotherapy. UCS is secondary to non-specific mast cell activation. It has been
      shown to be associated with activation of fibrinolysis that correlates with the severity of
      symptoms. Patients with UCS resistant to levocetirizine were shown to have higher D-dimer
      levels than patients who responded to antihistamines. Tranexamic acid is a molecule with
      antifibrinolytic propertiesSeveral cases of severe chronic urticaria responding favorably to
      treatment with tranexamic acid have been reported. In our department, Investigators also
      noticed the improvement of some of their patients on tranexamic acid. The combination of
      these two treatments appears to be synergistic: action on histamine receptors and control of
      fibrinolysis.

      The investigators propose to evaluate the association of tranexamic acid and levocetirizine
      for the treatment of chronic spontaneous urticaria.

      Multicentric controlled randomized crossover study, double-blind To evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of levocetirizine 10mg / day + tranexamic acid (AT) 2g / day versus levocetirizine
      20mg / day alone in the chronic treatment of chronic urticaria evaluated at 4 weeks.

      A hierarchical analysis will be implemented in the following order:

        1. Non-inferiority of the combination levocetirizine 10 mg / day + tranexamic acid (TA) 2 g
           / day versus levocetirizine alone 20 mg / day in terms of effectiveness

        2. Superiority of the combination levocetirizine 10 mg / day + tranexamic acid (AT) 2 g /
           day versus levocetirizine alone 20 mg / day in terms of tolerance

        3. Superiority of levocetirizine 10mg / day + tranexamic acid (AT) 2g / day versus
           levocetirizine alone 20mg / day in terms of effectiveness Each objective will be tested
           sequentially if and only if the previous objective is validated.

    <description>Evolution of the UAS7 score between the beginning (J0) and the end (J28) of the treatment period. To calculate the score, the patient rates the number of papules and itching intensity from 0 to 3 daily for 7 days. 0 corresponds to no papules and no itching, 3 corresponds to more than 50 papules per 24h and intense itching that can cause daily life. This makes a score of 0 to 6 per day accumulated over 7 days, ranging from 0 to 42.</description>
