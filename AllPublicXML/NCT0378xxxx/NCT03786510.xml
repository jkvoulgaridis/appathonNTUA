      Investigators aimed to examine the feasibility and effectiveness of a multidomain
      intervention strategy involving intensive and maintenance programs aimed at reducing the risk
      of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in at-risk older adults. Participants were randomly allocated
      into three groups: (1) intensive plus maintenance program (INT+MNT group), (2) intensive
      program only (INT-only group), and (3) active control (control group). There were two study
      hypotheses: 1) the participants in the 4-week intensive program (INT+MNT and INT-only group)
      would show reduced dementia risk scores compared to control; and 2) that the participants in
      the added 20-week maintenance program (INT+MNT group) would show greater improvement in
      dementia risk scores compared to the INT-only and control groups.

      OBJECTIVES: To examine the feasibility and effectiveness of a multidomain intervention
      strategy involving intensive and maintenance programs aimed at reducing the risk of
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) in at-risk older adults.

      DESIGN: A prospective randomized controlled trial with participants assigned to three
      parallel programs: intensive plus maintenance (INT+MNT), intensive only (INT-only), and
      active control.

      SETTING: A community center for dementia in South Korea.

      PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling older adults (aged â‰¥ 60 years) without dementia, but having
      several risk factors for AD.

      MEASUREMENTS: The study subjects participated in a 4-week intensive group-based lifestyle
      modification program that focused on physical activity, vascular risk factors, dietary
      habits, cognitive activities, and social engagement. Then, the participants underwent a
      20-week maintenance program to consolidate modified habits. Linear mixed models were used to
      examine the changes in modified Australian National University-Alzheimer's Disease Risk Index
      (ANU-ADRI) scores in each group. Additional analyses of secondary outcomes, including
      cognitive function, were also performed.

    <time_frame>baseline (0 week), 4-week, 24-week</time_frame>
    <description>The ANU-ADRI was developed based on review and meta-analysis of the literature regarding modifiable risk and protective factors for AD; it is a validated instrument assessing individual risk profiles for AD that combines the odds ratios of risk factors to derive a risk score. The total scores ranged from -18 to 63 for males, and from -18 to 66 for females; higher scores indicated greater risk for AD.</description>

    <measure>Changes from baseline Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) at 4 weeks and 24 week</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline (0 week), 4-week, 24-week</time_frame>
    <description>The SPPB was developed for evaluating lower extremity functioning in older persons. The scores range from 0 to 12; higher scores indicated better performance.</description>

    <measure>Changes from baseline total score in the CERAD neuropsychological battery at 4 weeks and 24 week</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline (0 week), 4-week, 24-week</time_frame>
    <description>The CERAD neuropsychological battery includes various cognitive domains: memory, language, visuospatial, executive, etc. There are age-, sex-, and educational year-stratified norms; individuals' z-score can be calculated.</description>

    <measure>Changes from baseline Color Word Stroop Test (CWST) at 4 weeks and 24 week</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline (0 week), 4-week, 24-week</time_frame>
    <description>CWST mainly can examine the executive function. There are age-, sex-, and educational year-stratified norms; individuals' z-score can be calculated.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes from baseline Seoul-Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (S-IADL) at 4 weeks and 24 week</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline (0 week), 4-week, 24-week</time_frame>
    <description>The S-IADL includes 15 items in regard with various instrumental activities of daily living. The total scores ranged from 0 to 15; higher scores indicated lower level of daily function.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes from baseline EuroQol Five-Dimensional Questionnaire (EQ-5D) at 4 weeks and 24 week</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline (0 week), 4-week, 24-week</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D is consisted of five dimensions that include mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. The total scores ranged from 5 to 15; higher scores indicated lower quality of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes from baseline Motivation to Change Lifestyle and Health Behaviors for Dementia Risk Reduction Scale (MCLHB-DRR) scale at 4 weeks and 24 week</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline (0 week), 4-week, 24-week</time_frame>
    <description>The MCLHB-DRR was developed to understand beliefs underpinning the lifestyle and health behavioural changes needed for dementia risk reduction. Seven-factor solution (perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived benefits, perceived barriers, cues to action, general health motivation, self-efficiency) with 27 items were included. The total scores ranged from 0 to 27; higher scores indicate higher motivation for reducing risk of dementia</description>
