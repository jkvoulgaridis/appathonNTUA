  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a prospective, open-label, single arm, multi-center phase 2 clinical trial
      of mFOLFOX6 + trastuzumab + avelumab in first-line, metastatic, HER2-amplified gastric and
      esophageal adenocarcinomas. The primary objective of this study is to estimate the best
      objective response rate (CR or PR, ORR) in these patients within 24 weeks by RECIST 1.1
      criteria. Secondary objectives include; estimating PFS by both RECIST 1.1 and iRECIST
      criteria, estimating OS, estimating the disease control rate (DCR) at 24 weeks by RECIST 1.1
      and iRECIST, and characterizing the safety issues associated with this regimen.

             alopecia, sensory neuropathy Grade ≤ 2, or other Grade ≤ 2 not constituting a safety
             risk based on investigator's judgment are acceptable.

             consent, the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the investigator,
             would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study.
