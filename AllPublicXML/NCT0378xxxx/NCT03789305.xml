  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective analysis of patient registry data of intensive care patients. The aim
      is to investigate if frailty is a predictor of decline of functional status of critically ill
      patients during their hospital stay.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Elderly critical-ill patients with a high frailty level are becoming increasingly important
      in the ICU and the health system. Especially, questions about the course of the individual
      proceeding, withhold of therapy and level of care are controversial among caretakers, as
      outcome and functional independence remain still unclear in these patients.

      This applies particularly in view of the fact that large studies such as VIP1 showed an
      inverse association of high frailty classes with short-term survival.

      Our main objective in this study was to focus on functional outcome and independency measured
      by Barthel Index after ICU stay regarding frailty, the effect of critical care and severity
      and prognosis of the disease.
