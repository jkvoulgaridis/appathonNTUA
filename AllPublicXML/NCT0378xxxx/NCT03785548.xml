  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective cohort study to determine if using a birthing mirror during the
      patient's pelvic examination decreases patients's degree of vulnerability and discomfort.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Obstetrics and Gynecology and its gynecologic subspecialties, the pelvic examination is
      routine practice for screening and diagnostic purposes. Nevertheless, due to their intimate
      nature, pelvic examinations may result in loss of control, embarrassment, discomfort and
      anxiety.

      The mirror pelvic exam has been a proposed technique to decrease patient anxiety and improve
      comfort during an already uncomfortable examination. However, little research has focused on
      this modality to date.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether the mirror pelvic exam decreases the
      level of vulnerability and discomfort experienced during the pelvic examination.

    <description>VAS on vulnerability level will be measured before and after the pelvic exam, and the change will be calculated per subject. The VAS is a validated 100 millimeter scale with 'no vulnerability' represented as 0 mm and 'very vulnerable' equating to 100 mm.</description>

    <description>VAS on discomfort level will be measured before and after the pelvic exam, and the change will be calculated per subject. The VAS is a validated 100 millimeter scale with 'no pain' represented as 0 mm and 'most pain' equating to 100 mm.</description>
