  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Achalasia cardia is a primary oesophageal motility disorder of unknown etiology. Recently,
      peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) has gained widespread acceptance as an effective treatment
      modality for achalasia.

      Major adverse events are uncommon with POEM. Since the operator works close to mediastinum
      during the POEM procedure, there is a potential for infectious complications. Therefore,
      intravenous antibiotics are universally used to prevent infection-related adverse events.
      There is no fixed protocol or duration of antibiotics for the same.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      POEM is a novel minimally invasive treatment for achalasia, which emerged as an offshoot of
      natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES). Major adverse events during POEM are
      rare and therefore, the procedure is considered safe.

      Bacteremia can occur after endoscopic procedures like esophageal dilation, sclerotherapy of
      varices, and instrumentation of obstructed bile ducts. Bacteremia has been advocated as a
      surrogate marker for risk of infection-related complications. In POEM procedure, the
      endoscopist works in close proximity to mediastinum and peritoneal cavity. Therefore, the
      potential for infection-related complications is high. However, despite of different
      antibiotic protocols at different centers, the reported incidence of infection-related
      complications is very low. At present, prophylactic antibiotics are universally initiated
      before starting the POEM procedure and continued for a variable duration after POEM ranging
      from 1 day to 7 days.

      Data from surgical studies indicate that prolonged administration of antibiotics for longer
      than 24 hours may not be beneficial. Prolonged use of antibiotics not only increases the
      costs and exposure to drug toxicity directly but also may be associated with an increased
      risk of acquired antibiotic resistance as well as infection with Clostridium difficile.

      With this background, we planned a study to evaluate the difference in the infectious
      complications between short vs long duration antibiotic in patients with achalasia undergoing
      POEM.
