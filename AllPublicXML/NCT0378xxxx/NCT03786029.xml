      Brief Summary:

      Aims: The objective of the current study will be to compare the effectiveness of Ibuprofen,
      Acetaminophen, and Placebo on reducing injection pain and post-operative pain in primary
      tooth extraction, and to compare the parents' satisfaction.

      Design: This will be a blinded, randomized placebo-controlled trial including sixty six
      cooperative children, aged 6-8 years old.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background and Aims: The pain could be a problem for the patients during the first few hours
      after the extraction because of both soft and hard tissues trauma during the operation,
      despite that the local anesthesia will last for a long time in most of the cases.

      There are no enough studies that ensure the validity of giving any analgesic in reducing
      injection pain and post-operative pain in primary tooth extraction so far.

      Design: This will be a blinded, randomized placebo-controlled trial including sixty six
      cooperative children, aged 6-8 years old, randomly assigned to one of three groups to receive
      one of the oral suspension drugs, that have the same colour and taste, via pre-calibrated
      medication bottles, which are identical, numbered and containing the same amount of
      pre-calibrated dosages, as per the following portions:

        1. Acetaminophen syrup: 160mg/5ml

        2. Placebo solution

        3. Ibuprofen suspension: 100mg/5ml

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment pain related to the injection of the local anesthesia using WBFS.</measure>
    <time_frame>30-60 seconds after injection of the local anesthesia.</time_frame>
    <description>The Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale (WBFS) is a pain scale that shows a series of faces ranging from a happy face at 0, or &quot;no hurt&quot;, to a crying face at 10, which represents &quot;hurts like the worst pain imaginable&quot;. Based on the faces and written descriptions, the patient chooses the face that best describes their level of pain.
Immediately after the injection, the child will be asked to point to the face that fits the degree of pain on the self-reporting pain scale, WBFS.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Post operative pain assessment using WBFS.</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes - 6 hours after the extraction.</time_frame>
    <description>After 10minutes from the injection and immediately after the extraction, the child will be asked to point to the face that fits the degree of pain on the same scale.
Re-evaluate the pain after 15minutes from the extraction.
The scale will be given to the parents to evaluate the pain post-extraction after an hour to 6 hours while the child is at home.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluate the parents' satisfaction using Likert fifth scale.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 hours after extraction.</time_frame>
    <description>After the post-operation pain assessment is being done by the parents, the Likert fifth scale is used to determined the degree of parents satisfaction by choosing one of the following degrees: strongly agree, agree, neutral, disagree, strongly disagree.</description>

    <description>Patients will receive 320mg (10ml) Acetaminophen (Strawberry flavour), wait for 30 minutes after the administration, then they will be given the local anesthesia injection.

The tooth will be extracted 10 minutes after the injection, then the child will be asked to record the degree of pain on the same scale immediately after the extraction.
Pain will be re-evaluated 15 minutes after the extraction.
The scale will be given to the parents in order to evaluate the post-extraction pain in 1 to 6 hours while the child is at home.
