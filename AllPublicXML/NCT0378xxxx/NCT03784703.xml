  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) are at increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular
      disease (ACVD). The achievement of the LDL-C target with statins for the reduction of ACVD
      risk is recommended. However, the risk is still present. Therefore, we investigated the
      impact of high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), sortilin, adiponectin and leptin
      biomarkers that linking inflammatory hypothesis of diabetes mellitus and atherosclerosis in
      diabetic patients treated with rosuvastatin and atrovastatin. Methods: Based on exclusion
      criteria, ninety-five type 2 diabetic patients were eligible and randomly assigned to receive
      either 20 mg per day atorvastatin (ATROVA group, n= 40) or 20 mg per day rosuvastatin (ROSUVA
      group, n= 35) for three months and twenty patients (Non-statin group, n=20) not treated with
      statin and served as control.

      a prospective, open-label trial, conducted between January 2018 and August 2018. Participants
      were enrolled if they had moderate cardiovascular risk (Framingham risk score of 10-20%), in
      other words 2 or more major risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD), and
      LDL-cholesterol level ≥100 mg/dl. All patients gave informed consent before entering the
      study. Of seventy-five patients were randomly assigned to receive either 20 mg per day
      atorvastatin (Atrostat®, Delta Pharmaceutical Industries, Cairo, Egypt) tablets (ATROVA
      group, n= 40) or 20 mg per day Rosuvastatin (Rosuvastatin Calcium®, Chemipharm Co. Cairo,
      Egypt) tablets (ROSUVA group, n= 35) as recommended in NCEP ATP III (21). Twenty patients
      (Non-statin group, n=20), not treated with statin, were used for comparison. Patients
      included in the study were maintained on oral hypoglycemic agents (OHA) according to their
      treatment regimen. Clinical and biochemical assessment was done at baseline and after 12
      weeks. Serum High-sensitivity CRP (hsCRP), sortilin, Adiponectin and Leptin level was
      determined using ELISA Kit. Blood pressure (BP) and anthropometrical parameters, such as
      body-mass index (BMI) were calculated using the equation (BMI = weight (kg)/height (m2).
      Blood pressure was measured twice, after keeping participants in a sitting position for 15
      min. The mean value of two consecutive measurements with 5 min intervals was used for study
      purposes. HbA1c% was determined by ion exchange method. Serum triglycerides (TGs), total
      cholesterol (TCH), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) were determined
      colorimetrically. Low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) was calculated according to
      Friedewald formula. Serum Atherogenic Index (AI) is calculated through the following:
      Atherogenic Index = TCH/HDL-C as TCH/HDL-C ratio is an excellent CVD risk predictor and a
      good biomarker for deciding on the intensity and the need for therapeutic intervention.
