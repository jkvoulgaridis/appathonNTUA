  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of Thyroid Cancer (TC) has increased over the last thirty years, in France and
      worldwide. This increase is mainly due to good prognosis microPapillary TC (mPTC). Sixty
      percent of diagnosed cancers are considered as over-diagnosed, leading to an over-treatment
      of these cases. The increase of diagnosis of mPTC and its treatment inevitably leads to an
      increase of medical resources consumption and corresponding costs.

      The primary aim of this study is to estimate the cost related to different care management
      pathway of TC patient during a lifetime period using a multi-state Markov model.

      This is a retrospective, observational population based cohort study, using data from a
      cohort study of TC patients implemented by the ONCOMIP network which initially aimed to
      perform an audit of clinical practices for the management of TC, and from database of the
      French social health insurance of Midi-Pyrenees region to calculate observed costs of TC
      management during 24 months.
