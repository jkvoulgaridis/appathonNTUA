      This is a 5-visit, controlled, bilateral, randomized, subject-masked, crossover (4 treatments
      x 4 period), non-dispensing study. Subjects will attend all study visits in their spectacle
      correction having not worn contact lenses on the day of the visit.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Microsphere Clearance Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Post microsphere application over a 30 minute period</time_frame>
    <description>The rate of microsphere clearance from the post-lens tear film was assessed by the C30 image analysis metric. Where bare eye was assigned, a droplet of microsphere suspension was applied directly onto the superior temporal conjunctiva. Where lens wear was assigned, the microsphere suspension was dispensed onto the posterior concave contact lens surface immediately prior to lens application. A series of digital images were taken over a 30-minute period (every minute for the first 10 minutes and then every 5 minutes for the next 20 minutes). Data transformed from the images were calculated by the C30 image analysis metric. Higher numbers represented greater clearance. The right eye was used to evaluate microsphere clearance.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Microsphere Uptake Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Post microsphere application over a 10 minute period</time_frame>
    <description>The rate of microsphere uptake into the post-lens tear film was assessed by the U5 image analysis metric. Where bare eye was assigned, a droplet of microsphere suspension was applied directly onto the superior temporal conjunctiva. Where a lens was assigned the lens was applied and after a 10-minute settling period, a droplet of microsphere suspension was applied directly to the superior temporal conjunctiva. A series of digital images were taken over a 10-minute period (every minute for 10 minutes). Data transformed from the images were calculated by the U5 image analysis metric. Higher numbers represented greater uptake rate. The left eye was used to evaluate microsphere uptake.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Lens Movement</measure>
    <time_frame>Post microsphere application at 30-minute timepoint (OD); post microsphere application at 10-minute timepoint (OS)</time_frame>
    <description>Lens movement was assessed for primary gaze, up-gaze, and push up by clinical grading. Primary gaze movement was evaluated by observing the vertical movement of the contact lens that occurs with a full blink without manipulating the subject's lids. Up-gaze movement was assessed by estimating the vertical lens movement observed when the subject looks up and blinks fully without manipulating the subject's lids. The push-up test consists of a gentle digital push of the lens upwards using the lower lid. The resistance of the lens to of the lens to upward movement is judged. Lens movement was graded according to the following scale: Excessive (+2), Moderate movement (+1), Optimal (0), Minimal (-1), and Insufficient (-2). All available data for lens movement in the safety population were reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Corneal Curvature</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Corneal curvature was assessed by Visante™ OCT. The following were measured: Sclera Angle-Temporal and Sclera Angle-Nasal.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Corneal Curvature</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Corneal curvature was assessed by Visante™ OCT. Sagital Height was measured.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Blink Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and the 30-minute post microsphere application time point in the right eye and at the 10-minute post microsphere application timepoint in the left eye.</time_frame>
    <description>Blinking characteristics were captured using an infra-red camera (FLIR Grasshopper 3 camera) and infra-red LED illumination (Thorlabs LIU780A). During video capture the subject was directed to view a wildlife video on an Ipad at a working distance of approximately 1 meter. The infrared video was captured for 3 minutes at 500 frames per second. Subsequent video analysis recorded the blink rate (blinks per minute) over the 3-minute period. Baseline values were reported across all subjects who were dispensed a study lens. Blink rate post microsphere application was reported by treatment. All available data for blink rate in the safety population were reported.</description>

        <title>Microsphere Clearance Rate</title>
        <description>The rate of microsphere clearance from the post-lens tear film was assessed by the C30 image analysis metric. Where bare eye was assigned, a droplet of microsphere suspension was applied directly onto the superior temporal conjunctiva. Where lens wear was assigned, the microsphere suspension was dispensed onto the posterior concave contact lens surface immediately prior to lens application. A series of digital images were taken over a 30-minute period (every minute for the first 10 minutes and then every 5 minutes for the next 20 minutes). Data transformed from the images were calculated by the C30 image analysis metric. Higher numbers represented greater clearance. The right eye was used to evaluate microsphere clearance.</description>

        <title>Microsphere Uptake Rate</title>
        <description>The rate of microsphere uptake into the post-lens tear film was assessed by the U5 image analysis metric. Where bare eye was assigned, a droplet of microsphere suspension was applied directly onto the superior temporal conjunctiva. Where a lens was assigned the lens was applied and after a 10-minute settling period, a droplet of microsphere suspension was applied directly to the superior temporal conjunctiva. A series of digital images were taken over a 10-minute period (every minute for 10 minutes). Data transformed from the images were calculated by the U5 image analysis metric. Higher numbers represented greater uptake rate. The left eye was used to evaluate microsphere uptake.</description>

        <title>Lens Movement</title>
        <description>Lens movement was assessed for primary gaze, up-gaze, and push up by clinical grading. Primary gaze movement was evaluated by observing the vertical movement of the contact lens that occurs with a full blink without manipulating the subject's lids. Up-gaze movement was assessed by estimating the vertical lens movement observed when the subject looks up and blinks fully without manipulating the subject's lids. The push-up test consists of a gentle digital push of the lens upwards using the lower lid. The resistance of the lens to of the lens to upward movement is judged. Lens movement was graded according to the following scale: Excessive (+2), Moderate movement (+1), Optimal (0), Minimal (-1), and Insufficient (-2). All available data for lens movement in the safety population were reported.</description>

        <title>Blink Rate</title>
        <description>Blinking characteristics were captured using an infra-red camera (FLIR Grasshopper 3 camera) and infra-red LED illumination (Thorlabs LIU780A). During video capture the subject was directed to view a wildlife video on an Ipad at a working distance of approximately 1 meter. The infrared video was captured for 3 minutes at 500 frames per second. Subsequent video analysis recorded the blink rate (blinks per minute) over the 3-minute period. Baseline values were reported across all subjects who were dispensed a study lens. Blink rate post microsphere application was reported by treatment. All available data for blink rate in the safety population were reported.</description>
