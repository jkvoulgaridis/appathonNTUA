      Following the evidence from the controlled clinical trial setting on the significant clinical
      benefits of apremilast in the treatment of active PsA, there is a scarcity of real-life
      evidence on the effectiveness and the beneficial role of apremilast in PsA in routine
      clinical practice. The present study primarily aims to generate real-world evidence on the
      impact of apremilast treatment on a broad population of biologic-naïve PsA patients in terms
      of its clinical effectiveness across the wide spectrum of disease manifestations, as well as
      its impact on disease burden and HRQoL, in the routine primary care settings of Greece.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite tremendous progress achieved in psoriatic arthritis (PsA) over the past 15 years, its
      management remains challenging due to the clinical heterogeneity and multifaceted nature of
      the disease. Currently available recommended algorithms for PsA treatment guide clinicians
      through treatment choices, beginning with conventional synthetic DMARDs after failure of
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and local therapy for active disease,
      followed, if necessary, by a biological DMARD or a targeted synthetic (ts) DMARD. The latter
      novel category of DMARDs represents recent advances in the treatment options of PsA that aim
      to overcome the limitations of biological agents that stem by the fact that they have to be
      administered intravenously or subcutaneously, are very cost intensive for both the patients
      and the health system, while among them, the immunosuppressive biological agents are also
      associated with increased risks for infections and certain malignancies. The first approved
      tsDMARD for the treatment of PsA is apremilast which with an alternative mechanism of action,
      oral route of administration and favorable safety profile, presents a novel treatment option
      for PsA that may be appropriate for use early in the treatment algorithm.

      Although there is evidence from the controlled clinical trial setting on the significant
      clinical benefits of apremilast in the treatment of active PsA, and despite the increasing
      recognition of the value of real-world data as a complementary source to randomized clinical
      trials, there is a scarcity of real-life evidence on the effectiveness and the beneficial
      role of apremilast in PsA in routine clinical practice which is partially attributed to the
      relatively recent advent of apremilast in the market.

      In light of the above, the present study primarily aims to generate real-world evidence on
      the impact of apremilast treatment on a broad population of biologic-naïve PsA patients in
      terms of its clinical effectiveness across the wide spectrum of disease manifestations, as
      well as its impact on disease burden and HRQoL, in the routine primary care settings of
      Greece. This information alongside with collected evidence regarding drug utilisation and
      safety profile under real-world conditions will strengthen the current state of knowledge in
      regards to the optimal use of apremilast in this population.
