    <textblock>
      Predicting fluid responsiveness in critically ill patients is of paramount importance. It can
      help define an adequate fluid balance. Overzealous fluid administration is poorly tolerated
      and has been associated with poor outcomes but so has insufficient administration. Currently
      available predictors of fluid responsiveness rely on invasive monitors and require patients
      to be on mechanical ventilation. It is thus important to develop non invasive novel methods
      to assess fluid responsiveness to provide an accurate management for a favorable outcome. We
      propose a readily available non-invasive method that relies on improvement of the ventilation
      perfusion mismatch as recorded by end tidal CO2.

      Ventilation of physiologic dead space is part of a spectrum of mismatch between ventilation
      and perfusion of the lungs. The extent of pulmonary dead space varies depending on factors
      affecting pulmonary perfusion (e.g. pulmonary capillary hydrostatic pressure) and alveolar
      pressure (e.g. positive pressure ventilation). Compromised pulmonary capillary perfusion can
      lead to ventilation-perfusion mismatch in a patient with clear conductive airway and adequate
      alveolar oxygen pressure. Alveolar dead space results in decreased CO2 exchange that
      translates into lower levels of expired CO2.

      Stroke volume of the right ventricle is a major determinant of the pulmonary capillary
      perfusion. Right ventricular cardiac output can be increased by passive lower limb elevation
      maneuver, which ultimately results in improvement of the ventilation to perfusion ratio. This
      effect leads to a higher participation of perfused (and ventilated) alveolar units in gas
      exchange and narrowing of the gradient between arterial and expired CO2 concentration.
      Performing a passive leg raising (PLR) maneuver leads to stroke volume enhancement in both
      healthy patients and in those experiencing hemodynamic instability. Responsiveness to PLR can
      be assessed by different methods including echocardiography and pulse pressure variation.
      Left ventricular cardiac output (LVCO) can be easily measured by transthoracic echo and be
      used as a surrogate of right ventricular preload changes. LVCO can thus be used to assess the
      fluid responsiveness of PLR and the effects of on end tidal CO2 that ensue.

      We propose this study to test the hypothesis that expired CO2 is a reliable predictor of
      fluid responsiveness after performance of the PLR maneuver, based on the assumption that
      increasing right ventricular output causes a reduction of the ventilation to perfusion ratio,
      leading to increased levels of expired CO2. T
