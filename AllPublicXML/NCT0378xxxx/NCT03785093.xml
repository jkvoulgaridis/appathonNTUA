  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is growing evidence that microbial programming beginning in-utero can be a central
      component for a balanced development of innate immunity and optimal growth and development in
      newborns. However, the specific types of bacteria along with their cross-talk with maternal
      and fetal host factors are far from being clear. The investigators hypothesize microbial
      compositions at different body sites of pregnant women are associated with early-life
      microbiota of their offspring as well as growth, neurodevelopment and the development of
      allergic and neurocognitive disorders. This is a prospective birth cohort study involving
      Chinese mother-child pairs. The investigators will follow up 120 pregnant women from first
      trimester until childbirth, and the child until three years of age.
