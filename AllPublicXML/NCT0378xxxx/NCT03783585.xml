  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Forty individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS) will be randomly assigned to a 6-week
      web-based cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia intervention (wCBT-I) or to wCBT-I plus
      biweekly support meetings with research personnel via phone or video. Questionnaires will be
      used to assess sleep quality, fatigue, and satisfaction. Recruitment, retention, attrition,
      adherence, and safety information will also be collected. This study is significant because
      addressing insomnia symptoms through CBT-I could be a low-cost, low-risk, non-pharmacological
      options for improving sleep quality and MS symptoms in individuals with MS. This study is
      innovative because CBT-I has never been delivered via a web-based application to individuals
      with MS which may increase access to services.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>change in Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The ISI is a valid and reliable measure of sleep difficulties and consists of 7 questions each rated on a 0-4 scale. The range of scores on the ISI is 0-28, with ≥10 suggesting clinical insomnia</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>change in Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The PSQI is a well-validated and reliable measure of sleep quality and consists of 9 items within 7 sleep categories. The 7 sleep category scores are summed to form a single global score ranging from 0-21. A global score of &gt;5 reflects poor sleep quality</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>change in Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The MFIS consists of 21 items with 3 subscales: physical, cognitive, and psychosocial. The score on the 21 items are scored with a range of 0-84 with a higher score indicating a greater impact of fatigue.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>change in Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) assesses the impact of fatigue on activities for the week prior and consists of 9 questions. The mean of the 9 scores is calculated with a range of 0-7.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>change in Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and week 8</time_frame>
    <description>MSIS-29 is total of 29 items scale, with subscales of physical (20 items) and psychological (9 items). Responses computed in a range from 0-100, and higher scores indicating a worse quality of life due to physical and physiological impacts of MS.</description>
