  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis (DLSS) is a condition which there is narrowing space of
      sagittal diameter of spinal canal or nerve root canal for spinal nerve or cauda equina
      secondary to degenerative changes. DLSS is a common cause of gluteal or lower extremity pain,
      women and elderly people aged 60-70 are more likely to have DLSS. The early symptoms of this
      disease are soreness and pain in the low back, gluteal region and posterior region of thighs
      which can be relieved after resting or changing posture. Being accompanied with gradually
      aggravated symptoms, patients with DLSS may have neurogenic claudication with hypoesthesia
      and numbness in lateral lower legs and feet, additionally, few patients may have bowel and
      bladder disturbances. In accordance of the guidelines of North American Spine Society (NASS),
      treatment options comprise surgical therapy, epidural steroid injections and physical therapy
      and transcutaneous electrical stimulation, however, the long-term efficacy of surgery is not
      superior to that of non-surgical therapy. Moreover, the short-term efficacy of non-surgical
      therapy is with insufficient evidence. According to a systematic review and recent studies,
      acupuncture may improve the symptoms of patients and their quality of life, however, there is
      a lack of placebo-controlled and large sample sized study.

    <description>Modified Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) is a reliable pain-specific functional status questionnaire which is easy and simple for patients to complete. The RMDQ includes 24 questions with a score range of 0-24, and there is a phrase &quot;caused by low back pain&quot; after each question which could excluded other reasons for dysfunction of the back. For this scale, higher scores indicate more severe symptoms.</description>

    <time_frame>week 6</time_frame>
    <description>SSSQ is a short outcome measure for symptoms and functions. SSSQ consists of 18 questions and three domains including symptom severity, physical function and satisfaction with the degree of treatment. For all these three domains, scores for each domain is calculated by total score of this domain divide the number of answered questions, and if more than two items are missing, the scale scores for this domain are considered missing. Six questions in the symptom severity domain assess back, buttocks, legs or feet pain, pain frequency, numbness, weakness with scores ranging from 1 to 5 while one question assesses balance with scores ranging from 1, 3 and 5 and higher scores indicating worse symptoms.</description>
