    <textblock>
      The prognostic relevance of isolated non-ischemic LGE (i.e. with no underlying &quot;labelled&quot;
      cardiomyopathy) is unclear, and current guidelines to not state on the clearance of athlete
      with this type of findings as regards to competitive or intense sport practice.

      The principal objective of the study is to evaluate during a five-years follow up, the
      clinical outcome of athletes with this kind of findings. The secondary objective is the
      determination of prognostic factors. The management and follow-up of the athletes will be let
      at the appraisal of each center.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The presence of a scar, assessed by late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) on cardiac resonance
      imaging (CMR), is associated with a poor prognosis in patients with ischemic heart disease or
      cardiomyopathy. But the prognostic relevance of isolated non-ischemic LGE (i.e. with no
      underlying &quot;labelled&quot; cardiomyopathy) is unclear, and current guidelines do not state on the
      clearance of athlete with this type of findings as regards to competitive or intense sport
      practice.

      The objective of the study is to evaluate the clinical outcome of athletes with isolated
      non-ischemic LGE with no underlying &quot;labelled&quot; cardiomyopathy during a five-years follow-up.
      The secondary objective is the determination of prognostic factors based on the baseline
      inclusion data: indication of CMR (i.e. symptoms, abnormal ECG, presence and morphology of
      arrhythmias, abnormal echocardiography); localization and amount of LGE, left and right
      ventricular geometry and function, characteristics of sport practice (amount, type,
      competition).

      The management of the athletes will be let at the appraisal of each centre, as regards to the
      initial assessment, the follow-up and the medical clearance for competitive sports
      participation. Nevertheless, due to the absence of consensus, we propose that the patient
      should at least undergo clinical examination, ECG, echocardiography, cardiopulmonary exercise
      test (CPET) and holter ECG each year. A CMR should be performed at one and five years.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Any athlete, aged of more than 15 years, symptomatic or not,

          -  in whom non-ischemic LGE with no underlying &quot;labelled&quot; cardiomyopathy is detected on
             CMR. Scare of an acute myocarditis will also be included.

        Athletes will be defined by a practice of ≥4 hours/week of sport activity and/or
        competitive sport activity at the time of the assessment which triggered the realization of
        the 1st CMR.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Athletes with any unequivocal cardiac disease that might explain the LGE (i.e.
             hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, ischemic cardiac disease). In case of borderline or
             doubtful diagnosis the athlete can still be included (for example an athlete with a
             dilated LV and borderline function, or with borderline wall thickness).

          -  Patients who refuse their participation in the study.

          -  Patients under legal protection or deprived of their liberty.
