  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the project is to study neonatal immune dysfunction associated to the risk of
      newborn sepsis in a malaria endemic area in Benin.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The fetal immunological responses maturate gradually during the last 3 months of pregnancy.
      To respond to pathogens, newborns depend essentially on their innate immune system. Premature
      babies have a significant impairment of innate and immune regulatory functions, thus
      promoting neonatal sepsis. In addition, chronic infections during pregnancy, including those
      of parasitic origin, fetal immunity. In utero exposure to P. falciparum antigens impacts
      particularly the newborn immune development and is a risk factor predisposing to malaria and
      also to other infections during the first year of life.

      The major objectives are to assess:

        -  The relevance of a host biomarker driven diagnostic of sepsis in newborns,

        -  The relevance of immune markers as indicators of sepsis incidence, secondary infections
           occurrence, and mortality

        -  The role of novel diagnostic techniques (FilmArray panels) as part of the
           microbiological diagnostic,

        -  The immunological profile of the infants in the 3 first months of life.

      The targeted population is newborns with a high risk to develop sepsis recruited at delivery
      compared to a control infant population with a low infection risk.

        Inclusion Criteria for the sepsis risk group (400 infants):

          -  Child born from mothers having one of the following criteria before delivery will be
             included in this study:

               -  Spontaneous preterm delivery (&lt;37 weeks of gestation time)

               -  Foul smelling / with meconium / colored / bloody amniotic liquid

               -  Rupture of membranes &gt; 18 hours

               -  Maternal fever at delivery

               -  Vaginal infection

          -  Child born at the maternity of CNHU (Centre National Hospitalier et Universitaire,
             Cotonou, Benin) or CHUMEL (Centre Hospitalier et Universitaire de la Mère et de
             l'Enfant Lagune, Cotonou, Benin) or HZAC (Hopital de zone d' Abomey-Calavi, Benin).

          -  Mother located near Abomey-Calavi. This criterion has been included to limit the
             follow-up expenses and spare the travel to the project staff in charge of the 3 month
             follow-up.

        Inclusion Criteria for the control group (170 infants):

        - Child born from mothers enrolled in the RECIPAL study (Pregnancy-associated malaria and
        Intrauterine growth restriction in Benin)

        Exclusion Criteria for both groups:

          -  HIV + status or unknown HIV status of the mother (as the mother and child will be part
             of the national program to take care of mother and child HIV+ at delivery)
