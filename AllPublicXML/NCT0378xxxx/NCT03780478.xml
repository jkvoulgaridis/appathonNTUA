    <textblock>
      Addiction is an inherent risk when prescribing opiates for pain relief, and methods to reduce
      its use or amount prescribed can help mitigate this risk for addiction. Patients undergoing
      rhinoplasty are often prescribed a short course of opiates during the acute post surgical
      phase. Studies have shown intraoperative sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG) nerve block in
      endoscopic sinus surgery can reduce post operative narcotic use. The purpose of this study is
      to determine if use of SPG block can be used to reduce narcotic use in the acute post
      operative phase of rhinoplasty/septoplasty.

    <textblock>
      With the current opioid epidemic, more than 40,000 deaths can be attributed to prescription
      and illicit opioid use per year. There is inherent risk for patients to develop addiction
      when prescribing opiates for pain relief, and methods to reduce its use or the amount
      prescribed can help mitigate this risk.

      Surgery is one of the leading causes for prescribing narcotics to control pain. Patients
      undergoing rhinoplasty are often prescribed a short course of opiates during the acute post
      surgical phase. Intraoperative sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG) block has been successfully and
      safely used in endoscopic sinus surgery, and has been shown to decrease narcotic use and
      inpatient hospital stay time.

      The investigators are interested in determining if use of SPG block may offer an improved
      strategy to reducing the use of narcotics for post rhinoplasty/septoplasty pain relief. The
      investigators hypothesize that SPG block will reduce the amount of post operative opiates
      required for pain control.

      The study population will include patients undergoing rhinoplasty/septoplasty at Keck Medical
      Center of USC who are able to provide consent. The study will include two arms: SPG block
      (experimental) and placebo saline injection (control). Patients' post operative pain scale
      and narcotic use will be recorded until first follow-up visit (2 weeks). Patient
      demographics, surgical indication, and intraoperative analgesia will be recorded. T-tests
      will be conducted between patient groups. ANOVA will be used to analyze other factors that
      may be associated with decreased narcotic use.
