    <textblock>
      This study is a retrospective comparative evaluation of six main periodontal pathogens and
      total bacterial load in chronic periodontitis patients affected or not by type 2 diabetes
      mellitus by polymerase chain reaction analysis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to compare prevalence and bacterial load of six main periodontal
      pathogens among chronic periodontitis patients with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus.
      Porphyromonas gingivalis and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans genotypes were also
      investigated.

      The recruitment for the study sample was performed analysing the medical records of adult
      patients with chronic periodontitis visited between 2010 and 2016. Eligible patients were
      subdivided in two balanced groups on the basis of the presence or absence of type 2 diabetes
      mellitus at the time of the microbiological test.

      For each subject, the following data have been collected: age, gender, smoking habits, type
      of metabolic control of diabetes, duration of diabetes, number of missing teeth.

      For each subject, four periodontal sites were studied. Probing pocket depth, sites with
      bleeding on probing, sites with suppuration and microbiological data were evaluated.

      An individual matching on the basis of severity and extension of periodontitis was performed
      by pairing a diabetic patient with another non-diabetic one with the same degree of severity
      and extension of the periodontal disease.

      Microbiological data of subgingival biofilm were analysed and compared for the examined
      pathogens: Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella
      intermedia, Treponema denticola, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Tannerella forsythia.

      Differences in genotypes of Porphyromonas gingivalis and Aggregatibacter
      actinomycetemcomitans among diabetic and non-diabetic patients were also evaluated.
