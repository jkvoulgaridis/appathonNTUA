  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with primary hip osteoarthritis (OA group) and patients with inflammatory hip
      disease (RA group) and healthy subjects (control group) are enrolled in the study. The aim of
      our study is to determine the postural control in patients suffering from OA and RA of the
      hip joint during different conditions, i.e., on both stable and compliant surfaces with
      opened or closed eyes to determine the possible differences between these two diseases in
      this respect.

      Determination of functional status, using the following outcome measures: Harris Hip Score,
      the Functional status of the hip joint is rated with the Harris Hip Score (HHS), Visual
      Analogue Scale, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index, Timed Up &amp; Go
      test.

      Posturography measurements, Postural control tests

      The Clinical Test of Sensory Interaction on Balance (CTSIB) uses different conditions to test
      how people adapt to changing sensory conditions during the maintenance of stance. We used the
      modified CTSIB by NeuroCom to perform the test on a computerized force plate to measure the
      body sway. Static postural stability [displacement of Centre of Pressure (CoP)] was measured
      during standing on a single force platform (Stabilometer, ZWE-PII) for 20-s periods in a
      quiet room. Signals were amplified and sampled at 16 Hz via an analogue-to-digital converter.
      Subjects stood barefoot on the platform, with the feet positioned side by side and arms
      hanging freely at their side. Toe-out was positioned to subjects' comfort. The CoP excursions
      along antero-posterior (AP) and medio-lateral (ML) axes were performed both on firm (the
      stable surface of the platform) and foam surfaces [an Airex Balance Pad (dimensions: 50 cm
      length x 41 cm width x 6 cm height) placed on the platform], always starting with standing on
      the stable surface. In each condition, subjects had to stand first with the eyes open (EO),
      when subjects had to look at a target fixed at eye level at a distance of approximately 1 m,
      and then measurements were also performed with closed eyes (EC).

    <description>The score has a maximum at 100 points (best possible function), covering pain (part I, 1 item, 0-44 points), function and activities (part II, 7 items, 0-47 points) and range of motion and absence of deformity (part III, 3 items, 0-9 points).

    <measure>Visual Analogue Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>Hip pain (average pain on movement over the previous 72 hours) is assessed by using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) (the range of the scale: 0-100 mm; where the subjects subjectively judge the actual level of pain between the minimum and maximum range. The meaning of the end-points: minimum: no pain- maximum: unbearable pain). The lower values represent better outcome.</description>

    <measure>Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) is used to assess pain (WOMAC A, 5 items), joint stiffness (WOMAC B, 2 items) and disability (WOMAC C, 17 items) by using visual analogue scales. Lower scores indicated less pain, less stiffness or less disability.</description>

    <measure>Timed Up &amp; Go test</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>To assess the functional mobility of the subjects, we applied the Timed Up &amp; Go (TUG) test. During the testing procedure, subjects were timed (recorded in seconds) for standing up from a chair (45 cm), walking 3 m, passing around an object and then returning to sitting position in the chair. The subjects were instructed to walk as quickly as possible but not to run. The subjects had three trials with 1 min pause between each trial; the trials were recorded in seconds.</description>
