  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of offering early antiretroviral therapy
      to HIV-positive individuals in government-managed health facilities in Swaziland on a range
      of economic outcomes

    <textblock>
      The MaxART study is a three-year stepped-wedge randomized trial with open enrollment for all
      adults 18 years and older across 14 rural health facilities in Swaziland's Hhohho Region. The
      main trial registration is accessible at:
      https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT02909218.

      This registration is specific to the economic evaluation of the MaxART study which aims to
      quantify the causal impacts of early ART initiation (compared to national standard care) on a
      range of key economic outcomes, including healthcare expenditures, productivity, and
      household wealth.
