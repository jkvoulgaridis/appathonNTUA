  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Problems with sexual function are common and distressing. The most frequent sexual difficulty
      in women is a lack of sexual desire with a prevalence of 20-30%. When low sexual desire is
      experienced over several months and causes significant personal distress, a sexual
      dysfunction can be diagnosed (ICD-10: Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder: HSDD). A distressing
      lack of desire is reported by 6% of sexually active women. Psychological interventions are
      the treatment of choice for women with HSDD. Promising treatment approaches include
      cognitive-behavioral and mindfulness-based interventions. A recent meta-analysis also showed
      that Internet-delivered programs are a valid alternative to face-to-face treatments. Aim of
      this project to assess the effectivity of two eight-week online-programs consisting of
      cognitive-behavioral (COPE) and mindfulness-based (MIND) interventions for women with HSDD.
      Both treatments will be compared to a waitlist-control group. For this project, two
      well-established group-treatment manuals will be translated into German and adapted to a
      multimedia online-environment. All participants will be guided through the programs by
      well-qualified eCoaches.
