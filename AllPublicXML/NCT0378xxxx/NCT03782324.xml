  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Central venous catheters are common in modern health care and are being increasingly used in
      both intensive care units and general wards. The primary aim of this study is to determine
      the incidence of mechanical complications within 24 hours after central venous
      catheterisation. The secondary aim is to identify risk factors associated with mechanical
      complications within 24 hours after catheterisation.

    <textblock>
      Central venous catheters provide reliable access to the bloodstream, which allows delivery of
      medications and nutritional support that cannot be given safely through peripheral venous
      catheters.

      Mechanical complications of central venous catheterisation include bleeding (such as hematoma
      and hemothorax), cardiac arrhythmia, arterial puncture, arterial catheterisation, nerve
      injury, pneumothorax, failed catheterisation and catheter tip malposition. The most common
      mechanical complications are arterial puncture, hematoma formation and pneumothorax. The
      number of mechanical complications related to central venous catheterisation varies widely in
      previous studies with incidences between 1.1 and 34 %. Ultrasound guidance reduces the
      incidence of mechanical complications, but despite evidence demonstrating improved safety,
      real-time ultrasound guidance is still not routinely used by all physicians when obtaining
      central venous access.

      Four hospitals in Region Skåne, Sweden, will participate in this study: one university
      hospital with approximately 1300 beds and three county hospitals with about 200 beds each.
      All central venous catheter insertions at the participating hospitals during the study period
      will be included in the study.

      The primary aim of this prospective, controlled, observational study is to determine the
      incidence of mechanical complications within 24 hours after central venous catheterisation.
      The secondary aim is to identify independent risk factors of mechanical complications within
      24 hours after insertion of central venous catheters.
