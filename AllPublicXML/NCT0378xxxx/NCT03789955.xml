      The aim of the present study is to compare contralateral oblique view with the lateral view
      for fluoroscopic guided mid-thoracic epidural assess.

    <textblock>
      A thoracic epidural assess (block or catheter insertion) is a widely used intervention to
      reduce pain in patients with postherpetic neuralgia or who underwent chest and upper
      abdominal surgery.

      In order to achieve the correct procedure, accurate access to the thoracic epidural space is
      needed. However, a thoracic epidural assess is a relatively more difficult procedure than
      procedures used in other regions, because the spinous process of the thoracic vertebra is
      longer than that of the lumbar vertebra, and the area through which the needle can approach
      the epidural space is relatively smaller due to an acute angle and larger distance between
      the skin and the epidural space. The midthoracic region (T4-8) is the most difficult area
      when performing this procedure.

      To overcome this issue, a method of approaching the thoracic epidural space through the
      contralateral oblique view (CLO view) has been introduced, however, unlike the cervical or
      lumbar spine, advantages of the CLO view over the lateral view or the optimal angle of the
      CLO view have not yet been studied. Therefore, we planned this study to investigate the
      advantages of the CLO view compared with the lateral view and to determine the optimal angles
      of the CLO view when fluoroscopic guided mid-thoracic epidural assess.

    <description>After assessment of the epidural space using the loss of resistance technique with air under fluoroscopic guidance, six fluoroscopic views will be obtained: true anteroposterior, contralateral oblique (CLO) at 40 degrees, 50 degrees, 60 degrees, CLO measured, and lateral for comparison CLO view with lateral view.</description>

    <description>When performing a fluoroscopic-guided thoracic epidural block (TEB), an 18-gauge Tuohy needle will be used for interlaminar epidural access. If the epidural space was accessed under fluoroscopic guidance and using the loss of resistance technique with air. All procedures will be performed with a paramedian approach under the true AP and lateral view at first, If the interlaminar space is not visible, the CLO view will be used. If the needle is deemed to be in the epidural space when the loss occurred, six fluoroscopic views will be obtained: true AP, CLO at 40 degrees, 50 degrees, 60 degrees, CLO measured, and lateral. The CLO measured angle will be determined by measuring the angle between the superior lamina and spinous process on the midsagittal plane on thoracic MRI or CT.</description>
