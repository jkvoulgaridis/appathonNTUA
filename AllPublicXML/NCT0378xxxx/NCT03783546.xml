  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is evaluating acupuncture, a medical therapy in which hair-thin,
      stainless steel needles are shallowly inserted into specific points to help the body's
      natural healing process, as a possible treatment to reduce hot flashes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hot flashes are a sensation of sudden onset of body warmth, flushing and sweating. Hot
      flashes are common side effects of breast cancer treatments and can affect mood and daily
      life. Medications can help ease hot flashes, but many patients continue to experience
      symptoms despite these treatments.

      Acupuncture is a complementary therapy in which, hair-thin, sterile disposable needles are
      inserted into various spots on the skin, with the goal of affecting body's natural healing
      system. Acupuncture has been tested in clinical trials in cancer patients and has been shown
      to be helpful in treating a number of side effects of cancer treatment, such as nausea and
      vomiting from chemotherapy. A few early studies have suggested that acupuncture may help to
      lessen hot flashes, but more information is needed about the benefits of acupuncture in
      breast cancer patients.

      This study is being done to test whether acupuncture can help to reduce the number and
      intensity of hot flashes in breast cancer patients who are being treated with mediations such
      as tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors, such as anastrozole (Arimidex), exemestane (Aromasin),
      and letrozole (Femara).
