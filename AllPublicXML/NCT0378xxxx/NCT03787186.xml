  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The sponsor wants to investigate how well the test medicine is taken up by the body when
      given orally (by mouth) as a tablet or capsule and as a solution for infusion (into a vein).
      The capsule and the solution will be radiolabelled. 'Radiolabelled' means that the test
      medicine has a radioactive component which helps us to track where the test medicine is in
      the body.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Able and willing to comply with the clinical study protocol (CSP) requirements and
             sign the informed consent form (ICF) as approved by the Independent Ethics Committee
             (IEC), before any screening evaluations.

          -  Male subjects between 30 to 64 years of age (extremes included), on the date of
             signing the ICF.

          -  Judged to be in good health by the investigator based upon the results of a medical
             history, physical examination, vital signs, 12-lead ECG, and fasting clinical

             3 months before first investigational medicinal product (IMP) administration.

          -  Having a regular and (at least) daily defecation pattern.

          -  Able and willing to comply with restrictions on prior and concomitant medication as

             study.

          -  History of malignancy within the past 5 years (except for basal cell carcinoma of the
             skin that has been treated and with no evidence of recurrence).

          -  Hemoglobin level below the lower limit of normal (LLN; 13.0 g/dL). Retesting is
             allowed once.

          -  Significant blood loss (including blood donation [&gt;450 mL]) or transfusion of any
             blood product within 12 weeks before screening.

          -  Active drug abuse (per investigator judgment) or alcohol abuse (more than three
             glasses of wine, beer, or equivalent/day) within 3 months before first IMP
             administration.

          -  Concurrent participation or participation in a drug, drug/device or biologic
             investigational research study within 12 weeks or 5 half-lives of the drug, whichever
             is longer, before first IMP administration.

          -  Radiation exposure, including that from the present study, excluding background
             radiation but including diagnostic Xrays and other medical exposures, exceeding 5
             millisievert (mSv) in the last 12 months or 10 mSv in the last 5 years. No
             occupationally exposed worker, as defined in the Ionising Radiation Regulations 1999,
             can participate in the study.
