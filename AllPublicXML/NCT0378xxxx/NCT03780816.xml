  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a qualitative study of local organizational and provider practice norms, and how
      these norms influence patient and family expectations and provider decision-making heuristics
      for minority patients with advanced cancer at major US cancer centers. Outpatient visits with
      oncologists will be observed and documented via hand-written field notes. Semi-structured
      interviews with selected participating clinicians, patients, caregivers, and other informants
      will follow the initial observation.

      The purpose of this study is to identify organizational and provider practice norms at major
      US cancer centers, and how these norms influence patient and family expectations and provider
      decision-making heuristics for later-line chemotherapy, hospice, and ICU admission among
      minority patients with advanced cancer. Norms are rules about which there is at least some
      degree of consensus, enforced through social sanctions. Heuristics are unconscious judgments
      or rules of thumb.The study team will collect direct observation data from outpatient clinic
      visits, and semi-structured interview data from selected participating providers, patients,
      caregivers, and other informants following the initial observation.

      The study team will perform 2-week, qualitative case studies of 6 theoretically sampled
      National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and NCI Comprehensive Cancer Centers. Oncology
      practice managers' nominations of providers with particular cancer focuses, high volumes, and
      high peer influence will be used to sample oncologic clinicians to shadow in outpatient
      clinic settings. Observations will be hand-written during the clinic visit, and later
      dictated and transcribed. Observed providers will be invited to be interviewed. Select
      patients and caregivers will also be invited to be interviewed following initial clinic
      observation. Other informants will be invited to be interviewed on an ad hoc basis. All
      interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed, and interviews will be semi-structured to
      allow for natural flow of conversation. Observations and interviews will all be done by the
      study PI, project coordinator, and/or another research team member.

      Clinical observations and semi-structured interviews will assess the following outcomes: 1)
      formal and informal organizational norms influencing provider decision-making, 2) provider
      decision-making heuristics, and 3) patient and caregiver expectations. All outcomes will be
      assessed regarding receipt of chemotherapy in the last 14 days of life, intensive care unit
      (ICU) admission in the last 30 days of life, and non or late hospice referral.

        Hospital-based providers who are on service during the 2-week site visit will be observed.
        Outpatient oncology providers who meet inclusion criteria and are nominated by their
        oncology practice managers will also be observed. If providers do not opt out after being
        introduced to the study by cancer center leadership, providers will be contacted directly
        for recruitment. A sub-sample of observed providers will be invited to participate in
        semi-structured interviews.

        Additionally, a sub-sample of all patients (and their caregivers) cared for by the shadowed
        provider who meet inclusion criteria will be invited to participate in semi-structured
        interviews. Recruitment will seek equal numbers of minority and non-minority participants.

        Selected other informants - such as personnel involved in developing and enforcing
        organizational policies, procedures, and practices, including allocation of resources, will
        also be invited to participate in semi-structured interviews.
