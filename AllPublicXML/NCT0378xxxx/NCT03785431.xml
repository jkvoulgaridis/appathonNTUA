      Study procedure

      Screening procedure

      All patient who are admitted to the study site will be evaluated based on this protocol with
      intention for study inclusion (patient screening). All patients with STEMI will be considered
      as potentially eligible candidates. Before being approach with patient informed consent
      (PIC), the member of study team will explain all the risks and benefits associated with the
      procedure and allow enough time to the patient for asking any questions that might represent
      his/her concerns. The patient must sign the consent prior to enrollment; failure to do so is
      a subject for ineligibility. After PIC is acquired, the patient will receive a unique
      screening number consisting of three digits (i.e. 001).

      The initial evaluation comprises of the following elements:

        -  History of symptoms directly leading to the diagnosis

        -  Cardiac physical examination

        -  12-lead ECG

        -  Coronary angiogram.

      Thereafter, all inclusion and exclusion criteria will be rechecked. If not all inclusion
      criteria are met, or there are at least one-exclusion criteria present the patient will be
      considered as screening failure.

      Patient allocation

      All patient who meet all eligibility criteria after pre-dilatation will be allocated in the
      study and have a Fantom BVS implanted.

      Medications

      Pre-treatment

      The pretreatment with aspirin, P2Y12 inhibitor and heparin is allowed as per local practice.
      In case the patient did not receive all of the above-mentioned drugs, those will be
      administered in latest just after coronary angiogram. The desired doses are: aspirin of 300
      mg p.o., P2Y12 inhibitor according to the agent (600 mg of clopidogrel or 60 mg of prasugrel
      or 180 mg of ticagrelor), and unfractionated heparin of 70-100 units per kg (or 50-60 units
      per kg, if IIb/IIIa inhibitor if co-administered).

      Peri-procedural

      If no anticoagulant was administered in the pre-hospital setting an intravenous agent should
      be given in the cathlab (preferably UFH). If UFH is used, the anticoagulation should be
      monitored according to the activated clotting time &gt; 250 second (200-250 seconds if GP
      IIb/IIIa inhibitor is being administered). The GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors may be administered at
      operator discretion. Before final angiographic projections, the nitroglycerin should be
      administered i.c.

      Post-procedural

      After the procedure patients should be treated according to the European Society of
      Cardiology Guidelines for the management of acute myocardial infarction in patients
      presenting with ST-segment elevation. Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) must me maintained for
      consecutive 12-months after revascularization comprising of low dose aspirin (75-100 mg
      daily) and a maintenance dose of P2Y12 inhibitor (clopidogrel 75 mg daily, prasugrel 10 mg
      daily, ticagrelor 90 mg bid). In patients with an indication to long-term anticoagulation the
      length of DAPT should be adjusted according to individual risk factors.

      All patients should receive optimal medical therapy consisting of high dose statins,
      additionally in those with low ejection fraction beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme
      inhibitors, and aldosterone antagonists should be considered if not contraindicated.

    <description>Once baseline angiography is performed and all eligibility criteria are met, the patient is included in the study. The target lesion should be crossed with a standard coronary guidewire. Next, the NIRS/IVUS and OCT probe is inserted and a pullback is being performed to evaluate the lesion and vessel morphology. The predilatation with 1:1 non-compliant or semi-compliant balloon is mandatory. Thereafter the scaffold should be inserted and position across the target lesion. Lesions up to 14 mm should be covered with the 18 mm device, for lesions of 15-20 mm a 24 mm device should be used. The scaffold will be deployed with intent to achieve the inner diameter to the reference vessel ration of 1:1 using a single inflation. Post-dilatation using a non-compliant balloon should be performed to achieve complete scaffold apposition and reduce the residual angiographic stenosis below 20%. The final NIRS/IVUS and OCT of the target vessel should be performed.</description>
