  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>changes in personal and social performance (PSP) scores at week 26</measure>
    <time_frame>26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>PSP consists of four main areas: 1. Socially useful activities (e.g., housework, voluntary work) including work and study; 2. Personal and social relationships (i.e., partner, family relationships, friends); 3. Self-care (i.e., personal hygiene, care of one's appearance); 4. Disturbing and aggressive behavior. The maximum scores is 100, the minimum scores is 1, higher values represent a better outcome</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>changes in MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) domain scores at week 26 in treatment group</measure>
    <time_frame>26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) includes 10 tests that measure seven cognitive domains: speed of processing, attention/vigilance, working memory, verbal learning, visual learning, reasoning and problem solving and social cognition. Scores for the individual tests will be calculated according to the developer's recommended scoring algorithms</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>changes in Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task (PASAT) test at week 26 in treatment group</measure>
    <time_frame>26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>PASAT is a neuropsychological test used to assess capacity and rate of information processing and sustained and divided attention</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>changes in Groove Pegboard Test (GPT) at week 26 in treatment group</measure>
    <time_frame>26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>GPT is a test used to assess fine motor skills and speed. this test measure the time it takes to put 25 nails in the pegborad in a defined order</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>changes in positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS) total scores at week 26 in treatment group</measure>
    <time_frame>26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>PANSS is a medical scale used for measuring symptom severity of patients with schizophrenia. the maximum scores is 210, the minimum scores is 30. the higher values represent a worse outcome. the total scores are the sum of subscales.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>changes in PANSS five-factor model scores at week 26 in treatment group</measure>
    <time_frame>26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>five-factor model is another model of PANSS. It is a medical scale used for measuring symptom severity of patients with schizophrenia. the maximum scores is 210, the minimum scores is 30. the higher values represent a worse outcome. the total scores are the sum of subscales.</description>

    <measure>changes in serum Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) at week 26 in treatment group</measure>
    <time_frame>26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>BDNF, is a protein that, in humans, is encoded by the BDNF gene. BDNF is a member of the neurotrophin family of growth factors, which are related to the canonical nerve growth factor. Neurotrophic factors are found in the brain and the periphery</description>
