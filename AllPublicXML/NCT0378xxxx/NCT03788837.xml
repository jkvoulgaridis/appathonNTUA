  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Septic shock remains a major cause of death in critically ill patients. Alterations in
      microcirculation have long been proposed as a key pathophysiological factor of organ
      dysfunction and death in septic shock patients. Persistence of mottling, prolonged skin
      recoloration time and cyanosis of the extremities are the easily and frequently observed
      manifestations of these microcirculatory disorders. Ilomedin is a prostaglandin analog with a
      potent vasodilatory effect together with anti-thrombotic properties (inhibition of platelet
      aggregation) preferentially at the microcirculatory level. An increase in cardiac output with
      increased arterial oxygen delivery has been observed in clinical and preclinical studies with
      no episodes of hypotension. Improvement in mesenteric perfusion has moreover been observed in
      experimental sepsis using Ilomedin. Our group has furthermore reported that administration of
      Ilomedin in patients with refractory septic shock (peripheral hypoperfusion) resulted in a
      rapid and sustained improvement in peripheral perfusion. Altogether, Ilomedin may prevent or
      improve recovery of organ dysfunction in septic shock patients through recruitment of the
      microcirculation and, thereby, ultimately improve outcome.

      In the 25 participating centers: patients with septic shock and persistent peripheral
      hypoperfusion despite hemodynamic optimization (skin mottling and/or finger skin recoloration
      time &gt; 3sec, and/or knee skin recoloration time &gt; 4sec), after 6 to 24 hours of
      norepinephrine onset will be eligible for randomization.

      Patients fulfilling the eligibility criteria will be included and randomized by the
      intensivist in two groups:

      *Experimental group: The patient will receive treatment with intravenous Ilomedin (blinded)
      therapy at a dose of 0.5 ng/kg/min with increments of 0.5 ng/kg/min every 30 minutes up to a
      maximum posology of 1.5ng/kg/min for 48h.

      Placebo group: The patient will receive treatment with intravenous NaCl 0.9% (placebo-double
      blinded) with increments of infusion rate every 30 minutes for 48h.

      Primary outcome will be Delta Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score between
      infusion onset and day 7.

      *within the 12 first hours after randomization : blood samples : 15 ml of blood will be
      collected at the same time as the sample routinely collected, within the 12 first hours after
      randomization in ICU, when the patients are perfused.

      The blood will be drawn and worked as follows:

        -  2 x EDTA tubes of 5 ml : After centrifugation each tube will be directly divided into 4
           aliquots of 500 µL (8 aliquots per patient)

        -  1 x aprotinine tube of 5 ml : After centrifugation, it will be directly divided into 4
           aliquots of 500 µL

      The aliquots previously will be stored locally, and will be transported to the &quot;Centre de
      Ressources Biologiques&quot; (CRB) of the Lariboisière Hospital.
