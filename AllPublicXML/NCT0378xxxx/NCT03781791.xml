  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted as a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      study. Approximately 72 patients will be randomized 3:1 to treatment or placebo, with
      approximately 54 patients allocated to receive the active investigational product and
      approximately 18 patients allocated to receive placebo.

      - Study Update-

      Amendment 3 - In this amendment, an additional 80 patients (approximately) will be randomized
      1:1 to treatment or placebo (double-blind) with approximately 40 subjects allocated to each
      group.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted on an out-patient basis. Each patient will have 6 visits to the
      clinic: a screening visit, a randomization visit, 3 follow up visits, and 1 end of study
      visit.

      Patient randomization will be stratified based upon the baseline weekly complete spontaneous
      bowel movement rate (CSBM) established during the screening period. Patients will be allowed
      to adjust their dosing, based upon protocol specifications. Rescue medications will be
      provided to all patients to ensure they move their bowels on a regular basis.

      Patients will also be asked to participate in up to 2 sub-studies: a pk study and/or a stool
      microbiome study. The first 20 patients to consent to the pk study will have additional blood
      samples taken at randomization and at 2 follow up visits. The first 20 patients to consent to
      the stool microbiome study will provide stool samples at randomization and at 2 follow up
      visits.

             study procedures.

          3. Subjects must be diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease defined as the presence of at
             least three of the following cardinal features, in the absence of alternative
             explanations or atypical features: rest tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia and/or
             akinesia, postural and gait abnormalities.

          4. There are insufficient criteria for Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)

          5. Constipation which has been present for over 6 months and is unresponsive to first
             line, typically over the counter treatments such as Milk of Magnesia (1g), Miralax
             (17g in 8 ounces of water) or the equivalent at least once weekly with an inconsistent
             response over a 6-week period or the subject is dissatisfied with first line
             treatments.

          6. Body mass index (BMI) of 18-40 kg/m2

          7. Subjects must fulfill Rome IV criteria for functional constipation which includes 2 or
             more of the following:

               1. Straining during at least 25% of defecations

               2. Lumpy or hard stools in at least 25% of defecations

               3. Sensation of incomplete evacuation for at least 25% of defecations

               4. Sensation of anorectal obstruction/blockage for at least 25% of defecations

               5. Manual maneuvers to facilitate at least 25% of defecations (e.g., digital
                  evacuation, support of the pelvic floor)

          8. Self-report of fewer than 3 complete spontaneous bowel movements per week

          9. Loose stools are rarely present without the use of laxatives
