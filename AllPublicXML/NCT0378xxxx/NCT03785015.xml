  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding associated with the use of low-dose aspirin (ASA)
      is a major cause of peptic ulcer bleeding worldwide. Among survivors of acute myocardial
      infarction, a study of over 14,000 patients reported that the risk of life-threatening GI
      bleeding in the first two months is 7 times higher than that in the subsequent months. After
      endoscopic control of ulcer bleeding, most patients with cardiovascular (CV) diseases will
      need to resume ASA. However, the investigator found that immediate resumption of ASA saves
      life but at the expense of higher risk of recurrent bleeding. Peptic ulcer bleeding
      associated with ASA is a major cause of hospitalization in Hong Kong. Currently, ASA use has
      contributed to about one-third of the bleeding ulcers admitted to our hospital that serves a
      local population of 1.5 million. Accordingly, current international guidelines recommend
      early resumption of ASA but the optimal timing is unknown. Clinicians often face the dilemma:
      when should ASA be resumed? Furthermore, patients who suffer from acute peptic ulcer bleeding
      are often elderly patients with significant co-morbidities. Mortality in these patients
      remains high. Clinicians are facing an increasing number of patients who are on antiplatelet
      drugs or anticoagulants. The investigator proposes a open-label randomized-controlled trial
      to evaluate the optimal timing of resuming ASA in patients with CV diseases complicated by
      peptic ulcer bleeding. Patients will be randomized to resume the standard treatment within
      first few hours or only to resume the standard treatment 72 hours after endoscopic
      haemostasis.

      Acute upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding associated with the use of low-dose aspirin (ASA)
      is a major cause of peptic ulcer bleeding worldwide. Among survivors of acute myocardial
      infarction, a study of over 14,000 patients reported that the risk of life-threatening GI
      bleeding in the first two months is 7 times higher than that in the subsequent months (1).
      After endoscopic control of ulcer bleeding, most patients with cardiovascular (CV) diseases
      will need to resume ASA. Clinicians often face the dilemma: when should ASA be resumed?
      Furthermore, patients who suffer from acute peptic ulcer bleeding are often elderly patients
      with significant co-morbidities. Mortality in these patients remains high. Clinicians are
      facing an increasing number of patients who are on antiplatelet drugs or anticoagulants.

      However, there are very limited data to guide the best timing for resumption of ASA in these
      high risk patients. To date, our group has conducted the only randomized controlled trial in
      the literature that has partially addressed this issue. Importantly, the investigator found
      that immediate resumption of ASA saves life but at the expense of higher risk of recurrent
      bleeding (2). Accordingly, current international guidelines recommend early resumption of ASA
      but the optimal timing is unknown.

      In the setting of acute GI bleeding, it is often a dilemma whether to stop or to restart
      these drugs. The balance between bleeding and thrombotic risks is difficult and treatment is
      often empirical and not evidence-based.

      The investigator aims to test the hypothesis that in ASA users complicated by peptic ulcer
      bleeding, withholding ASA till day 3 reduces the risk of recurrent bleeding compared to
      immediate resumption of ASA without a significant increase in mortality.
