  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single blind, randomized, prospective study comparing SURGICEL Powder with SURGICEL
      Original (control arm) as an adjunct to achieve hemostasis in the control of capillary,
      venous, and small arterial hemorrhage when ligation or other conventional methods of control
      are impractical or ineffective during surgery (open, laparoscopic, or thoracoscopic) in
      Chinese adult subjects.

      This is a single blind, randomized, prospective study comparing SURGICEL Powder with SURGICEL
      Original (control arm) as an adjunct to achieve hemostasis in the control of capillary,
      venous, and small arterial hemorrhage when ligation or other conventional methods of control
      are impractical or ineffective during surgery (open, laparoscopic, or thoracoscopic) in
      Chinese adult subjects.

      After application of either SURGICEL Powder or SURGICEL Original, the target bleeding site
      (TBS) will be assessed for hemostasis (no detectable bleeding) at 3, 5, and 10 minutes from
      application and prior to initiation of final fascial closure on open surgery or port site
      closure in laparoscopic or thoracoscopic procedures.

      All enrolled subjects will be observed post-operatively through discharge and followed up at
      30 days (+14 days) and at 6 months (+/-30 days) post-surgery via phone call or office visit.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Adult subjects aged ≥18 years requiring elective/non-emergent open or laparoscopic
             general, gynecological, or cardiothoracic surgical procedures.

          2. Subject or authorized representative has signed the approved Informed Consent.

          3. Subject(s) whose platelet count is ≥100,000 per microliter and International
             Normalized Ratio (INR) is &lt;1.5 prior to 24 hours of surgery.

          4. Presence of an appropriate TBS identified intra-operatively by the surgeon.

          5. Subject(s) undergoing cardiothoracic surgery with anticoagulation must have
             anticoagulation reversed prior to TBS identification and treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Female subjects who are pregnant or nursing.

          2. Subject on heparin within 12 hours prior to surgery, or oral Coumadin (warfarin)
             and/or Factor Xa inhibitors within 3 days prior to surgery.

          3. Subject on antiplatelet/P2Y12 inhibitors medication 5 days prior to surgery;

          4. Subject is currently participating or plans to participate in any other
             investigational product or drug trial without prior approval from the Sponsor.

          5. Subjects who are known, current alcohol and/or drug abusers.

          6. Subjects with any pre-operative findings identified by the surgeon that may preclude
             conduct of the study procedure.

          7. Subjects with any intra-operative findings identified by the surgeon that may preclude
             the use of study product.

          8. Subject with TBS in an actively infected field (Class III Contaminated or Class IV
             Dirty or Infected; see Appendix 1).

          9. TBS is on arteries or veins where application of SURGICEL Powder would present a risk
             of introducing the study product into an open blood vessel.

         10. Major arterial or venous bleeding or major defects in arteries and veins.

         11. TBS where silver nitrate or any other escharotic chemicals have been applied.

         12. TBS is in, around, or in proximity to foramina in bone, or areas of bony
