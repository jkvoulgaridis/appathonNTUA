      An open, uncontrolled pharmacokinetic study with a new topical combination gel containing
      triiodothyroacetic acid (TRIAC) and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) in subjects with skin
      atrophy due to topical treatment with glucocorticoids.

      At the Baseline Visit (Day 1) and after completion of all evaluations, each subject who
      qualifies for entry will will receive a dose of 0.5 g IMP on the back of a hand affected with
      skin atrophy.

      PK-samples will be withdrawn at 0, 2, 4, 6, 24, 48 and 72 hours.
