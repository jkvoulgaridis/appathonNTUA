  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study will aim to determine if adding phenobarbital or ketamine to a
      symptom-triggered benzodiazepine regimen decreases the rate of intensive care unit admissions
      during the treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome when compared to symptom-triggered
      benzodiazepine therapy alone.

      The primary objective of this study is to compare phenobarbital and ketamine adjunctive
      therapies to lorazepam-based therapy in the treatment of acute alcohol withdrawal syndrome.

      It is hypothesized that the use of an alternative agent, either phenobarbital or ketamine,
      when used as an adjunct to symptom-triggered lorazepam therapy will significantly reduce the
      rate of intensive care unit admissions and thereby reduce the total cost associated with
      hospital admission for treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome.

      Enrolled patients will be admitted to Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital where they will be
      monitored with continuous pulse oximetry and cardiac telemetry. They will remain hospitalized
      while undergoing study-guided therapy in addition to supportive care for acute alcohol
      withdrawal syndrome. Patients will undergo standard of care therapy with lorazepam
      symptom-triggered therapy regardless of study participation.

    <masking>Triple (Participant, Care Provider, Investigator)</masking>
    <masking_description>Each participant will be randomized according to a web-based randomization program employed by a research pharmacist once the Emergency Department provider deems the patient appropriate for inpatient treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome.
Each medication will be packaged by Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital pharmacy. In order to blind both the clinicians and the participants, the pharmacy will provide medication bags that are identical. Therefore, Emergency Department nursing staff and physicians will be unaware of which study drug is being provided to the patient. Normal saline will be used as a placebo to mimic study drugs (phenobarbital and ketamine). Pharmacy will remain unblinded and maintain records of which treatment assignment is prepared for each patient.
Treatment will be provided for the duration of the patient's hospitalization; therefore, treatment compliance will be documented in the electronic health record using the medication bag identifier.</masking_description>
