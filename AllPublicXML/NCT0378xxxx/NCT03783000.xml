    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to investigate the absolute oral bioavailability of BI
      425809 administered as tablet (Test, T) compared to [C-14]-BI 425809 administered as
      intravenous microtracer (Reference, R).

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male subjects according to the assessment of the investigator, based on a
             complete medical history including a physical examination, vital signs (Blood Pressure
             (BP), Pulse Rate (PR)), 12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG), and clinical laboratory tests

          -  Age of 18 to 65 years (incl.)

          -  Body mass index (BMI) of 18.5 to 29.9 kg/m2 (incl.)

          -  Signed and dated written informed consent prior to admission to the study in
             accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and local legislation

          -  Subjects who are sexually active must use, with their partner, highly effective
             contraception from the time of administration of trial medication until 4 months after
             administration of trial medication. Adequate methods are:

               -  Condoms plus use of hormonal contraception by the female partner that started at
                  least 2 months prior to administration of trial medication (e.g., implants,
                  injectables, combined oral or vaginal contraceptives, intrauterine device) or

               -  Condoms plus surgical sterilization (vasectomy at least 1 year prior to
                  enrolment) or

               -  Condoms plus surgically sterilised partner (including hysterectomy) or

               -  Condoms plus intrauterine device or

               -  Condoms plus partner of non-childbearing potential (including homosexual men)
                  Subjects are required to use condoms to prevent unintended exposure of the
                  partner to the study drug via seminal fluid.

               -  Alternatively, true abstinence is acceptable when it is in line with the
                  subject's preferred and usual lifestyle. If a subject is usually not sexually
                  active but becomes active, with their partner, they must comply with the
                  contraceptive requirements detailed above.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any finding in the medical examination (including Blood Pressure (BP), Pulse Rate (PR)
             or Electrocardiogram (ECG)) is deviating from normal and judged as clinically relevant
             by the investigator

          -  Repeated measurement of systolic blood pressure outside the range of 90 to 139 mmHg,
             diastolic blood pressure outside the range of 45 to 89 mmHg, or pulse rate outside the
             range of 40 to 100 bpm

          -  Any laboratory value outside the reference range that the investigator considers to be
             of clinical relevance

          -  Any evidence of a concomitant disease judged as clinically relevant by the
             investigator

          -  Clinically significant gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory (including but
             not limited to interstitial lung disease), cardiovascular, metabolic, immunological or
             hormonal disorders
