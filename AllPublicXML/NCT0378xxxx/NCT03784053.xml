  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Older adult participants will complete eight immersive virtual reality (VR) sessions with the
      researcher, within five weeks (no more than two sessions per week may be scheduled). The
      screening process and assessment measures are not included in the five weeks of virtual
      reality. Sessions will consist of 30 minutes of use of the virtual reality goggles. During
      the virtual reality sessions, participants will select from a list of Oculus Go apps related
      to their self-identified occupational performance issues. Participants are expected to
      complete the session while seated with the VR set secured on their head.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Virtual reality (VR) may promote engagement in meaningful daily activities that is tailored
      to the individual's skill level, need, and significance to their individual context. There is
      limited research on measurable changes in perceived meaningful daily activities after
      utilizing immersive VR, specifically with a head mounted display. Only in recent years have
      head-mounted displays become less expensive and more commercially available for research and
      patron purchase. At the low cost of $250, the device is within the reach of many older adult
      community centers for leisure and recreational use. The researchers will measure changes in
      occupational performance, occupational satisfaction, and quality of life for the older adult
      members of a community center, after eight immersive VR sessions. Sessions will consist of 30
      minutes of use of the virtual reality goggles. During the virtual reality sessions,
      participants will select from a list of Oculus Go apps related to their self-identified
      occupational performance issues. Participants are expected to complete the session while
      seated with the VR set secured on their head.

    <measure>The Canadian Occupational Therapy Performance Measure (COPM)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The COPM is a standardized outcome measure that identifies an individual's perceived occupational performance and occupational satisfaction and detects change in these areas over time. Through a semi-structured interview, individuals will identify their difficulties with self-care, leisure, and productivity (Law et al., 2005). The client is asked to rate the importance of each of the occupations to his/her life using a 10-point rating scale (1 to 10). Then, the client will rate the performance and satisfaction of the occupations on a 10-point rating scale (1 to 10). Then, the average performance satisfaction is calculated (1 to 10) and the average satisfaction is calculated (1 to 10). Higher scores indicate better outcomes.</description>

    <measure>World Health Organization Quality of Life BREF (WHOQOL-BREF)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The WHOQOL-BREF is an assessment used to measure an individual's perceived quality of life. It has 26 items across the following four domains: physical health, psychological health, social relationships, and environment. Items are scored on a scale of 1 to 5 (a higher score is a more favorable outcome). Raw scores are calculated of each domain, and then scores may be transformed to scores ranging from 4 to 20 within each domain.</description>

    <description>At the start of every session, the participants' top five occupational problems will be reviewed, and a list of apps corresponding to the desired occupational problem will be offered through the immersive virtual reality device (Oculus Go). There will be eight 30-minute virtual reality sessions.</description>

      <textblock>
        The aim is to recruit community-dwelling, healthy older adults from one community center.
        Subjects will be excluded if they receive a score of 17 or less on the MoCA because this
        score is associated with individuals with Alzheimer's Disease (Trzepacz, Hochstetler, Wang,
        Walker, &amp; Saykin, 2015). The second exclusion, for safety purposes, is recommended by the
        Oculus Go user manual.
