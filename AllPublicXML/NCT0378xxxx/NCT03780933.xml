      1. To access role of vitamin C supplementation in ARDS patients on the following:

           Oxidants/ antioxidants imbalance Length of hospital stay Mortality rate Weaning from
           mechanical ventilator Incidence of adverse drug reaction

    <textblock>
      Acute Respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a form of severe hypoxemic respiratory failure
      due to severe impairment of gas exchange and lung mechanics that is characterized by
      inflammatory injury to the alveolar capillary barrier, with extravasation of protein-rich
      edema fluid into the air space. Current ARDS antioxidant treatment strategy, is based upon
      supportive therapies including low tidal volume ventilation, fluid management, nutritional
      support and glucocorticoids.

      Ascorbic acid or Vitamin C is an important dietary water-soluble antioxidant, it
      significantly decreases the adverse effects of ROS such as reactive oxygen and nitrogen
      species that can cause oxidative damage to macromolecules. Recent studies show that high dose
      of Vitamin C have protective effects against overwhelming oxidative stress due to critical
      illness. Vitamin C improves immune function and improves tissue perfusion and reduce tissue
      hypoxia and subsequent organ dysfunction. Also, Ascorbate, the redox form of vitamin C is
      physiological antioxidant and has bacteriostatic activity Hence the study aims to evaluate
      the impact of IV Vitamin C in ARDS, as a novel pharmaceutical approach in an attempt to
      improve the clinical outcome of ARDS patients, decrease other medications toxicities and
      improve patients' quality of life.

      The objective of the current study was to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of
      IV Vitamin C administration in addition to conventional therapy in patients with ARDS by
      assessing the following:

        1. Oxidants/ antioxidants imbalance

        2. Length of hospital stay

        3. Mortality rate

        4. Weaning from mechanical ventilator

        5. Incidence of adverse drug reaction

        6. Serum IL8 levels

      8. Serum Vitamin C levels
