  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Other psychiatric disorders, including anxiety, often co-occur with adult ADHD; with 85% of
      ADHD patients having at least one other psychiatric condition. The presence of a co-occurring
      anxiety disorder has been associated with additive clinical effects, leading to more global
      impairment, poorer outcome, greater resistance to treatment and increased costs of illness.
      Stimulants are effective first-line treatments for adult ADHD patients, however the
      literature has mostly examined these treatments in pure ADHD populations (i.e. without other
      psychiatric disorders). Thus, there is little information to guide physicians in making
      treatment decisions for patients with ADHD and a co-occurring condition.

      This trial aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of methylphenidate hydrochloride
      controlled release capsules (Foquest) in treating adults aged 18-65 years with DSM-5 ADHD
      with and without a co-occurring anxiety disorder.The study uses a 14-week, randomized,
      placebo-controlled, cross-over design.

    <measure>Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Rating Scale - 5</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The ADHD-RS-5 is a scale for children and adolescents that assesses the frequency and severity of ADHD symptoms and impairments based on criteria from the Diagnostic Statistics Manual 5. The measure will be adapted for use with adults as a clinician rated scale in this study. It consists of 18 items, rated on a 4-point scale from 0 (never or rarely) to 3 (very often). The items can be summed to obtain a total score (range: 0-54), an Inattention subscore (range:0-27), and a Hyperactivity-Impulsivity subscore (range: 0-27), with higher scores indicating greater frequency and severity of symptoms.</description>
