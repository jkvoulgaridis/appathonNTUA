  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of obesity in Spain is about 21.6%. The discouraging results provided by
      dietary treatment, together with the lack of funding for pharmacological treatment, have led
      to the progressive use of bariatric surgery (CB). Besides weight loss, CB associates a
      beneficial effect on metabolic comorbidities. However, 25-30% of operated patients present a
      weight response considered inappropriate, they do not resolve their comorbidities and/or
      present a weight-regain shortly after surgery. Therefore, predictive strategies are necessary
      to allow a correct selection of obese patients who are candidates for CB.

      The main hypothesis of the study is that various factors such as psychopathological profile,
      body composition and metabolic alterations related to morbid obesity can influence the
      response to bariatric surgery.

      The investigators have designed a prospective study in which 200 consecutive patients from
      the outpatient clinic of the Morbidly Obesity Unit of the Vall d'Hebron Hospital will be
      included, meeting criteria for bariatric surgery (with BMI&gt; 40 kg / m2 or BMI&gt; 35 kg /m2 in
      the presence of comorbidities) and will undergo surgery in the investigator's center between
      September 2018 and September 2019. All patients will undergo (baseline, month, 6, 12 and 24
      month): complete clinical history, analysis complete biochemistry, 2 blood samples will be
      extracted to study metabolomics, stool sample for microbiota study, bioimpedance for the
      study of body composition, determination of AGEs in the skin and lens, cognitive function
      assessment, retinal function assessment by microperimetry and they will be asked to complete
      several specific questionnaires for the evaluation of the psychopathological profile and the
      dietetic survey.
