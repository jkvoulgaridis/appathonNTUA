    <textblock>
      The subjects of this intervention program are mainly based on community-dwelling mid-aged and
      older adults. The investigator's program will provide meals containing different
      proportionated protein.As this project is a double blind test, only the investigators will
      know which subject corresponding to specific group of diets.

      Besides, the investigators use the valued-based healthcare standard set as well as the Center
      for Epidemiological Studies-Depression, Charlson's comorbidity index Montreal Cognitive
      Assesment ,and Mini Nutritional Assessment as outcome measures and to use the randomized
      controlled trial design to validate if increased protein density diet could improve the
      vitality and health of mid-aged and old adults .

    <textblock>
      With aging, functions of every organs become to decline. Muscle mass, is one of the decline.
      According to previous research, adults would lose 40% among from aged 20 to 70. If muscle
      mass decline combining with the decline of muscle strength is so called Sarcopenia.When
      muscle mass decline, infectious risk gets higher, and resilience after illness gets lower. In
      addition, activity and life quality are also responsible for falling, cognitive difficulty,
      disability and mortality among seniors. We hope to find out the etiologies of Sarcopenia
      through this program and develop prevention strategy and model to mollify the the negative
      effect of rapid aging society.
