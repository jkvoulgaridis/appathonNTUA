  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) is a visceral adipose tissue that surrounds the heart and the
      coronary arteries. It is metabolically active, secreting pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators
      and cytokines. With increasing EAT volume, inflammatory activity increasing, which suggests
      that EAT may locally influence atherosclerosis development in the coronary artery tree. The
      amount of EAT is associated with cardiovascular disease risk factors as well as presence and
      progression of subclinical atherosclerosis. Likewise, EAT volume is increased in patient with
      prevalent and incident coronary artery disease manifestation. In the setting of acute
      coronary syndrome, EAT was found to be associated with the TIMI risk score and Syntax II
      score. While CT imaging of the heart is the gold standard for EAT quantification,
      transthoracic echocardiography allows for a quick and reliable assessment of EAT thickness,
      as has been used in research studies and may qualify for routine EAT assessment in clinical
      routine.However, currently data on how quantification of EAT in clinical routine may impact
      patient management is lacking. We aim to investigate, whether quantification of EAT thickness
      via transthoracic echocardiography enables improved risk stratification in patients
      presenting with acute chest pain to the emergency department.
