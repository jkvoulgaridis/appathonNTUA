      Impact of intraoperative use of pneumatic peristaltic compression device on hemodynamics vis
      a vis on fluid requirement during general anaesthesia and surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Induction of general anaesthesia is associated with cardiac depression and peripheral
      vasodilatation resulting in hypotension .This hypotension can be corrected by giving
      intravenous fluid, or the vasoconstrictor. While optimum fluid balances in the perioperative
      period is of vital importance in overnight fasting patients to correct the fluid deficit, any
      fluid overload is not only counterproductive to the heart function but is associated with
      fluid retention in body and edema in postoperative period.

      Peristaltic pneumatic compression device, a variant of intermittent sequential compression of
      legs, uses higher pressure and longer compression cycles to avoid venous stasis in
      immobilized patients. Sequential compression devices have sleeves with pockets of inflation,
      which works to squeeze on the appendage in a milking action .The most distal areas will
      inflate initially, and the subsequent pockets will follow in the same manner. The primary aim
      of the device is to squeeze blood from the underlying deep veins to proximal side. When the
      inflatable sleeves deflate, the veins will replenish with blood. The intermittent
      compressions of the sleeves will ensure the movement of venous blood . Peristaltic Pneumatic
      Compression of the legs significantly reduces fluid demand and enhances stability during
      minor ear, nose, and throat surgery. Peristaltic Pneumatic Compression has the potential to
      support fluid restriction regimens during surgery .
