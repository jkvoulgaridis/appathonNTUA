  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For 15 years, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-funded Arizona Prevention
      Research Center (AzPRC) has been engaged in academic community collaborative research to
      reduce chronic disease health disparities among the Latino border communities in Arizona,
      which positions the center well to contribute to CDC's current winnable battle of nutrition,
      physical activity and obesity. The AzPRC's research study Linking Individual Needs to
      Community and Clinical Services (LINKS) will implement and evaluate a CHW-delivered
      preventive program linking primary care settings dedicated to reaching the under-served with
      community services that are county-delivered or -based. By developing community-clinical
      linkages, the AzPRC will help ensure access to, and quality of, culturally relevant
      prevention and promotion efforts. These efforts will result in a sustainable and scalable CHW
      model program that reduces obesity and associated chronic disease, and improves overall
      health in under-served communities at the Arizona U.S.-Mexico border.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over the past 15 years, CDC-funded AzPRC researchers have strengthened collaborations with
      community partners while developing and implementing comprehensive diabetes prevention and
      control programs (1998-2019), and policy intervention research (2009-2014) in Southern
      Arizona border communities. The community health worker (CHW)-led diabetes programs were
      successful in terms of community perception and health improvements. Despite this success,
      disparities in chronic disease remained unacceptably high. The investigators developed and
      implemented an innovative intervention research project, Acción Para La Salud (Acción), which
      engaged CHWs in community-level advocacy to empower border communities to address root causes
      of chronic disease. This community-based participatory research (CBPR) project recognized the
      importance of addressing the social determinants of health to overcome health disparities in
      chronic disease. The investigators have published results and processes of Acción.

      Chronic disease and obesity health disparities continue to disproportionately affect Hispanic
      populations along the U.S. Mexico border in part due to barriers to healthful nutrition,
      adequate physical activity, and mental/emotional well-being as well as insufficient access to
      culturally appropriate health care services. In collaboration with our border-wide Community
      Action Board (CAB), the investigators are taking our intervention expertise one step further
      by developing and testing novel CHW-led interventions that will link community and clinical
      services.

      In recent years, federally qualified community health centers (FQHCs), a major backbone of
      the primary care system in reaching under-served populations across the US, have begun to
      involve the CHW model into various services, often with a focus on chronic disease prevention
      and control. While CHWs help improve the quality and cultural relevancy of health care,
      improve patient centered care, and improve linkages between primary care and community
      services, each clinic adapts practices within their clinic environment without clear
      guidelines about best practices, or concrete evidence regarding activities best shown to lead
      to improvement in health outcomes. In addition, there may not be clear linkages from the
      clinic to CHW programs in the community that have been shown to be effective in chronic
      disease control and prevention, and there are challenges in identifying mechanisms for the
      sustainability of effective clinical or community programs. Our intervention research
      proposes to fill these gaps by establishing clear guidance and best practices for CHW
      involvement in primary care and community settings to prevent and manage chronic disease, and
      to promote mental/emotional well-being.

    <measure>Change from baseline in participant self-rated health, emotional well-being, and life satisfaction on 3 questions from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) at 3 and 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>July 14, 2017-March 30, 2019</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will ask three questions from the BRFSS:
Would you say in general your health is: (Excellent / Very good / Good / Fair / Poor)
How often do you get the social and emotional support you need? (Always / Usually / Sometimes / Rarely / Never)
In general, how satisfied are you with your life? (Very satisfied / Satisfied / Dissatisfied / Very Dissatisfied)
Responses from the BRFSS are Likert type questions. Individual items from the scales will be tabulated and summarized at each administration of the questionnaire. The outcome at each timepoint for a given subject on a given scale will be the sum of the scores of the items from that scale. An increase in the score demonstrates a positive outcome.</description>

    <time_frame>July 14, 2017-March 30, 2019</time_frame>
    <description>To determine participant physical activity, the investigators will ask a single question regarding the amount of physical activity the subject engaged in during the previous week:
In the past week, on how many days have you done a total of 30 minutes or more of physical activity, which was enough to raise your breathing rate? (0-7 days)
An increase in days reported demonstrates a positive outcome.</description>

    <description>Responses from the SF8 are Likert type questions. Individual items from this scale will be tabulated and summarized at each administration of the questionnaire. The outcome at each timepoint for a given subject on a given scale will be the sum of the scores of the items from that scale. An increase in the score demonstrates a positive outcome.</description>

    <description>Responses from the SSI scales are Likert type questions, with the exception of SSI question 7 (Are you currently married or living with a partner? Yes/No). Individual items from this scale will be tabulated and summarized at each administration of the questionnaire. The outcome at each timepoint for a given subject on a given scale will be the sum of the scores of the items from that scale (excluding SSI question 7). An increase in the score demonstrates a positive outcome.</description>

    <time_frame>July 14, 2017-September 30, 2019</time_frame>
    <description>A total score for the SHS can be obtained by adding the values of the responses to each item, yielding a score from 6 - 48. An increase in the score demonstrates a positive outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in participant depression on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D-R 10) at 3 and 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>July 14, 2017-September 30, 2019</time_frame>
    <description>A total score for the CES-D-R 10 scale is found by determining the sum of the items which are scored as:
Rarely or none of the time (less than 1 day); Some or a little of the time (1 - 2 days); Occasionally or a moderate amount of time (3 - 4 days); All of the time (5 - 7 days)
Questions 5 &amp; 8: Rarely or none of the time (less than 1 day) = 3 to All of the time (5 - 7 days) = 0
All other questions: Rarely or none of the time (less than 1 day) = 0 to All of the time (5 - 7 days) = 3
An increase in the score demonstrates a positive outcome.</description>

    <description>The principal analytical strategy is propensity score matching, which will lead to the generation of a natural control group from the health centers existing electronic medical records. Propensity matching is highly effective in addressing selection bias of known confounders and enables causal inferences when randomization is not possible, feasible or appropriate, by creating matched groups with similar covariate distributions. Matched controls will be extracted from the electronic medical record from the participating clinics.</description>
