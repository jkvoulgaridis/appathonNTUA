    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the pulmonary function, respiratory muscle strength and peripheral
      muscle strength in patients with burn injury on the week that they will be discharge from the
      hospital. Healthy subjects will be evaluated for pulmonary function, respiratory muscle
      strength and peripheral muscle strength.

    <textblock>
      Burn injures have adverse effect on the respiratory system.In addition to burn injury
      prolonged hospitalization may increase the ratio of respiratory complications. But, there are
      no information in the literature about pulmonary function, respiratory muscle strength and
      peripheral muscle strength in patients with burn injury. Especially, when the patients are
      discharged from the hospital, it is not known whether the patients are at the same level in
      terms of pulmonary functions respiratory muscle strength and peripheral muscle strength with
      healthy individuals. This study will assess pulmonary functions respiratory muscle strength
      and peripheral muscle strength in patients with burn injury compared to healthy subjects.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Forced Vital Capacity</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>is the total amount of air exhaled during the test. After three trial, the best forced vital capacity value is the outcome</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second is the volume exhaled during the first second of a forced expiratory maneuver started from the level of total lung capacity. After three trial, the best FVC value is the outcome.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second / Forced Vital Capacity</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The ratio of Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second / Forced Vital Capacity. This formule is calculated by measuring device. After three trial, the best value is the outcome.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Maximal Inspiratory Pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>is a measure of the strength of inspiratory muscles, primarily the diaphragm. It is obtained by having the patient inhale as strongly as possible against a mouthpiece. After three trial, the best value is the outcome.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Maximal Expiratory Pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>a measure of the strength of respiratory muscles, obtained by having the patient exhale as strongly as possible against a mouthpiece. After three trial, the best value is the outcome.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Peak Expiratory Flow</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Peak Expiratory Flow is a person's maximum speed of expiration, as measured with a peak flow meter, a small, hand-held device used to monitor a person's ability to breathe out air. After three trial, the best value is the outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>forced expiratory flow</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Forced expiratory flow is the flow (or speed) of air coming out of the lung during the middle portion of a forced expiration.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Peripheral strength</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Peripheral (Grip) strength is a measure of muscular strength or the maximum force/tension generated by one's forearm muscles</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain severity</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Pain severity was assessed by visual analogue scale. This scale score range from &quot;no pain=0 point &quot; to &quot;worst imaginable pain=10 points&quot; for intensity. Maximum point means worst pain severity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional Exercise Capacity</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>It was evaluated by six minutes walk test.The 6-min walk test is a submaximal exercise test that entails measurement of distance walked over a span of 6 minutes. The distance will be recorded. The higher distance is indicated better exercise capacity.</description>
