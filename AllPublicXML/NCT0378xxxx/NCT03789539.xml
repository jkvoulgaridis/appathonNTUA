      This is a single-site, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of Uniflu in fifty
      four (54) volunteers 18-60 years of age.

      All subjects will receive an intramuscular (IM) injection twice,with a 21 days interval
      between treatments.

      Subjects will undergo screening procedures within 6 days prior to first vaccination which
      will include medical history, vital signs, physical examination and safety blood and urine
      lab tests.

      On the first treatment visit, eligible subjects will undergo pre-dose physical
      examination,vital signs, ECG, a blood sample will be drawn for circulating IgE. They receive
      an IM injection of either vaccine or placebo, according to the above treatment assignment,
      into the deltoid muscle. The subjects will remain under medical supervision for 72 hrs, after
      that time they will be released from the Clinical research center.

      The second treatment will take place 21 days after the first vaccination. Procedures will be
      the same as on the first treatment visit.

      Follow-up visits take place at 4th, 5th, 6th, 14th, 35th days. A Study Termination visit will
      take place at 42nd day of research. Adverse events (AEs) and changes in concomitant
      medications will be recorded, vital signs will be measured and the subjects will undergo
      physical examination and ECG. Blood and urine samples will be collected for safety.

    <intervention_model_description>Subjects will undergo screening procedures within 2-6 days prior to first vaccination which will include medical history, vital signs, physical examination and safety blood and urine lab tests.
On the first treatment visit, eligible subjects will undergo pre-dose physical examination, ECG, vital signs, and a blood sample for circulating IgE. They will then receive an IM injection of either vaccine or placebo, according to the above treatment assignment, into the deltoid muscle preferably of non dominant arm. The subjects will remain under medical supervision for 72 hrs at which time they will be released from the Clinical research center.
The second treatment will take place 21 days after the first vaccination. Procedures will be the same as that of Visit 1 Additional follow-up visits will take place at 4-7th,14th,24-27th and 42nd days. Blood and urine samples will be collected for safety.</intervention_model_description>
