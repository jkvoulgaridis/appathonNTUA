  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is prospectively conducted on 190 patients aged between 20 and 85 years, American
      Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I - III, undergoing one-lung ventilation
      for thoracic surgery. Patients were randomly allocated into either control group (n = 95) or
      experimental group (n = 95) by a computerized randomization table. The size of endobronchial
      tube is decided based on the diameter of left main bronchus measured on the CT finding of
      patients. After induction of general anesthesia, in patients assigned to control group,
      endobronchial intubation is performed using conventional technique with left-sided
      double-lumen endobronchial tube (Shiley®, Covidien, Mansfield, MA, USA). In experimental
      group, patients are intubated with novel double-lumen endobronchial tube (Ankor®,Insung
      Medical, Wonjou, S. Korea). During intubation, the carina cuff of Ankor® is inflated after
      the tube is rotated 90º toward the left. The tube is advanced until slight resistance is
      felt, then the carina cuff is deflated. In both groups, fiberoptic bronchoscope is performed
      to evaluate the position of endobronchial tube after intubation. If endobronchial tube is not
      in optimal position, the depth of tube is corrected to optimal position under guidance of
      fiberoptic bronchoscope. Airway injury is confirmed using fiberoptic bronchoscope before
      extubation. The success of endobronchial intubation, position of endobronchial tube, the
      corrected depth of endobronchial tube, time consumption for endobronchial intubation and
      complication of intubation such as airway injury, pain, and hoarseness are compared between
      two groups.

    <intervention_model_description>Patients were randomly allocated into either control group (n = 95) or experimental group (n = 95) by a computerized randomization table.

    <description>In control group, endobronchial intubation is performed using conventional technique with left-sided double-lumen endobronchial tube(Shiley®). The tube is introduced into the glottis via direct laryngoscopy. After the tube tip passes the vocal cord, the tube is rotated 90º toward the left. The tube is advanced according to the depth(cm) of the tube calculated by the height of patient(12.5+0.1*height). Afterwards, the depth of the tube is adjusted by the compliance of both lung.
In experimental group, patients are intubated with novel double-lumen endobronchial tube(Ankor®). The tube is introduced into the glottis via direct laryngoscopy. After the tube tip passes the vocal cord, the tube is rotated 90º toward the left. Once the carinal cuff of the tube is passed through the vocal cord of patients, the carinal cuff is inflated with 5-8ml of air. The tube is advanced until the tube stops itself at some point along the tracheobronchial tree. And then the carinal cuff is deflated.</description>
