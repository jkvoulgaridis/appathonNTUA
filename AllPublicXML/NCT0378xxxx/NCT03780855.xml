      The objective of the study is to preliminarily evaluate the clinical safety and effectiveness
      of the bionic nerve scaffold with longitudinally oriented microchannels. 10 patients with
      peripheral sensory nerve defects will be involved and divided into 2 groups: the experimental
      group is treated with the nerve scaffold, and the control group without that. Then follow the
      cases up and draw conclusion according to the results of observation and examination.

      The objective of the study is to preliminarily evaluate the clinical safety and effectiveness
      of the bionic nerve scaffold with longitudinally oriented microchannels developed in the
      Department of Orthopaedics in Xijing hospital in repairing the peripheral nerve defect.
      According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 10 patients with peripheral sensory nerve
      defects of 1 to 3 cm in size will be involved. Divided them into 2 groups. The experimental
      group of 5 cases will be treated with the nerve scaffold, and the control group without that.
      Then follow the cases up at about 2 weeks, 3 months and 6 months after surgery. Observe the
      condition of the healing of the local wound and the whole body of the 10 patients. Examine
      the blood routine and biochemical indexes of the experimental group. Sensory recovery of
      injured nerves will be tested at about 3 months and 6 months after surgery. Record the
      results in the case report forms. Analyze the data statistically and draw conclusion.
