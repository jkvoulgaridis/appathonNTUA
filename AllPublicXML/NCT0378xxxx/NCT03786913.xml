    <textblock>
      The aim of our study is to Assess skeletal muscle structural status in children with
      inflammatory myositis and Duchenne muscular dystrophy using musculoskeletal ultrasound and to
      perform a longitudinal follow up of these changes over 2 years and to assess the relation
      between these findings with clinical parameters, functional scales, biochemical and
      electromyographic tests.

      This study will be carried out on two groups:

      • Group (I): fifty children diagnosed to have duchenne muscular dystrophy and inflammatory
      myositis.

      Group (II): including 20 healthy children matching age and sex as control group.

      patients will be subjected to

      (A) Clinical evaluation

        1. Complete history taking.

        2. Thorough clinical examination.

        3. Body mass index (BMI) assessment.

        4. Quantitative muscle strength tests

        5. Functional grading

        6. Childhood Myositis Assessment Scale. 7 (B) Laboratory assessment:

      All patients will be subjected to the following measurements:

        1. Serum creatine kinase levels (CK).

        2. Serum Lactate dehydrogenase levels

        3. Serum of Liver enzymes (SGOT&amp; SGPT) levels.

      (C) Electromyographic (EMG) assessment:

      (D) Musculoskeletal ultrasound assessment (E) Statistical analysis

          -  If no final diagnosis could be established.

          -  The presence of a concomitant illness that may result in peripheral neuropathy or
