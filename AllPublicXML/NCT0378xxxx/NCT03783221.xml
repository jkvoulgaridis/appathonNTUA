  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Meal ingestion induces digestive responses associated to homeostatic and hedonic sensations.
      The responses to meal ingestion are modulated by conditioning factors. Single-centre,
      cross-over, random, open label study comparing the effect of a high-fat/low-residue diet
      versus low-fat/high residue diet on the responses to meal ingestion. In 20 healthy subjects
      each diet will be administered during 2 weeks in random order; each diet will be preceded by
      2 weeks washout, balanced diet. The aim of the study is to compare the effects of each diet
      on the responses to comfort and flatulogenic meals, intestinal gas production and digestive
      sensations.
