  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While cigarette smoking remains the primary cause of most lung cancer cases, lung carcinoma
      in never smokers account for nearly 20 percent of cases. Never smokers with lung cancer
      typically present with different molecular profiles from that of smokers, which results in
      prognostic and therapeutic implications. Molecular changes in NSCLC that have therapeutic
      significance include mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and
      rearrangements in the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene. These driver mutations typically
      are present in lung tumors found in never or light smokers.

      The addition of bevacizumab to carboplatin and paclitaxel in first-line treatment of
      non-squamous NSCLC showed improved survival compared to carboplatin and paclitaxel alone,
      12.3 vs. 10.3 months respectively. Results from the POINTBREAK trial demonstrated that
      carboplatin + pemetrexed + bevacizumab is an alternative option to carboplatin + paclitaxel +
      bevacizumab, with comparable survival but less toxicity. In recent years, immunotherapy has
      emerged as a form of treatment that can lead to robust responses in a subset of patients. The
      PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab and the PD-L1 inhibitor atezolizumab have shown prolonged survival
      in comparison to docetaxel in patients who previously progressed with chemotherapy,
      irrespective of PD-L1 expression. Thus, this study combines immunotherapeutic agent
      atezolozumab with an ant-angiogenic agent, bevacizumab, and double platinum therapy
      (carboplatin and pemetrexed).

    <intervention_model_description>The design of this study will be an open label, randomized, phase 2 study in adult (≥ 18 years) male and female subjects with stage IV disease who have never smoked, irrespective of their driver mutation status, as well as subjects who have tumors that possess a driver mutation.
The study will be comparing the four agent treatment group (Arm A) that includes carboplatin + pemetrexed + bevacizumab + atezolizumab versus a three agent control group (Arm B) that includes carboplatin + pemetrexed + bevacizumab for 4 cycles, each cycle lasting for 3 weeks. Treatment will be followed by maintenance in both arms that will include all agents except carboplatin. There is no crossover in this study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed stage IV non-squamous
             non-small cell lung cancer

          -  Patients must either have tumors that harbor an EGFR mutation in exon 19 or exon 21,
             or must be never smoker wild-types. Never smoker wild-types are defined as patients
             with tumors without an ALK or ROS1 rearrangement, and are not harboring any EGFR
             mutation (this includes exons 19 or 21, exon 20, and any other rare EGFR mutations).
             Never smoker wild-type patients must have smoked less than 100 cigarettes in a
             lifetime. Patients with an EGFR mutation in exon 19 or 21 may be included irrespective
             of their smoking history. If tissue-based testing for EGFR mutation status is not
             available, blood-based EGFR testing that confirms presence of a mutation in exon 19 or
             21 is acceptable, and these patients may be included in the study

          -  Patients must have measurable disease by CT or MRI, defined as at least one lesion
             that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension in accordance with RECIST
             criteria v 1.1

          -  Patients with tumors that harbor an EGFR exon 19 or exon 21 mutation must have
             received prior treatments with one or more TKIs. A washout period of at least 2 weeks
             is required to begin treatment in this trial. Patients who are never smoker wild-types
             must be treatment naïve

          -  All patients must be chemotherapy, VEGF therapy, and immunotherapy naive, with the
             exception of prior oral TKIs which are required for EGFR mutated patients. The number
             of prior oral TKIs and duration of use is neither specified nor limited.

          -  Patients with a history of treated asymptomatic CNS metastases are eligible, provided
             they meet all of the following criteria:

               -  Only supratentorial and cerebellar metastases allowed (i.e., no metastases to
                  midbrain, pons, medulla or spinal cord)

               -  No ongoing requirement for corticosteroids as therapy for CNS disease

               -  No stereotactic radiation within 7 days or whole-brain radiation within 14 days

             be collected.

          -  Urinary protein must be ≤1+ on dipstick or routine urinalysis (UA; if urine dipstick
             or routine analysis is ≥2+, a 24 hour urine collection for protein must demonstrate

             contraception for the course of the study through 8 months after the last dose of
             study medication.
