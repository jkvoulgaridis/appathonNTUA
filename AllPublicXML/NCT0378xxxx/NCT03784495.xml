  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the effectiveness of melatonin and essential aminoacid supplementation on body
      composition, protein metabolism, strength and inflammation. The investigators performed a
      Randomized controlled parallel groups preliminary trial in 159 elderly sarcopenic people
      (42/117 men/women) assigned to 4 groups: isocaloric placebo (P, n=44), melatonin (M, 1
      mg/daily, n=42,), essential aminoacids (eAA 4 g/daily, n=40) or eAA plus melatonin (eAAM, 4 g
      eAA and 1 mg melatonin/daily, n= 30). The period of intervention was 4 weeks. Data from body
      composition (DXA), strength (handgrip test) and biochemical parameters for the assessment of
      protein metabolism (albumin) and inflammation (PRC) were collected at baseline and after the
      4-week intervention

    <measure>Change in Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA)</measure>
    <time_frame>0, 30 days</time_frame>
    <description>A mini nutritional assessment (MNA) was performed for all participants. The MNA uses 18 questions regarding simple measurements and a brief questionnaire involving an anthropometric assessment (weight, height and weight loss), a general assessment (lifestyle, medication and mobility), and a dietary assessment (number of meals, food and fluid intake, self-assessment of eating autonomy and self-perception of health and nutrition). Every answer give up to a maximum of 3 points. The sum of all points gives the total MNA. A maximum of 30 points can be achieved. A score of â‰¥ 24 points describes a well-nourished status. A score of 17 to 23.5 points indicates a risk of malnutrition, while less than 17 points indicates malnutrition.</description>
