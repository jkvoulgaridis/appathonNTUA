  <brief_summary>

      Background:

      Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) activates brain cells. When this happens, the cells
      produce brain waves. These can be recorded with electrodes on the scalp. This can tell us
      about how TMS works and how the brain functions. Researchers want to learn more about the
      technique by testing healthy adults.

      Objective:

      To better understand how to use transcranial magnetic stimulation plus electroencephalography
      (EEG) to study the brain of healthy adults.

      Eligibility:

      Healthy adults ages 18 35

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with a neurological exam.

      Participants will have 2-3 visits for a total duration of about 7/8 hours.

      Women of childbearing age must have a negative pregnancy test before each MRI scan.

      Visits may include:

      Physical exam

      Tests of attention, and thinking

      TMS. A brief electrical current will pass through a wire coil on the scalp. Participants will
      hear a click and may feel a pull. They may be asked to tense muscles or do tasks.

      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan for a maximum of 1 hour. Participants will lie on a
      table that slides into a cylinder in a strong magnetic field. They will do tasks on a
      computer screen or lie still. They will get earplugs for loud noise.

      EEG for no longer than 5 hours, with most lasting 3 hours. Gel and a cap with electrodes will
      be placed on the scalp. They will record brain waves while the participant gets TMS or does
      nothing.

      Questions about participants dominant hand and about the MRI.

      Objective

      The goal of this protocol to explore correlations between lateralized individual differences
      in visual attentional preference and hemispheric asymmetries in functional connectivity
      between the frontal and parietal visual attention areas. To measure functional connectivity,
      resting state functional MRI and electroencephalographic (EEG) potentials evoked with
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) will be used. Protocol research will also attempt to
      validate the TMS-evoked EEG potentials against fMRI resting state functional connectivity.

      Study Population

      Up to 80 right-handed and right-eyed healthy volunteers, aged 18-35

      Design

      TMS evoked EEG potentials (TEPs) and fMRI will be used to measure functional connectivity
      between the posterior parietal cortex and the frontal visual attention area. Various tasks
      will be used to quantify attention and explore their relationship with asymmetries in
      functional connectivity. A qualitative comparison between the value of fMRI and TEPs for
      predicting attentional bias will be made.

      Outcome Measures

        -  Behavioral measures of attention

        -  TEP measures of functional connectivity

        -  fMRI measures of functional connectivity
