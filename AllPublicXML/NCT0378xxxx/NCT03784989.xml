  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a post market clinical follow-up study and devices will carry the CE mark once the
      study is initiated.

      The investigational device is SenSura® Mio Kids, which is a flat ostomy device. The device is
      comprised by a baseplate connected to a bag. The coupling between baseplate and bag can be
      either welded together, referred to as a 1-piece (1P) system, or assembled as separate parts,
      referred to as a 2-piece (2P) system.

      The purpose of this research is to gather more information about how well the SenSura® Mio
      Kids ostomy device works, and how safe it is. This device has already been studied and
      approved to be used in the United States. It has a European CE-mark, which means it has met
      European health and safety requirements. SenSura® Mio Kids is a flat ostomy device that is
      made to be used for kids from 6 months up to 4 years of age.

      The reason for this study is to find out how well the new SenSura® Mio Kids device works
      compared to the standard of care device. We can learn about this by asking people who have
      used it about how well it worked and how comfortable it was.

      The Investigator/study nurse will decide whether the subject would benefit from switching to
      SenSura® Mio Kids and if so, the subject will be invited to take part in the study. The study
      design is observational. That means that the ostomy device, and the skin around the stoma,
      will be observed while receiving the stoma care they normally would. This study design will
      help the researchers see how well the device works when it is used in the usual way, and
      makes it easier for the people who are participating in the study.

        The population in this study are subjects from the age of 6 months (calculated from term
        age meaning 40 gestational weeks) to 4 years either with a colo-, ileo- or urostomy or a
        loop stoma, or two stomas placed closely together. Subjects can participate in the PMCF
        study if they fulfill the in-/exclusion criteria as listed in the tables below. However,
        the per protocol population only include 30 subjects as needed for the compara-tive
        performance evaluation (Group 1), and these subjects must fulfill inclusion criteria no. 3
        (subjects should use a competitor device).

             together

          2. Have given written informed consent (the legal authorized representative of the
             subject)

          3. Group 1 subjects should use a competitor device

        Exclusion Criteria:

        1) Are currently suffering from peristomal skin problems i.e. bleeding and/or broken skin
