  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A total of 160 cases of nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients who met the inclusion criteria were
      randomly assigned to two groups. The experimental group was given massage of maxillofacial
      and oral cavity plus routine oral care and functional exercise. The control group was given
      routine oral care and functional exercise. Analyze the difference of incidence of severe
      acute radioactive oral mucositis in these two groups.

    <textblock>
      160 nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to two groups in a
      1:1 ratio. The experimental group was given massage of maxillofacial and oral cavity plus
      routine oral care and functional exercise, the control group was only given routine oral care
      and functional exercise. Assess the condition of oral mucosa, according to the grading
      standard of RTOG acute radiation injury, everyday during radiotherapy. After radiotherapy,
      follow up the condition of oral mucosa one time per month for a total three times. Then
      analyze the incidence difference between two groups.

      massage method：The duration of the massage lasts from the first day of radiotherapy to three
      months after the end of radiotherapy，5 times a day（After getting up, before breakfast, lunch,
      dinner and going to bed). massage of maxillofacial includes the left and right cheeks, the
      upper jaw, the lower jaw, and around the mouth. Oral Massage includes the tongue, hard
      palate, the gums, and the bucca. Each part lasts 1-2min，repeating 3 cycles each time.
      Patients who could finished at least 75% are included in the statistical analysis.
