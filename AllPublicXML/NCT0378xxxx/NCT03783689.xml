  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if pain can be relieved by delivering small amounts
      of electricity (called &quot;electrical stimulation&quot;) to the nerves in an individual's amputated
      leg.This study will involve the use of a Peripheral Nerve Stimulation (PNS) System that is
      made by SPR Therapeutics (the sponsor of the study). The PNS System was cleared by the FDA
      for up to 60 days of use for the management of chronic pain, including extremity (leg) pain.

    <description>The Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) questionnaire has 13 questions that assess rumination, magnification, and helplessness. Subjects are asked to think back on painful experiences in the past and reflect on how often they had specific thoughts or feelings. Each of the 13 questions is scored on a 5-point scale where 0 represents &quot;not at all,&quot; and 4 represents &quot;all the time.&quot; The scores from each question are summed for each subject to provide a total PCS score, with a possible range from 0 to 52 with higher scores indicating a greater tendency to catastrophize pain (i.e. a higher score indicates a worse outcome). The median scores are then calculated across all subjects.</description>
