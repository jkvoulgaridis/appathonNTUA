    <measure>Change in Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation (BSSI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline Visit to End of Treatment Visit- approximately 3-4.5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Beck Scale is a 21-item self or clinician administered instrumentation used to measure the current intensity of patients' specific attitudes, behaviors and plans to commit suicide. Score range 0-42, with higher score indicating higher intensity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline Visit to End of Treatment Visit- approximately 3-4.5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The MADRS is a 10-item instrument used for the evaluation of depressive symptoms in adults and for the assessment of any changes to those symptoms. Higher MADRS score indicates more severe depression, and each item yields a score of 0 to 6. The overall score ranges from 0 to 60.</description>

    <measure>The Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology, Self-Report (QIDS-SR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline Visit to End of Treatment Visit- approximately 3-4.5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>QIDS-SR is a 16-item self-rated instrument designed to assess the severity of depressive symptoms present in the past seven days (Rush et al. 2003). The 16 items cover the nine symptom domains of major depression, and are rated on a scale of 0-3.</description>
