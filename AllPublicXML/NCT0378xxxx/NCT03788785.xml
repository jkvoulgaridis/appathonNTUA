  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) arise in the mucosa of the upper
      aero-digestive tract. They are the 6th most prevalent type of cancer worldwide. The risk
      related to tobacco is particularly high in the case of HNSCC, as the prevalence of heavy
      smoking for long periods is high in this population. The investigators' aim is to compare two
      models: one is a specific model of tobacco cessation intervention designed for health care
      teams treating patients with HNSCC; the other is the current standard of care for these
      patients, namely referral to external care after general advice on tobacco cessation. The
      investigators will evaluate the efficacy of this intervention 12 months after randomization.
      This intervention will be implemented into otolaryngology (ENT) care by training ENT nurses
      with a specific program for tobacco cessation delivered to patients diagnosed with HNSCC.

    <textblock>
      Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) arise in the mucosa of the upper
      aero-digestive tract. They are the 6th most prevalent type of cancer worldwide, with
      approximately 600 000 new cases every year. The investigators hypothesize that a
      specifically-designed tobacco cessation intervention initiated and driven by trained nurses
      of the health care team, either in the otolaryngology (ENT) department or in the radiotherapy
      department, is more efficient than a classic intervention based on the same pharmacological
      support during the hospital stay (NRT) followed by an orientation in an external smoking
      cessation center, while remaining feasible for both patients and caregivers.The health care
      setting represents an ideal place to initiate cessation interventions with smokers who are
      newly diagnosed with a malignancy. The investigators' aim is to compare two models: one is a
      specific model of tobacco cessation intervention designed for health care teams treating
      patients with HNSCC; the other is the current standard of care for these patients, namely
      referral to external care after general advice on tobacco cessation. The investigators will
      evaluate the efficacy of this intervention 12 months after randomization. This intervention
      will be implemented into otolaryngology (ENT) care by training ENT nurses with a specific
      program for tobacco cessation delivered to patients diagnosed with HNSCC.

    <description>Decrease in Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HAD) mean scores over time.
The HAD scale is a self-assessment scale for detecting states of depression and anxiety in the setting of an hospital medical outpatient clinic.
HADS is a self-administered scale of 14 items which assessed levels of depression and anxiety, divided into 2 subscales of 7 items (Anxiety or HADS-A, Depression or HADS-D). Each item is scored on a scale of 0 to 3. A score is generated for each of the two sub-scales (sum of the 7 items, ranging from 0 to 21). Limit scores, for each of the scores, distinguish: non-cases or asymptomatic ones (score ≤ 7); probable or borderline cases (score 8-10); clearly or clinically symptomatic cases (score ≥ 11).</description>

    <description>The EQ-5D-5L is composed of - the EQ-5D-5L descriptive system and the EQ Visual Analogue scale (EQ VAS). The descriptive system comprises 5 dimensions (mobility, self care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression). Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems. Each level corresponds to 1-digit number expressing the level selected for that dimension.
The EQ VAS corresponds to a 20 cm vertical, visual analogue scale raging from 'the best health you can imagine' to 'the worst health you can imagine'.</description>
