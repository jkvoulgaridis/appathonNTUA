  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open-label, 2-arm, non-randomized study of CPI-100 in patients with
      advanced tumors. CPI-100 is administered via intravenous infusion in a 3 + 3 study design to
      identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary Objectives:

      • To determine the safety, tolerability and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of CPI-100 as once
      every two weeks (Q2W) and once every three weeks (Q3W) regimens in patients with advanced
      tumors

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of CPI-100

        -  To evaluate clinical response and resolution of symptoms after CPI-100 treatment

        -  To characterize adverse events of CPI-100 monotherapy and CPI-100 in combination with
           capecitabine in patients with advanced cancers

      Up to 5 dose levels of CPI-100 Q2W, 4 dose levels of Q3W regimen of CPI-100 monotherapy (Q3W
      Arm A) and 4 dose levels of Q3W regimen of CPI-100 in combination with capecitabine (Q3W Arm
      B) will be tested in a dose escalation study. MTD will be defined as the dose associated with
      a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) in less than or equal to 33% of patients at the dose level
      tested. Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as one of the following events occurring from
      the intravenous injection of CPI-100 within 28 days (Q2W) or 42 days (Q3W):

        -  Grade 4 or greater treatment related adverse events

        -  Any Grade 3 or greater treatment related non-hematologic, non-dermatologic toxicity
           (including nausea, vomiting or diarrhea lasting more than 72 hours)
