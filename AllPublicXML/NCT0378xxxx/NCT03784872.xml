    <textblock>
      In women with retroverted retroverted uterus complaining of pelvic pain, Laparoscopy was
      done. Under vision the skin overlying the attachment of the round ligament to the anterior
      abdominal wall was incised followed by introduction of 30 curved needle attached to
      absorpable Vicryl 2/0 suture through the incision and withdrawn through grasper under
      laparoscopi vision. The needle was turned around the round ligament all through its length to
      plicate it then the needle was pushed again beside its entry side to appear at the skin
      incision. The same was repeated on the other side and both sutures were tied at the
      subcutaneous tissue simultaneously. then the laparoscopy was withdrawn followed by closure of
      the skin incision.

    <description>The visual analogue scale or visual analog scale (VAS) is a psychometric response scale which can be used in questionnaires. It is a measurement instrument for subjective characteristics or attitudes that cannot be directly measured. When responding to a VAS item, respondents specify their level of agreement to a statement by indicating a position along a continuous line between two endpoints.</description>
