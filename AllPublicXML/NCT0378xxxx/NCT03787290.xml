      Overall, the objective of this pilot study is to utilize the IL-6 receptor antagonist
      tocilizumab to prospectively evaluate the role of IL-6 in the antidepressant and
      immunological effects of whole body hyperthermia (WBH). The study seeks to replicate findings
      thus far that WBH has an antidepressant effect by administering the intervention at two sites
      not involved in studies to date. Moreover, the current proposal may help the investigators
      better understand the role of IL-6 in the pathogenesis and treatment of depression which
      might point to novel immune-based interventions for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Finally,
      the current proposal holds promise for better understanding of a novel treatment for MDD,
      which is among the leading causes of health-related disability in the world.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Major depressive disorder (MDD) is among the leading causes of overall global disease burden.
      Much of this burden derives from the fact that currently available pharmacologic modalities
      suffer from important shortcomings, including limited efficacy, delayed onset of action, and
      significant side effects that impair quality of life and promote treatment non-adherence
      and/or discontinuation. These factors provide ample incentive to continue the search for
      novel antidepressant methodologies that might maximize the benefits of these newer treatment
      modalities while minimizing their limitations. It is within this context that discoveries
      regarding the use of whole body hyperthermia (WBH) are of significant potential clinical
      relevance. The investigators' studies to date suggest that WBH produces a rapid and sustained
      antidepressant response with an extremely favorable side effect profile in medically-healthy
      patients with MDD. To follow up on evidence of the antidepressant effect of hyperthermia
      observed in animal models, the investigators conducted an open trial of WBH in humans. In 16
      medically-healthy adults with MDD, the investigators found that a single session of WBH
      induced a rapid, robust and sustained reduction in depressive symptom scores. Thirteen of the
      study participants received no other pharmacologic or psychotherapeutic intervention during
      the study period (pre-treatment and 5 days post-treatment), whereas 3 participants were
      receiving a stable dose prior to treatment with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor
      (SSRI) antidepressant (with no change in dosage during the study period). Interestingly, when
      looked at separately, WBH appeared to have no effect in these 3 individuals, and, in fact,
      worsened depressive symptoms in one of them. These findings are consonant with animal data
      from the investigators' group demonstrating that therapeutic doses of an SSRI (citalopram 20
      mg/kg) obviated the antidepressant-like effects of WBH.

      The investigators' group followed-up positive findings from this initial open trial with a
      randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled study of WBH. Confirming the investigators primary
      study hypothesis, participants in the active WBH group showed significantly reduced Hamilton
      Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) scores at one week post-treatment when compared to
      participants in the sham group. A similar advantage for active WBH at one week post-treatment
      was apparent based on self-reported Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology Self-Report
      (IDS-SR) scores which indicated that active WBH separated from sham beginning on day 3
      post-treatment. Contrary to the investigators' a priori hypothesis, the antidepressant effect
      of active WBH remained apparent out to 6 weeks post treatment when compared to sham. Based on
      HDRS scores, 60% (9 of 15) of the active WBH group met criteria for response and 40% (6 of
      15) met criteria for remission during at least one post-intervention assessment, compared
      with 7% (1 of 14) and 0% respectively for sham. Rates of adverse events were very low in both
      WBH and sham groups, with no differences between groups, except for increased adverse events
      at post-intervention week two in the sham group.

      With regards to the immunosuppressive effects of WBH, much of the investigators' prior work
      has focused on the role of inflammation in the etiology and treatment of MDD. Given this, in
      the investigators' initial randomized, sham-controlled, double-blind trial of WBH they
      examined the impact of WBH on inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor [TNF],
      interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1-beta). Based on extensive data from the investigators' group and
      many others indicating that the cytokines TNF and IL-6 have depressogenic potential and are
      elevated in MDD, the investigators sought to test the hypothesis that WBH would reduce plasma
      concentrations of these cytokines and that these reductions would be associated with improved
      mood. However, when compared to sham, WBH produced a striking acute increase in IL-6 that
      resolved completely by one-week post-intervention, while having no acute or chronic effect on
      TNF.

      Because IL-6 can come from multiple cell types in the body, and may have more of a
      proinflammatory vs. anti-inflammatory effect depending on whether it comes from immune cells
      (proinflammatory) or other tissues (i.e. adipocytes, muscle fibers, skin cells)
      (anti-inflammatory), the investigators measured plasma neopterin concentrations prior to, and
      following, the study interventions and at post-intervention weeks 1 and 4 simultaneous with
      the measurement of IL-6.

      The investigators next explored whether acute changes in IL-6 and/or neopterin were
      associated with the antidepressant effects of WBH. The investigators found that acute
      increases in both IL-6 and neopterin in response to WBH were associated with reduced
      self-reported depressive symptoms one week following the treatment. Smaller but similar
      associations were observed between this immune signal and reductions in clinician-rated HDRS
      scores at one-week post-treatment. Increased IL-6 and neopterin in response to WBH were also
      associated with increased positive emotion from beginning to conclusion of the procedure.

      Overall, the objective of this pilot study is to utilize the IL-6 receptor antagonist
      tocilizumab to prospectively evaluate the role of IL-6 in the antidepressant and
      immunological effects of WBH. The study will seek to replicate findings thus far that WBH has
      an antidepressant effect by administering the intervention at two sites not involved in
      studies to date. Moreover, the current proposal may help the investigators better understand
      the role of IL-6 in the pathogenesis and treatment of depression which might point to novel
      immune-based interventions for MDD . Finally, the current proposal holds promise for better
      understanding a novel treatment for MDD, which is among the leading causes of health-related
      disability in the world.

    <intervention_model_description>Randomization will be conducted by randomly permuted blocks of 4 with separate randomization schedules for each site. The randomization schedule for each site will be created by a statistician who has no other role in the study data collection or analysis. The randomization schedules will be sent directly from the statistician to each site's Research Pharmacy which will maintain the list. Qualifying study subjects will be assigned the next sequential treatment assignment on the randomization schedule, in the order they are randomized. Participants will be randomized on a 1-to-1 allocation to one of two study arms: 1) tocilizumab followed by whole body hyperthermia (WBH); or 2) placebo followed by whole body hyperthermia (WBH). At the time of randomization, the study coordinator will contact the Research Pharmacy at the site to complete the coded treatment assignment described below.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology Self-Report (IDS-SR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0 (Visit 2) to Week 1 (visit 3) [approximately 7 days]</time_frame>
    <description>The IDS-SR is a self-administered questionnaire assessing depressive severity. 30 questions focus on depressive symptoms experienced over the past 7 days. Each question is scored from 0-3, for a total minimum score of 0 and a total maximum score of 84 (appetite and weight items are split into two questions each, one for increase and one decrease, but counted once only, so there are effectively 28 items). Higher scores indicate more severe depression. Ranges correspond to depressive severity as follows: 0-13 = no or minimal depression; 14-25 = mild depression; 26-38 = moderate depression; 39-48 = severe depression; 49-84 = very severe depression. A decrease of 50% or more in the score is considered to be a response to treatment, while a final score of 11 or less is considered remission. Primary study outcomes will be between-group differences (tocilizumab vs. placebo) in total IDS-SR score change from Week 0 (Visit 2) to Week 1 (visit 3).</description>
