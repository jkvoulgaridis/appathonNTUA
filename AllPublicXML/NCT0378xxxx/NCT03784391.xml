  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The researchers in this trial want to analyze prerecorded patient data which provide
      information on benefits of the drug nifurtimox in patients with a sudden (acute) and long
      lasting (chronic) Chagas´ disease an illness caused by parasites mostly transmitted to humans
      by a bug. They also want to learn how often organs, especially the heart, are affected by the
      illness in treated and untreated chronic Chaga's patients. In order to find this out medical
      records of adult and pediatric patients in Argentina will be analyzed.

        The study population will comprise adult and pediatric patients diagnosed with Chagas'
        disease, respectively, who were treated with nifurtimox (nifurtimox groups). An untreated
        reference group comprising adult patients diagnosed with chronic Chagas' disease, who did
        not receive antitrypanosomal treatment will be considered.

          -  Diagnosis of Chagas' disease confirmed by parasitological and/or serological method(s)
             before start of antitrypanosomal treatment or during the course of this
