    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common and frequently-occurring disease. The incidence of
      OSA is more than 4% in general population, and as high as 20% - 40% in the elderly. At
      present, CPAP machines commonly used for OSA treatment includes traditional pressure fixed
      single-level CPAP machine and automatic pressure regulation CPAP machine. Studies have shown
      that the CPAP treatment pressure of OSA patients is normally below 11 cmH2O. Since the
      condition of OSA patients and the required CPAP treatment pressure may change over time, a
      CPAP machine with automatic pressure regulation function may theoretically better meet the
      needs of treatment. However, a recent large-scale clinical study with an average follow-up of
      four years showed that there was little need to change CPAP treatment pressure after
      titration. Although different types of CPAP have different functions, the basic principle is
      to keep the upper airway open and unobstructed to eliminate sleep apnea and hypopnea by
      continuously applying positive pressure to the upper respiratory tract through an air pump. A
      complex CPAP machine with functions such as pressure regulation, boost delay, end-expiratory
      pressure release will cost more than a single-function CPAP machine. Some patients from poor
      areas, even with severe OSA, may give up treatment when they can not afford CPAP machines
      that have not yet been included in national health insurance in China. In view of the current
      economic level in China, it is urgent to find an inexpensive and effective CPAP machine for
      the treatment of OSA and related complications. Recently, Guangzhou Yinghui Medical
      Technology Co., Ltd.and State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease have developed a new
      simple CPAP machine. The CPAP treatment pressure is fixed at the factory to 6 cm H2O (SKL), 8
      cm H2O (SKM) and 10 cm H2O (SKH). Compared to traditional CPAP machine, only a power switch
      button is attached on the body, and the additional adjustment devices including display
      screen are removed, which not only reduces the cost of the CPAP machine, but also facilitates
      the operation of patients.

      Study Design: A randomized, cross-over and double blind study . Objective: To investigate the
      efficacy of simple device of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in the treatment of
      obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Methods: A randomized, cross-over and double blind study would
      be performed on 100 OSA patients using both simple CPAP and traditional CPAP during overnight
      polysomnography. Pressure for CPAP treatment would be manual titrated. The sleep apnea
      hypopnea index (AHI), arousal index (ArI), Oxygen desaturation Index (ODI), sleep structure
      and the preference of CPAP model were to be observed.
