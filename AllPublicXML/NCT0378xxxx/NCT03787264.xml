    <textblock>
      CLL2-BAAG is a prospective, open-label, multicenter phase-II trial to evaluate the efficacy
      and safety of a sequential regimen of debulking with bendamustine followed by induction and
      maintenance with GA101 (obinutuzumab), acalabrutinib (ACP-196) and venetoclax (ABT-199) in
      patients with relapsed/refractory CLL.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the CLL2-BAAG trial will be included a total of 46 patients with relapsed or refractory
      CLL in need of treatment.This trial will evaluate a debulking with two cycles bendamustine
      (only for patients with a higher tumor load), followed by an induction and a maintenance
      treatment with obinutuzumab, acalabrutinib and venetoclax in patients with
      re-lapsed/refractory CLL. The duration of maintenance treatment is depending on MRD levels.
      This trial combines one old (chemotherapy) and three novel, synergistic (antibody,
      BTK-inhibitor and Bcl-2 antagonist) principles of action in order to achieve deep and long
      lasting remissions with a short duration of treatment. Additionally, this trial has an
      extensive accompanying scientific program aiming at a better understanding of the kinetics of
      response and clonal evolution of CLL.
