    <textblock>
      women candidate for ICSI and having ovarian endometrioma smaller than 5 cm will be randomized
      to either transvaginal aspiration alone or transvaginal aspiration follwed by injection of
      small parts of oxidized regenerated cellulose within the cyst cavity during the cycle that
      preceded the induction cycle of ICSI

      women candidate for ICSI and having ovarian endometrioma smaller than 5 cm will be randomized
      to either transvaginal aspiration alone or transvaginal aspiration follwed by injection of
      small parts of oxidized regenerated cellulose within the cyst cavity during the cycle that
      preceded the induction cycle of ICSI.

      Transvaginal aspiration will be done under ultrasonographic guidance with spinal needle
      insertion inside the cyst cavity followed by aspiration of the chocolate material from the
      cyst &amp; then irrigation of the cyst cavity with normal saline solution till complete
      elimination of the chocolate material. The needle will be withdrawn in women in non-Surgicel
      group while injection of small pieces of surgicel inside the cyst cavity will be done for
      women in the surgicel group followed by withdrawal of the needle.

    <description>Candidates for the standard long protocol received triptorelin 0.1 mg Subcutanous daily starting from day 21 of the previous cycle. On the second day of the stimulation cycle, pituitary downregulation was confirmed. Controlled ovarian stimulation was then started on day 3 using Human Menopausal Gonadotropin (Menogon; Ferring). The dose of gonadotropin was individualized. The patients were monitored with serial ultrasound and serum E2. When at least 3 follicles reached 18 mm, ovulation was triggered using Human Chorionic Gonadotropin 10000 IU (Epifasi 10000 IU; Eipico, Tenth of Ramadan, Egypt) IM and ovum pickup was performed 35 hours later.
All cases received luteal support in the form of progesterone 400 mg twice daily. Embryo transfer was done on day 3 or 5 using Labotect semi-rigid catheter (Labotect GmbH, Kassel area, Germany) under abdominal ultrasound guidance.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subfertile women indicated for ICSI

          -  having a single endometrioma of less than 5 cm with typical sonographic criteria; a
             cyst with 1 to 4 locules and ground glass appearance of the cyst fluid with no
             papillary projections and no or minimal vascularization of the cyst capsule. Since
             endometriotic cysts measuringmore than 1 cm are readily diagnosed by ultrasound,25 we
             chose a diameter of 2 cm as the lower limit to declare a cyst as endometrioma.

          -  All cases had a normal uterine cavity demonstrated by ultrasonography and
             hysteroscopy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  bilateral or multiple endometriomas, lesions of more than 5 cm or showing atypical
             sonographic features presence of uterine pathology (eg, polyp or fibroid)

          -  follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) of more than 10,

          -  body mass index of more than 30, age more than 40 years,

          -  cases who received previous GnRH therapy for treatment of endometriosis within 12
             months of the study

          -  patients who received oral contraceptive pills or any form of hormones for the
             previous 3 months,

          -  patients with previous surgical resection of endometrioma

          -  severe male factor.
