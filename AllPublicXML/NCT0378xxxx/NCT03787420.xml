  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to develop a smart communication system for patients with amyotrophic
      lateral sclerosis (ALS), especially for stage 3 and stage 4 (late stage). Patients with ALS
      will be able to communicate with outer environment by means of mental control or eye tracking
      control, which would increase their life quality. This integrated research project includes
      experts from different domains and proposes a solution for smart communication system.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A multi-function brain- computer interface (BCI) communication system will be developed by
      combining a BCI system (subproject 1) and a 3D electro-cap (subproject 3). Then, this system
      and an eye-controlled device (subject 2) are further integrated to a smart communication
      system. The outputs of the system are presented with the original voice the ALS patients,
      which will be achieved by using the voice reconstruction technology (subproject 4) in this
      project. All the user-interfaces of the BCI and eye tracking systems will be re-deigned by
      employing human factors engineering to increase the usability of the proposed smart
      communication system for ALS. Finally, the validity of the system in improving the life
      quality of ALS will be assessed through clinical study.

        Part one:

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  ALS diagnostic criteria (Brooks et al., 2000).Must have the following characteristics:

               1. Degeneration of motor neurons (LMN) by clinical, electrophysiological or
                  neuropathological evidence.

               2. Degeneration of upper motor neurons (UMN) is demonstrated by clinical
                  examination.

               3. According to the medical history or examination, the symptoms or signs gradually
                  disappear in a certain part.

        Also, there are no features:

          1. Electrophysiological or pathological evidence of other diseases that may explain signs
             of LMN and/or UMN degradation

          2. Neuroimaging evidence of other diseases that may explain the observed clinical
             electrophysiological signs.
