  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will mainly focus on Middle and old-aged adults, and examine whether
      Cardiovascular and metabolic risks can be reduced. In the meanwhile, this project will
      develop strategies for improving muscle loss , muscle strength decline, and the quality life
      of the elderly.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular diseases are common among the elder. However, previous researches mainly focus
      on observational research or small scale clinical trial, and the subjects are mainly youth.
      Therefore, this project hope to understand whether Oligonol can reduce Cardiovascular and
      metabolic risks among senior adults. Consequently,improve muscle loss muscle strength
      decline, quality of old adults life. This project design may potentially develop new
      strategies for curing Sarcopenia as well.
