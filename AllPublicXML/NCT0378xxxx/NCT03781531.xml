  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Venous thromboembolism is a common and serious complication in cancer, and is associated with
      a substantially increased morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, VTE may be the earliest sign
      of cancer. Recent studies, however, fail to show a clinical benefit of extended cancer
      screening in this patient population. Better risk prediction models are therefore warranted
      to identify VTE patients who would benefit from a rapid and extensive cancer screening.
      Inflammation and hypercoagulability are considered hallmarks of cancer, and emerging light is
      being shed on the potential of various markers of inflammation and coagulation in cancer
      diagnostics and prognostics. Among the inflammatory and thrombotic processes linked to cancer
      is the neutrophil release of web-like nuclear chromatin (DNA and histones), referred to as
      neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Driven by the tumor environment, NETs have recently
      been shown to play a central role in tumor progression, metastasis, and tumor-associated
      thrombosis.

      The investigators hypothesize that an enhanced inflammatory state may be predictive of an
      underlying cancer in patients presenting with VTE. The present study is an ongoing
      prospective study with the primary aim to investigate the diagnostic potential of markers of
      inflammation, including markers of NETs, in detecting occult cancer in patients presenting
      with VTE. Secondary aims are to include other biomarkers of cancer, and to assess whether any
      or a combination of these biomarkers may be prognostic of occult cancer, recurrent thrombotic
      events, mortality, or cancer disease progression in VTE patients with an underlying
      malignancy.
