  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a two-arm trial, comparing the effects of a 12-week GMCB exercise intervention
      vs. a 1:1 individually supervised exercise intervention on PA maintenance in colorectal
      cancer survivors, and explore multi-level determinants of PA maintenance, 12-months after
      intervention completion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be prospectively assigned or allocated to either a GMCB exercise
      intervention or 1:1 supervised exercise (i.e. personal training) for 12 weeks. Supervised
      exercise sessions will take place twice per week for approximately one hour, and include
      aerobic, muscular strength and endurance, balance, and flexibility components. Exercise will
      be individualised based on the results of baseline fitness assessments and medical history,
      and will be modified to accommodate ostomy or stoma (e.g. refrain from exercises that
      increase intraabdominal pressure to avoid herniation, avoid crunching or curling motions with
      colostomy bag).In the GMCB intervention, group size will be 5-15 participants to optimize
      social interaction, and activities will be structured so that participants come in close
      proximal distance of each other at least once per session (e.g. circuit training, squat with
      ball toss to a partner). There will be scheduled opportunities for social interaction (e.g.
      water breaks at least 3 times during class, partner 'get to know you' questions during
      aerobic exercise, etc.), and group roles will be assigned for class participants (e.g.
      leading warm up or stretching). Discussion sessions will be based on Social Cognitive Theory,
      and will target PA maintenance. In both groups, discussion sessions will last 30-60 minutes,
      and will be held following an exercise session in Weeks 1, 4, 7, 9, and 12. Topics will
      include benefits of PA specific to colorectal cancer survivors, identifying and overcoming
      barriers to PA, and strategies for independent exercise (e.g. goal setting, self-monitoring).
      In the GMCB intervention, discussion sessions will be group-based, and further facilitate
      group cohesion via activities such as personal introductions, group PA goal setting, group
      problem solving, creation of a group name/identity, and design of group t-shirts.

    <description>Compare the efficacy of a 12-week physical activity intervention delivered in group versus one-on-one, on long-term physical activity adherence. Physical activity will be measured with a self-report questionnaire (duration and frequency of moderate and vigorous physical activity) and accelerometer.</description>

    <description>Aerobic fitness will be assessed with a submaximal, graded exercise test on a motorized, calibrated treadmill. Muscular Strength &amp; Endurance will be assessed by multiple repetition maximum (1RM) plate loaded seated bench press and leg press, and by the number of full stands from a chair, and the number of bicep curls (holding a hand weight of 5lbs) that can be completed in 30 seconds.</description>
