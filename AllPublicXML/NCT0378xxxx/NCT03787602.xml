      This study evaluates KRT-232, a novel oral small molecule inhibitor of MDM2, for the
      treatment of patients with Merkel Cell Carcinoma (MCC) who have failed treatment with at
      least one anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy. Inhibition of MDM2 is a novel mechanism of
      action in MCC.

      This study is Phase 2, Open-Label, Study of KRT-232 in Patients with p53 Wild-Type (p53WT)
      Merkel Cell Carcinoma

             lesion by RECIST 1.1

          -  MCC expressing p53WT based on any CLIA or FDA approved test

          -  Patients must have failed (i.e., relapsed or were refractory to) treatment with at
             least one PD-1 inhibitor or PD-L1 inhibitor for MCC

          -  Fresh or archival tumor tissue must be submitted for biomarker assessment. Archival
             tissue samples must have been obtained from biopsy performed ≤ 2 years before the date

               1. Hematologic: ANC ≥1.0 × 109/L in the absence of growth factors during the prior 7
                  days; platelet count ≥100 × 109/L

               2. Hepatic: total bilirubin ≤2.0 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), unless
                  Gilbert's Syndrome; aspartate transaminase/serum glutamic oxaloacetic
                  transaminase (AST/SGOT) and alanine transaminase/serum glutamic pyruvic

               3. Renal: estimated creatinine clearance &gt;30 mL/min by Cockcroft Gault:

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Concurrent anticancer treatment such as chemotherapy, cytoreductive therapy, immune
             therapy, or cytokine therapy within 28 days or approximately 5 half-lives, whichever
             is shorter, prior to the first dose of KRT-232

          -  Radiation therapy within 2 weeks prior to the first dose of KRT-232

          -  Toxicity from prior radiation therapy that has not resolved to National Cancer
             Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Grade 0 or Grade
             1 (with the exception of Grade 2 alopecia)

          -  Participation in another interventional clinical trial within the past 4 weeks of the
             first dose of KRT-232
