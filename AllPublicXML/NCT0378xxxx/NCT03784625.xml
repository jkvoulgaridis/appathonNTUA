    <textblock>
      This study is a phase I clinical trial aimed to determine the recommended dose of
      [131I]ICF01012 to administer for the treatment of patients with pigmented metastatic melanoma
      (binding [131I]ICF01012 ). The [131I]ICF01012 is a targeted radionuclide therapy with a high
      affinity for melanin.

      This study will include a maximum of 36 patients. This study will begin with a preselection
      part that consists of an injection of [131I]ICF01012 at a diagnostic dose (185 MBq) in order
      to preselect patients who will receive the therapeutic dose according to the dosimetry
      results : binding of [131I]ICF01012 on at least a tumoral lesion and an acceptable radiation
      absorbed dose to major organs.

      The second phase will consist of a therapeutic part with a single administration of
      [131I]ICF01012 at a therapeutic dose. This part is a dose escalation model (4 levels of
      therapeutic dose were tested)
