      Background: To determine the performance of delta shock index (ΔSI), a change in shock index
      (SI) upon arrival at the emergency room (ER) from that in the field in predicting the need
      for massive transfusion (MT) among adult trauma patients with stable blood pressure.

      Methods: This study included data from all trauma patients aged 20 years and above who were
      hospitalized from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2016 and was obtained from the registered
      trauma database of the hospital. Only patients who were transferred by emergency medical
      service from the accident site with a systolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mm Hg at the ER were
      included in this study. The 7,957 enrolled trauma patients were divided into 2 groups, those
      who had received blood transfusion ≥ 10 U (MT, n = 82) and those who had not (non-MT, n =
      7,875). The odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals for associated patient conditions and
      the odds of need for MT by a given ΔSI were measured. The plot of specific receiver operating
      characteristic (ROC) curves was used to evaluate the best cutoff point that could predict the
      patient's probability of receiving MT.
