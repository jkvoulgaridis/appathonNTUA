  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brain metastases (BM) are the most prevalent tumors of the central nervous system (CNS), with
      a ratio of 10: 1 in relation to primary tumors. In prospective studies, whole-brain
      radiotherapy (WBRT) reduced the risk of local recurrence after resection of brain metastases
      from 46-59% to 10-28%. Furthermore, WBRT reduces the incidence of new metastases and death
      from disease, but no apparent improvement in overall survival (OS). Due to the potential
      neurocognitive effects associated with WBRT compared to isolated focal approach, several
      authors have suggested delaying WBRT and perform focal adjuvant RT after resection of
      isolated BM. In this context, intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) in the cavity after
      resection of BM may be an appealing option.

      The primary objectives of this study are evaluate local control and the control of brain
      disease in patients with oligometastatic brain disease (up to 4 lesions) submitted to focal
      IORTto an isolated surgical cavity.

      Brain metastases (BM) are the most prevalent tumors of the central nervous system (CNS), with
      a ratio of 10: 1 in relation to primary tumors. This type of metastasis occurs in 20-40% of
      cancer patients and are related to significant morbidity and mortality.

      In prospective studies, whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) reduced the risk of local recurrence
      after resection of brain metastases from 46-59% to 10-28%. Furthermore, WBRT reduces the
      incidence of new metastases and death from disease, but no apparent improvement in overall
      survival (OS). Due to the potential neurocognitive effects associated with WBRT compared to
      isolated focal approach, several authors have suggested delaying WBRT and perform focal
      adjuvant RT after resection of isolated BM.

      The utilization of intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) in the cavity after resection of
      primary or BM has been described in the literature, the majority of reports describes
      performing brachytherapy with iodine seeds or interstitial radiosurgery. However, there is a
      paucity of information regarding the use of IORT with low energy X-ray for focal treatment
      after resection of brain BM.

      The objectives of this study are evaluate local control (LC), the control of brain disease in
      patients with oligometastatic brain disease (up to 4 lesions) submitted to focal IORT to an
      isolated surgical cavity, evaluate overall survival (OS), evaluate the frequency of radiation
      necrosis and correlate the prognostic factors related to the patient with OS and the
      parameters of the treatment (dose, volume, lesion location) with the LC and radiation
      necrosis.

    <description>Intraoperative Radiotherapy with a mobile device (Intrabeam, Carl Zeiss AG) consisting of a small source of low energy x-rays (30-50 kV) mounted on a mechanical arm with six degrees of freedom. The resulting dose distribution is isotropic around the tip of the X-ray source. A set of spherical applicators with diameters ranging from 1.5 to 5 cm is available to connect to the source. The treatment time may vary from 20-30 minutes with the suggested dose of 18 Gy to the resection cavity to a depth of 1 mm.</description>
