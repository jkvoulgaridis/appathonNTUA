      Single arm, single site, open-label Phase II study of the effects of oral olaparib in
      participants with metastatic renal cell carcinoma that harbor an inactivating mutation in
      BAP-1, ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, CHEK2, BRIP1, RAD51C, BARD1, CDK12, CHEK1, FANCL, PP2R2A,
      RAD51B, RAD51D, or RAD54L who have had prior treatment with at least one immune checkpoint
      inhibitor or anti-VEGF therapy. Must have measurable disease on CT imaging per RECIST 1.1
      criteria.

      The trial will enroll up to 20 participants. Following enrollment, participants will be
      initially treated with olaparib 150mg by mouth twice daily for one month. After one month of
      therapy, the dose of olaparib will be increased to 300mg by mouth twice daily provided there
      are no grade 3 or greater adverse events experienced. All participants will be reassessed at
      least monthly for toxicity, including laboratory investigations. Radiological scans will be
      performed approximately every 3 months to assess for disease response. Treatment will be
      continued until clinical and/or radiographic progression according to RECIST 1.1 criteria or
      unmanageable toxicity requiring cessation.

    <description>Olaparib is a crystalline solid, is non-chiral and shows pH-independent solubility of approximately 0.1 mg/mL across the physiological range. Olaparib is presented for oral administration as a green, film-coated tablet containing 25 mg, 100 mg or 150 mg of drug substance. The 100 mg strength is also available as a yellow, film-coated tablet. The 25 mg, 100 mg and 150 mg strengths of olaparib tablets are composed of the same constituents. The tablet cores comprise: olaparib, copovidone, colloidal silicon dioxide, mannitol and sodium stearyl fumarate. The composition of the green tablet film coating is: hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (hypromellose), macrogol 400 (polyethylene glycol 400), titanium dioxide, iron oxide yellow and iron oxide black. The yellow tablet film coating only differs from the green film coating with the omission of iron oxide black.</description>

             registration, and that the patient remains free of recurrent or metastatic disease.

          -  Patients with symptomatic uncontrolled brain metastases. A scan to confirm the absence
             of brain metastases is not required. The patient can receive a stable dose of
             corticosteroids before and during the study as long as these were started at least 4
             weeks prior to treatment. Patients with spinal cord compression unless considered to

             for 28 days.

          -  Previous allogenic bone marrow transplant or double umbilical cord blood
             transplantation (dUCBT).

          -  Judgment by the investigator that the patient should not participate in the study if
             the patient is unlikely to comply with study procedures, restrictions and
             requirements.

          -  Breast feeding women.

          -  Use of any prohibited concomitant medications within the prior 2 weeks.

          -  Involvement in the planning and/or conduct of the study (applies to both AstraZeneca
             staff and/or staff at the study site).

          -  Participation in another clinical study with an investigational product during the
             last 2 weeks.

          -  Patients receiving any systemic chemotherapy or radiotherapy (except for palliative
             reasons) within 3 weeks prior to study treatment.

          -  Any previous treatment with PARP inhibitor, including olaparib.

          -  Resting ECG with QTc &gt; 500 ms and/or indication of uncontrolled cardiac conditions, as
             judged by the investigator (e.g. unstable ischemia, uncontrolled symptomatic
             arrhythmia, congestive heart failure, electrolyte disturbances, etc.), or patients
             with congenital and/or family history of long QT syndrome.

          -  Concomitant use of known strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g. itraconazole, telithromycin,
             clarithromycin, protease inhibitors boosted with ritonavir or cobicistat, indinavir,

             ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, diltiazem, fluconazole, verapamil). The required washout
             period prior to starting olaparib is 2 weeks. During the study, if co-administration
             of a strong or moderate inhibitor is required because there is no suitable alternative
             medication, exception to this criterion may be allowed with a suitable dose reduction
             of olaparib.

          -  Concomitant use of known strong CYP3A inducers (e.g. phenobarbital, phenytoin,
             rifampicin, rifabutin, rifapentine, carbamazepine, nevirapine and St John's Wort) or
             moderate CYP3A inducers (e.g. bosentan, efavirenz, modafinil). The required washout
             period prior to starting olaparib is 5 weeks for phenobarbital or enzalutamide and 3
             weeks for other agents.

             systemic disease or active, uncontrolled infection. Examples include, but are not
             limited to, uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia, recent (within 3 months) myocardial
             infarction, uncontrolled major seizure disorder, extensive interstitial bilateral lung
             disease on High Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) scan or any psychiatric disorder
             that prohibits obtaining informed consent.

          -  Unable to swallow orally administered medication and patients with gastrointestinal
             disorders likely to interfere with absorption of the study medication.

          -  Immunocompromised patients, e.g., patients who are known to be serologically positive
             for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

          -  Known hypersensitivity to olaparib or any of the excipients of the product.

          -  Known active hepatitis (i.e. Hepatitis B or C) due to risk of transmitting the
             infection through blood or other body fluids.

             to study entry.
