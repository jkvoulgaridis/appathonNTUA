      Kırıkkale University Faculty of Medicine Physical Therapy will be hospitalized in the USA
      clinic and volunteers will be involved in stroke rehabilitation. The patients who meet the
      inclusion criteria and who are excluded from the exclusion criteria will be randomized
      according to the order of arrival and will be divided into two groups as the education group
      and the control group. Patients will be taken to the control and study group respectively in
      order of arrival. If the next patient falls outside the inclusion criteria of the study,
      randomization will be applied to the next patient. Patients in the control group will be
      given routine conventional physiotherapy in 4-week and 60-minute sessions. The training group
      will be given routine conventional physiotherapy in 4-week and 45-minute sessions.In
      addition, after three sessions a week, 3 times a week in the supine position on both sides of
      the foot base with a 15-100 Hz vibration device will be applied to the soles of the foot for
      15 minutes. Individuals before; age, gender, marital status, nutritional characteristics,
      habits, smoking and alcohol, auxiliary devices, background information, family history,
      educational status, social security, previous or current occupation, frequency of fall, cause
      of fall and drugs used will be questioned. Static and dynamic equilibrium parameters will be
      evaluated at the beginning of the study and at the end of the 4th week.

    <intervention_model_description>30 stroke patients will be included in this study. The patients who meet the inclusion criteria will be divided randomly into 2 groups as study (n=15) and control (n=15). Patients in study group received 45-min conventional physiotherapy session for 5-days in a week, over 4-week. Each physiotherapy sessions will consist of range of motion and strengthening exercises, exercises such as activities of daily living, mobility and transfer activities. In addition after 45-min conventional physiotherapy session for 3-days in 5-days, while each patient in study group is supine position, plantar vibration will be applied to both foot of each patient with a vibration device with a frequency of 15-100 Hz over 7.5-min. Patients in the control group received 60-min conventional pysiotherapy session for 5-days in a week, over 4-week. Each physiotherapy session will consist of range of motion and strengthening exercises, exercises such as activities of daily living, mobility and transfer activities.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mini-Mental State Test</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minute</time_frame>
    <description>It was used to determine the cognitive state before the training. The Mini-Mental State Test was first published by Folstein et al. It consists of eleven items under 5 main headings: orientation, record memory, attention and calculation, recall and language, and the total score is evaluated over 30 points. The ideal threshold value of the Mini-Mental State Test was found to be 24.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Time Up and Go Test</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minute</time_frame>
    <description>This test is applied to assess the risk of falling and mobility.This test starts with the individual leaving the chair without receiving arm support by giving the go command while sitting in a chair.The distance of 3 meters is asked to return and sit again in the chair.The elapsed time is recorded in seconds.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Berg Balance Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minute</time_frame>
    <description>It is a 14-item scale that evaluates the tasks used in daily life activities.Standing up without support, standing without support, sitting without support, standing up, transfers, standing with feet, standing with legs while standing, reaching out while standing, picking up from the ground, looking back, 360 degree rotation, firm side standing on the stool, one foot standstill and standstill functions are evaluated.Each item is planned between 0-4; 0 is unable to fulfill the task, 4 is to fulfill the task successfully. The total score of the test is between 0-56.0-20 points: wheelchair dependent, 21-40: assisted walking, 41-56: means independent ambulation.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Trunk Impairment Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minute</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluate the motor loss in trunk after stroke.It is a scale consisting of 17 items.3 items assess the static sitting balance, dynamic balance with 10 items, coordination with 4 items.The score is 0-23.The highest score is considered the best performance.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional Reach Test</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minute</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will asked to stand comfortably, to make a fist, and to raise their arm until it was parallel to the yardstick (position 1). The placement of the end of the third metacarpal along the yardstick will recorded. Subjects will then asked to reach as far forward as they could without losing their balance (position 2), and the position of the end of the third metacarpal along the yardstick will again recorded. No attempt will make to control the subject's method of reach, but if he will touch the wall or took a step during the maneuver, that trial will consider invalid and repeated.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>10 Meter Walk Tests</measure>
    <time_frame>3 minute</time_frame>
    <description>Walking speed are measure by timing subjects over 10 meters with a stopwatch. To avoid the effects of acceleration and deceleration, measurements take over the middle 10 meters of a 14-meter walkway. It is repeated 2 times.</description>
