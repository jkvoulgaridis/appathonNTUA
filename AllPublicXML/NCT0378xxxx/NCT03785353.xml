  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain Neuroscience Education (PNE) has been shown to be effective to alter beliefs and
      decrease pain among individuals with musculoskeletal pain. Additionally, PNE has been shown
      to alter beliefs among middle school children. This study plans to assess the effects of PNE
      within a group of Spanish-speaking individuals.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain is a topic of discussion that is becoming increasingly prevalent among
      healthcare professionals. With the ever-growing opioid epidemic, there are a variety of
      discussions on different modes of treatment other than opioid prescription. Pain neuroscience
      education, or PNE, is one of these alternative treatment options. PNE focuses on a patient's
      understanding of pain itself and relates this to the current pain they are experiencing. PNE
      is often a discussion between provider and patient that utilizes a series of stories,
      metaphors, and examples where pain is described from a point of view that is not strictly
      medical. Recent literature suggests there is a lack of knowledge regarding pain in the United
      States, particularly in the Spanish-speaking population. This population is also less likely
      to seek a physician's advice for pain management. For these reasons, this study will focus on
      the Spanish-speaking population within the Winchester community. Due to success within prior
      PNE studies, this study will be conducted through a classroom lecture. The overarching
      purpose of this study is to examine the change in knowledge of pain in the Spanish-speaking
      population immediately following a PNE lecture composed of stories, metaphors, and examples
      about pain. Because Spanish-speaking individuals are less likely to seek out a medical
      provider, the study may support an additional treatment option for managing chronic pain. Not
      only will this provide further research to support the benefits of PNE, but there is the
      potential to modify a participant's perception of their own pain through this educational
      lecture.

    <intervention_model_description>Participants will arrive at a location TBD on the day of data collection. Consent forms will be dispersed to participants, who will be able to ask any questions they may have before signing. A Spanish-speaking researcher will be available to answer those questions. After consent is received, each participant will draw a random number that will be used to link their responses to pre- and post-lecture surveys. After consent is received, a pre-test on pain knowledge and beliefs will be administered. A 30-minute Pain Neuroscience Education (PNE) lecture will be given to participants in Spanish. A post-test on pain knowledge and beliefs will be administered.</intervention_model_description>
