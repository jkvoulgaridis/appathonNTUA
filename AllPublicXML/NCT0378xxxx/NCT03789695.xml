  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Kidney function in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) is tending to decline over a time
      which is clearly demonstrated in clinical studies. Taking into account that renal impairment
      is a risk factor for stroke and its progression is associated with unfavorable prognosis it's
      clear that preserving kidney function should be considered as a one of priorities when
      choosing treatment strategies which is especially important in patients with existing chronic
      kidney disease or in patients who are under risk of its development. This is especially
      relevant for the patients with Diabetes mellitus and with Chronic kidney disease who can be
      considered as a group of risk of rapid progression of kidney function decline.
