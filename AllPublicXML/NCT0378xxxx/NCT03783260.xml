  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project proposes to characterise the microbiome-derived metabolites produced upon
      ingestion of bioactive precursor-rich meals by healthy volunteers in order to investigate the
      relationship between gut microbiome composition and the nature of dietary metabolites
      production.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a large inter-individual variability in gut microbiome-derived metabolites
      production upon ingestion of similar meals. Since many of these microbiome-derived
      metabolites have enteric and systemic biological effects, these variabilities could in part
      account for the different responses to meals and diets.

      This project thus aims to improve the understanding the relationship between gut microbiome
      composition and the nature of dietary metabolites produced from similar bioactive
      precursor-rich meals.

      The investigators therefore propose to characterise the circulating microbiome-derived
      metabolite profiles in healthy individuals fed the same 2-day precursor-rich Mediterranean
      diet prior to and after a 2-week of habitual Canadian diet feeding.

    <description>Plasma and urine metabolomics profiling of gut-microbiome derived metabolites (e.g., branched-chain amino acids [BCAA], short chain fatty acids [SCFA], trimethylamine [TMA], amino acids- and polyphenol-metabolites) will also performed at the same time points.</description>

    <description>Fecal microbiome composition will be characterise by rRNA 16S sequencing prior to and following both 2-day Mediterranean diet periods. Relevant indexes of microbiome diversity (e.g. Shannon beta-diversity), ratios between meaningful bacterial markers of gut dysbiosis (e.g. Firmicutes:Bacteroidetes) and specific microbiome differences in bacterial Families, Genera or species between study periods and individuals.</description>

    <description>Interindividual variations in the endocannabinoid levels following a 2-day Mediterranean diet intervention according to individual gut microbiome composition will also be characterised. N-acyl ethanolamines, acylglycerols and omega-3 derived endocannabinoids will be quantified by LC MS-MS in plasma and urine samples collected prior to and following both 2-day Mediterranean diet periods.</description>
