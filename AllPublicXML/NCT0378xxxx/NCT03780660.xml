  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Volume expansion (VE) is often administered in intensive care (ICU)-patient to improve
      arterial oxygen delivery. Such effect is secondary to an increase in stroke volume and
      cardiac output. However, cardiac output increase in response to VE (fluid responsiveness)
      only occurs when the heart is preload-dependant. Increasing evidence of the deleterious
      effects of inappropriate fluid administration encourages the development of variables
      predicting fluid responsiveness, but few have been validated in spontaneously breathing
      patients.

      Central venous pressure (CVP) variation in spontaneously patients during standardized or
      unstandardized inspiratory maneuver may represent an easy tool to predict fluid
      responsiveness. The hypothesise is that inspiratory maneuver may increase CVP variation in
      fluid responsiveness patient whereas no or few variation may reflect fluid unresponsiveness.
