  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective controlled study is to obtain a multi-center safety and
      feasibility data on patients managed with anti-thrombotic monotherapy with HeartMate 3 LVAS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients implanted with the HeartMate 3 LVAS will be screened for participation in the study
      with established stability at 6 months after implantation of the device. If inclusion
      criteria are met, patients will be transitioned to a single anti-thrombotic therapy with
      Acetylsalicylic Acid (ASA) or equivalent antiplatelet therapy and anticoagulation with
      warfarin will be withdrawn. ASA will be administered in a minimum dose of 100 mg per day with
      dosage adjustments based on VerifyNow testing up to a maximum of 200 mg daily. The primary
      endpoints will be analyzed at 90 and 180 days after initiation of the single antiplatelet
      therapy.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  patients implanted with HeartMate 3 LVAS irrespective of intended goal of treatment of
             bridge to transplant or destination therapy

          -  a minimum of 6 months since HeartMate3 LVAS implantation free of thromboembolic events
             and pump malfunction

          -  evidence of forward flow across the aortic valve (with aortic valve opening of at
             least 1:2 per cardiac cycle) at baseline echocardiography (ECHO) or after speed
             reduction as long as no evidence of progression of heart failure is noted, based on a
             combination of biomarkers and clinical assessment follow-up (see Appendix III);
             Clinical assessment will include review of the biomarkers, invasive or non-invasive
             hemodynamics (as available or indicated) and clinical physical examination

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  absence of an informed consent

          -  presence of any prosthetic valve or central aortic valve repair (e.g. Park's stitch)

          -  presence of any other ancillary circulatory assist device system

          -  known history of major thrombotic event e.g. deep vein thrombosis (DVT)

          -  known history of stroke

          -  left atrial appendage in patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter not addressed by
             resection or exclusion at a time of the implant

          -  evidence of any intracardiac thrombus evidenced by transoesophageal echocardiography

          -  any other clinical indication for a use of long-term anticoagulation using a vitamin K
             antagonist or thrombin inhibitor (e.g. specified known genetic thrombotic mutation
             mandating the therapy, malignancy)
