  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of venetoclax when combined with
      lenalidomide and dexamethasone for participants with newly diagnosed, active t(11;14)
      positive multiple myeloma (MM).

      This study will consist of 2 parts: Part 1 Dose Escalation and Part 2 Dose Expansion.
