      MULTISARC is a randomized multicenter study assessing whether high throughput molecular
      analysis (next generation sequencing exome - NGS) is feasible in advanced/metastatic
      soft-tissue sarcoma patients, that is, whether NGS can be conducted for a large proportion of
      patients, with results available within reasonnable delays.

      In parallel, MULTISARC aims to assess efficacy of an innovative treatment strategy guided by
      high throughput molecular analysis (next generation sequencing exome, RNASeq [NGS]) in
      patients with Advanced/metastatic soft-tissue sarcomas. At the end of first-line treatment,
      participant's tumor profile of experimental Arm NGS (treatment strategy based on NGS results)
      will be discussed within a multidisciplinary tumor board which aims at discussing the genomic
      profiles and at providing a therapeutic decision for each participant. Participants for whom
      a targetable genomic alteration has been identified will be proposed to enter in one of the
      subsequent phase II single-arm sub-trial.

      Screening phase: archival frozen tumor sample and blood sample will be used for genetic
      profiling. Patients can be considered as pre-eligible for the randomized phase when all
      genetic material have been received by the Platform.

      Randomization phase: the randomization will allocate the following arms with a ratio 1:1:

        -  experimental Arm NGS : treatment strategy based on NGS results [exome, RNASeq]

        -  standard Arm No NGS: treatment strategy not based on NGS (Note that for these
           participants and under specific conditions, subsequent NGS analyses may be allowed
           within the scope of the trial)

      Single-arm phase II sub-trial: at the end of the first-line treatment and regardless of tumor
      response as per RECIST v1.1, patients randomized in Arm NGS and for whom a targetable
      alteration has been identified by the Molecular Tumor Board will be considered as
      pre-eligible for the targeted sub-study. The mandatory post-chemotherapy wash-out period of
      21 days will provide time to achieve all the required tests and examinations.

    <intervention_model_description>MULTISARC is a randomized multicenter study assessing whether high throughput molecular analysis (next generation sequencing exome - NGS) is feasible in advanced soft tissue sarcoma participants.
In parallel, MULTISARC aims to assess efficacy of an innovative treatment strategy guided by high throughput molecular analysis, in participants with advanced soft-tissue sarcomas.
Randomization 1:1 with 1 participant randomized in experimental Arm NGS (treatment strategy based on NGS) and 1 participant randomized in standard Arm No NGS (treatment strategy not based on NGS).
At the end of first-line treatment, participant's tumor profile of experimental Arm NGS will be discussed within a multidisciplinary tumor board which aims at discussing the genomic profiles and at providing a therapeutic decision for each participant. Participants for whom a targetable genomic alteration has been identified will be proposed to enter in one of the subsequent phase II single-arm sub-trial.</intervention_model_description>
