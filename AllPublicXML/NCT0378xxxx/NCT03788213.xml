      Background:Moderate three week hypofractionated adjuvant radiotherapy schedule is a standard
      care in breast cancers. A five day schedule has been demonstrated to be iso-toxic as a
      standard three week schedule. Recently studies have also demonstrated the safety and
      feasibility of simultaneous integrated boost in this setting. This randomized trial will
      investigate if a one-week course of hypofractionated breast radiotherapy is non-inferior to a
      three week course.

      Aim: To determine if one-week schedule of adjuvant radiotherapy in breast cancer is
      non-inferior to a three week schedule.

      Primary Objective: Locoregional Recurrence Rate (LRR) (Cumulative proportion of patients with
      locoregional recurrence) at 5 years

      Secondary Objective:

        1. Overall survival (OS) (Time from randomization to death)

        2. Invasive Disease-free survival (iDFS) (Time from randomization to any invasive disease
           recurrence, death due to any cause or second invasive malignancy)

        3. Late adverse events (AE)

        4. Quality of Life (QoL)

      Hypothesis:

        1. 1 week schedule will be non-inferior to a three week schedule for Locoregional
           Recurrence Rate

        2. 1 week schedule will be non-inferior to a three week schedule for OS

        3. 1 week schedule will be not result in worse late adverse events as compared to 3 week
           schedule

        4. Proportion of patients decrease in quality of life will not differ between the two arms
           at 12 months

      Design: Open-label, parallel group, two arm, randomised, phase III, non-inferiority trial.

      Population: Patients with breast cancer who need adjuvant radiotherapy after breast
      conservation or mastectomy.

      Intervention: Patients will be randomized to 15 days or 5 days of radiotherapy to the whole
      breast or chest wall or reconstructed breast. Nodal radiation will be delivered as indicated.
      A simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) will be delivered to patients who need a tumor bed
      boost after breast cancer. The following dose schedules will be tested:

      Control Group: 40 Gy in 15 fractions over 3 weeks (with SIB of 8 Gy)*

      Test Group: 26 Gy in 5 fractions over 1 week (with SIB of 6 Gy).*

      * Use of Sequential Boost is allowed in both arms if prespecified by the institution. If used
      dose is 12 Gy in 4 fractions in 1 week in both arms.

      Outcomes and measures:

        1. LRR : Cumulative proportion of patients with ipsilateral Locoregional Recurrence after
           treatment at 5 years .

        2. OS: Time from randomization to the time of death due to any cause. Cumulative proportion
           reported at 5 years.

        3. iDFS: Time from randomization to any disease recurrence, death due to any cause or
           second primary invasive cancer.Cumulative proportion reported at 5 years.

        4. AE: Proportion of patients with late Grade 2 or more AE as defined by the CTCAE 5
           criteria

        5. QoL: Proportion of patients with a worse summary score in the EORTC QLQ C30 at 12 months
           post-treatment as compared to the baseline score.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed invasive breast cancers

          -  Age &gt; 18 years

          -  ECOG performance status : 0 - 3

          -  Underwent curative intent surgery for the breast cancer with complete microscopic
             resection either in the form of a mastectomy or breast conservation surgery

          -  Adequate axillary clearance or a validated sentinel node biopsy procedure. For the
             purpose of this study, adequacy of the axillary clearance will be determined by a
             multidisciplinary tumor board and rationale for the decision documented in the case
             records. As a general guideline, at least 10 axillary lymph nodes need to be sampled
             for an axillary nodal dissection to be considered as adequate.

          -  Absence of distant metastases. Patients who have high risk breast cancer as defined by
             a Nottingham Prognostic Index (NPI) of &gt; 5.4 will be considered for metastatic workup
             in the form of a 18 FDG PET CT. Alternatively, a CT scan of the thorax and whole
             abdomen, and a bone scan is also allowed. Metastatic workup will also be recommended
             in patients with AJCC 8 T3/T4 tumors at presentation, 4 or more nodes positive after
             surgery (pN2 or above). Patients with low or intermediate NPI will be considered for
             metastatic workup on a case by case basis. Metastatic workup will also be recommended
             for all patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy for locally advanced breast
             cancers.

          -  Clear margins of resection for the breast primary as defined by absence tumor on ink
             in the specimen if a breast conservation has been performed or excision upto the deep
             fascia of the pectoralis major or skin.

          -  Adjuvant radiotherapy is indicated. The following patients will be considered as
             candidates to receive adjuvant radiotherapy:

          -  All patients after breast conservation surgery or after neoadjuvant chemotherapy

          -  Patients after mastectomy if any of the below:

               -  T3 - T4 tumors

               -  more than 3 axillary lymph nodes

               -  T0-T2 tumor with 0 - 3 axillary lymph nodes with a Cambridge Score of 3 or more.

          -  The SCF will be included in patients with axillary nodal involvement in pathology or
             in those patients who have undergone neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The internal mammary
             nodes will be included based on the institutional policy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of any one of the following will exclude the patient from participation in
             the study:

          -  Patients with pure ductal carcinomas in situ (in patients undergoing upfront surgery).

          -  Patients with non-epithelial malignant conditions of the breast viz. Sarcomas,
             lymphomas, phyllodes tumors

          -  Patients with metaplastic breast cancers

          -  Presence of pathologically proven residual supraclavicular nodal metastases or
             residual internal mammary lymphadenopathy at time of radiotherapy.

          -  Prior radiotherapy to the ipsilateral breast/chest wall or the mediastinum. Patients
             with synchronous / metachronous contralateral breast malignancies will be eligible for
             inclusion. Patients requiring bilateral breast radiotherapy are also eligible for
             inclusion.

          -  Concurrent illness, including severe infection that may jeopardize the ability of the
             patient to undergo the procedures outlined in this protocol with reasonable safety

          -  Serious medical or psychiatric conditions that might limit the ability of the patient
             to comply with the protocol.

          -  Patients planned for concurrent chemotherapy during radiation therapy. Concurrent
             hormonal therapy or targeted therapy using anti-HER2 agents is allowed.
