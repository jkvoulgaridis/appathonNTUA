  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is no specific treatment that can cure somatosensory tinnitus and usually conservative
      physical therapy modalities are used in the literature. The aim of the study is to
      investigate the effect of kinesio taping applied to sternocleidomastoid, upper trapezium and
      levator scapulae muscles on the somatosensory tinnitus associated with neck complaints.

      The study was designed as a prospective, randomized controlled and double blind trial.

      Patients complaining of tinnitus were firstly subjected to otologic and audiologic evaluation
      by an otolaryngologist. Tinnitus characteristics, such as severity (Tinnitus handicap Index,
      tinnitus Visual Analog Scale- tinnitus VAS) , type (pulsatile/non-pulsatile), localization
      (unilateral/ bilateral) and the frequency (number of days with symptoms) were recorded.
      Patients were excluded if they had objective tinnitus, subjective tinnitus with hearing loss
      or Meniere's disease, vertigo, middle ear pathologies, intracranial pathologies, whiplash
      injury, previous cervical spinal surgery, pregnancy, infection, malignancy and if they
      received cervical physical rehabilitation program in the past 3 months.

      Patients who diagnosed with somatosensory tinnitus and concomitant neck complaints
      (cervical-VAS score &gt;2) at least 6 weeks were referred to physical medicine and
      rehabilitation outpatient clinic. Before the treatment, participants' demographics data
      including age, gender, Body-Mass Index (BMI) and cervical pain VAS score were recorded and
      physical examinations (cervical joint range of motion (cervical-ROM), cervical manual muscle
      testing (cervical-MMT) and myofascial trigger points for sternocleidomastoid, upper trapezium
      and levator scapulae muscles) were performed by one investigator.

      Banding application performed for both groups once a week for four weeks. Tinnitus handicap
      index score, tinnitus VAS, ROM of the cervical joint, cervical MMT, cervical pain VAS, Neck
      Disability index score and myofascial trigger points of sternocleidomastoid, upper trapezium,
      levator scapula was evaluated in all subjects by the same investigator.

    <measure>Tinnitus handicap Index (THI)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The questionnaire comprises 25 items with a functional subscale (11 items), emotional subscale (9 items), and catastrophic subscale (5 items). Each question is rated as 0 (none), 2 (sometimes), or 4 (always). Total score range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating higher levels of perceived tinnitus handicap.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Tinnitus severity (tinnitus-VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The loudness of tinnitus was graded with a10 cm of visual analog scale (VAS, 0-10 cm; 0 means no tinnitus, 10 means extremely loud tinnitus)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Cervical pain (cervical-VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Pain intensity was measured with VAS which is used to measure musculoskeletal pain with very good reliability and validity (VAS, 0-10 cm; 0 means no pain, 10 means severe pain).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Neck Disability index score (NDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The NDI is designed to assess self - reported neck functional status. The questionnaire comprises 10 items related to pain, activities of daily living, lifting, reading, headaches, concentration, work status, driving, sleeping and recreation, each rated on a 6-point Likert scale with a final score range of 0 (no disability) to 50 (major disability). Higher scores represent greater disability</description>
