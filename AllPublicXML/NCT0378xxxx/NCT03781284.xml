  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colonoscopy is considered crucial for the diagnosis and quantification of ulcerative colitis
      (UC). However, there are several drawbacks related to the invasiveness, procedure-related
      discomfort, risk of bowel perforation (especially in the period of acute inflammation), and
      relatively poor patient acceptance. Most patients regard the necessary bowel cleansing as
      burdensome. Feasible, accurate and well accepted non-invasive diagnostic techniques are
      needed for the determination of inflammatory activity and optimal tailoring of therapy.
      Hybrid PET/MRI represents an innovative combination of two established, non-invasive
      diagnostic tools: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), allowing for anatomic-functional imaging
      of the abdomen at high soft tissue contrast and positron emission tomography (PET) utilizing
      18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) a non-invasive tool to monitor glucose metabolism and allowing a
      detection and quantification of inflammatory processes. Since MRI has limited sensitivity in
      UC and may be hampered by retained stool, a combination with another imaging modality is very
      appealing. PET, on the other side provides functional information, yet with limited
      anatomical landmarks and is relatively unsusceptible to artifacts associated to retained
      stool. In combination, these modalities might provide a valid alternative for the
      non-invasive assessment of the inflammatory activity in UC patients without the need for
      bowel purgation. It will therefore have to be investigated whether fecal material does impede
      the diagnostic quality of the combination of FDG-PET and MRI. For this purpose, the
      investigators will include 50 patients with confirmed ulcerative colitis. Dependent on
      clinical activity of the inflammation, patients will be randomized to undergo PET/MRI
      enterography either with or without prior bowel purgation followed by a colonoscopy.
      Inflammatory activity in 7 bowel segments will be analyzed based on PET/MRI with and without
      bowel purgation with the results of colonoscopy as standard of reference.

      Patient acceptance of PET/MRI with and without bowel purgation as well as colonoscopy will be
      compared. PET/MRI with and without bowel cleansing will be compared with regard to diagnostic
      accuracy as well as for its patients' acceptance in comparison to colonoscopy.

      The investigators hypothesize that PET/MRI will eventually be highly accurate to detect and
      monitor inflammatory activity in patients with ulcerative colitis. Additional information
      about extra-intestinal findings might also change the therapeutic concept. PET/MRI might
      serve as a non-invasive diagnostic option in patients with UC to quantify inflammatory
      activity especially when bowel cleansing or colonoscopy is not applicable.
