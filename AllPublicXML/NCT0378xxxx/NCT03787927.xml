  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine whether cold-stored platelets (CSP) are equally, more effective,
      or uniquely effective at reversing the effect of dual antiplatelet therapy in healthy human
      subjects compared to room-temperature-stored platelets (RTP). The investigators plan to
      enroll healthy human subjects without risk factors for bleeding to achieve 60 complete data
      sets. Each subject will donate two apheresis platelet units. One platelet unit will be stored
      in the cold (CSP) and one platelet unit will be stored at room temperature (RTP). Subjects
      will be given dual anti-platelet therapy (aspirin and clopidogrel) prior to autologous
      transfusion of each unit. Platelet function testing will be performed before and after
      transfusion to measure reversal of the antiplatelet drugs.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        The subject is in good health, is taking no excluded medications and meets platelet donor
        suitability requirements aimed at assuring donor safety.

          1. Subject self-reports that he or she feels well and healthy

          2. Subjects must be 18-59 years old, of either sex

          3. Temperature: less than or equal to 99.5 F

          4. Resting blood pressure: systolic less than or equal to 180 mmHg, diastolic less than
             or equal to100 mmHg

          5. Resting heart rate: 40 to 100 beats per minute

          6. Weight: greater than or equal to110 pounds,

          7. Hematocrit: greater than or equal to 35 percent for females, greater than or equal to
             38 percent for males, but not greater than 55 percent

          8. Platelet count able to achieve target platelet yield per apheresis machine
             configuration parameters

          9. Subjects must be able to read, understand and sign the informed consent document and
             commit to the study follow-up schedule. The ability to read and speak English is
             required for participation.

         10. Subject must agree to avoid taking any aspirin or aspirin-containing drugs (e.g.,
             Alka-Seltzer, Bufferin, Excedrin) or NSAIDs (e.g.,Feldene, Motrin, Aleve, Advil) or
             other drugs known to affect platelet function throughout their study participation.

         11. Subjects must agree to avoid calcium channel blockers such as amlodipine (Norvasc),

             (Protonix) until all study blood draws are concluded. These classes of drugs may
             interfere with the action of clopidogrel and diminish its antiplatelet effect.

             samples.

         13. Women of child bearing potential must agree to use an effective method of
             contraception during the course of the study. The following methods of contraception
             will be considered 'effective' when self-reported by subject; abstinence, intrauterine
             contraception devices, hormonal methods, barrier methods or history of sterilization.

         14. Subject has phone and e-mail for contact and notification, and is able to come to the
             research site for approximately 9 visits over up to approximately 64 days.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Healthy subjects will be excluded from the study for any of the following reasons:

             pulmonary disease, untreated hypertension and or metabolic syndrome (at the discretion
             of the PI).

          5. Diabetes Mellitus

             Bufferin, Excedrin) or NSAIDs (e.g.,Feldene, Motrin, Aleve, Advil) or other drugs
             known to affect platelet function within 14 days prior to screening.

         12. Chronic NSAID therapy

         13. Chronic steroid therapy

         14. Known allergy to aspirin or clopidogrel

         15. Subjects who are taking, or have taken within 14 days any of the following class of
             drugs protone pump inhibitors (PPIs) such as omeprazole, pantoprazole, lansoprazole,
             esomeprazole lipid lowering drugs/statins anticoagulants ACE-inhibitors phenytoine
             tolbutamide calcium channel blockers such as amlodipine, felodipine, verapamil

         16. Current drug or alcohol dependence by subject's declaration.

         17. Currently pregnant or nursing as assessed during interview. A urine pregnancy test

             as boxing, rugby, American football, soccer, or other risky recreational hobbies at
             the discretion of the investigator.

         19. Unwilling or unable to comply with the protocol in the opinion of the investigator.

         20. Participation in an experimental drug/device study within the past 30 days (other than
             this study). Subjects who have received an infusion on this study may not be
             re-enrolled.

         21. Average initial (only for the first PFT) aggregation responses to ADP less than or
             equal to 60% by aggregometry platelet function testing.

         22. Other unspecified reasons that, in the opinion of the Investigator, make the subject
             unsuitable for enrollment.
