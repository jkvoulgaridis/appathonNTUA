  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rehabilitation robotics is increasingly used because it enables the patients to practice a
      wide array of movements. Dynamic balance training is essential for gait rehabilitation and
      robotised devices enhance repeatability, objectivity and precision of such training combined
      with monitoring and recording of kinematic and kinetic data. The aim of the study is to
      explore the effect of robot-assisted gait training on dynamic balance, symmetry and take-off
      in patients after stroke. The investigators will conduct a randomised intervention study
      where one group will receive visual feedback on gait status and the other group will receive
      kinetically-assisted training using a robotised device in addition to the visual feedback.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gait training will start 3 weeks after admission to inpatient rehabilitation. It will last
      for 3 weeks, 5 times per week, 30 minutes per day. The first few sessions with the robotic
      device will serve to familiarise the patient with the BART device and training conditions.
      Further details are described in the Arms and Interventions section.

    <time_frame>Assessment before and after the 3-week training programme</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed using the Functional Gait Assessment (FGA) scale. The scale scores range from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating less impairment.</description>

    <time_frame>Assessment before and after the 3-week training programme</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed using the Functional Ambulation Categories (FAC) scale. The FAC is a 6-point scale (0-5), with higher category indicating better walking ability.</description>

    <measure>Change in functional independence</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessment before and after the 3-week training programme</time_frame>

    <time_frame>Assessment before and after the 3-week training programme</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed using the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test. Longer TUG times indicate worse mobility (and thus higher fall risk).</description>

    <description>In each session, the group will undergo standard gait training on BART without pelvic perturbations, i.e.,
walk a virtual track on the BART without pelvic perturbations (i.e., the pelvic brace of the BART device will be set to follow the patient's motion) for 10 minutes;
practise gait symmetry and take-off using visual feedback without pelvic perturbations in two 10-minute sessions.</description>

walk a virtual track on the BART with pelvic perturbations during virtual uphill walk and virtual curved walk for 10 minutes;
practise gait symmetry and take-off using visual feedback with pelvic perturbations for 10 minutes;
practise dynamic gait balance using pelvic perturbations during treadmill walking for 10 minutes.</description>

    <description>The Balance Assisted Robot on Treadmill (BART) enables various types of gait training on treadmill with visual feedback. It interfaces to the pelvis of the walking subject in an actuated and admittance-controlled manner, thus providing transparent haptic interaction with negligible power transfer.</description>
