  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to conduct an observational pre/post study to evaluate the
      clinical impact oxygen guideline implementation on oxygen utilization and oxygenation in
      critically ill trauma patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Supplemental oxygen is fundamental in caring for critically ill trauma. While the avoidance
      of hypoxia is vital, the current clinical practice of excessive oxygenation settings is
      common, and unnecessary, and may even be harmful.

      We convened an expert panel to define optimal oxygenation targets in critically ill trauma
      patients. The strong consensus was to target normoxia at an oxygen saturation (SpO2) range of
      90-96% and arterial oxygen (PaO2) range of 60-100 mmHg. Accordingly, our institution will
      implement this consensus for the care of trauma patients

      Specific Aim:

      This is an observational pre/post study to evaluate the impact of targeted normoxia
      implementation in optimizing oxygen delivery and oxygenation in critically ill trauma
      patients.

      Hypotheses:

      That the clinical efforts to improve adherence to oxygen guidelines will:

        1. improve the proportion of time spent with target normoxia thresholds (oxygen saturation
           SpO2 90-96%) by

        2. reducing utilization of unnecessary supplementation oxygen

        3. without a substantive increase in hypoxic episodes or an adverse impact on clinical
           outcomes.
