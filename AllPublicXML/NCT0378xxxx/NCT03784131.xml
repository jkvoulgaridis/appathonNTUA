  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the safety (incidence of adverse events including serious adverse
      events and clinical significant laboratory abnormalities) of personalized tissue engineered
      veins (P-TEV) with valves implanted in patients with severe chronic venous insufficiency
      (CVI). For each patient a segment of the femoral vein containing the non-functioning valve
      will be surgically replaced with a single P-TEV containing a functioning valve.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The advanced therapy medicinal product (ATMP) described herein is a personalized tissue-
      engineered vein (P-TEV), a human vein segment graft for use in transplantation to replace a
      defective or missing part of a patient's vein.

      In this specific application a P-TEV segment with a functioning venous bicuspid valve is
      implanted to replace a nonfunctioning venous valve in the femoral vein of a patient suffering
      from severe CVI. The P-TEV is a hybrid tissue consisting of the extracellular matrix (ECM)
      scaffold of an allogeneic vein segment derived from a cadaveric donor as well as autologous
      components from a sample of peripheral blood of the recipient. As the allogeneic immunogenic
      material from the donor has been removed and been replaced by autologous components, no
      immunosuppression is required.

      Successful implantation and treatment should prevent the reverse flow of blood, decrease
      blood pooling in the lower leg, and thereby alleviate symptoms such as swelling, pain, and
      ulcers.
