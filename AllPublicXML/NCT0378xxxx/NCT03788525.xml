      The purpose of this pilot experiment is threefold.

        1. To assess the efficacy of the recruitment strategy

        2. To assess the acceptability and feasibility of the outcome measurement methods obtained
           in free-living in the participants homes

        3. To assess the acceptability of the prescribed interventions to reduce screen media use

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Modern day's excessive use of screen-based media is heavily discussed in the public in terms
      of its possible harmful effects on physical and mental health among children and adults. To
      date there is little rigorously conducted research available on the effects of high use of
      todays screen-based media. Of particular notice, no controlled experimental studies in
      free-living have been carried out to study the immediate effects of screen-based media use on
      habitual physical activity patterns, sleep, and temporary stress- and emotional state.

      To undertake a large-scale randomized controlled trial of the efficacy of limiting
      screen-based media use in families of parents and children the investigators aim to conduct a
      pilot study to assess the acceptability and feasibility of the outcome measurement methods
      obtained in free-living in the participants homes and the acceptability of the prescribed
      interventions to reduce screen media use. The investigators also perform the pilot study to
      investigate the efficacy of our recruitment strategy.

      The participating families (households with children ≥4 and &lt;18 years old) will be invited to
      answer a recruitment questionnaire sent out to their personal digital mailbox, which is a
      compulsory digital solution to receive mail from i.e. public authorities. Based on the survey
      answers eligible families (see section on inclusion/exclusion criteria) will be invited to
      participate in this pilot experiment. Families who are willing to participate will be
      randomized to one of two intervention groups after completion of the baseline measurement
      protocol. One group must reduce all recreational screen-based media use to less than three
      hours per week for a period of two weeks. Participants in this group will be asked to hand
      over their portable screen devices and in exchange they will be handed an old model Nokia
      phone. The other group must remove all screen-based media use (both work-related and
      recreational) after 6PM for a period of two weeks. The experiment does not include a control
      group. To ensure compliance to the interventions, the investigators will install an app,
      which will measure screen use on each participant's smartphone(s) and tablet(s). Furthermore,
      the investigators will connect a device to all televisions in each household, which will
      monitor television usage. To investigate the effect of the interventions all participants
      will go through a 7-day measurement protocol just before the family is randomized to one of
      the interventions and again during the last week of the intervention period.

    <description>Participants must remove all recreational screen-based media use beyond 3 hours/week. This includes all recreational screen-based media use inside and outside the household. As a tool to comply with the intervention the families will hand-over all portable screen-based media devices. In return, each participant who own a smartphone will receive a regular cell-phone which can only make phone calls and send text messages. For a maximum of ½ an hour a day, adult participants may use this device for necessary contact. The families are allowed a maximum of 3 hours/week of recreational screen time. If participants can not hand over their smartphones due to daily use for work purposes we will install an app tracking screen use on these devices.</description>

    <description>Participants must remove all recreational screen-based media use after 6 PM. There are no restrictions on the amount of screen-based media use before 6 PM. Thus, before 6 PM, the participants must continue their habitual screen-based media use completely. However, after 6 PM, both work-related and recreational screen-based media use must be removed completely.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  High amount of screen-based media according to self-report (based on the adults only)

          -  In each household, at least one adult and one child must be above the 50th percentile
             for self-reported screen-based media use (characterized as &quot;high&quot; in this study). The
             50th percentile is based on the responses from all adults who answered the recruitment
             survey.

          -  The children in the household are ≥ 4 and ≤ 18 years old, at the time the survey is
             sent out. In this way sleep measurements do not get distorted by infants and toddlers
             in the household (e.g. sleep).

          -  Adults and children who participate in the measurements must have the resources to
             remove all recreational- and work-/school-related screen-time in the evening hours,
             with a few exceptions, for a period of 2 weeks (intervention length).

          -  Participants must report that they consider the extent of their screen-based media use
             an issue

          -  Participants must report to be motivated to decrease screen-based media use for the
             whole family household.

          -  Family members who choose to not participate or are ineligible must be willing to
             support the success of this family experiment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  If the adults or children only reside in the household part time, i.e. have multiple
             addresses

          -  Diagnosis of stress from their general practitioner within the last year

          -  Diagnosis of sleep disorders from their general practitioner within the last year

          -  Working night shifts

          -  In any shape or form limited in one's ability to participate in habitual physical
             activity

          -  Has or is in inquiry of Neuropsychiatric disorders, such as Attention Deficit
             Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) or development disorders such as Autism.

          -  Already participating in research studies, such as the Odense Child Cohort
