  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The clinical study is a randomized-controlled, double-masked, crossover clinical trial with
      two study treatments to compare two study lens types and the initial performance, in terms of
      the subjective response after a period of lens dispensing. The study will last approximately
      2 to 4 months.

    <measure>CLUE Vision</measure>
    <time_frame>2-Week Follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Overall vision was assessed using the Contact Lens User Experience™ (CLUE) questionnaire. CLUE is a validated patient-reported outcomes (PRO) questionnaire to assess patient experience attributes of soft contact lenses (comfort, vision, handling, and packaging) in a contact-lens wearing population in the US, ages 18-65. Derived CLUE scores using Item Response Theory (IRT) follow a normal distribution with a population average score of 60 (SD 20), where higher scores indicate a more favorable/positive response with a range of 0-120.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>logMAR Visual Acuity</measure>
    <time_frame>2-Week Follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Binocular visual performance on logMAR (Logarithm of Minimal Angle of Resolution) scale was evaluated under high luminance and high contrast conditions at three distances:
Distance (3 meters) was measured using ETDRS (Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study) charts; Intermediate (64 centimeters) and Near (40 centimeters) were measured using Reduced Guillon-Poling Charts.
Letter-by-letter results calculated the visual performance score for each chart read. logMAR scores closer to zero, or below zero, indicate a better visual acuity. A logMAR visual performance score of 0.0 is equivalent to Snellen visual acuity of 20/20.</description>

             study:

               1. The subject must read, understand, and sign the STATEMENT OF INFORMED CONSENT and
                  receive a fully executed copy of the form.

                  in this clinical protocol.

               3. The subject must be at least 40 years of age and not greater than 70 years of
                  age.

               4. The subject's distance spherical equivalent refraction must be in the range of
                  +1.25 D to +3.75 D in each eye.

               5. The subject's refractive cylinder must be ≤0.75 D in each eye.

               6. The subject's ADD power must be in the range of +0.75 D to +2.50 D.

               7. The subject must have distance best corrected visual acuity of 20/20-3 or better
                  in each eye.

               8. Subjects must own a wearable pair of spectacles if required for their distance
                  vision.

               9. The subject must be an adapted soft contact lens wearer in both eyes (i.e. worn
                  lenses a minimum of 2 days per week for at least 8 hours per wear day, for 1
                  month of more duration).

              10. The subject must either already be wearing a presbyopic contact lens correction
                  (e.g., reading spectacles over contact lenses, multifocal or monovision contact
                  lenses, etc.) or if not respond positively to at least one symptom on the
                  &quot;Presbyopic Symptoms Questionnaire&quot;.

        <title>CLUE Vision</title>
        <description>Overall vision was assessed using the Contact Lens User Experience™ (CLUE) questionnaire. CLUE is a validated patient-reported outcomes (PRO) questionnaire to assess patient experience attributes of soft contact lenses (comfort, vision, handling, and packaging) in a contact-lens wearing population in the US, ages 18-65. Derived CLUE scores using Item Response Theory (IRT) follow a normal distribution with a population average score of 60 (SD 20), where higher scores indicate a more favorable/positive response with a range of 0-120.</description>

        <title>logMAR Visual Acuity</title>
        <description>Binocular visual performance on logMAR (Logarithm of Minimal Angle of Resolution) scale was evaluated under high luminance and high contrast conditions at three distances:
Distance (3 meters) was measured using ETDRS (Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study) charts; Intermediate (64 centimeters) and Near (40 centimeters) were measured using Reduced Guillon-Poling Charts.
Letter-by-letter results calculated the visual performance score for each chart read. logMAR scores closer to zero, or below zero, indicate a better visual acuity. A logMAR visual performance score of 0.0 is equivalent to Snellen visual acuity of 20/20.</description>
