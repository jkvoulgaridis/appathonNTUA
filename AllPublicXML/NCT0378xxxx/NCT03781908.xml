  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this study is to compare well-defined pleural effusion management success
      outcomes in patients with malignant or paramalignant pleural effusions who were treated with
      Indwelling pleural catheter insertion compared with those treated with siver nitrate
      pleurodesis. It is also to demonstrate the effectiveness of silver nitrate pleurodesis. It is
      also important to evaluate frequent adverse events of silver nitrate pleurodesis in patients
      with malignant pleural effusion

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dyspnea is present in 50% of patients with malignant pleural effusion and quality of life is
      significantly impaired.

      Chemical pleurodesis using various sclerosing agents is accepted as a palliative therapy for
      patients with recurrent, symptomatic, and malignant pleural effusions.

      Silver nitrate solution (SNS) is a valid sclerosing agent that induce a caustic injury to the
      mesothelium that results in an effective pleurodesis.

      However, various clinical parameters and biochemical factors affect the success of
      pleurodesis in symptomatic patients with MPE: symptoms and performance status of the patient,
      daily fluid drainage, primary tumour, and mainly lung reexpansion following pleural fluid
      evacuation.

      The pleural injectate consists of 50 mL 0.5% SNS with 10mL of lidocaine (25mg/5mL).

      An alternative treatment is intermittent or continuous drainage of the pleural fluid with a
      chronic indwelling pleural catheter.

    <description>First, pleural fluid drainage will be done after administration of 5 cc of local anesthetic lidocain1% either by insertion of chest tube (26F or 28F ) or by using ultrasonography. Pleural fluid drainage will be terminated when the patient want to cough to make sure that the pleural cavity is empty, then the sclerosant material will be injected, patients will receive 0.5% silver nitrate diluted in 50 ml distilled water with 10 ml of local anaesthetic lidocaine 1%.</description>

    <description>First , insert the wire into the pleural effusion at approximately the anterior axillary line. A 1-2 cm incision is made over the wire. A chest wall tunnel (5-8 cm in length) is created with a counter incision. The catheter is pulled through the tunnel and out next to the wire. After dilation of the wire tract with a Teflon &quot;peel-away&quot; sheath, the indwelling catheter is inserted into the chest. The counter incision is closed primarily, and the catheter is secured to the skin medially with a suture.</description>
