  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-site, randomized, investigator-initiated pilot study to evaluate the efficacy
      of investigational techniques to reduce fluoroscopy time or radiation dose and the amount of
      radio opaque contrast used during a cryoballoon pulmonary vein isolation procedure for atrial
      fibrillation.

      One group of subjects will have the procedure performed with intracardiac echo maneuvers to
      assess cryoballoon occlusion of the pulmonary vein and will be compared to a group of
      subjects who will receive the standard medical treatment with fluoroscopy and angiography.

    <textblock>
      Surgical and catheter based technologies target triggers that initiate atrial fibrillation
      located in the pulmonary veins (PV). In order to isolate these triggers, radiofrequency
      energy or freezing is used to destroy the atrial tissue which propagate electrical impulses
      into and out of the pulmonary veins (PV), to achieve pulmonary vein isolation (PVI). Use of a
      patented cryoballoon catheter (Medtronic) to perform PVI has been shown to be safe and
      efficacious under fluoroscopic guidance with contrast angiography. The objective of this
      study is to identify methods to reduce radiation dose and radio opaque contrast use while
      maintaining PVI efficacy and safety.

    <description>A 28-mm cryoballoon (Arctic Front Advance™ Cardiac CryoAblation Catheter, Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN) will be employed. The cryoballoon catheter will be introduced into the left atrium, following a single transeptal puncture, through a 12 French steerable sheath (FlexCath, Medtronic), constantly flushed with heparinized saline. A circular mapping catheter (Achieve, Medtronic) will be advanced through the cryoballoon to the PV orifice and positioned as proximally as possible inside the vessel to record the PV potentials at baseline and monitor the isolation procedure in real time.</description>
