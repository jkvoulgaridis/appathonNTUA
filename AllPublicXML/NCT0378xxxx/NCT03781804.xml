  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 24-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter
      study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intranasal administration of 186 and 372 μg
      twice daily (BID) of OPN-375 in subjects with chronic sinusitis (CS) with or without nasal
      polyps.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of intranasal administration
      of twice-daily doses of 186 and 372 µg of OPN-375 (fluticasone propionate) with placebo in
      subjects with chronic sinusitis using the following co-primary endpoints:

        1. A change from baseline in symptoms as measured by a composite score of nasal congestion,
           facial pain or pressure sensation, and nasal discharge (anterior and/or posterior) at
           the end of Week 4.

        2. A change from baseline to Week 24/Early Termination (ET) in the average percent of the
           volume opacified in the ethmoid and maxillary sinuses.

    <description>Change from baseline to the end of Week 4 in average total instantaneous AM scores (evaluation of symptom severity immediately preceding the time of scoring) for each symptom: nasal congestion, nasal discharge (anterior and/or posterior), facial pain/pressure sensation. Baseline scores are the averaged total instantaneous AM scores over the last 7 days of the single blind run in period, and the end of Week 4, scores are averaged over the 7 days from the subject diary. Range of scores for each nasal symptom is 0= none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe. Composite score is a sum of the 3 symptom scores and will range from 0 to 9.</description>

    <description>The SNOT-22 is a subject-completed questionnaire that consists of 22 symptoms and social/emotional consequences of their nasal disorder across several domains including: rhinologic, ear/facial pain, psychological dysfunction, and sleep dysfunction.

    <measure>Change in baseline to Week 24/ET as measured by the Euroqol 5-dimension (EQ-5D) instrument</measure>
    <time_frame>24 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D consists of the EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS). The subject is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the 5 dimensions. This decision results in a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the 5 dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the subject's health state. Scores for health state range from 0 to 1. The EQ VAS records the subject's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale, where the endpoints are labelled 'The best health you can imagine' and 'The worst health you can imagine'. The VAS can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome that reflect the subject's own judgement. VAS scores range from 0 to 100.</description>

    <time_frame>24 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PSQI is a validated, self-rated questionnaire which assesses sleep quality and disturbances over a 1-month time interval. Nineteen individual items generate 7 &quot;component&quot; scores (each ranging between 0 and 3): subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication, and daytime dysfunction. The sum of scores for these 7 components yields 1 global score ranging between 0 and 21.</description>

    <description>The 16-item QIDS (Rush et al. 2003) is designed to assess the severity of depressive symptoms. The QIDS is available in a self-rated version and assesses all the criterion symptom domains designated by the American Psychiatry Association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - 5th edition to diagnose a major depressive episode. The 7-day period prior to assessment is the usual time frame for assessing symptom severity. Scores range from 0 to 27.</description>

    <description>The Health and Work Performance Questionnaire measures work productivity (absenteeism and presenteeism). - Absenteeism is measured in missed work days over the past four weeks (range 0-20); absenteeism is measured in % productivity at work (0-100%), with higher values indicating improved productivity. - Presenteeism can be converted to number of days of productive time lost per month, and when added to the number of lost days due to absenteeism provides an estimate of total productive work days lost.</description>
