    <measure>Change From Baseline in European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life (QLQ) Questionnaires Lung Cancer 13 (QLQ-LC13)</measure>
    <time_frame>Questionnaires completed at week 1, 4, 7, 9, 12, 15 , 18,21,27,33,39,45and51</time_frame>
    <description>The EORTC QLQ-LC13 was a lung-cancer-specific module comprising 13 questions to assess lung cancer symptoms (cough, haemoptysis, dyspnoea, and site-specific pain [pain in chest, pain in arm or shoulder, and pain in other parts); treatment related side-effects (sore mouth, dysphagia, peripheral neuropathy, and alopecia); and pain medication. Except for a multi-item scale for dyspnoea, all were single items. An outcome variable consisting of a score from 0 to 100 was derived for each of the symptom scales/symptom items. Higher scores on the global health status/QoL and functioning scales indicated better health status/QoL and better function. Higher scores on the symptoms scales indicated greater symptom burden. The results of the analyses were presented in terms of a least squares mean together with its associated 95% profile likelihood CI</description>

    <description>he EORTC QLQ-C30 cancer-specific questionnaire consisted of 30 questions, which were combined to produce 5 functional scales (Physical, Role, Cognitive, Emotional, Social); 3 symptom scales (Fatigue, Pain, Nausea/Vomiting); 6 individual items (dyspnoea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhoea, and financial difficulties); and a global measure of health status/QoL. An outcome variable consisting of a score from 0 to 100 was derived for each of the symptom scales/symptom items, the functional scales, and the global health status/QoL scale in the EORTC QLQ-C30. Higher scores on the global health status and functioning scales indicated better health status/function. Higher scores on the symptoms scales indicated greater symptom burden.
