      Stress and stress related diseases are becoming a huge health burden in modern societies.
      Psycho-emotional stress plays a key role in stress regulation. Therefore this study aims to
      investigate the effects of online-courses addressing emotion regulation.

      For this aim several different online-courses about emotional competence and compassion are
      scientifically evaluated with psychometric questionnaires and heart rate variability
      measuring. The courses are planned by the trainers and people register on their own
      initiative.

      The courses have a duration of 4 weeks or three months. They consist of video lectures that
      explain the content as well as videos giving exercises about the character of the different
      feelings and about the characteristics of emotions. They teach practices on how to use
      feelings as an empowering force in life and how to deal with difficult emotions.
