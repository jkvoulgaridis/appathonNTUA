  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psychiatric diagnosis is based mainly on questioning the patient and subjective impression
      rather than a quantitative assessment. The assessment is usually done with long time
      intervals between assessments and arbitrary in relation to the clinical course of the
      disorder. Post-traumatic stress disorder has physiological, physical, and behavioral
      manifestations. These changes appear as a response to different situations during the day and
      can be measured directly and indirectly in order to obtain an objective, quantitative and
      fuller picture of the severity and changes in the disorder. This is a non-interventional
      pilot study, using a system that collects data through wearable sensors and smartphone over a
      long period of time for patients suffering from PTSD and enables data analysis and
      characterization of a personal digital phenotype using a dedicated algorithm. Based on this
      pattern, the investigators will attempt to support the establishment of the PTSD diagnosis.
      During the course of the study, the therapeutic procedure will not be affected by the study
      and will be independent of the research.

    <description>Investigators will use a wearable smart watch to collect physiological data (Heart Rate, Cardiac Output, Blood Pressure, Respiratory Rate, Steps Counter, Electro-Dermal Activity) and will use psychiatric rating score (CAPS 5, CGI, PHQ-SADS) to determine changes in clinical symptoms. The investigators will look for correlations between the collected physiological data and the clinical symptoms according to the psychiatric rating scales</description>

        Adults aged 18 years and older from both sexes. The study group will include 25
        participants with a diagnosis of PTSD. The participants will be recruited from among the
        patients at the Ministry of Defense clinic at the Sheba Medical Center. The control group
        will consist of 25 participants recruited from medical staff and students from the Sheba
        Medical Center and Tel-Aviv University.
