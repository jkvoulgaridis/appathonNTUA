  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hip fracture is a common orthopedic emergency in the elderly, and it is associated with
      significant morbidity and mortality.1 Surgical reduction and fixation are the definitive
      treatment in most patients.2 Effective perioperative analgesia that minimizes the need for
      opioids and related adverse effects (such as delirium) is essential in this patient
      population.

      Regional analgesic techniques, including femoral nerve (FN) block, fascia iliaca block (FIB),
      and 3-in-1 FN block, are popular analgesic strategies, due mainly to their opioid-sparing
      effects and reduction in opioid-related adverse effects. The effect size of analgesia from
      these blocks is only moderate, and literature suggests that the obturator nerve (ON) is not
      covered.

      The anterior hip capsule is innervated by the ON, accessory obturator nerve (AON), and FN as
      reported by previous anatomic studies. The anterior capsule is the most richly innervated
      section of the joint, suggesting these nerves should be the main targets for hip analgesia. A
      recent anatomical study by Short et al15 confirmed the innervation of the anterior hip by
      these 3 main nerves but also found that the AON and FN play a greater role in the anterior
      hip innervation than previously reported. This study also identified the relevant landmarks
      for those articular branches. The high articular branches from FN and AON are consistently
      found between the anterior inferior iliac spines (AIIS) and the iliopubic eminence (IPE),
      whereas the ON , close to the inferomedial acetabulum. Using this information, the
      investigator developed an ultrasound-guided technique for blockade of these articular
      branches to the hip, the PENG (PEricapsular Nerve Group) block. In this study, the
      investigator will examine the efficacy of PENG block in hip surgeries as a post-operative
      pain management technique in comparison with fascia Iliaca block in hip surgeries

    <description>The regional block was performed with the patient in the supine position. A curvilinear low-frequency ultrasound probe (2-5MHz) was initially placed in a transverse plane over the AIIS and then aligned with the pubic ramus by rotating the probe counterclockwise approximately 45 degrees (Figs. 2, 3). In this view, the IPE, the iliopsoas muscle and tendon, the femoral artery, and pectineus muscle were observed. A 22-gauge, 80-mm needle was inserted from lateral to medial in an in-plane approach to place the tip in the musculofascial plane between the psoas tendon anteriorly and the pubic ramus posteriorly. Following negative aspiration, the local anesthetic solution (20ml of bupivacaine 0.25%) was injected in 5-mL increments while observing for adequate fluid spread in this plane for a total volume of 30 mL</description>

    <description>In supine position, a high frequency linear probe will be placed in the inguinal crease. Scan starting laterally from the femoral artery and nerve in inguinal crease to identify the sartorius muscle, tracing the muscle until it's origin to anterior superior iliac spine. The shadow of the bony of iliac crest &amp; iliacus muscle will be seen, the end point of the injection is deep to the fascia iliaca and above the iliacus muscle in the lateral part of the iliacus muscle. After negative aspiration, 30 mL of 0.25 % of bupivacaine will be injected under the fascial plane incrementally, aspirating every 5 ml.</description>
