  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite numerous kinds of evidence on functional health and CNS protection of intermittent
      fasting after injuries were found in many brain-, and spinal cord-damaged animal models,
      there has yet to be any clinical study of intermittent fasting after acute ischemic cerebral
      infarction. The aim of this study is to evaluate the neurological, functional and clinical
      efficacy of intermittent fasting in patients after acute ischemic stroke.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In order to verify the validity and clinical efficacy of intermittent fasting for
      neurological and functional effects of ischemic cerebral infarction, the first ischemic
      stroke (diagnosed within 1 year through brain MRI / CT) patients will be randomly assigned to
      intermittent fasting group or control group. In both groups, physical therapy, occupational
      therapy and speech therapy will be provided during 3 hours in total a day. The intermittent
      fasting group should maintain intermittent fasting for no less than 12 hours or more every
      day during the rehabilitation period (at least 1 week), and the control group is able to eat
      all of the hospital meals and all the participants want without any time limit. The efficacy
      of intermittent fasting is to be verified by performing the electro-physiological tests and
      functional evaluations before participation, 1st week, 2nd weeks after participation, before
      discharge, 3 months, and 6 months after the stroke onset.
