    <textblock>
      The study evaluates the effect of early follow up in a preventive clinic with stepwise
      treatment of high blood pressure and lowering blood cholesterol. Half the participants were
      randomized to the preventive clinic group and the other half to control group with the usual
      treatment: one visit to the outpatient clinic three months after discharge with a diagnosis
      of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension is the most important modifiable risk factor for recurrent stroke. Several
      studies have shown that less than 40% of stroke survivors are treated to target one year
      after stroke The investigator performed a feasibility study to test a model of treating this
      important risk factor in a hospital setting The investigator used a stepwise escalation of
      treatment of both blood pressure and blood cholesterol to individual targets according to
      patients' diagnosis of stroke, comorbidity and age
