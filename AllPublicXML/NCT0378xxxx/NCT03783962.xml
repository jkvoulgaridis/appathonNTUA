  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed pilot study will examine cooking as an intervention target for weight control in
      overweight adults. The study will also examine whether interventions designed to promote
      cooking at home can increase participants' sense of food agency, and overcome common barriers
      to cooking at home such as time scarcity and budget constrictions. The study will utilize a
      cooking pedagogy designed to not just teach participants the basics of cooking different
      foods, but how to be efficient, mindful cooks. If cooking class participation positively
      impacts diet and health outcomes, it will bolster the case for promoting cooking at home as a
      health behavior for multiple populations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A two arm randomized control trial will examine whether the addition of an active cooking
      lesson versus a passive observed lesson to a behavioral weight loss intervention results in
      significantly greater weight loss. Additionally, the study will examine whether interventions
      designed to promote cooking at home can increase participants' sense of food agency, and
      overcome common barriers to cooking at home such as time scarcity and budget constrictions.

      Overweight and obese but otherwise healthy participants (n=64) will be recruited. Recruitment
      and study initiation will occur in two waves. Wave 1 aims to recruit 32 individuals who will
      then be randomized to 1) a 24 week, 24 session group behavioral weight loss intervention with
      12 bi-weekly cooking lessons; or, 2) the same 24 week, 24 session group behavioral weight
      loss intervention with 12 bi-weekly cooking demonstrations. Both groups get the same
      intervention and the same counselor delivered intervention elements; the presence of active
      cooking lessons vs. passive observed cooking demonstrations is the only difference between
      conditions. Assessments will be conducted at 0, 3 and 6 months. Wave 2 (n=32) will follow the
      same process as Wave 1 approximately two months after Wave 1 is initiated.

    <intervention_model_description>The Behavioral Weight Loss Program: Investigators have developed and implemented a theory-based group-delivered behavioral weight control program in two previous studies that incorporates the elements of current thinking and empirical data on successful weight loss programs, including restricted calorie intake and increased physical activity. In addition to attending weekly classes, participants will track their food intake, exercise, and weight. Participants will share online tracking diaries with the group facilitator who will offer individualized feedback on progress.
The Cooking Program Active Intervention. Twelve cooking classes will be run every other week after the in-person weight loss meetings.
Demonstrations. The demonstration condition will serve as an &quot;attention only&quot; control. All participants will have an opportunity to sample the prepared food at the end of class. The demonstrations will be led by the same chef as the active intervention group.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Cooking and Food Practices Change from baseline to 24 weeks will be measured by The Cooking and Food Provisioning Action Scale (CAFPAS), which measures food preparation skills and capacities. The CAFPAS contains 28 items administered with responses chosen from a 7-point bipolar Likert scale. There are three subscales: Self-Efficacy (measures whether an individual thinks their cooking ability and skills are adequate), Attitude (measures an individual's affective stance towards food, cooking and provisioning in different areas), and Structure (measures the ways in which external factures can either hinder or support an individual's cooking and provisioning actions). Subscales are scored by coding responses from 1-7, reversing them as necessary, summing the items and dividing by the standard deviation of the sample population's scores on the subscale. The overall CAFPAS score is the sum of the three subscales. A higher score on the CAFPAS is associated with improvement.</description>

    <description>Twelve cooking classes will be run every other week after the in-person weight loss meetings. These lessons will be patterned after Dr. Amy Trubek's cooking pedagogy and will be tailored for individuals specifically interested in weight loss. Classes will begin with a brief lecture on the day's topic, followed by a laboratory session. Participants work in teams of two in the NFS foods lab to actively practice skills and cook a meal. Subjects will receive recipes and information sheets that cover pantry supplies, grocery lists, knife skills and cooking equipment. Classes will be taught by a chef trained in the pedagogy by Dr. Trubek and participants will have the opportunity to sample the food they prepared at the end of class.</description>

    <description>The demonstration condition will serve as an &quot;attention only&quot; control. Previous research suggests that demonstrations of cooking have little to no impact on cooking behavior, therefore, cooking demonstrations can be used to &quot;even out&quot; the time and attention devoted to the active cooking participants without introducing bias into the study design. Subjects in the demonstration condition will also begin with a brief lecture on the day's lesson followed by a cooking demonstration that covers the same topics as the active intervention group. All participants will receive the same printed information and also have an opportunity to sample the prepared food at the end of class. The demonstrations will be led by the same chef as the active intervention group.</description>

    <description>Key behavioral strategies to facilitate making sustained changes in dietary habits and activity patterns are introduced, promoted and reinforced throughout the program. In-person sessions facilitated by an interventionist provide the group meetings. The program provides 24 weekly facilitated group sessions over 6 months. In addition to attending weekly classes, participants will track food intake, exercise, and weight. Participants will share online tracking diaries with the group facilitator who will offer individualized feedback on individual progress.
