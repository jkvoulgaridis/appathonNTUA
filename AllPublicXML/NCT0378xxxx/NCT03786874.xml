  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 2017, all IMPACTT investigators experimented in coordinated manner on multifacet
      intervention program, proposed by the present research protocol, with 2 teams from healthcare
      units from the PDL region. This experiment followed collaborative work aiming to raise team
      awareness on task interruptions. Given the existing data in the literature, the investigators
      hypothesise that the implementation of a multifacet program focusing on interactions within a
      team could enable the percentage of task interruptions linked to interactions between
      coordination functions and healthcare provision activities to be decreased by 33%. This
      decrease would concern task interruptions that are avoidable, in order to improve healthcare
      safety and teamwork.

      Also, the main objective of this project is to measure the impact of a program on the
      evolution of the characteristics of avoidable task interruptions. The project combines
      quantitative data (observations, questionnaire) and qualitative data (interviews).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research is a controlled, randomised, blind, pragmatic intervention study (36 months).
      From the list of volunteering teams meeting inclusion criteria, a random selection will be
      made. This will enable the formation of two groups of 20 teams each (control group and
      experimental group). An observational method coupled with a validated questionnaire transfer
      will allow teams to be questioned about their avoidable task interruptions (control group and
      experimental group).

      The multifacet intervention program is based the concept of teamwork implementation.
      Targeting potential for improvement will be decided and implemented by each team
      (experimental group).

      Statistics analysis will be conducted on teams before and after the implementation of the
      program. The assessment criteria will be: the evolution of characteristics of the task
      interruptions observed (interactions between coordination functions and care delivery
      functions, prevalence, avoidability, duration, resumption of tasks, social representations of
      task interruptions).
