  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tissues of the genitals of women are both androgen (testosterone) and estrogen dependent. The
      clitoris, vestibule, urethra, anterior vaginal wall, peri-urethral tissue, and pelvic floor
      all depend on androgens for normal function. In addition, the glands, which secrete
      lubrication during sexual arousal, also require androgens to function. Deficiencies of both
      estrogens and androgens occur naturally during menopause. Menopause-related deficiencies of
      these hormones lead to thinning in the tissues of the genital and urinary systems which have
      been termed Genitourinary Syndrome of Menopause (GSM). Patients with GSM will frequently
      complain of dryness and/or pain during sexual intercourse.

      Historically, GSM treatment involved both androgens and estrogens, However, over the past few
      decades estrogen based therapies have become much more common. More recently, clinical trials
      have demonstrated that local vaginal dehydroepiandrosterone (Intrarosa®) improves symptoms in
      menopausal women who have moderate to severe pain with intercourse.

      Intrarosa® vaginal inserts are a prescription medicine approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) used in women after menopause to treat moderate to severe pain during
      sexual intercourse caused by changes in and around the vagina that happen with menopause.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tissues in the genitourinary system are both androgen- and estrogen-dependent. The clitoris,
      vestibule, urethra, anterior vaginal wall, peri-urethral tissue, and pelvic floor are
      androgen-responsive. In addition, the minor vestibular glands and the major vestibular glands
      (Bartholin's and Skene's) are androgen-dependent, mucin-secreting glands. Deficiencies of
      both estrogens and androgens can occur both naturally during menopause or iatrogenically
      because of certain medications (e.g. Depo Lupron, spironolactone) or surgically
      (oophorectomy). Menopause-related deficiencies of these sex hormones lead to atrophic changes
      in the genitourinary system which have been termed genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM).

      While erythema is a nonspecific finding in atrophic tissue, focal painful erythema in the
      androgen-dependent vestibule, particularly near the ostia of the Bartholin's glands (4:00 and
      8:00 o'clock) and Skene's glands (1:00 and 11:00 o'clock) or lesser vestibular glands, is
      highly suggestive of GSM. Patients with GSM will frequently complain of penetrative
      dyspareunia and experience allodynia with the cotton swab palpation of the vulvar vestibule.
      During examination of the vulvar vestibule, the examiner might note general pallor with
      superimposed erythema. Physical exam can be improved by magnification (i.e. vulvoscopy).

      Historically, GSM treatment involved both androgens and estrogens. However, in the absence of
      information about intracrinology, over the past few decades, estradiol-based therapies have
      been used exclusively. More recently, double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trials
      demonstrated that local vaginal dehydroepiandrosterone (Intrarosa®) improves symptoms in
      postmenopausal women including moderate to severe dyspareunia. These trials have demonstrated
      improvement in both subjective measures (such as improvement in dyspareunia) as well as
      objective measurement of vaginal health (improved vaginal maturation index, decreased vaginal
      pH) but they have not attempted to demonstrate improvement in the health of the vulvar
      tissue.

    <description>The Vulvar Pain Assessment Questionnaire (VPAQ) was developed to assess the dimensions of the pain experience in studies of chronic pain. It consists of 6 primary (pain severity, emotional response, cognitive response, and interference with life, sexual function, and self-stimulation/penetration) and 3 supplementary subscales (pain quality, coping skills, and partner factors). The pain severity subscale of the VPAQ consists of 3 pairs of verbal rating scale that test both pain intensity and pain affect. Each verbal rating scale is a 5-point scale with the following options: none=0, mild=1, moderate=2, severe=3, and worst possible=4. The calculated mean produces the overall score for the pain severity subscale ranging from 0-4 (4 is the worst score).</description>
