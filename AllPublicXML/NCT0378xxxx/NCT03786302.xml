  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to assess clinically, radiographically, and histologically the
      regenerative ability of Tailored Amorphous Mulioporous (TAMP-BG) bioglass in comparison to
      Biodentine™ (BD) in pulpotomized primary teeth.

      The study was a parallel design, randomized controlled clinical trial It was conducted in the
      out-patient clinic of the Pediatric Dentistry and Dental public health department after
      obtaining the guardians consent. The sample size was calculated to be 35 teeth per group. The
      teeth were randomly and equally assigned to either BD or TAMP-BG groups.The treatment
      follow-up was scheduled at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. The study was terminated for ethical
      considerations after showing significant clinical failure in the TAMP-BG group and after
      performing interim analysis.

    <description>Tailored amorphous multiporous bioglass (TAMP-BG) of 70% SiO2 / 30% CaO was prepared according to Wang et al. (2011, 2013) in the tissue engineering lab, Faculty of Dentistry, Alexandria University as follows: Scaffolds were grounded to 180- to 300-μm particle size and sterilized at 180°C for 2 hours. The resulting powder was mixed with distilled water to obtain a putty like consistency that was carried to the pulp chamber and condensed lightly on the pulp stumps.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Biodentine ™ (BD) pre-dosed capsule were gently tapped on a hard surface to diffuse the powder. Five drops of the liquid from the single dose dispenser were poured into the capsule and mixed for 30 seconds at 4,200 rpm in an amalgamator according to manufacturer's instructions to obtain putty- like consistency. (Powder-liquid system). It was then be carried to the pulp chamber and condensed lightly on the pulp stumps. Final restoration was applied after 12 minutes, allowing Biodentine ™ to set.</description>
