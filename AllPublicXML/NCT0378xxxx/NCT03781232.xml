      The study was established to collect data and reference measurements in order to establish
      calibration models for the Prototype 0.3

    <textblock>
      Subjects are recruited at two different sites.

      Site 1: In group 1 subjects will on their regular stay in the clinic perform four measurement
      sessions a day. A measurement session consist of a reference capillary blood sample and two
      measures on the IMD.

      Site 2: The study in group 2 consists of 26 home-based measurements and two in-clinic days.
      During the home measurements, 6 measurement sessions will be performed by the subjects a day.
      A measurement session consists of two reference BGMs, two reference CGMs and two measurements
      on the device. On in-clinic visits, subjects will be administered high glucose breakfast and
      the following 6-7 hours, measurement sessions are performed every 15 minutes.
