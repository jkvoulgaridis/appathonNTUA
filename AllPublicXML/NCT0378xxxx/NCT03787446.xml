  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While both conventional and advanced MRI techniques offer important insights into MS
      pathophysiology, important aspects of this inflammatory disorder are undetectable with
      existing MRI technology. In Multiple Sclerosis (MS), there is growing interest in PET as an
      imaging modality that can increase the investigator's understanding of the disease processes
      and may add to an understanding of MS phenotype, particularly when combined with advanced MRI
      techniques such as myelin water imaging.

      This is an exploratory study. PBR28 PET scan is new, promising and exploratory endpoints in
      MS clinical trials, making sample size estimation difficult.

      A separate pre-screening consent form will be issued for the TSPO rs6971 polymorphism and
      eGFR blood samples, a separate pre-screening step. Eligible participants, according to their
      TSPO rs6971 polymorphism will be presented a separate study consent form to continue into the
      clinical trial.

      Study Assessments include 1 PET scan, 1 MRI scan, OCT, EDSS exam, physical exam, cognitive
      questionnaires, etc.
