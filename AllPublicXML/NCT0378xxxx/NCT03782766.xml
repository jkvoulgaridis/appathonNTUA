  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was conducted to compare the rate of second molar protraction, level of
      Interleukin1-β in gingival crevicular fluid, periodontal health (gingival index, plaque
      index, and periodontal pocket depth) and perception of pain in patients treated by molar
      protraction with piezocision vs control (no piezocision).

      Twenty-six subjects (39 Molars) who presented with at least one extracted mandibular first
      molar were selected to participate in the study. The subjects were subdivided into one of 3
      groups as follows: group 1 consisted of 18 molars (13 molars from patients with bilateral
      first molar extraction space and 5 molars from patients with unilateral first molar
      extraction space) where piezocision was performed immediately before molar protraction; group
      2 consisted of 21 molars (13 from patients with bilateral first molar extraction space and 8
      molars from patients with unilateral first molar extraction space) where molar protraction
      was performed with no piezocision; group 3 consisted of 21 molars (group 2 subjects where
      piezocision was carried on after 3 months of molar protraction with no piezocision. After
      reaching 0.019X0.025&quot; SS arch wire, NiTi coil spring was used for space closure (protraction
      force was 150g) attached from the lower second molar hook to the head of the mini-screw.
      Piezocision was performed by making 2 vertical incisions mesial and distal to the extraction
      space. Piezotome was inserted in the incisions previously made and bone cuts were done with a
      length up to mucogingival line and depth of 3 mm.

      Gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) sample was obtained from the mesiogingival side of the lower
      second permanent molar with use of Periopaper. GCF sample was repeated 1 day, 1 week and 4
      weeks after molar protraction with piezocision or with no piezocision. Pain was assessed
      using visual analog scale (VAS). Patients were requested to report the level of pain for 7
      consecutive days.
