      â€¢ Adjunctive use of easily-obtainable maternal sonographic vascular measurements assessing
      volume status, cardiac output, and systemic vascular resistance by means of inferior vena
      cava collapsibility/caval index (ICV CI), end-point septal separation (EPSS) for determining
      left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), cardiac output determination (stroke volume x
      heart rate), stroke volume variation, &amp; radial artery resistance index) augments standard
      vital sign assessment (pulse pressure and systolic / diastolic predominance) in clinical
      decision-making potentially leading to more appropriate pharmacologic and clinical therapies
      with faster resolution of severe hypertension among pregnant women and women in the
      postpartum period.

      -  Minutes count when it comes to treating and preventing serious complications associated
           with hypertensive emergencies in pregnancy. The rates of maternal morbidity and
           mortality are on the rise within the United States whereas the rates are falling in the
           rest of the developed world. Cardiovascular and neurologic injury associated with the
           severe hypertension witnessed among women with preeclampsia/eclampsia represent two of
           the leading causes of maternal mortality within the U.S. Optimizing the clinical
           identification and response to these perinatal complications represents one means of
           reducing overall maternal mortality.

        -  Point-of-care use of ultrasound technology to augment clinical diagnosis and management
           is gaining traction throughout nearly all fields of medicine. Obstetricians utilize this
           technology frequently to assess the fetus and maternal-fetal interface, and our ability
           to expand its use to assess a deeper understanding of maternal physiology is
           underutilized. Exploration into the ability to apply clinically-proven point-of-care
           sonographic techniques to augment maternal care and reduce maternal mortality is
           warranted.

        -  The purpose of this study is to gain a deeper understanding of maternal physiologic
           changes using easily-obtainable sonographic vascular measurements in the setting of
           hypertensive emergencies and to assess the utility of these adjunctive maternal
           sonographic measurements in augmenting clinical decision-making.
