  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted over a 3 year time period. This is a trial of an exercise
      intervention vs. standard of care in patients receiving chronic dialysis. The specific aims
      will be to determine feasibility of patient recruitment, adherence to the exercise program,
      and efficacy of the intervention on patient important outcomes.

      The exercise intervention will be delivered to randomized participants for 12 months, and
      consist of the prescribed use of Nordic Walking poles, regular use of a pedometer to monitor
      progress, and for participants with Wi-Fi access, participation in a physical activity social
      network with other patients. Both groups will receive regular verbal encouragement to
      exercise (monthly) by dialysis unit staff. Both groups will receive the same standard of care
      co-interventions including individualized dialysis prescriptions and health-care interactions
      according to practices at their centre.

    <description>Participants in the intervention group will be given an exercise prescription to increase their baseline steps by 1200 and 2000 steps per day at least 3 days a week over the first 3 months. If tolerated and accepted, the participants will increase their step counts by an additional 600 to 1000 steps per day at least 3 days a week for the next 3 months.This will be followed by a 6-month maintenance phase. The research coordinator will instruct the participants on the proper use of the Nordic walking poles which can be used to help participants achieve their prescribed number of steps.
All participants will be encouraged to wear the pedometer throughout the trial in order to follow the step-count prescription, monitor adherence and allow them to join a virtual exercise group that will include dialysis patients with similar levels of baseline activity.</description>
