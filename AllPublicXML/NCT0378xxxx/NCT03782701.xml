  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study designed to test if Lumify™ eyedrops temporarily raise the upper eyelid.
      Lumify™ is an FDA approved medication for reducing eye redness. A similar, but stronger
      product is also used to treat glaucoma. Whether or not it affects the position of the eyelids
      has not been studied, but we believe that it will raise the position of the upper eyelid,
      making the eye appear more open.
