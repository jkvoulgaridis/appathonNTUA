      Phase 2, single center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel design study
      of CA-008 vs. placebo in subjects undergoing an elective C-ABD under general anesthesia
      supplemented with a bupivacaine hydrochloride (HCl)transverse abdominis plane (TAP) block.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel
      design study evaluating up to 4 ascending dose level cohorts, each evaluating a single dose
      of CA-008 vs. placebo injected/instilled during an elective C-ABD. Up to 72 subjects may be
      randomized in 4 cohorts.

      For each subject, postsurgical assessments will be conducted in two parts:

        -  Inpatient period: starts with completion of study treatment injection (T0) and continues
           through 96 hours (T96h).

        -  Outpatient period: begins on discharge from the inpatient unit through various follow up
           visits to day 29 (D29)/week 4 (W4) after surgery. Note that additional follow up visits
           may occur at any time or even after D29/W4 to follow adverse events (AEs) to resolution
           or establishment of a new baseline.

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Plan to undergo an elective complete abdominoplasty (C-ABD), without collateral
             procedure or additional surgeries.

          -  In the medical judgment of the investigator, be a reasonably healthy adult aged 18 -
             65 years old, inclusive, and American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) physical Class 1
             or 2 at the time of randomization.

          -  In the opinion of the Investigator, have a concurrent painful condition that may
             require analgesic treatment during the study period or may confound post-surgical pain
             assessments.

                  of screening.

               3. Within the 7 days prior to surgery, be taking any central nervous system (CNS)
                  active agent as an analgesic adjunct medication, such as anticonvulsants,
                  antidepressants, benzodiazepines, sedative- hypnotics, clonidine and other
                  central alpha-2 agents, ketamine or muscle relaxants.

             i. These drugs are permitted if prescribed for non-pain indications and the dose has
             been stable for at least 30 days prior to surgery.
