  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A unicentric, blind, non-comparative clinical study to prove the perceived efficacy of the
      research product.

      It will be necessary 33 female research participants, aged between 45 and 70 years menopause
      with complaint of vaginal dryness.

      The participant will remain in the study for one day, making use of the research product in
      the Research Center.

      Participants will be divided into 2 groups so that each group observes the viscosity (flow)
      of the test product in a different anatomical position (lying down and standing) immediately
      after application of the product, after 15 and 30 minutes.

      Participants will respond to a subjective assessment using a standardized questionnaire to
      capture possible feelings of discomfort during the study.

      A gynecologist will be available to monitor the participants throughout the study.
