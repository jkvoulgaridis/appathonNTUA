  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the use of Brimonidine tartrate nanoemulsion eye drop solution in the
      treatment of Dry Eye Disease (DED). Half of participants will receive Brimonidine and half
      will receive ophthalmic buffered saline (placebo).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dry eye disease (DED) is a common ocular disorder involving the aberrant production and
      instability of tear film, which results in damage to the ocular surface and is correlated
      with symptoms of ocular discomfort.

      This study will be a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-masked, multicenter phase 3 study
      in the United States conducted at approximately 25 centers. Upon meeting the eligibility
      criteria, enrolled subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 (test:control) fashion to
      receive either Brimonidine Nanoemulsion Eye Drops 0.20% investigational product (test) or
      ophthalmic buffered saline (placebo).
