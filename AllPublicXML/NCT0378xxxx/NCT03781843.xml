  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Genicular nerve block is a safe and effective therapeutic procedure for intractable pain
      associated with chronic knee osteoarthritis (OA). There is increasing support for the
      neuropathic component to the knee OA pain. Investigators proposed that targeting treatment to
      the underlying pain mechanism can improve pain management in knee OA. There is a debate on
      injectable solutions used in nerve blocks. Investigators aimed to investigate the efficacy of
      genicular nerve block and to determine which solution should be appropriate for patients with
      knee osteoarthritis who have neuropathic or nociceptive pain.

      The patients who participated in this study were selected from outpatients who attended our
      hospital for knee pain. These 90 patients were who matched the following criteria. All
      patients had knee pain for more than 3 months.

      The ultrasound-guided genicular nerve block was performed at the site of the superior
      lateral, the superior medial, and the inferior medial genicular nerves. Color Doppler was
      used to identify the arterial structures which serve as landmarks for the corresponding
      nerves. This method was used to inject a total of 6 mL of lidocaine or 6 mL dextrose or 6 mL
      saline at 3 separate target sites: the superior lateral, superior medial, and inferior medial
      genicular nerves.

      Pain was evaluated with Analog Analogue Scale (VAS), daily living activities with Western
      Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC), maximum distance walked with
      Lequesne Score, and neuropathic pain was evaluated with painDETECT inquiry form. Outcome
      measures were assessed at baseline and at 1st, 4th weeks, and 3rd months after the procedure.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Efficacy of genicular nerve block on neuropathic pain reduction in knee osteoarthritis</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Neuropathic pain reduction is measured by painDETECT questionnaire (PD-Q) which consists of 9 items that evaluate pain quality, pattern and radiation. Possible scores range from -1 to 38, with higher scores indicating more neuropathic-like symptoms. Clinical assessments:score ≤12: unlikely neuropathic pain; score 13-18: possibly neuropathic pain, and score ≥19:likely neuropathic pain.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Efficacy of genicular nerve block on nociceptive pain reduction in knee osteoarthritis.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Nociceptive pain reduction is measured by Visual analogue scales (VAS). The score is determined by measuring the distance (mm) on the 10‐cm line between the &quot;no pain&quot; anchor and the patient's mark, providing a range of scores from 0-100. A higher score indicates greater pain intensity. Pain intensity as none, mild, moderate, or severe, the following cut points on the pain VAS have been recommended: no pain (0-4 mm), mild pain (5-44 mm), moderate pain (45-74 mm), and severe pain (75- 100 mm).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Efficacy of genicular nerve block on physical function in knee osteoarthritis.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Physical functional disability is measured by the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC). The WOMAC index is a self-administered health questionnaire specifically designed for patients with osteoarthritis of the hip or knee. It consists of 24 multiple-choice items grouped into 3 categories: WOMAC pain, WOMAC stiffness, and WOMAC physical function. The questions are ranked on a 5-point Likert scale (1 point, best result; 5 points, worst result), and the scores are added up for each category. The WOMAC scores from 1 (best) to 5 (worst) points to a system of 0 (worst) to 100 (best) points.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Efficacy of genicular nerve block on walking distance in knee osteoarthritis.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Walking distance with or without walking aids is measured by Lequesne algofunctional index.The Lequesne OA index is a 11-question interview format questionnaire with three sections about pain or discomfort, maximum distance walked and possible necessity of crutches and activities of daily living . The Lequesne OA index is scored as the sum of all questions ranging from 0 to 24. Lower score indicates less dysfunction where 0 = no handicap, 1-4 = mild handicap, 5-7 = moderate handicap, 8-10 = severe handicap, 11-13 = very severe handicap, and ≥14 = extremely severe handicap.</description>

    <description>The ultrasound-guided genicular nerve block was performed at the site of the superior lateral, the superior medial, and the inferior medial genicular nerves. Color Doppler was used to identify the arterial structures which serve as landmarks for the corresponding nerves.10 cm 21 G insulated block needle was inserted and aligned with the ultrasound scanning plane. Once satisfactory position of the needle is confirmed, 6 mL of a solution containing 6 mL of 2% lidocaine or 6 mL dextrose or 6 mL saline was slowly injected. Spread of local anesthetic was documented adjacent to the target nerve. This procedure was performed at the site of the three genicular nerves Interventions: Drug: 6 mL 2% lidocaine Procedure: Genicular nerve block</description>
