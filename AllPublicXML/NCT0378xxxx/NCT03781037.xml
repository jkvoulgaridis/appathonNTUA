  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will develop and pilot test a novel intervention module targeting perceived
      burdensomeness toward others in 30 clinic referred youths who experience anxiety or
      depression and elevated levels of burdensomeness. All participants will be assigned to
      receive the intervention in this open trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Suicidal ideation is prevalent and impairing in youth, with approximately 15% of high school
      students reporting seriously considering a suicide attempt and making a specific plan for
      suicide in the past 12 months. Substantial evidence documents perceived burdensomeness
      towards others, or the belief that one is a burden or drain on others, as a risk factor for
      suicide ideation in youth. This evidence highlights the potential promise of perceived
      burdensomeness as a novel intervention target to prevent suicide ideation in youth. The
      current study will develop and preliminary evaluate a novel, brief behavioral treatment
      module targeting perceived burdensomeness in youth that can be embedded within existing
      psychosocial treatments. The study will use an open trial design. The first aim of this
      proposal is to develop a novel, brief psychosocial intervention module (the GIVE module)
      targeting perceived burdensomeness towards others that can be embedded within existing CBT
      protocols for youth internalizing problems. The second aim is to collect data relevant to
      client satisfaction and reductions in perceived burdensomeness. Participants will be N=30
      clinic-referred youth ages 10 to 17 years with anxiety or depressive disorders in a
      university-based research clinic, who display elevated levels of perceived burdensomeness. In
      the context on ongoing CBT for anxiety or depression, participants will complete the GIVE
      module at sessions 6 and 7 of the CBT protocol. It is hypothesized that perceived
      burdensomeness will be significantly lower after the GIVE module is administered, and that
      client satisfaction will be high. Data collected in this study will provide the foundation
      for a subsequent randomized controlled trial of the GIVE module.

    <description>The GIVE module consists of one 50-minute treatment session and a second partial session (15-20 minutes) embedded within a larger cognitive behavioral treatment (CBT) protocol for anxiety or depression. The GIVE module uses cognitive behavioral principles to target youth's beliefs that they are a burden or drain on others.</description>
