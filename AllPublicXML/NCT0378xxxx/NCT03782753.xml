  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized clinically
      by bradykinesia, resting tremor, rigidity, and postural instability. Little is known about
      the mechanisms underlying neuronal degeneration in PD and currently, no treatment is
      available to halt disease progression in PD.

      The pathophysiological characterisation of phenomena occurring in the time window between the
      pathological start of the disease and the onset of motor symptoms is crucial to develop
      potential neuroprotective agents.

      Several genes have been discovered providing important insights on the pathogenesis of PD.
      Mutations of Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are associated with 2-5% of all PD cases in
      North American Caucasians. LRRK2 is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the autosomal
      dominant Parkinson's disease-8 (PARK8) gene, which is associated with an increased risk of
      PD.

      Clinical and digital biomarkers, blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers and molecular
      positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, with specific radioligands, provide invaluable
      insights to help understand and characterise disease pathophysiology.

      The investigators aim to characterize molecular phenomena underlying LRRK2 PD with the hope
      of providing further insights into possible mechanisms taking place in PD and to help
      identify targets for disease-modifying therapeutics.
