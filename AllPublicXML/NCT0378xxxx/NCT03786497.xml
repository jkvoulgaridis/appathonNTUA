  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple disorders in the neonatal period are associated with high risk of neurological
      impairment. Therapeutic hypothermia is known to be the standard treatment for infants with
      hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy and continuous brain monitoring, including amplitude
      integrated EEG and Near Infrared Spectroscopy, provides useful information for the clinician
      at the bedside. Despite the described benefits, it is estimated that less than 5% of
      Brazilian neonatal centers are well structured and trained to provide therapeutic hypothermia
      or continuous brain monitoring to infants at high risk. In order to reduce the existing gap,
      an advanced telemedicine model is proposed as an alternative to provide neuroprotection
      strategies in developing countries.

      Methods: This is a multi-center prospective observational cohort study conducted in 20
      neonatal intensive care units in Brazil. The inclusion period will be for 5 years. All
      patients will be assessed after hospital discharge between 18 and 24 months of life. Were
      included all infants admitted on the neonatal intensive care units who underwent brain
      monitoring with two channel aEEG/EEG and/or NIRS, presenting inclusion criteria as following:
      hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, extreme prematurity, severe peri-intraventricular
      hemorrhage, congenital heart disease, brain malformations, congenital infections, sepsis,
      inborn errors of metabolism, cardiac arrest and also seizures due to various causes.
      Recruitment was ahead of target by eleven months and approvals were obtained allowing
      recruitment to continue to the end of the planned recruitment phase.

      Discussion: The Protecting Brains and Saving Futures study will evaluate the feasibility of
      establishing a telemedicine model to provide remote assistance to neonates at high risk for
      brain injury, evaluation of protocol adherence and patients who underwent TH. Furthermore,
      imaging findings, morbi-mortality and neurodevelopment data will be correlated.
