  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Application of trigger point dry needling can induce post-dry needling soreness. This is not
      a negative experience, but sometimes some patients want to reduce it as much as possible.
      Different therapeutic strategies targeting to decrease post-dry needling soreness need to be
      investigated. Previous studies have investigated spray and stretch, ischemic compression or
      low-load eccentric exercise as post-needling intervention procedures. There is increasing
      evidence supporting the role of descending pain inhibition mechanisms for paon control. The
      application of virtual reality as a distraction technique could active brain mechanisms
      during dry needling. Therefore, the objective of this study will be to investigate the
      effects of playing virtual reality during the application of dry needling on post-needling
      soreness over trigger points in the extensor carpi radialis brevis muscle. A secondary aim
      will be to determine the prognostic role of baseline scores of pressure pain sensitivity,
      related-disability, anxiety and catastrophizing levels.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Baseline score of upper extremity related-disability assessed with the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The DASH questionaire consists of 30-items assessing: 1, degree of difficulty during the preceding week in performing physical activities because of problems in the upper extremity (21 items); 2, severity of each pain symptom, activity-related pain, tingling, weakness, and stiffness (5 items); and, 3, the problem's effect on social activities, work, and sleep, and its psychological impact (4 items). Each item is answered on a 5-points scale ranging from 1 (no difficulty to perform, no symptom, or no impact) to 5 (unable to do, very severe symptom, or high impact). Responses are summed to form a raw score that is converted to a 0 to 100 scale where higher scores reflect greater related-disability.</description>

    <measure>Baseline data on pressure pain sensitivity assessed with a pressure algometer</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Pressure pain thresholds over the cervical spine, the lateral epicondyle and the tibialis anterior muscle will be assessed with a pressure algometer at baseline</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Baseline anxiety levels as assessed with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The STAI is a 40 items scale assessing separate dimensions of state anxiety (items l-20, STAI-S) and trait anxiety (items 21-40, STAI-T). The STAI-S items assess relatively enduring symptoms of anxiety. Participants use a 4-points response scale ranging from &quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;very much&quot;, to indicate the extent to which they experience each emotion. The STAI-T scale measures a stable propensity to experience anxiety, and tendencies to perceive stressful situations as threatening. It consists of 20 statements requiring individuals to rate how they generally feel on a 4-points scale. In both scales, higher scores indicate greater state or trait anxiety.</description>

    <measure>Catastrophizing belief as assessed with the Pain Catastrophizing Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Pain Catastrophizing Scale will be used for determining baseline participant's propensity to catastrophize about pain. It consists of 13-items evaluating the three components of catastrophizing: rumination, magnification and helplessness.</description>
