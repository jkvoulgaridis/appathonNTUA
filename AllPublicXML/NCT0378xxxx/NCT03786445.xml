      A retrospective analysis of 1,664 emergency forms from MET activities, ranging from January
      2013 to December 2016. Every MET activation call via the emergency telephone number (&quot;5555&quot;)
      and following emergency treatment was recorded by a standardized documentation form.

    <textblock>
      Recent studies demonstrated that in-hospital emergencies are linked to a higher mortality in
      patients. In total, 1 out of 10 patients is suffering from an unexpected incident during the
      hospital stay. Therefore, establishing and developing medical emergency teams (MET) is
      getting more important in the future. Aim of the present study was an analysis of medical
      documentation, operational tactics and procedures taken by MET in a 4-year-period, ranging
      from 2013 to 2016. A retrospective analysis of 1,664 emergency forms from MET activities,
      ranging from January 2013 to December 2016. Every MET activation call via the emergency
      telephone number (&quot;5555&quot;) and following emergency treatment was recorded by a standardized
      documentation form.
