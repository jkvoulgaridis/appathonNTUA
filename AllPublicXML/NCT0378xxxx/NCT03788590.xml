    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that transcatheter artificial aortic valve and
      transcatheter artificial heart values delivery system is associated with a reduction of
      all-cause mortality in severe aortic stenosis or insufficiency patients who are high risk or
      ineligible for aortic valve replacement.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aortic valve diseases is usually caused by rheumatic fever, congenital aortic valve
      structural abnormality or degenerative aortic valve calcification. Transcatheter aortic valve
      implantation (TAVI) has evolved as an alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR)
      with now more than 50,000 implantations in patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis,
      who were considered to be at very high or prohibitive operative risk.

      This project take the incidence of all-cause mortality at 12 months since TAVI as the primary
      endpoint to evaluate the safety and efficacy, then take the procedure success rate, device
      success rate, incidence of severe adverse events, device operative performance, prosthetic
      valve performance and quality of life to evaluate transcatheter artificial aortic valve and
      transcatheter artificial heart values delivery system of Ningbo Jenscare Biotechnology Co.,
      Ltd. in clinical application.
