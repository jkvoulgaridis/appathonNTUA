    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of deflazacort in participants
      with LGMD2I. Most participants enrolled will have a screening visit and 3 additional visits
      (after 1, 13, and 26 weeks of treatment).

    <description>Participants will receive deflazacort 0.6 milligrams per kilograms per day (mg/kg/day) orally. The dose could be reduced in case of tolerability issues. Any participant assigned to placebo prior to the Version 4.0 amendment (prior to or after 01 February 2020) will have the option to be consented under Version 4.0 and will be switched to deflazacort for 26 weeks treatment. Any participant assigned to deflazacort prior to the Version 4.0 amendment (prior to 01 February 2020) will have the option to re-consent under Protocol Version 4.0 and continue for an additional 26 weeks treatment. Any participant assigned to deflazacort prior to the Version 4.0 amendment (after 01 February 2020) will have the option to re-consent under Protocol Version 4.0 at their Week 13 Visit and continue treatment until Week 26. Any new participant enrolled until 31 May 2020 will receive deflazacort for 26 weeks.</description>
