    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted to assess the safety and tolerability of BOS172738 when
      administered to patients with advanced solid tumors with rearranged during transfection (RET)
      gene alterations and also to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended
      phase 2 dose (RP2D) of BOS172738.

    <description>In Part A (dose escalation), participants with advanced solid tumors with rearranged during transfection (RET) gene alterations will receive oral BOS172738 at a starting dose of 10 milligrams (mg) once daily in each 28-day cycle. In Part B (dose expansion), participants with RET gene-fusion non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with RET gene-mutant medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), and with RET gene-altered advanced tumors or NSCLC/MTC with prior specific RET gene-targeted therapy will be enrolled in Cohorts 1, 2, and 3, respectively, and will receive oral BOS172738 once daily in each 28-day cycle at the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) established in Part A.</description>

          -  Uncontrolled or severe concurrent medical condition

          -  History of upper GI bleeding, ulceration, or perforation within 12 months prior to the
             first dose of study drug

          -  Known history of stroke or cerebrovascular accident within 6 months prior to the first
             dose of study drug

          -  Participants with known infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or Acquired
             Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) (testing not required)

          -  Participants who are hepatitis B surface antigen positive or participants who are
             hepatitis C antibody positive (Participants who have been successfully treated for
             hepatitis C virus [HCV] are eligible if an undetectable HCV viral load at least 6
             months after completion of treatment can be demonstrated.)

          -  Any evidence of serious active infections

          -  Uncontrolled or severe cardiovascular disease

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness or psychiatric illness/social situations that would
             limit compliance with study requirements
