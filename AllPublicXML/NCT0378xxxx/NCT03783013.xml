  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine if tomato-soy juice can reduce
      inflammation, which is linked to chronic disease
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to improve understanding of how diet can ameliorate the state of
      chronic inflammation. Short term inflammation is an important part of the body's response to
      injury, but long term inflammation, as happens in the state of obesity, can result in a
      multitude of secondary problems, like cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Using a
      novel tomato-soy juice, we aim to demonstrate the potential of tomato-soy juice for reducing
      inflammation in adults.

    <description>Metabolomics is the simultaneous measurement of the many thousand small molecule metabolites. Chromatography separates the metabolites, which are then ionized, then the detector detects the number of ion hits for each ion, which reflects the amount (number of ions) of a particular compound. If the detector detects more of an ion in blood or urine after one treatment vs. another, then the position on the chromatogram (units of time in minutes) and the ratio of the mass (atomic mass units) to charge (unitless) of the compound will be compared to the 75,000 entries in the METLIN metabolite library to identify what the compound is.</description>
