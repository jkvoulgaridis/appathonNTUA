      A prospective non-randomized open label single arm clinical trial to examine the efficacy and
      safety of sirolimus in patients with Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PJS (Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome) is mostly caused by mutations in Lkb1 gene, which leads to an
      increased activity of mTOR pathway, thus making mTOR inhibitor (sirolimus) a promising
      candidate in treatment and prevention of PJS. The efficacy of sirolimus (rapamycin) on PJS
      has been demonstrated in mouse model, but no clinical trials have been reported. Our study
      was designed as a prospective non-randomized open label single arm clinical trial to examine
      its efficacy and safety.

If it is impossible to evaluate 3 or more lesions, results of the actual number of lesions should be taken as valid; 2. Lesions evaluated should be correspondent before and after treatment. If the lesion is difficult to assess after treatment, it should be ruled out from the assessment.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients are diagnosed with PJS.

          -  Patients have gastrointestinal polyps related syndromes, including abdominal pain,
             abdominal distension, gastrointestinal bleeding, etc, with imageological examination
             suggesting intestinal obstruction or intussusception; or whose symptoms recur after
             previous digestive endoscopic treatment and surgery; or who are inappropriate or
             unwilling to accept the above treatment again and wish to receive pharmacotherapy.

          -  Conventional treatment didn't work well in patients combined with PJS-related tumors.

          -  Physical condition (ECGO): 0~3
