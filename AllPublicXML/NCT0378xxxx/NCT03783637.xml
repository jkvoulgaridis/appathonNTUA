  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to identify markers of a single meal of whole grain
      oat and whole grain wheat intake in humans.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to identify compounds that are found in blood and urine and are
      derived from a single meal of whole grain oat or whole grain wheat intake so that
      epidemiological studies can be conducted to provide more accurate associations between whole
      grain intake and health.

    <measure>Identification of unknown biomarkers of grain intake immediately after grain consumption</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 8</time_frame>
    <description>Blood and Urine metabolomics profiling will be conducted. Metabolomics refers to the complete set of small molecule metabolites. The METLIN Metabolomics Database is a repository of such chemicals and contains over 75,000 entries, thus metabolomics is a very broad assessment. Blood and urine will be broadly analyzed with mass spectrometers for metabolomics, and all ionizing compounds will be captured by the detector, which reports the ratio of mass of the compound to the charge (units: m/z which is mass to charge). The mass-to-charges will be compared across different time points of collection, and appearance of mass-to-charges in some collections (but not found in others when grains were not consumed) will indicate a biomarker of grain intake.</description>
