  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This a randomized clinical trial involving children with non-operative fractures presenting
      the emergency department randomized either to intranasal or intravenous ketamine.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if Intranasal Ketamine (INK) is efficacious for
      Procedural Sedation and Analgesia (PSA) when compared to Intravenous Ketamine (IVK) in
      children with non-operative fractures. The primary aim is to determine if INK provides
      non-inferior sedation to IVK as defined by a Modified Ramsay Sedation score of ≥ 4 and also
      to compare the proportion of successful procedure between two treatment groups. The secondary
      aim is to compare proportion of adverse events and compare duration of sedation and length of
      emergency department (ED) stay between treatment groups.

    <description>Determine if IN ketamine provides non-inferior sedation to IV ketamine as defined by a Modified Ramsay Sedation score of ≥ 4. Modified Ramsay Sedation scale is used to evaluate levels of sedation. The scale range is from 0 to 6 with a higher score indicated deeper levels of sedation. At levels of 4 or greater is set to be satisfactory for deep sedation.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of adequately sedated participants successfully completing the procedure without requiring rescue medications.</measure>
    <time_frame>From induction to 60 minutes.</time_frame>
    <description>Rescue medication is defined as requiring additional doses of Ketamine to maintain adequate sedation. Successful procedure completion will be define as completing the procedure with only the induction dose and without requiring rescue medications.</description>

    <measure>Proportions of patients with non-serious adverse events.</measure>
    <time_frame>From induction to 6 hours.</time_frame>
