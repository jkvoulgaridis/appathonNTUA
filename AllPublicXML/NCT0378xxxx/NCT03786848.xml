      The investigators intend to use the Second-generation sequencing（NGS）and MiniPDX drug
      sensitivity models to guide the treatment decision-making for patients who were resistant to
      abiraterone, enzalutamide or other new second-generation anti-androgenic drugs. In order to
      develop precise personalized treatment plans for patients and extent their lifetimes.

    <textblock>
      Most patients with metastatic prostate cancer are effective in endocrine therapy at the
      beginning, but after a median survival of 12 to 18 months, almost all patients develop
      castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Since the pathogenesis of CRPC is still unknown,
      the clinical lack of precise treatment for the cause is a difficult and hot topic in current
      research and treatment. Mini patient derived xenograft (MiniPDX) is a drug sensitivity test
      model established by transplanting primary human tumor cells into immunodeficient mice by
      special methods. This efficient drug sensitivity test can provide sensitivities of single
      drug or drug combination in order to screen out the optimal individualized regimens for each
      patient. The investigators intend to use the Second-generation sequencing（NGS）and MiniPDX
      drug sensitivity models to guide the treatment decision-making for patients who were
      resistant with abiraterone, enzalutamide or other new second-generation anti-androgenic
      drugs. This project is to develop precise personalized treatment plans for patients and
      extent their lifetimes.
