  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research has shown that people with depressive symptoms maintain negative expectations even
      if they have positive experiences that contradict their expectations. Healthy people,
      however, change their expectations after unexpected positive experiences. In this
      experimental study, it will now be examined whether there are also differences between
      healthy people and people with depressive symptoms in dealing with unexpected negative
      experiences.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Research has already shown that people with depressive symptoms continue to hold on to
      negative expectations even if they have positive experiences that contradict their
      expectations. By contrast, healthy people change their expectations after unexpectedly
      positive experiences. In this experimental study, the authors will now examine whether there
      are also differences between healthy people and people with depressive symptoms in processing
      unexpectedly negative experiences. It is hypothesized that people with depressive symptoms
      change their expectations in a negative direction after unexpectedly negative experiences,
      while healthy people continue to hold on to an optimistic view.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>2-Item Performance Expectations Scale - generalized</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately before the performance test and immediately after completion of the performance test</time_frame>
    <description>Changes from baseline to postassessment in generalized performance expectations. Each item is scored from 1 to 7 (1 = very negative expectations, 7 = very positive expectations), yielding a total score between 2 and 14. Higher total scores reflect more positive expectations.</description>

    <measure>5-Item Cognitive Immunization after Performance Feedback (CIPF) scale</measure>

    <description>Engagement in cognitive immunization strategies after receiving performance feedback. Each item is scored from 1 to 7 (1 = no cognitive immunization, 7 = great engagement in cognitive immunization), yielding a total score between 5 and 35. Higher total scores reflect a greater engagement in cognitive immunization strategies.</description>
