    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of this project is to pilot test a manual wheelchair (MWC) training
      program based on motor learning theory to improve wheelchair propulsion for manual wheelchair
      users (MWUs) with spinal cord injury (SCI).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The project objective is to conduct a pilot randomized control trial (RCT) examining (1) the
      number of task-specific repetitions required to produce change in wheelchair propulsion
      techniques and (2) identifying the most conducive surface (overground or on a stationary
      device such as rollers) for implementing a repetition-based manual wheelchair propulsion
      training program. The long-term goals of this research are to minimize upper extremity pain
      and chronic overuse injury and to increase mobility efficiency in in persons with SCI who use
      MWCs for everyday mobility. The current project goal is to test the effects of a
      repetition-based manual wheelchair propulsion training program that emphasizes the
      recommended clinical practice guidelines (CPG). The expected outcome will be evidence to use
      in training MWUs with SCI in proper propulsion techniques in order to prevent or delay pain
      and chronic overuse injuries and maximize mobility through efficient wheelchair propulsion
      techniques. The long-term impact will be implementing evidence-based MWC propulsion training
      in appropriate amounts to facilitate a reduction in pain and dysfunction, a reduction in
      health costs, and prolonged participation in major life activities for MWUs with SCI.

      Our research aims are to:

        1. Compare wheelchair propulsion kinematics, kinetics, and wheelchair performance changes
           among three independent groups (Roller Group, Overground Group, Wheelchair Skills
           Group).

        2. Characterize the dose-response relationship of repetition-based propulsion practice.

        3. Evaluate the long-term impact of propulsion training on performance in the lived
           environment.

      A single-blind pilot RCT will be conducted. Forty-eight individuals with SCI who use MWCs and
      who do not follow the recommended clinical guidelines for propulsion will be recruited. Each
      participant will be randomized into one of three independent groups: motor learning
      repetitions on a roller system (RG), motor learning repetitions overground (OG), or the
      placebo-controlled group receiving conventional MWC skills training (WSG). The WSG will
      operate as a placebo by receiving basic MWC skills training—the current standard of
      rehabilitation care. Participants' kinematics (video motion analysis), kinetics (SmartWheel),
      and wheelchair performance overground (Wheelchair Propulsion Test) will be assessed
      pre-intervention (Baseline), immediately following intervention (Follow-up), and three
      months' post-intervention (3-Month Follow-up).

    <description>Kinematic data will be collected using a 3D infrared VMC system (VICON, Centennial, CO).106 The VMC system consists of 14 Vero 2.2 digital cameras to detect the location of reflective markers, which will be attached to the participant's third metacarpal and to the wheel axle of the participant's MWC. As the participant propels through the capture volume, the VMC will record the motion of the participant's third metacarpal in relation to the wheelchair axle. Hand-axle relationship will be measured in centimeters and compared across the three testing sessions. This variable corresponds to the recommendations outlined in the CPG (bringing the hand down toward the axle during recovery [hand-axle relationship].</description>

    <measure>Wheelchair User's Shoulder Pain Index (WUSPI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Up to 4 weeks post intervention and 3-month post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>A self-report measure of shoulder pain in manual wheelchair users (MWUs) during functional activities. The WUSPI consists of a 15-item questionnaire addressing shoulder pain during 15 activities within four domains: transfers, wheelchair mobility, self-care, and general activities. A 10-point visual analog scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain) is used to determine pain intensity experienced during each activity. The WUSPI score (from 0 [no pain] to 150 [worst pain] across all items) indicates the participant's level of shoulder pain during functional activities. Reliability and validity have been established by sampling long-term MWUs. The WUSPI has excellent test-retest reliability (ICC = .99),3 excellent internal consistency (α = .97),3 and moderate concurrent validity (r = -.49). Excellent convergent validity was established by correlating the WUSPI with pain intensity on a numeric rating scale (r = .77; p &lt; .003).</description>

          -  Have a mobility limitation due to SCI, which requires the use of a manual wheelchair
             (MWC)

          -  Be able to self-propel a MWC bilaterally with their upper extremities

          -  Plan to use a MWC for at least 75% of activities throughout the day

          -  Live in the community

          -  Understand English at a sixth-grade level or higher

          -  Be able to follow multi-step instructions

          -  Participants must be able to provide informed consent independently

          -  Be able to tolerate propelling their wheelchair independently for 10 meters

          -  Be willing to participate in three assessments and up to 13 training sessions at the
             Enabling Mobility in the Community Laboratory (EMC Lab).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  People will be excluded if they maneuver their MWC with their lower extremities or
             with only one upper extremity.

          -  Individuals who display the proper MWC propulsion techniques during the screening
             process, who already follow the CPG, or whose MWC position inhibits them from
             following the CPG will be excluded.

          -  Potential participants also will be excluded if they have bilateral incoordination due
             to strength inequality or neurological involvement that impairs propulsion in a
             steady, straight line. Specifically, if a person demonstrates upper extremity strength
             inequalities resulting in a 12-inch deviation from a marked pathway, he or she will be
             excluded.

          -  Other exclusionary criteria include surgeries compromising the integrity of the upper
             extremities or cardiovascular complications within the past year.

          -  Potential participants will also be excluded if upper extremity or overall bodily pain
             is rated 8/10 or higher per the Wong-Baker FACES Numeric Pain Scale (FACES). -In
             addition, potential participants will be excluded if they are currently receiving
             medical treatment for an acute upper extremity injury, have a Stage IV pressure
             injury, or are currently hospitalized.
