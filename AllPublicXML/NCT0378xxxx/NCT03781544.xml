      Evaluation of the effect of different analgesic treatments (Tramadol, Paracetamol,
      Diclofenac) on sympathetic nerve activity, blood pressure, heart rate, heart rate, and
      vascular function in osteoarthritis patients and healthy subjects.

    <textblock>
      Hundreds of millions of patients worldwide require pain-relieving therapy to maintain an
      acceptable quality of life. Pain relievers, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
      (NSAIDs) and opioids, however, exert unwanted potent adverse systemic off-target effects and
      their use is associated with a well-documented excess of cerebrovascular and cardiovascular
      events. This of particular concern for the one fourth of the world's population aged over 35
      years suffering from chronic pain, particularly with arthritis of whom half also present with
      established or at high risk of cardiovascular disease. This uncertainty around the
      cardiovascular safety of pain relieving drugs leaves practitioners and their patients with
      difficult management decisions and underscores the need to investigate potential differential
      cardiovascular effects of NSAIDs and opioids and to better delineate the underlying
      mechanisms involved. Indeed, currently available NSAIDs invariably disrupt the balance
      between prostacyclin and thromboxane, but may also exert multiple and opposing cardiovascular
      effects on endothelial factors, including nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species, the
      sympathetic nervous system and vascular inflammation. Intriguingly, the net effect of pain
      relieving drugs on vascular function and sympathetic nerve activity and its resulting
      deterioration of blood pressure control is increasingly recognized as a major possible
      determinant in explaining the cardiovascular side effects of NSAIDs. As a result of the
      ongoing concerns around the cardiovascular safety of NSAIDs and coxibs many patients are
      being withheld effective pain relieve or switched to opioids and/or paracetamol under the
      assumption of their yet unproven greater cardiovascular safety. The absence of evidence about
      the cardiovascular safety of these drugs presents a major dilemma for patients and
      physicians, who have been warned about the toxicity of NSAIDs.

    <description>Effect of different single analgesic treatments (Tramadol, Paracetamol, Diclofenac) on resting muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) in osteoarthritis patients (post 2 days of analgesic therapy washout phase) and in healthy subjects.
Tramadol treatment will be compared to diclofenac and paracetamol (3 treatment arms).

    <description>Effect of a single acute intravenous analgesic treatment with tramadol versus paracetamol on changes in flow mediated dilatation (FMD) in osteoarthritis patients and in healthy subjects.
Tramadol treatment will be compared with paracetamol as we previously demonstrated that paracetamol exerts no significant effects on endothelial function as measured by flow mediated dilatation.
