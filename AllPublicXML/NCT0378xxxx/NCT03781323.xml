  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the treatment of patients with locally advanced
      rectal cancer for complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy without the use of radiation
      and surgery.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      These patients will be evaluated for complete clinical response (cCR) after completing 10
      cycles of FOLFOX (fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin) chemotherapy, with interval analysis
      after six cycles. Patients who have stable or progressive disease will be treated per
      discretion of the treating physician following multidisciplinary discussion. Those determined
      to have partial or complete response will complete full neoadjuvant treatment and undergo
      close surveillance with watchful waiting for local recurrence without immediate surgery. The
      primary endpoint of this study will be the rate of cCR, which is to include complete and near
      complete clinical response, with secondary endpoints of disease free survival (DFS), overall
      survival (OS), quality of life (QOL), as well as evaluation of safety and toxicity.

    <description>A complete response will consist of a digital rectal exam with normal appearing mucosa and sigmoidoscopy/proctoscopy with scarring but no nodularity or ulcerations.
A near complete response will consist of digital rectal exam with smooth or minor mucosal abnormalities, and sigmoidoscopy/proctoscopy with small mucosal abnormalities, or superficial ulceration or erythematous scarring.
Partial response, in our study, will be those tumors read with RECIST version 1.1 criteria with a ≥20% decrease in size without obtaining near or complete response.
Stable disease, in our study, will be those tumors read with RECIST criteria with a &lt;20% decrease in size without obtaining near or complete response.
Progressive disease will be those tumors with &gt;20% increase in size by RECIST version 1.1 criteria on imaging.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Participants must be &gt;18 years old at time of diagnosis

          2. Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the rectum from biopsy, defined as
             adenocarcinoma &lt;15 cm from the anal verge

          3. Clinical staging including T3N0 tumors, or T1-3 with N1-2a disease

          4. Patients with lower rectal cancer deemed by surgery to not be candidates for sphincter
             sparing surgery are eligible to participate

          5. There must be no evidence of metastatic disease any time prior to initiation of study

          6. Rectal tumors must be determined as likely requiring total mesorectal excision (TME)
