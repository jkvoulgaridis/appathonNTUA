  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is a heritable skin disease characterized by marked fragility of
      epithelialized tissue with blistering in skin and mucous membranes following the slightest
      mechanical trauma. Eighty percent of all patients suffering from recessive dystrophic EB
      (RDEB), a subtype originating from mutations in the COL7A1 gene, develop squamous cell
      carcinoma (SCC). In RDEB patients SCC presents early (most patients are in their 20s or 30s)
      and shows a highly aggressive metastatic course which often leads to premature death at this
      young age.

      In light of scarce data on the efficacy and safety of systemic treatment regimens for
      advanced SCC, the investigators propose to perform a small, &quot;first in EB &quot; trial of an
      experimental drug called rigosertib for the treatment of EB cancer. The trial will be
      conducted in two study centres, in London and Salzburg, and will last approximately 2.5 years
      with each patient recruited being in the study for 1 year. The drug is a polo-like kinase
      inhibitor interfering with different molecular pathways that are essential for cancer cell
      growth. Rigosertib was developed by Onconova Therapeutics and is currently tested in several
      clinical trials for a number of other cancers including myelodysplastic syndrome (a cancer of
      the blood). The investigators have identified that rigosertib most selectively kills EB
      cancer cells in vitro while leaving normal EB skin cells unaffected. This project will
      evaluate whether rigosertib is capable of inducing an anti-cancer response in EB patients and
      whether the drug is well-tolerated. Mechanisms of molecular targeting of squamous cancer
      cells by rigosertib will further be investigated in EB patients, also aiming at the
      identification of biomarkers that may allow the predictive identification of best responders.

    <description>Patients will take Rigosertib either as oral capsules or oral liquid solution or will get intravenous infusions depending on the needs of the patients.
Oral Capsules/ Liquid Solution:
Patients will take oral Rigosertib continuously for a total of three weeks, every four week cycle (three weeks on, one week off drug) for up to 13 cycles. Patients will take 560 mg of oral Rigosertib (ie, 2 capsules of 280 mg or 7,47mL of the concentrate in 30mL water) in the morning and 280 mg of oral Rigosertib (ie, 1 capsule of 280 mg or 3,73mL of the concentrate in 30mL water) in the afternoon, total of 840mg/day.
Intravenous Infusions:
For IV treatment Rigosertib 1800 mg/24 hr is diluted in 0.9% sodium chloride for injection just prior to dosing and is administered as a 72-hr CIV infusion on days 1, 2, and 3 of a 2-week cycle for the first eight 2-week cycles, then on days 1, 2, and 3 of a 4-week cycle thereafter.</description>
