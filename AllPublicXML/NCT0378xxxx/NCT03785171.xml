  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Moyamoya disease (MMD) is a nonatherosclerotic cerebrovascular abnormality, characterized by
      a progressive stenosis or occlusion of the intracranial internal carotid arteries (ICAs) and
      their proximal branches, with subsequent formation of collateral vessels (&quot;puff of smoke&quot;).
      In some cases, the posterior circulation can also be involved. MMD has been discovered around
      the world, but Asians carry the most possibility to develop this disease. Current treatment
      designed to prevent strokes by improving blood flow to the affected cerebral hemisphere
      including medical therapy and surgery. In particular, surgery included two general methods:
      direct and indirect revascularization. Compared with direct bypass, indirect procedures are
      more technically accessible and may reduce the possibility of complications, such as
      hyperperfusion. In addition, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with derived parameters have
      shown great potential in evaluating perfusion in patients, and could possibly predict
      surgical outcome. However, there is still lack of evidence of the predictive value of MRI in
      evaluating clinical and angiography improvement in patients with MMD.

        2. ASL shows CBF in associated regions;

        3. Stoke area measured by DWI and Flair;

        4. PH values reflected by APT-CEST.

      Treatment:

      Surgery-indirect revascularization

      Follow-up:

      Baseline (MRI+DSA); 3-months follow-up (MRI); 6-months follow-up (MRI+DSA)
