  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Critically ill patients with spontaneously prolonged pro-thrombin time, where administration
      of intravenous administration of phytomenadione (vitamin K) has been ordered by the treating
      physician will be identified. After signed informed consent baseline samples will be
      collected. Phytomenadione will be given and 24 hours after administration new blood samples
      will be collected. Several different advanced coagulation and vitamin K-assays will be
      performed before and 24 hours after vitamin K administration.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vitamin K-deficiency is common in the peri-operative and intensive care setting. It is often
      seen in patients with prolonged prothrombin complex (PK-INR). A prolonged (PK-INR) is
      sometimes treated with intravenous vitamin K, even in non-warfarin treated or non-liver
      failure patients. Despite the development of this practice the knowledge about how
      intravenously given vitamin K affects routine coagulation status and other advanced
      laboratory coagulations assays is rare.

      The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of intravenously administered vitamin K
      on routine coagulation status and on advanced coagulation and vitamin K-assays in
      post-operative- and critically ill patients with prolonged PK-INR.

      Patients with spontaneously prolonged PK-INR are routinely given intravenous vitamin K but it
      is largely unknown how this procedure affects the included coagulation assays. This research
      project may contribute to increased knowledge concerning effects of intravenously given
      vitamin K in critical ill patients with spontaneous coagulopathies. Since spontaneous
      coagulopathy is frequently occurring in critically ill and postoperative patients due to
      various underlying conditions and current evidence for vitamin K administration is based on
      scarce evidence more research in this area is motivated.
