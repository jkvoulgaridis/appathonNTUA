  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cervical cancer is the most common cause of cancer and a leading cause of death among
      HIV-infected women living in resource-limited settings. Although screening for premalignant
      lesions is an effective way of reducing cervical cancer incidence, its uptake in low-resource
      settings to date is low. The use of HPV testing for primary screening is currently
      recommended by many guidelines - including the WHO guidelines for cervical cancer screening
      in resource-limited settings - because of its greater sensitivity and ease of use compared to
      other options. However, these WHO guidelines have both highlighted the need to conduct more
      research on appropriate HPV-based algorithms among HIV-infected women, as immunodeficiency
      may affect the screening performance. Indeed, HPV infections in HIV-infected women are very
      common, so there is a need for additional triage to identify women most at risk and there
      remains considerable uncertainty on the optimal option for such triage. Most of the evidence
      available comes from HIV-negative populations living in high-resource settings and is not
      necessarily relevant for low-resource contexts where the epidemiological background is
      different, women access late to screening and may not have follow up visits, where financial
      constraints are important and health service resources limited.

      Hence, the proposed project aims to provide evidence on the effectiveness and feasibility of
      HPV-based screening algorithms among HIV-infected women in low-resource settings.

      This multicenter cross-sectional study will include 3,000 HIV-infected women (30-59 years
      old) receiving HAART and followed in Mfou (Cameroun), Abidjan (Ivory Coast), Bobo-Dioulasso
      (Burkina Faso) and Phnom Penh (Cambodia).

      After self-collection of cervico-vaginal samples, each participant will have an HPV test with
      partial genotyping primary using the Xpert HPV assay, a real-time PCR assay that provides the
      possibility of identifying 14 HR-HPV types within one hour. The Xpert HPV test has been
      chosen because of the wide availability of the Genexpert platform in HIV care centers from
      resource-limited settings. Furthermore, it can specifically detect HPV-16, 18 and 45, the
      most carcinogenic HPV types in both HIV-negative and HIV-positive women, separately from
      other high-risk HPV types. VIA will be another triage option either alone or combined to HPV
      DNA genotyping.
