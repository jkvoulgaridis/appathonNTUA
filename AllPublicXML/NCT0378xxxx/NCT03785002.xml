  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A strength training session promotes increased muscle sensitivity to protein synthesis, which
      lasts for 24 hours after its closure. Recent studies have shown that the subsequent intake to
      the training session of approximately 20g or 0.24g / kg of high-quality protein in the same
      meal induces a plateau in this synthesis. Thus, this study aims to compare the muscular
      strength between vegetarian and omnivorous athletes with adequate protein intake to reach
      this plateau. It will recruit 64 university sportsmen who have maintained vegetarian or
      omnivorous diet for at least 6 months, totalizing 32 individuals per group. After signing the
      Term of Consent, participants will be submitted to anthropometric and body composition
      assessment (via DEXA), neuromuscular tests [(ie, muscle strength - 1RM, peak torque of knee
      extensors (JE), muscle thickness of JE and cohort analysis (ANCOVA) will be used in order to
      compare the results of the study, and to compare the results of the covariance analysis
      (ANCOVA). the levels of the neuromuscular parameters between the groups, considering the
      initial values of the force and the initial muscular thickness as covariables, the other
      parameters will be presented in the form of mean and standard deviation or median, the
      differences will be considered significant for values of p &lt;0, 05. Expected to find no
      differences in strength and muscle thickness between vegetarians and omnivores after adequate
      protein intake.
