    <intervention_model_description>Single center, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, SAD study of three escalating doses of PTI-125. A total of 24 healthy subjects enrolled in one of three dose cohorts. Each cohort will contain 8 subjects; six receive PTI-125 and two receive placebo. Three SAD does of PTI-125 oral solution (50, 100 or 200 mg) or placebo solution will be administered.</intervention_model_description>

             cotinine, or urine drug screen at screening or at check-in. The subject has a positive
             serum hepatitis B surface antigen or positive HCV antibody test at the Screening
             Visit.

          -  The subject has a positive HIV test at the Screening Visit.

          -  Female subject is pregnant or breastfeeding.

          -  The subject has received an investigational drug within 30 days of Check-in.

          -  The subject has donated or lost a significant volume of blood (&gt;450 mL) within 4 weeks
             prior to the study.

          -  The subject is unwilling to reside in the study unit for the duration of the study or
             to cooperate fully with the investigator or site personnel.
