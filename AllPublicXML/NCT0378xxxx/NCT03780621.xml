  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two arm cross-over study to determine whether
      a specific combination of Andrographis paniculata and Withania somnifera can be regarded as a
      safe and effective treatment for cognitive deficits.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with acute or chronic diseases that are relevant to the study and asked for
             by the study staff are excluded.

          -  Acute or chronic disease with an impact on the study, which becomes obvious by case
             history or clinical examination.

          -  Clinically relevant allergic symptoms.

          -  Detection of alcohol at the time of initial examination (day SC) or on study day A

          -  Consumption of clinically relevant medication during last 14 days before and during
             the active study period based on the notification of the subject or his case history.

          -  Consumption of medication with primarily central action (i.e. psychotropic drugs or
             centrally acting antihypertensive drugs). Known intolerance / hypersensitivity
             (allergy) to plant derived extracts or any of the ingredients of the investigational
             product (anamnestic).
