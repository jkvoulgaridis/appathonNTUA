  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the metabolic benefits of bitter melon seed oil (BMSO), overweight or obese
      healthy Taiwanese adults (n=60) were randomly assigned to receive capsules containing either
      olive oil (OO; placebo) or BMSO at 4.5 g/d dose for 12 week. Across intervention period, body
      weight, BMI, waist-to-hip ratio, and body fat mass were measured. Blood were collected before
      and after intervention for measurements of blood lipid and inflammatory cytokines. The
      anti-obesity effect of BMSO was further assessed by stratification of participants according
      to UCP1 rs1800592 polymorphism.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bitter melon is a common Asian vegetable. Its seed is not edible and discarded as a waste
      product. However, the seed oil is enriched in cis9, trans11, trans13-conjugated linolenic
      acid or alpha-eleostearic acid (alpha-ESA). Investigators previously demonstrated the
      anti-obesity functions of bitter melon seed oil (BMSO) in animal trials. Herein, a RCT was
      conducted to test the potential of BMSO in developing as a functional culinary oil for weight
      control.

      Considering UCP-1 played a pivotal role in anti-adiposity function of BMSO as demonstrated in
      animal studies, the anti-obesity effect of BMSO was further assessed according to UCP1
      rs1800592 polymorphism.

      Healthy Taiwanese adults with overweight or obesity were recruited by advertisement and were
      assessed by a family medicine physician for eligibility. All participants signed the consent
      form. Blocked randomization was used to randomly assign participants into one of two groups
      to receive indicated supplement (BMSO or OO capsules with identical appearance; 4.5 g oil/d)
      for 12 week. Subjects were requested to maintain their usual diet and physical activity
      during the study period (0-12 week).

      Anthropometric measurements were done on week 0, 4, 8 and 12. Three-day food records,
      collection of blood samples and physical health check were conducted on week 0, 4 and 12.
      Indirect calorimetry was done on week 0 and 12. Questionnaires about self-reported side
      effects, such as trouble sleeping, constipation, diarrhea, increased heartbeat, palpitations,
      headache, anxiety, or dizziness, were collected in each visit. Group allocation was
      concealed.

    <description>BMSO was extracted from Hualien No. 4 cultivate of bitter melon seed. BMSO were incorporated into capsules containing 0.5 g of oil. All persons took 3 capsules after each meal, i.e. 9 capsules (4.5 g of oil) daily, resulting in daily consumption of 2.3 g alpha-ESA in the BMSO group.</description>
