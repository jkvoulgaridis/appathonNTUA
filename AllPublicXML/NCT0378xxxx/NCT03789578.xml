  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will look at how insulin 287 and semaglutide work in the body, both when given
      alone or together. This study will look at the way insulin 287 and semaglutide reach and stay
      in participants' blood after injection when given alone or together. Participants will get 3
      study medicines at 3 different time points: 1) a combination of semaglutide plus insulin 287,
      2) insulin 287 alone and 3) semaglutide alone. The order in which participants get them is
      decided by chance. Participants will get all medicines as an injection under the skin in the
      thigh. The injections will be done by study staff. The time between injections is 6 to 9
      weeks. The study will last for about 19 to 32 weeks in total.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a three-period cross-over trial. The treatments to be used are: Treatment A: insulin 287, Treatment B: semaglutide, and Treatment C: NNC0148-0287sema. The subjects will be randomised to one of the six treatment sequences in the trial: 1) ABC, 2) ACB, 3) BAC, 4) BCA, 5) CAB, and 6) CBA. The trial includes a screening visit followed by three 5 -week periods with pharmacokinetic sampling after single dose administration. The dose periods are separated by a 1-4 week washout period (from last pharmacokinetic sampling to next dosing). The follow-up period is 1−4 weeks after last pharmacokinetic sampling in period 3 (i.e. 6 to 9 weeks after last trial product administration). The total trial duration for the individual subjects participating in the trial will be 19 to 32 weeks (including follow-up), depending on individual visit schedules.</intervention_model_description>
