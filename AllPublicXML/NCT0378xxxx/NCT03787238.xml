      A randomized study for the prevention and acute treatment of migraine using open label nVNS
      and standard of care versus standard of care.

      Eligible subjects will participate in a 4 week run-in period after which they will be
      randomized (1:1) to either nVNS and standard of care (nVNS group) or standard of care (SOC
      group) for 12 weeks. The nVNS group will use the nVNS device preventatively and acutely for
      the treatment of migraine. The SOC group will continue to use their regular standard of care
      migraine treatment medications for the duration of the 12 week randomized period.

          -  Experience at least 6 and no more than 24 headache days per month and a minimum of 4
             migraine attacks per month (over the last 3 months).

          -  Has age of onset of migraine less than 50 years old.

          -  Stable regime for any migraine preventative medications for the last 3 months and
