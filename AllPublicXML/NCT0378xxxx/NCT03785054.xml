  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is the first time HTL0014242 will be administered to humans. The principal aim of this
      study is to obtain safety and tolerability data when HTL0014242 is administered orally as
      single doses to healthy subjects. This information, together with the pharmacokinetics data,
      will help establish the doses and dosing regimen suitable for future studies in patients
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will comprise a single dose, sequential group design. Overall, up to 72 subjects
      will be studied in up to 9 planned groups (Groups 1 to 9), with each group consisting of 8
      subjects. In addition, a further 6 subjects will participate in a crossover food effect arm.

      Subjects will be screened within 28 days prior to dosing. Each subject will participate in 1
      treatment period only, except the food effect arm where subjects will be dosed both fed and
      fasted. Subjects will reside at the clinical research unit from Day -1 (the day before
      dosing) to Day 5.

      All subjects will return for a follow-up visit 7 to 14 days after dosing. The investigator
      (or designee) may also request that the subject return for an additional follow up visit.

      In each of groups 1 to 9, 6 subjects will receive a single dose of HTL0014242 and 2 subjects
      will receive placebo oral capsule in accordance with a randomisation schedule. In the food
      effect arm, 6 subjects will receive a single dose of HTL0014242 in both the fed and fasted
      state, separated by 14 days.
