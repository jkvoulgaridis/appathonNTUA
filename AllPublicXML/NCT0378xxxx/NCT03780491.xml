  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that many cancer patients desire discussions of cost as part of their care,
      but that preferences for having cost discussions with their physicians vary. Further, we
      hypothesize that providers can introduce the topic of cost into clinical conversations in a
      balanced way and that this will improve shared decision making and patient uptake of offers
      of financial counseling which will lead to improved financial well-being, patient
      satisfaction with providers, and satisfaction with treatment decisions.

      Aim 1: Further understand patient preferences and attendant associations for cost discussions
      through a patient survey of newly diagnosed breast cancer patients.

      Aim 2: Study the influence of provider communication about cost on shared decision making,
      uptake of financial counseling, financial well-being and satisfaction through an intervention
      to encourage discussion of cost by breast cancer surgeons with subsequent referral to
      financial counseling.

  <detailed_description>

      Newly diagnosed breast cancer patients over the age of 18 will be eligible for participation.
      All stages of disease will be included. Eligible participants will be approached in clinic.
      Those interested will provide written, informed consent at the time of their clinic visit.
      All participants will be asked to complete baseline surveys consisting of the InCharge
      Financial Distress/Financial Well Being scale (IFDFW),[24] the Maximizer-Minimizer Scale,[25]
      and a three question, 5-point Likert scale survey about desire for cost information (1: How
      concerned are you about the cost of your cancer care? 2: How interested are you in discussing
      cost of care with your doctors? 3: How interested are you in meeting with a financial
      counselor about the costs of your care?) Demographic information including age, race and
      ethnicity, marital status, number of children, current employment status of self and spouse,
      and education level will be included. To decrease participant burden and encourage study
      participation, only the three question survey will be required to be completed prior to the
      visit. The other survey components (IFDFW and Max-Min Scale) can be completed after the
      visit, but prior to seeing a financial counselor. Participants will be offered a $10 giftcard
      of their choice (grocery store, Starbucks, Amazon, or gas) at each survey timepoint ($20
      total) for participation.

      For this study, we will use a pre and post design with 100 total participants. All visits
      will be audiorecorded, transcribed, and coded for whether cost was discussed in the control
      group and whether the intervention was successfully implemented in the intervention group as
      well as shared decision making using the observer-OPTION scale. The first 50 patients will
      have usual care with providers conducting the visit in their typical manner.

      From our past studies, study team discusses cost in 15% of visits, though these discussion
      tend to be very superficial. The second group of 50 patients will be the intervention group
      where the providers will have a discussion of cost emphasizing five points: 1) Cancer care is
      expensive and it is normal to be concerned about cost. 2) We will recommend treatments for
      your cancer based on what we think gives you the best chance of doing well, not based on the
      cost of the treatment. 3) Because of how complex our healthcare system is, it is very hard
      for your doctors to know what your costs will be, but we will do our best to give you some
      general information. 4) We have resources available to help you get more specific information
      so that you can plan appropriately. 5) Do you have any specific concerns about cost that
      you'd like to share with me? We will encourage study team to have this discussion at the
      beginning of the consult, but the exact timing will be according to study team judgment.

      After the visit, all patients will complete a patient satisfaction survey and will be offered
      a referral to a financial counselor at our institution. Financial counseling will take place
      per our usual institutional protocols either in person or over the phone. Our financial
      counselors are aware that they may see an increased volume of patients during the study
      period and we will provide funding to cover the increased need. Volume will be tracked during
      the study period and compared to the non-study period and between the groups.

      At the first three to six-month follow-up visit with the surgeon, participants will again
      complete the IFDFW, a validated patient satisfaction scale[26], and the Satisfaction with
      Decision Scale.[27].

      Data will have personal health identifiers removed from the data for the analysis portion of
      the study. PHI will not be reused without first seeking IRB approval.

      We will enroll 100 patients in two consecutive groups of 50. This gives us 80% power with a
      two sided significance level of 0.05 for seeing a 27-30% improvement (0.27-0.3 higher score)
      in our primary outcome of financial well-being as measured by the IFDFW in the intervention
      group at 3-6 months after the initial visit; the average pre-score on the IFDFW is 5.52 in
      past studies with improvements of 0.32-1.18 seen in past studies of education interventions
      to improve financial well-being.[24] This level of difference may not be achievable with this
      small study, but will provide data for powering a larger study.

      Maximizer-Minimizer status, uptake of financial counseling, patient satisfaction, decision
      satisfaction, and demographic variables will be evaluated for associations with financial
      well-being using logistic regression methods.
