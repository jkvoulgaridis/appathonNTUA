    <textblock>
      Totally 60 subjects will be included in the study. The present study was aimed to observe and
      evaluate the effect of Xinmailong injection on reducing cardiovascular toxicity associated
      with adjuvant chemotherapy after breast cancer surgery. The primary endpoint was 6 months of
      cardiac safety. Secondary endpoints included 3 months of cardiac safety, adverse events (AE),
      severe adverse events (SAE), and DFS.

      After signing the informed consent, the patients in the control group will receive Epirubicin
      45mg/m2 d1, 2 + cyclophosphamide 600mg/ m2 d1, repeated every 14 or 21 days for 4 cycles,
      followed by paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 (or docetaxel 75 mg/m2) on day 1, repeated every 21 days for
      4 cycles. Patients in the Xinmailong group were given 5 mg/kg of Xinmailong injection every
      cycle on d0, d1, d2, d3, d4 on the same chemotherapy regimen as those in the control group.
      The patients-general condition, vital signs, blood routine, liver and kidney function,
      electrocardiogram, myocardial enzymes, troponin, BNP and echocardiography should be examined
      every week. Breast ultrasound were performed every week. Chest CT were evaluated after 8
      cycles of chemotherapy.

      After adjuvant chemotherapy, adjuvant radiotherapy and endocrine therapy were given according
      to the situation, and long-term survival was observed.

      The patients will be followed up for 5 years, once every 6 months with in 1-3 years, once
      every 12 months within 4-5 years.
