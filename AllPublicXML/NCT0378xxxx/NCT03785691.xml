  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim is to investigate the efficacy of mirtazapine and ondansetron as treatment for
      hyperemesis gravidarum(HG).

      The setup is a double-blind multicenter trial where patients suffering from HG will be
      randomized to treatment with either mirtazapine, ondansetron or placebo (1:1:1).
