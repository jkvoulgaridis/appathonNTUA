  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective study conducted on women with a suspected/confirmed diagnosis of
      placental abruption. Maternal blood samples will be taken at various points during the
      peripartum period. A healthy group of women admitted for delivery will act as a matched
      control and will have their blood sampled at similar time points. The primary outcome
      variables will include the total number of micro-particles, the number of micro-particles
      from each cell line (platelet, placental, endothelial etc.), and protein markers
      (specifically; placental growth factor (PlGF), soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFLT-1),
      vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), soluble endoglin (sEng)). Secondary outcomes if
      will examine the correlation between placental micro-particles, biomarkers, and extent of
      placental abruption.

      The purpose of this study is to determine how well maternal serum biomarkers and placental
      micro-particles (MP) correlate with PA. The sensitivity and specificity of these proteins
      will be analyzed to further increase our understanding of the pathological mechanisms
      involved in PA. The knowledge gained from this study has the potential to develop a
      diagnostic test for PA with the ability to improve outcomes for mother and baby through
      earlier diagnosis and targeted therapy.
