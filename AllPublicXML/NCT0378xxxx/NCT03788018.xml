    <textblock>
      BACKGROUND: Few researches have manifested that intravenous (IV) lidocaine or dexmedetomidine
      decreased the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). The investigators
      investigated whether IV lidocaine plus dexmedetomidine infusion could better reduce the
      incidence of PONV after laparoscopic hysterectomy.

      METHODS: One hundred and twenty women with elective laparoscopic hysterectomy were randomly
      divided into two groups: patients in the lidocaine combined with dexmedetomidine group (LD
      group, n=60) received lidocaine (1.5 mg/kg loading, 1.5 mg/kg/h infusion) and dexmedetomidine
      (0.5 μg/kg loading, 0.4 μg/kg/h infusion) respectively. Patients in the control group (CON
      group, n=60) received the equal volume of saline. Primary outcome was the incidence of the
      first 48 h nausea, vomiting and PONV after surgery. The secondary outcomes included
      perioperative propofol and remifentanil consumption, postoperative fentanyl requirement,
      Ramsay sedation score, and bradycardia during post-anaesthesia care unit (PACU) stay.
