      Study CC-95251-ST-001 is an open-label, Phase 1, dose escalation (Part A) and expansion (Part
      B &amp; Part C), first-in-human clinical study of CC-95251 in subjects with advanced solid &amp;
      hematologic cancers. The dose escalation part (Part A) of the study will be conducted in
      three stages. Stage 1 will evaluate the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of
      CC-95251, administered IV, to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), non-tolerated dose
      (NTD), and/or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of CC-95251. Stage 2 will evaluate the safety
      and tolerability of escalating doses of CC-95251 in combination with weekly cetuximab, both
      administered IV, to determine the MTD, NTD, and/or RP2D of CC-95251 plus cetuximab. Stage 3
      will evaluate the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of CC-95251 in combination with
      rituximab, both administered IV, to establish MTD, NTD, and/or RP2D of CC-95251 plus
      rituximab.
