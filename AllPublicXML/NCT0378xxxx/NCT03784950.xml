    <textblock>
      Using behavioral economics, the study objective is to increase the efficiency, quality, and
      timeliness of care for Los Angeles County (LAC) Department of Health Services (DHS) patients
      by nudging specialists toward more effective use of eConsult, a web-based consultation and
      communication portal for Primary Care Providers (PCPs) and specialists, improving access for
      patients in greatest need of specialty care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Historically, the Los Angeles County (LAC) Department of Health Services (DHS) Safety Net
      system has faced challenges in delivering specialty services that are timely, geographically
      equitable, and coordinated in a patient centered manner. Recently, LACDHS improved
      infrastructure through implementation of eConsult, a web-based consultation and communication
      portal for Primary Care Providers (PCPs) and specialists, improving access for patients in
      greatest need of specialty care. The study investigators will conduct a pragmatic randomized
      trial with the goal of increasing the efficiency, quality, and timeliness of care for LACDHS
      patients by nudging specialists toward more effective use of eConsult. If successful, these
      nudges may reduce the number and increase the value of face-to-face consults.

    <description>eConsult Specialty Reviewers receive confidential feedback via email on their performance (top performer vs not a top performer) as compared to colleagues in their specialty. Feedback is based on other reviewers ratings of their eConsult exchanges on the following four dimensions: 1) efforts to elicit additional information from PCPs, when needed; 2) medical decision making; 3) inclusion of educational content for PCPs, when appropriate; 4) perceived effect on the PCP-specialist relationship (i.e., overall tone of the eConsult exchange)</description>
