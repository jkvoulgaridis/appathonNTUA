      In the present study a program of respiratory physical therapy based on diaphragmatic
      breathing is applied in institutionalized old people, evaluating lung function parameters
      (FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC) and oxygen saturation.

      The hypothesis is that a diaphragmatic breathing program applied in elderly people can
      improve the respiratory system's function and consequently improve their daily life. This
      program will include learning and performing a diaphragmatic-abdominal breathing, and
      incorporating the new breathing pattern to a upper and lower limbs maintenance exercises as
      well as to daily life activities.

      Methods: randomized and controlled clinical study of respiratory parameters of
      institutionalized old people. The subjects will be divided into 2 groups: 1) diaphragmatic
      breathing program and upper and lower limbs maintenance exercises 2) control group which do
      upper and lower limbs maintenance exercises. There will be 3 treatment sessions during 8
      weeks, with evaluations before the study and after 8 weeks, which include: lung function
      parameters (forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in one second, Tiffeneau Index)
      and pulseoximeter (which includes oxygen saturation and cardiac frequency).

      Introduction.The aging of the respiratory system includes physiological changes of the lung
      as well as the osteoarticular and muscular tissues. Therefore, the European and North
      American Respiratory Societies highlight in their recommendations the importance of
      prevention of respiratory diseases. They also insist on the need to maintain the integrity of
      the anatomical elements that participate in the thoraco-abdominal movements and on preventive
      treatments in those at risk before the symptoms appear.

      Objective. The main objective of this study is to apply a program of supervised breathing
      program in old people with no respiratory health issues and evaluate the effects on
      respiratory variables such as forced vital capacity (FVC) forced expiratory volume in one
      second (FEV1) Tiffeneau Index (FEV1/FVC) and oxygen satutarion (SO2).

      Material and Methods Sample: over 60 year old subjects, institutionalized and with no
      respiratory condition.

      Study design. Randomized clinical trial with 2 groups: Group 1. diaphragmatic breathing
      program and upper and lower limbs maintenance exercises ; Group 2. control group which only
      do upper and lower limbs maintenance exercises.

      Evaluations. Clinical interview with anthropometric data and health characteristics.

      There will be 2 evaluations: at the beginning of the study and at the end of the supervised
      program (at 8 weeks).

      In addition, it includes the following evaluation instruments:

        -  Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE)

        -  Spirometry: obtaining FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC.

        -  Pulse oxymetry: it measure the SaO2 and cardiac frequency.

    <description>Assessed using a COSMED PONY FX spirometer with mouthpiece and filters (1 cardboard mouthpiece and a bacteriological filter per patient). The test was performed with the person sitting, without crossing the legs and shoulders relaxed. Anthropometric data were entered into the equipment, nose was covered with a nose clio and the patient was then asked to perform three forced inhalations and exhalations.</description>

    <description>To assess oxygen saturation, a SmartOx pulse oximeter (WEINMANN Medical Technology) is used. The subject remains seated, the pulse oximeter clamp placed on a finger of one of the hands, waiting for the SaO2 and CF value to stabilize and register the value.</description>

    <description>Mini-Cognitive Lobo est (MEC). To assess the cognitive status before inclusion in the study, the spanish version of Folstein's Minimental State Examination is used. Adapted and validated by Lobo in Spain in 1979. It is a brief cognitive test that consists of the evaluation of the most important cognitive areas (orientation, concentration, calculation, memory, language and construction) with a global maximum score of 35 (30-35 = normal, 24-29 = borderline, &lt;24 in people over 65). The MEC has widely shown its reliability, validity and discriminative power, with a specificity of 75.1% and a sensitivity of 89.8%.</description>
