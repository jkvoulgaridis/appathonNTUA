  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to investigate the treatment response of lymphedema, of the upper or
      lower extremity, during clinical, pharmacologic treatment of lymphedema with oral ketoprofen.
      Correlation of clinical responses (changes in limb volume and skin thickness) with changes in
      the inflammasome will help to define the molecular substrate of treatment response.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients presenting to the Investigator's Clinic for evaluation and treatment of (upper or
      lower extremity) lymphedema, will be assessed for their suitability (of low risk) for medical
      treatment with ketoprofen. If there are no contra-indications to taking ketoprofen, after
      discussion of FDA warnings, including provision of a written copy of the FDA language to the
      patient, and with the recommendation to discuss with the primary physician-of-record,
      patients will be provided with a prescription for ketoprofen 200 mg daily (one capsule taken
      orally, once daily) or if obtained from a compound pharmacy, ketoprofen 210 mg daily (one
      capsule taken orally, once daily).

      Participation in this study will be offered. Two study visits, at baseline and month 6 are
      required. Measurements (circumferential and skin thickness) and a blood sample will be taken
      at each study visit.

      The investigators will try to determine how ketoprofen affects the body tissue by obtaining
      blood samples and measurements, before starting treatment and at month 6.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Systemic Inflammatory Mediator Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Factor (G-CSF)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and month 6.</time_frame>
    <description>The systemic inflammatory response of G-CSF, in patients treated with Ketoprofen will be assessed with Luminex-bead inflammasome analysis at baseline and 6 months post-treatment plasma samples. G-CSF, a glycoprotein, is an inflammatory cytokine produced by endothelium and immune cells. Ketoprofen is a unique NSAID possessing dual pathways of inflammatory inhibition, blocking cyclooxygenase (COX) and arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO). Measurement using median fluorescence intensity (MFI) will be employed.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Measurement of Skin Thickness</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and month 6.</time_frame>
    <description>Caliper-measured skin thickness (mm) of upper or lower extremities, at 3 points, will be performed and recorded. Quantitative assessment of skin thickness (mm) of the affected limb at month 6 will be compared to baseline value.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Limb Volume</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and month 6.</time_frame>
    <description>Upper or lower limbs will be marked and measured at 4 cm intervals and circumferential measurements, with tape, will be performed and recorded.
Quantitative assessment of limb volume (ml) of the affected limb at month 6 will be compared to baseline value.</description>

        Patients presenting to the Investigator's Stanford Center for Lymphatic and Venous
        Disorders, for evaluation and treatment of their condition, lymphedema, will be assessed
        for their suitability for medical treatment with ketoprofen. The use of ketoprofen in these
        patients is predicated upon clinical presentation and evidence-based practice, not any
        investigational consideration of therapy.

        If there are no contra-indications to taking ketoprofen, after discussion of FDA black box
        warnings, including provision of a written copy of the Medication Guide for Non-Steroidal
        Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs), approved by FDA, will be provided to the patient, and
        with the recommendation to discuss with the primary physician-of-record, patients will be
        provided with a prescription for ketoprofen. The opportunity to participate in this
        observational study will be presented.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants with a history of acquired lymphedema

          -  Stage 1, 2, or 3

          -  18-75 years

          -  Clinical use of ketoprofen for lymphedema

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Active cancer, infection, bleeding tendency, inflammatory disease and/or taking
             anti-inflammatory or anti-leukotriene medication will be excluded.

          -  Pregnant or lactating females

          -  Inability to take ketoprofen (contra-indicated, e.g patients with known CV, GI, renal,
             hepatic disease).

          -  Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation, may
             interfere with interpretation of study results, and in the judgement of the
             investigator, would make the participation inappropriate for entry into this study.
