  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study of implantation potential of the embryo stay a priority in In Vitro Fertilization
      (IVF). Indeed, the selection of embryos to transfer is actually based in routine check on
      morphologic criteria, approved by literature but not perfect. Implantation's markers
      identification, allowing to choose the embryo(s) to transfer and then decrease pregnancy
      failure, represent a major issue in IVF, not any biomarker being approved yet.

      Among factors regulating embryonic implantation, investigators have recently proposed soluble
      CD146, coming from proteolytic cleavage of the CD146 membrane, angiogenic bond molecule.

      In a monocentric study about 222 transferred embryos at the end of IVF try, investigators
      showed that the sCD146 dose in the embryonic culture environment reflected the implantation
      ability of embryo, a high rate showing a low implantation potential and this independently of
      the embryonic quality. A multicentric prospective study is now required to confirm the
      utility of this dosage in clinical practice.

      Primary objective : Compared 2 frozen embryo transfer (FET) strategies in terms of
      implantation efficiency, according to choice method of embryo to be transferred :

        -  Group A : Standard strategy : Depending on embryonic quality according to criteria
           currently selected.

        -  Group B : Experimental strategy : Association of embryonic quality according to criteria
           currently selected and of sCD146 rate.

      Expected Results :

        -  Demonstrate a beginning pregnancy test significantly superior in Group B compared to
           Group A.

        -  Confirmed that sCD146 is an independent biomarker of morphologic embryonic quality
           (actual selection criteria) and represent a complementary criteria to choose embryos to
           transfer.

      Methodology :

      - Multicentric prospective study with 2 groups of Frozen Embryo Transfer (FET); The
      calculation of the number of staff required includes 151 couples per group.

      For this will be include for 24 months, couples benefiting of freezing at least one of the
      two embryos and transfer of only one FET.

        -  Test the same day of environment freezing where frozen embryos were cultivated. sCD146
           dosage by ELISA technic (Enzyme Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay) in thus culture environment
           before FET.

        -  Implantation potential analyze of each transfer embryo (FET) according to sCD146 rate.

        -  Following of the FET future(pregnancy, childbirth) : maximum 9 months after attempt to
           each included couple.
