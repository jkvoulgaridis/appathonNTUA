      The study will be two parallel group, triple blinded randomized controlled clinical trial
      that based on CONSORT (consolidated standards of reporting trials) guideline .The selected
      participants according to inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomly allocated in two
      groups using (Research Randomizer Program) .

      Blinding All participants don't know the type of received restorative material (ACTIVA Kids
      or High -viscosity GI restorative material) and the outcome will be evaluated by a examiner
      other than operator who doesn't know the type of received restorative material also.

      Study setting The study will be performed at pediatric Department and Dental Public Health
      Department of Faculty of Dentistry, Ain Shams University, and at the institute of Graduate
      Studies and Research, Ain Shams University.

      Sample size: 60 participants Recruitment/Setting The all participants of this study have been
      selected after complete clinical examination has been done with full medical and dental
      history , history of medications and history of hospitalization. In patients who receive
      dental treatment as an usual care in clinics of Pediatric Dentistry and Dental Public Health
      Department at faculty of dentistry, Ain-Shams University.

      Informed consent designed to include all data about dental procedures in this study and clear
      more details about time consuming in the procedure and follow up visits, used materials and
      adverse event of this procedure . All participants have the wright to withdraw from this
      study at any time .The consent will be assigned from each patient by the patient's parents or
      guardians after explanation of the study.

      The full mouth rehabilitation will be performed by postgraduate student registered at the
      master Degree at the Pediatric Dentistry and Dental Public Health Department Faculty of
      Dentistry, Ain- Shams University All subjects receive instructions on oral health,
      particularly in relation to oral hygiene and sugar consumption

0 Present, good
1 Present, slight marginal defect for whatever reason, at any one place which is less than 0.5 mm in depth.
No repair is needed.
2 Present, marginal defect for whatever reason, at any one place which is deeper than 0.5 mm but less than 1.0 mm.
Repair is needed.
3 Present, gross defect of more than 1.0 mm in depth. Repair is needed.
4 Not present, restoration has (almost) completely disappeared. Treatment is needed.
5 Not present, other restorative treatment has been performed.
6 Not present, tooth has been extracted.
7 Present wear and tear gradually over larger parts of the restoration but is less than 0.5 mm at the deepest point.
No repair is needed.
8 Present, wear and tear gradually over larger parts of the restoration which is deeper than 0.5 mm Repair is needed.
