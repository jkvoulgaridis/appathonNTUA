  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized crossover trial will be conducted in 90 primary school children in 3 classrooms
      in Shanghai, China. The effects of fresh air ventilation/filtration system, fresh air
      ventilation system with no filtration and natual ventilation will be compared on the effects
      of reducing indoor PM2.5 and chilhood health. Biological samples of children are going to be
      collected to investigate the associations between indoor air pollution and biomarkes of
      certain health effects.

      A randomized crossover trial among 90 primary students in 3 classrooms in Shanghai, China
      will be performed. Three arms are going to be 1) fresh air filtration system, 2) fresh air
      system with no filtration and 3) natural ventilation. Each arm is going to be in use for five
      continuous weekdays followed by one week of wash-out. After one-week of wash out, a cross
      over change between 3 arms is going to be taked. Then the 2nd week of intervention is
      performed followed by the 2nd wash-out week. The same cross-over change between 3 arms is
      going to be repeated again until each classroom will be applied by all three arms of
      ventilation. A total of 5 weeks is required for the project. Children's biological samples
      including saliva, urine and skin samples will be collected as well as exhaled NO. A
      questionnaire on children's perception on air quality will be assessed as well.
