  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study seeks to investigate safety and efficacy of ixazomib (NINLARO), a proteasome
      inhibitor, in multiple sclerosis (MS). Participants will receive either ixazomib capsules or
      placebo capsules for up to 24 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The production of antibodies in the form of oligoclonal bands (OCBs) from plasma cells (cells
      involved in the body's immune response), is the hallmark of MS. Recent evidence suggests that
      plasma cells are resident in the meninges (protective membranes of the brain and spinal cord)
      of people with Multiple Sclerosis (pwMS). Ixazomib is a drug which has been effective in
      treating multiple myeloma, a disease caused by aberrant plasma cells. The purpose of this
      study is to investigate whether ixazomib can reduce or clear OCBs from the cerebrospinal
      fluid (CSF) of pwMS. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either ixazomib
      capsules (active drug arm) or placebo capsules (placebo arm) for up to 24 months.
      Participants with relapsing remitting MS (who are stable on disease modifying therapy) and
      those with progressive MS (who are not on disease modifying therapy) will be invited to take
      part in the study.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial. Randomisation will be stratified by disease stage, i.e. RRMS (and established on DMT) versus progressive MS (and not on DMT). The expected study duration is 36 months (a 12-month recruitment period and a 24-month treatment period). There will be 72 participants: 48 on ixazomib; 24 on placebo.</intervention_model_description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        - Each participant must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be enrolled in the
        study:

          1. Male and female patients 18 to 65 years old at screening

          2. Must have a diagnosis of MS, and:

               -  Patients with RRMS must be on DMT

               -  Patients with progressive MS must not be on DMT

          3. Participants with RRMS must be on stable DMT (i.e. must not have had a relapse within
             1 month prior to the screening visit). Patients on tecfidera, cladribine, ocrelizumab,
             alemtuzumab, fingolimod or natalizumab must be enrolled with caution, at Chief
             Investigator's (CI) discretion because of the lymphopenia caused by these drugs and
             the risk of thrombocytopenia in 1-2 % of people after alemtuzumab

          4. OCB positive CSF either from a previous CSF analysis or from the screening CSF
             analysis

          5. Able and willing to give written informed consent and comply with protocol
             requirements with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn by the patient at
             any time without prejudice to future medical care.

          6. Agree to the use of effective contraception as follows:

             Female patients must:

               -  Be postmenopausal for at least 1 year before the screening visit (postmenopausal
                  status confirmed by serum Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) and oestrogen levels
                  at screening or from a historical sample), OR

               -  Surgically sterile, OR

               -  If they are of childbearing potential, must agree to practice two effective
                  methods of contraception concurrently from the time of signing the informed
                  consent form until 90 days after the last dose of study drug, OR

               -  Agree to practice true abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and
                  usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence e.g. calendar, ovulation,
                  symptothermal, post-ovulation methods and withdrawal are not acceptable methods
                  of contraception

             Male patients must:

               -  Even if surgically sterilized (post-vasectomy with documentation of azoospermia),
                  agree to practice effective barrier contraception during the entire study
                  treatment period and through to 90 days after the last dose of study drug, OR

               -  Agree to practice true abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and
                  usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence e.g. calendar, ovulation,
                  symptothermal, post-ovulation methods and withdrawal are not acceptable methods
                  of contraception

          7. Clinical laboratory values:

               1. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1 x 109/L

               2. Platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/L

               3. Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × the upper limit of the normal range (ULN)

               5. Calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 30 mL/min

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants meeting any of the following exclusion criteria are not to be enrolled in
             the study:

                  screening

               4. Major surgery within 14 days before baseline

               5. Any clinically relevant malignancy or infection, as per CI/PI (or delegate)
                  decision, including a possible diagnosis of multiple myeloma: raised erythrocyte

               6. Infection requiring systemic (intravenous) antibiotic therapy or other serious
                  infection within 14 days before study enrolment. Urinary tract infections (UTIs)
                  will be treated prior to baseline and may delay baseline

                  reassessed for inclusion after treatment

              10. Any serious medical or psychiatric illness that could, in the investigator's
                  opinion, potentially interfere with the completion of treatment according to this
                  protocol

              11. Known GI disease or GI procedure that could interfere with the oral absorption or

              13. Patient has ≥ Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy, or Grade 2 with pain on clinical
                  examination during the screening period
