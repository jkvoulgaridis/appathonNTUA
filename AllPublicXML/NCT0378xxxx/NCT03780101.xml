      This study will perform multi-parametric renal MRI in 70 patients with a renal transplant who
      are undergoing a clinically indicated biopsy of their transplant. The aim of this study is to
      compare findings on renal MRI with those seen on histology.

      Background: Renal transplantation is the optimal treatment for patients with renal failure.
      However, transplant life-span is finite and commonly limited due to the development of
      chronic rejection and other causes of irreversible fibrosis. At present, renal transplant
      biopsy is required to diagnose the cause of transplant dysfunction. Renal biopsies are
      invasive procedures that carry risks of bleeding, damage to the transplant and discomfort to
      patients. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the kidneys is an emerging field of
      research that has potential to non-invasively define and quantify parenchymal renal disease
      including fibrosis and inflammation. There is a paucity of data correlating multi-parametric
      renal MRI sequences with histological findings on biopsy, especially in patients with renal
      transplants.

      Study participants: 70 adult renal transplant recipients who have been referred for a
      clinically indicated biopsy of their transplant kidney.

      Study design: Participants will undergo multi-parametric renal MRI at time of biopsy. In
      patients who receive treatment for acute rejection, a second renal MRI will be undertaken at
      completion of treatment. Blood tests for fibrosis biomarkers and routine clinical measures of
      transplant function will be obtained at time of MRI scanning.

      Objectives:

        1. Assess the correlation between functional renal MRI sequences and histological markers
           of fibrosis and inflammation.

        2. Assess the change in functional MRI sequences in response to treatment for acute
           rejection in renal transplant recipients.
