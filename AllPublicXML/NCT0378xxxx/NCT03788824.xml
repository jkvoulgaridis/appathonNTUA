      The aim:1) To test the correlation of pCLE-obtained features with histological findings in
      UC; comparing the real-time conventional colonoscopy Baron score with CLE assessment. 2) To
      test the accuracy of the investigators previously proposed simplified four-grade
      classification system of crypt architecture in evaluating inflammation activity in UC by
      pCLE.

      Patients with acute inflammatory infiltrates seen on histological assessment are more likely
      to experience relapse than are those without infiltrates,studies suggest that severity of
      inflammation is a risk factor for colorectal neoplasia in UC.

      The assessment of inflammation activity by conventional colonoscopy is inaccurate in the
      prediction of acute inflammation in some cases. Confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) allows
      for real-time endoscopy and histological diagnosis of gastrointestinal diseases. In our
      previous study, we confirmed a simplified four-grade classification system of crypt
      architecture(Grade A :normal; Grade B: an irregular arrangement of colonic crypts with normal
      size and shape, and enlarged spaces between crypts; Type C: an enlarged crypt opening and a
      more irregular crypt arrangement than type B; Type D: crypt destruction and / or crypt
      abscess) by eCLE in predicting acute inflammation, and found a good correlation with
      histology. In this study, the investigators aimed to test the accuracy of the proposed tne
      four-grade classification system in evaluating inflammation activity in UC by pCLE.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>A valuable realtime- and offline- diagnosis of pCLE in evaluating the inflammation activity in UC.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Recruited more than 100 UC patients,pCLE diagnostic criteria was the four-grades crypt architecture classification system ( inactive cases with Grade A or B, active with Grade C or D), histological assessment according to the Geboes Index ( inactive disease with Geboes index ≤ 3.0; active disease with a index &gt; 3.0). Using Spearman's text, calculating the corelation between pCLE real-time finding and the Geboes index, if p&lt;0.05, it means a strong corelation,vice versa. Also for the offline diagnosis.
Also calculate the corelation between white-light colonoscopy (Baron Score) and histopathology.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Good or Excellent interobserver and intraobserver agreement of pCLE diagnosis.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of interobserver variability of pCLE was conducted in a randomized pCLE videos' order by two independent investigators. After a 2-week interval, all pCLE videos were reassessed by the two investigators to evaluate the intraobserver agreement.</description>
