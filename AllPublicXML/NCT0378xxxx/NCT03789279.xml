  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traditionally, coronary angiograms are performed through the radial artery which is accessed
      above the palm of the 'right' hand. In recent years, some cardiologists are performing this
      procedure from the back of the wrist in as the radial artery courses through the anatomical
      snuffbox (distal radial access). The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of hand
      dysfunction following coronary angiography via the distal radial artery.

      In this multi centre observational registry, we will recruit patients undergoing planned
      invasive coronary angiography. Inclusion criteria include:

        1. Age ≥ 18 years.

        2. The distal radial artery must be palpable and non-occlusive flow must be confirmed by
           Doppler ultrasound.

        3. Patient should be able to comply with the protocol.

        4. Provide written informed consent before study participation.

      The primary endpoint is the overall prevalence of hand dysfunction defined as any significant
      reduction from baseline score in any of the following five domains:

      DASH score Levine Katz score VAS score Sensory function Pinch grip strength.

      Specifically hand function will be assessed at 4 time points using simple tests of hand
      strength, sensation and ultrasound to assess the arterial latency.

        Eligible patients for inclusion are those by whom coronary angiography or angioplasty is
        indicated as part of clinical decision-making or therapy. Operators with adequate
        experience at the discretion of the principal investigator in distal radial access are
        eligible to participate.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age ≥ 18 years.

          2. The distal radial artery must be palpable and non-occlusive flow must be confirmed by
             Doppler ultrasound.

          3. Patient should be able to comply with the protocol.

          4. Provide written informed consent before study participation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Obligatory femoral or forearm radial access

          2. Previous ipsilateral forearm radial artery occlusion.

          3. Undergoing another procedure involving the ipsilateral radial artery, performed
             between the index procedure and the follow-up date.

          4. Enrolment in another study that competes or interferes with this study.

          5. Poor clinical condition like cardiogenic shock, that prohibits pre- and postprocedural
             function tests.

          6. Any other condition which, in the opinion of the investigator or operator, may pose a
             significant hazard to the subject if he or she is enrolled in the study.

          7. Co-morbidity that excludes patient follow-up.
