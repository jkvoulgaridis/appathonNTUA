  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      End stage renal disease (ESRD) is a major public health problem. The dialysis population is
      aging. As a result we observe a high prevalence of frailty among dialysis patients (ranges
      from 3 to 10 fold higher than in the comparably aged general public). Frailty is a medical
      syndrome characterized by diminished strength, endurance, and reduced physiologic function
      that increases an individual's vulnerability for developing increased dependency and/or
      death. Without systematic approach it is difficult for physicians to detect frailty phenotype
      which however might be reversible or attenuated by interventions. Fried et al. developed a
      frailty phenotype consisting of 3 or more of: unintentional weight loss, exhaustion, physical
      inactivity, slow gait speed, and weak grip strength. The primary care of hemodialysis patient
      is often supported by the nephrologist. Identification of frailty is integrated into the
      primary care setting as one of the steps necessary for the overall assessment of the person
      and planning to formal prevention interventions in an individualized care plan. Thrice-weekly
      hemodialysis (HD) schedules are the standard default hemodialysis prescription in Western
      countries, imposed in the 70s. For incremental HD, the weekly dose of dialysis is based on
      variety of clinical factors such as residual kidney function, volume status, cardiovascular
      symptoms, potassium level, nutritional status and, comorbid conditions. Incremental HD scheme
      generally starts with 2 weekly sessions and then periodic monitoring of criteria mentioned
      above are used to determine the timing for increasing dialysis dose and frequency to 3 weekly
      sessions.

      An approach that integrates systematic frailty phenotype assessment by nephrologists and
      individualized incremental HD therapy can be beneficial within the first year of HD. It could
      optimize health-related quality of life and other pertinent outcomes without affecting
      negatively the quality of dialysis. The purpose of this study is to evaluate for frail aged
      incidents hemodialysis patients the impact of implementation of an incremental HD on HRQoL
      compared to conventional HD.

    <description>Before randomization, we will determine whether patients are frail. We will define frailty as the presence of at least three of the following five conditions: malnourished according to dietitian assessment and/or short form of Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA), grip strength and gait speed using participants' scores on the SF-36 Physical Functioning (PF) scale, exhaustion using in the quality of life questionnaire SF-36 vitality (VT) scale and physical activity according to patient assessment (one single question)</description>
