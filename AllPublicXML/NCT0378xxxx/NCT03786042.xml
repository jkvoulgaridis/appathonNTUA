  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research aims to investigate how exposure to advertising for Electronic Nicotine
      Delivery Systems (commonly called e-cigarettes) may lead to combustible smoking initiation in
      adolescents.

    <measure>change in baseline in implicit positive smoking expectancies, measured by the implicit association test</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, within 5 minutes post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Scores are measured by recording the amount of time (reaction time) it takes to categorize smoking-related words with positive (e.g., cool) and negative (e.g., cancer) words. Faster reaction times when categorizing smoking-related words with positive words is evidence of higher positive smoking expectancies.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Amount of time spent looking at static smoking cues in e-cigarette advertisements</measure>
    <time_frame>approximately 30 minutes post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Eye-tracking will be used to measure the amount of time spent looking at static smoking cues in screen shots taken from e-cigarette advertisements. The amount time spent looking at a smoking cue is a measure how much attention was given to the smoking cue. The longer the looking time, the greater amount of attention.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>7-item explicit positive smoking expectancies scale</measure>
    <time_frame>approximately 30 minutes post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Scores are measured on a 7-item scale. Positive smoking expectancies will be assessed using the following questions that follow the lead-in, &quot;Please tell me how you feel about the following statements.&quot; &quot;I think I would enjoy smoking&quot;; &quot;I think smoking would give me something to do when I'm bored&quot;; &quot;I think smoking would help me deal with problems or stress&quot;; &quot;I think smoking would help me stay thin&quot;; &quot;I think smoking would help me to feel more comfortable at parties&quot;; &quot;I think smoking would be relaxing&quot;; and &quot;I think smoking would make me look older.&quot; Responses are yes/no. Responses are coded as &quot;1&quot; for yes and &quot;0&quot; for no. Responses are then summed for a maximum positive smoking expectancy score out of 7. Higher scores mean higher positive smoking expectancies.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>11-item scale that measures social normative beliefs about smoking</measure>
    <time_frame>approximately 30 minutes post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>This 11-item scale assess social normative beliefs about smoking related to 1) perceived disapproval from family/friends, 2) perceived popularity among successful/elite, and 3) perceived prevalence. Disapproval scale questions are answered using a 4-point Likert scale (1 = Strongly disagree; 4 = Strongly agree). A total disapproval score (ranging from 1 to 4) is calculated by averaging responses to each question. Higher values indicate a higher disapproval score. Popularity scale questions are answered using a 4-point Likert scale (1 = Strongly disagree; 4 = Strongly agree). A total popularity score (ranging from 1 to 4) is calculated by averaging responses to each question. Higher values indicate a higher popularity score. Prevalence scale questions are answered using a percent scale from 0 - 100% in 10% increments. A total prevalence scale (from 0 to 100) is calculated by averaging the responses to each question. Higher values indicate a higher prevalence score.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>A 3-item scale that measures adolescent smoking susceptibility</measure>
    <time_frame>approximately 30 minutes post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>This 3-item instrument is used to predict which never smokers are likely to start smoking by measuring their curiosity to use tobacco products. Item responses are on a 4-point Likert scale (definitely yes, probably yes, probably not, definitely not). To classify a respondent as not susceptible to smoking, the respondent must indicate &quot;definitely not&quot; to all four items. Any other response to any item classifies a respondent as &quot;susceptible.&quot;</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Amount of time looking at dynamic smoking cues in e-cigarette advertisements</measure>
    <time_frame>During the intervention, approximately 15 minutes post baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Eye-tracking will be used to measure the total amount of time spent looking in realtime at smoking cues in TV commercials for e-cigarettes. The amount of time looking at smoking cues will be a measure of the amount of attention given to smoking cues. The longer the amount of time spent looking at smoking cues indicates that a greater amount of attention was given to the smoking cues.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>18-item scale that measures character attributes of actors that appeared in the commercials</measure>
    <time_frame>approximately 30 minutes post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Character Attributes will be collected using a scale that measures participants beliefs about character attributes using the lead in: &quot;I think [Character Name] is: &quot; using a 5-point Likert (1 = strongly disagree; 5 = strongly agree). There is a total of 6 attributes assessed: 1) smart (smart, intelligent, stupid), 2) successful (successful, achieves goals, gets what he/she wants), 3) attractive (physically attractive, ugly, good-looking), 4) funny (funny, humorous, makes me laugh), 5) respected (respected by others, receives approval, criticized by others), and 6) popular (has lots of friends, well liked, gets support from others). A total score (form 1 to 5) for each scale is calculated by averaging responses for each question within that scale. For each scale, a higher total score indicates higher beliefs about that attribute.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>5-item scale that measure how much participants wish to be like the actors appearing in the commercials.</measure>
    <time_frame>approximately 30 minutes post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>This 5-item is scale is used to quantify how much a participant would like to be like an actor appearing in a commercial. Questions are rated on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = Strongly Disagree; 5 = Strongly agree). A total identification score (from 1 to 25) is calculated by summing the responses to each question. A higher total score indicates a higher level of wishful identification.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>13-item scale to measure risk perception about cigarette use</measure>
    <time_frame>approximately 30 minutes post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>This 13-item scale measures risk perceptions associated with cigarette use. Questions are answered using a sliding percent scale from 0 - 100% in 10% increments. A risk perception scale is calculated (from 0 to 100) by averaging the responses to each question. Higher values indicate a higher risk perception.</description>
