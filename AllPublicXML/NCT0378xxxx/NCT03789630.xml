  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Historically, pain in humans has been measured using subjective ratings, such as the visual
      analog scale (VAS), to determine presence and severity. While this is important information,
      self-report is a problematic metric for both diagnostic and research purposes as it depends
      on their history with pain, cognitive and behavioral factors, and can vary over time. Over
      the past few years, significant advances have begun to be made in the development of measures
      as valid biomarkers or surrogate markers for the presence of acute and/or chronic pain.
      Measurement of various physiology parameters like heart rate, blood pressure, sweating, etc.
      have shown to be associated with the presence of pain and can aid clinical interpretation. It
      is acceptable that measurements extracted as a result of this singular assessment are not
      specific to pain and may be caused by something unrelated, which can weaken the validity.

      The aim of this observational study is to assess whether patient-reported pain levels
      correlate with deviations in multivariate physiology biomarkers captured in a real-world
      ambulatory setting. This study will be conducted using a clinical-grade wearable sensor to
      continuously monitor patient's physiology (pain related biomarkers) and allow the subjects to
      actively report their pain score, symptoms and quality of life using a mobile-based
      application.

    <description>This study will recruit 151 patients aged 21 to 80 years who will be undergoing total knee replacement surgery. All study participants undergoing total knee replacement surgery will be monitored using the wearable biosensor to continuously monitor physiology biomarkers. Participants will be followed for an estimated total of 39 days, beginning four days before surgery, the entire period during in-patient recovery (four to five days), and 30-days post-discharge at-home.</description>
