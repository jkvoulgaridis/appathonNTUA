      This study is planned to determine the safety and tolerability of rogaratinib in Chinese

    <description>Rogaratinib will be administered on 20 days in Cycle 1 (single dosing on Day 1 and twice daily dosing on Days 3-21). In Cycles ≥2, rogaratinib will be administered twice daily for 21 days, with cycles repeated every 21 days. Treatment will be continued until death, tumor progression, unacceptable toxicity, consent withdrawal, or until another criterion is met for withdrawal from the study at the discretion of the investigator.</description>
