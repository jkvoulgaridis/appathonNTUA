  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep difficulties are very common in adults in the U.S. today. Zolpidem (Ambien) is often
      prescribed as a first line agent to treat sleep difficulties in patients presenting with
      sleep related complaints to Primary Care Practitioners (PCP's). Zolpidem is currently
      available in two doses, 10 and 5 mg. These doses were developed in clinical studies carried
      out primarily on men. The first dose made clinically available, 10 mg, resulted in morbidity
      and mortality in many women because women metabolize Zolpidem at a slower rate than men, thus
      the half-life is longer. Women taking Zolpidem often had morning drowsiness, persistent
      sleepiness, and difficulty with tasks requiring coordination and judgement, such as motor
      vehicle operation. There were a number of well publicized motor vehicle crashes and
      fatalities attributed to Zolpidem, mostly among women. The company then produced a 5 mg dose;
      however, some women still reported side effects at the lower dose, suggesting persistent drug
      levels in the morning, when the drug purportedly should have been cleared from the body.
      These women would likely benefit from a lower dose, a dose personalized for their individual
      metabolisms and sleep difficulties. Lower doses of Zolpidem are only available from
      compounding pharmacies, which are not common, are expensive, do not take many insurances, and
      are not offered as an option to most patients. Vitae Industries, Inc. is a start-up tech
      company located in Providence, founded by a Brown University graduate, a chemical engineer,
      who has developed technology that can provide precisely varied amounts of drug for specific
      and variable personalized patient dosing. Personalized medicine is an area of great research
      and clinical interest to the medical community at large and the Brown University Medical
      School in particular. Brown also has a growing focus on issues of sex and gender in the
      rendering of clinical medical care. This technology has the potential to address both of
      these areas, providing the possibility of very specific, tailored drug dosing for men and
      women. This research was developed as a proof of concept study which will be carried out as a
      collaboration between Brown University Medical School/Lifespan physicians and the technical
      staff at Vitae Industries, Inc.. This work will be foundational and will serve as the medical
      and scientific justification for Vitae Industry's providing patient specific dosing of
      medications. For the purposes of this study, the medication to be tested, Zolpidem (Ambien)
      will be compounded by a licensed compounding Rhode Island pharmacy, PhusionRx, using
      standardized approaches to compounding and formulating pharmaceutical products. This study
      will use low doses of Zolpidem formulated by the licensed compounding pharmacy, PhusionRx.
      The investigators will provide graduated doses of Zolpidem to women participants meeting
      inclusion criteria who present to their primary care physician complaining of difficulty
      achieving satisfactory sleep. Participants will start at a dose of 0.5 mg of Zolpidem. Each
      day the quality of their sleep will be assessed by self-report. If they have not achieved
      satisfactory sleep at the starting dose of 0.5 mg, the will increase their dose daily by 0.5
      mg until they reach the standard 5 mg dose or satisfactory sleep is achieved.
