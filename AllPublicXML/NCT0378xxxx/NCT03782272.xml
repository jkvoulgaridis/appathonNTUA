  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled pilot study to determine the safety,
      acceptability, and feasible pediatric dosage/tolerability of enterade® solution, an amino
      acid-based oral rehydration solution (AA-ORS), for potential use in the management of
      environmental enteric dysfunction (EED) among children aged 12-24 months in Kakamega County,
      Kenya.

      Primary objectives:

        1. To determine the safety of a 2-week course of AA-ORS among children with length-for-age
           Z-scores (LAZ) between -1 and -3.

        2. To determine the feasibility and best tolerated dose of AA-ORS among children with LAZ
           between -3 and -1.

           Secondary objectives:

        3. To determine the perceptions among caregivers on the acceptability of AA-ORS as a
           potential intervention for EED. (Qualitative)

           Exploratory objectives:

        4. To determine the impact of AA-ORS on markers of metabolism, gut dysfunction, systemic
           inflammation, and micronutrient status among children with LAZ between -3 and - 1.

      Qualitative results will not be reported on ClinicalTrials.gov.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Environmental enteric dysfunction (EED) is an intestinal disorder common among people living
      in low-resource settings (LRS), which in children has been associated with increased risk of
      growth stunting, reduced cognitive development, and reduced oral vaccine responsiveness. An
      effective EED therapeutic would offer an opportunity to improve child growth and development
      in LRS. One promising intervention, enterade® (an amino acid-based oral rehydration solution
      [AA-ORS]), is a medical food product already sold in the United States. It consists of oral
      rehydration salts and a proprietary blend of amino acids designed to restore gut function,
      improve nutrient and electrolyte absorption, and improve barrier integrity. There is evidence
      that this AA-ORS reduces inflammation and promotes healing of damaged intestinal epithelium
      in murine models of intestinal damage (irradiated gut), and it may provide benefit to
      pediatric EED patients. Supplementation of amino acids may lessen or improve intestinal
      injury related to enteric illnesses commonly experienced in settings of poor hygiene and
      sanitation infrastructure. The results from this exploratory mixed-methods study could have
      broad implications for possible future studies among pediatric patients with intestinal
      injury resulting from EED and future product development and program strategies for EED
      interventions.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a mixed-methods pilot study to assess the safety, acceptability, and feasible dosage of AA-ORS among children with mild to moderate stunting (LAZ between -1 and -3) who are at risk for EED and to assess the acceptability of this fluid supplementation for their caregivers. During the main study, child participants will be randomized to receive 14 days of AA-ORS or placebo solution daily, dosing of up to 237 ml over a 3-hour period. Study staff and participants will be blinded to the study product allocation. Caregivers will store and return unused study product. Data collection methods to include direct observation of product consumption, structured surveys with caregivers, average daily volume consumed, and measurement of plasma/serum markers of metabolism, gut dysfunction, systemic inflammation, and micro-nutrient status pre- and post-administration of product.</intervention_model_description>
