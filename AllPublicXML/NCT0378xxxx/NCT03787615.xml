  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the feasibility of using sipIT tools (i.e.,
      wrist-worn sensors, smart water bottles, mobile applications) to increase compliance with
      physician-recommended fluid consumption guidelines in participants with a history of
      urolithiasis. The study aims to: 1) deliver notifications regarding fluid consumption to the
      FitBit Versa and the participant's smartphone based on the participant's assessed fluid
      intake, and 2) determine the acceptability of using the sipIT tools to increase fluid
      consumption. It is hypothesized that receiving notifications regarding fluid consumption will
      lead to an increased compliance in attaining fluid consumption guidelines. Further, it is
      hypothesized that the frequency of notifications will diminish across the study duration.

      Complying with fluid consumption guidelines provides a variety of health benefits. Patients
      with a history of urolithiasis are a segment of the population that can benefit from meeting
      physician-recommended fluid consumption guidelines. Preliminary studies with this population
      have revealed patient interest in using various technologies (i.e., wrist-worn sensors, smart
      water bottles, mobile applications) to increase their fluid consumption but the investigators
      are not aware of any that combine multiple technologies. The investigators' long-term goal is
      to examine if just-in-time reminder notifications to drink following periods when patients
      have not been drinking will increase compliance among patients with a history of
      urolithiasis. To prepare for that study, the investigators seek to evaluate the feasibility
      and acceptability of the sipIT tools in this study.

      This study is part three of a set of studies aimed at determining the feasibility of using
      technology to increase compliance with fluid consumption guidelines. Preliminary data
      included 1) a focus group of participants with a history of urolithiasis and 2) a lab study
      to examine the feasibility of using wrist-worn sensors to detect non-alcoholic drinking
      events. Data from the focus group revealed that participants are interested in using a
      variety of technologies (e.g., wrist-worn sensors, smart water bottles, mobile applications)
      to assist with increasing fluid consumption. Data from the lab study revealed that using
      wrist-worn inertial sensors to detect drinking events is feasible. Based on data from the lab
      study, an algorithm was developed to detect these drinking events and has been implemented in
      a consumer smartwatch consumer smartwatch app for just-in-time drinking detection.
