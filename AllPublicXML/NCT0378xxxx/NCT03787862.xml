  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate novel advanced imaging techniques (hyperspectral imaging) that could enable
      clinicians to determine the degree and effectiveness of blood flow to tissues during surgery.

      There are a number of disorders where blood flow is inadequate to provide nutrients and
      oxygen to tissues. Under some circumstances, surgery is required to either improve the blood
      flow or remove tissues that are poorly perfused. In other cases, occlusion of the blood
      supply to an organ is temporarily or permanently performed to minimize blood loss during a
      surgical procedure.

      Additionally, there are disorders where the location of certain blood containing structures
      is important but not immediately obvious to surgeons during an operation. Knowledge of where
      those structures are is very important and could greatly improve the safety of various
      surgical procedures.

      Patients of the investigator who are scheduled for foot surgery will be provided the
      opportunity to participate in this research. After giving informed consent, hyperspectral
      images will be obtained at various points during the surgical procedure.

      As this technology is non-invasive, it is not expected to interfere with or change the
      procedure they are undergoing. Once the surgical procedure is complete, imaging will be saved
      to a disk for later evaluation.

      100 subjects will participate in this study.

      The hyperspectral imager will be turned on at various time points during surgery, to measure
      the spectral wavelengths of tissues. The surgery being performed will in no way be altered by
      the imaging device and post surgical follow-up of patients will be standard of care
      appropriate to the surgical procedure.

      Patients will have HSI performed only during their surgery. They will not receive additional
      medications and will have no additional follow up. Participating in this study will not add
      extra appointments, procedures, or time requirements for the patient. The patient's medical
      record may be referenced for information after the surgery for up to one year. There are no
      costs to the patient for participation in this study.
