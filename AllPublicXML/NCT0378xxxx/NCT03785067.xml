  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A Sub-Study of an investigator initiated and conducted, multicentre, international,
      double-blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial (TRIDENT) to
      determine the effect of more intensive long-term blood pressure control, provided by a fixed
      low-dose combination blood pressure lowering pill (&quot;Triple Pill&quot;) strategy on top of standard
      of care, for slowing memory decline as measured by Cambridge Neuropsychological Test
      Automated Battery (CANTAB), in patients with a history of acute stroke due to intracerebral
      haemorrhage (ICH).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive decline and dementia in ICH is high due to the common underlying vasculopathy of
      cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD). However, in general, detailed cognitive outcomes in ICH
      have been neglected, possibly due to the high mortality rate of ICH (up to 60% within the
      first year).

      Blood pressure (BP) management in those with ICH has been suboptimal. Most hypertensive
      patients need more than two medications. Combination therapy may improve adherence and BP
      reduction and reduce cardiovascular (CV) event rates. In the main TRIDENT study, it is
      hypothesised that a fixed low-dose triple combination BP-lowering agent, termed the 'Triple
      Pill' will prevent recurrent stroke. The Triple Pill is composed of a single capsule
      containing either a combination of telmisartan 20 mg, amlodipine 2.5 mg and indapamide 1.25
      mg, or placebo.

      In addition to achieving optimal BP control, the Triple Pill also has the capacity to slow
      cognitive decline and dementia in ICH survivors. Research shows that elevated BP is
      associated with Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia, even after accounting for prior
      stroke or transient ischaemic attack, and large scale prospective studies have shown a 50%
      reduction in dementia when BP is managed appropriately
