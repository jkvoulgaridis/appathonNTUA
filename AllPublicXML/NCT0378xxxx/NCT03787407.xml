  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to verify the effect of neurofeedback-assisted mindfulness
      training for workers. Subjects who can participate in the screening are assigned to one
      neurofeedback-assisted mindfulness training group, mindfulness only training group, and
      self-treatment group. The neurofeedback-assisted mindfulness group and the mindfulness group
      meet with psychologist and have education for the mindfulness training with or without
      neurofeedback respectively, a total of 4 times, once a week. On the other hand, the
      self-treatment group provides self-education by providing the stress education kit.

      After screening, Pre-evaluation is conducted on the subjects who agreed to participate in the
      study. Pre-assessment includes questionnaires related to stress, emotional labor, resilience,
      sleep, etc., and includes stress-related physiological measures using HRV, 2 lead EEG. After
      the pre-evaluation, the neurofeedback-assisted mindfulness and mindfulness training group
      will have education sessions with a psychologist for 30 minutes at a time, once a week, for a
      total of 4 sessions (one month for a period). The education includes the instruction of the
      application including mindfulness training, with or without neurofeedback, and the review for
      the accomplishment of the training. Participants should follow the instruction and the
      training schedule which is arranged in advance. On the other hand, for a self-care control,
      the education sessions are not provided and self-learning materials are provided once a week.
      The purpose of the study is to find the effectiveness of mindfulness training on reduction of
      stress and severity of emotional labor. Especially, mindfulness training group with
      neurofeedback might be expected to show the highest improvement in various clinical scales
      and biomarkers including EEG and HRV.

    <measure>Change from baseline Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) score at 4, 8 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after 4, 8 weeks later</time_frame>
    <description>The full name: Perceived Stress Scale - 10 item form 14-item scale developed by Cohen et al. (1983) that emphasizes subjective perception of stress. Measures the degree of perceived unforeseeable, uncontrollable, and overwhelming experience of stress in the past month. Although the 14-item PSS tend to exhibit good reliability, four of the items tend to perform poorly when evaluated using exploratory factor analysis (Cohen et al., 1988). As a result, the PSS is commonly implemented using the 10-item form. The questions are rated on 5-point Likert scale; 0 (never), 1 (almost never), 2 (sometimes), 3 (fairly often), 4 (very often). Higher scores represent worse outcomes. The scores of each scale sum into the total score. Thus the total score ranges from 0 to 40.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline Korean Emotional Labor Assessment Tool score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after 4, 8 weeks later</time_frame>
    <description>The total of 26 items were Emotional expression and control 5 items, organizational monitoring and management system 4 items, forced customer response 4 items, emotional damage 6 items, organizational protection system 7 items, and organizational protection system is reverse coding and summed up. 4 point Likert scale (1 = not at all, 5 = very much), and the possible total score ranges from 26 to 130 points. The higher the score, the more emotional labor means.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and after 4, 8 weeks later</time_frame>
    <description>total of 24 items were used, and each item was not at all (from 1 point) to very much (5 points). The higher the score, the more the job stress means. Job demand, Insufficient job control, job insecurity, interpersonal conflict, Organizational system, Lack of reward and Occupational climate.</description>
