  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to collect information on how Tresiba® works in real world
      patients. Patients will get Tresiba® as prescribed to them by their study doctor. The study
      will last for about 6 to 8 months. Patients will be asked questions about their health and
      diabetes treatment as part of their normal study doctor's appointment.

    <description>Number of episodes occurring within 4 weeks prior to initiation of treatment with Tresiba® and within 4 weeks prior to end of study. The definition of &quot;nocturnal&quot; will be based on the patient's perception of whether or not it was night, i.e. the answer to this question to the patient: &quot;How many of these occurred between midnight and early morning&quot;?</description>
