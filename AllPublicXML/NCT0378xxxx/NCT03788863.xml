  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glucocorticoids are drugs that have many effects on body metabolism, raise sugar level in the
      blood, and reduce inflammation. By applying a statistical technique for combining the
      findings from a systematic literature review (meta analysis), researchers want to learn more
      about the relationship of the risk to develop a separation in the roof of the mouth (cleft
      palate) in newborns and contact with glucocorticoids during pregnancy.
