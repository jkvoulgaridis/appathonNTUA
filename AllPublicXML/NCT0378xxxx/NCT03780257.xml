      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of QR-421a administered
      via intravitreal injection (IVT) in subjects with Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) due to mutations
      in exon 13 of the USH2A gene.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of QR-421a administered
      via IVT in subjects with RP due to mutations in exon 13 of the USH2A gene. Subjects will
      receive one single IVT injection of QR-421a or sham-procedure in one eye (subject's worse
      eye) and will be followed up for 24 months.

      Three dose levels of QR-421a will be evaluated: 50, 100, and 200 µg. Additional dose levels
      (eg, 25 or 400 µg) may be evaluated based on ongoing safety and efficacy data monitoring.

      Per dose cohort, a minimum of 4 subjects will be treated with QR-421a and a minimum of 2
      subjects will receive the sham-procedure. The first subject in a dose cohort will receive
      QR-421a (open-label); subsequent subjects in the same dose cohort will be randomized to
      either QR-421a or sham-procedure.

             a continuous area of central field greater than or equal to 10 degrees diameter in any
             axis in the treatment eye, and evidence of functioning rods.

          6. Willing and able to comply with the protocol, follow study instructions, attend study
             visits as required and complete all study assessments.

          7. Willing and able to provide informed consent for participation prior to performing any
             study related procedures, and suitable verbal, auditory, written and/or tactile sign
             language communication as to allow informed consent to be obtained, in the opinion of
             the Investigator.

          8. No limitations to SD-OCT image collection that would prevent high quality, reliable
             images from being obtained in both eyes as determined by the investigator.

          9. Reliable perimetry measurements in both eyes, as described in the Imaging Manual and
             determined by the Investigator.

         10. Clear ocular media and adequate pupillary dilation to permit good quality retinal
             imaging, as assessed by the Investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Presence of additional non-exon 13 USH2A pathogenic mutation(s) on the USH2A allele
             carrying the exon 13 mutation in subjects who are compound heterozygous for mutations
             in exon 13.

          2. Presence of non-exon 13 USH2A pathogenic mutation(s) on both USH2A alleles in subjects
             who are homozygous for mutations in exon 13.

          3. Presence of pathogenic mutations in genes (other than the USH2A gene) associated with
             Usher syndrome Type 2 or NSRP, or other inherited retinal degenerative diseases or
             syndromes.

          4. Presence of any significant ocular or non-ocular disease/disorder (or medication
             and/or laboratory test abnormalities) which, in the opinion of the Investigator and
             with concurrence of the Medical Monitor, may either put the subject at risk because of
             participation in the study, may influence the results of the study, or the subject's
             ability to participate in the study. This includes but is not limited to a subject

             (including refractive surgery), or an IVT injection or planned intraocular surgery or
             procedure during the course of the study.

         11. Current treatment or treatment within the past 12 months with therapies known to
             influence the immune system (including but not limited to steroid implants,
             cytostatics, interferons, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-binding proteins, drugs acting
             on immunophilins, or antibodies with known impact on the immune system). Subjects that
             have been treated with systemic steroids within the past 12 months or that require
             intermittent use of topical steroids may be considered for inclusion following
             approval by the Medical Monitor.

         12. A history of glaucoma or an IOP greater than 24 mmHg in either eye that is not
             controlled with medication or surgery at the time of informed consent.

         13. Use of any investigational drug or device within 90 days or 5 half-lives preceding the
             first dose of study medication, whichever is longer, or plans to participate in
             another study of an investigational drug or device during the PQ-421a-001 study
             period.

         14. Any prior treatment with genetic or stem-cell therapy for ocular or non-ocular
             disease.

         15. History of malignancy within 5 years prior to Screening, except adequately treated
             squamous or basal cell carcinoma of the skin or carcinoma in situ of the cervix that
             has been successfully treated.

         16. Known hypersensitivity to antisense oligonucleotides or any constituents of the
             injection.

         17. Pregnant and breastfeeding subjects. Females of childbearing potential and males must
             comply with using highly effective methods of contraception as defined in Section
             6.2.2. Women of non-childbearing potential may be included without the use of adequate
             birth control, provided they meet the criteria in the protocol.
