    <textblock>
      Diabetic patients with and without chronic cough will be included in this study. After giving
      their informed consent, the patients will perform a spirometry, chest X-ray at the inclusion
      visit. Cough will be assessed using the cough visual analog scale (VAS) and the Leicester
      Cough Questionnaire (LCQ). Within 60 days, the patient will perform neurophysiological tests.
      The neurophysiological assessment will be concluded with a skin biopsy to evaluate small
      fiber neuropathy. The aim of the study is to compare the proportion of small fiber neuropathy
      between diabetic patients with chronic cough and those without chronic cough.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic cough is a very common entity that affects 9.6% people worldwide. Given the high
      number of patients with refractory cough, the concept of cough hypersensitivity syndrome
      (CHS) has emerged. In CHS, afferent sensory nerves may exhibit a modification of activation
      patterns with facilitation of encoding signals in response to irritating stimuli. Similar
      patterns with neuropathic pain have been described. Small fiber neuropathy has never been
      assessed in chronic cough. Interestingly, diabetic patients experienced cough more frequently
      than healthy subject. We hypothesized that small fiber neuropathy may explain chronic cough
      is more frequent in diabetic patients.

      Within 60 days after inclusion, diabetic patients with and without chronic cough will perform
      neurophysiological tests such as electromyography, thermotest, QSART (Quantitative Sudomotor
      Axon Reflex Test and Sudoscan), cardio-vascular tests to study the autonomic nervous system.
      No risks are expecting with these non-invasive tests. A skin biopsy to evaluate small fiber
      neuropathy will also be performed.After the neurophysiological tests, a consultation will be
      scheduled at 6 months. A cough VAS and LCQ will be used to assess cough.

    <description>estimate the values of Leicester Cough Questionnaire in diabetic patients with and without chronic cough. The Leicester Cough Questionnaire comprises 19 items and takes 5 to 10 minutes to complete. Each item assesses symptoms, or the impact of symptoms, over the last 2 weeks on a seven-point Likert scale. Scores in three domains (physical, psychological and social) are calculated as a mean for each domain (range 1 to 7). A total score (range 3 to 21) is also calculated by adding the domain scores together. Higher scores indicate better quality of life.</description>

    <time_frame>6 month after inclusion visit</time_frame>
    <description>estimate the values of the DN4 questionnaire in diabetic patients with and without chronic cough.
It allows to estimate the probability of neuropathic pain in a patient, through 4 questions divided into 10 check items. The practitioner questions or examines the patient and completes the questionnaire himself. He notes a response (&quot;yes&quot;, &quot;no&quot;) to each item. At the end of the questionnaire, he counts the answers and assigns the note 1 for each &quot;yes&quot;, and the score 0 for each &quot;no&quot;. The sum obtained gives the score of the patient, scored out of 10.</description>
