  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The beneficial effects of physical activity (PA) for older adults are well known. Yet, few
      older adults reach the health guideline of 150 minutes/week of moderate-intensity PA. eHealth
      interventions are effective in raising PA levels in older adults on the short-term. However,
      intermediate- or long-term effects have been examined rarely. This study aimed to investigate
      the effect of the eHealth intervention 'MyPlan 2.0' on both accelerometer-based and
      self-reported PA levels in Belgian older adults on the short- and intermediate-term.

      This study was a randomized controlled trial with three measurement moments (baseline (n=72),
      post (five weeks after baseline; n=68) and follow-up (three months after baseline; n=68). At
      all measurement moments, participants in the control group and intervention group filled out
      the International Physical Activity Questionnaire and wore an accelerometer during one week.
      Participants in the intervention group got access to the eHealth intervention 'MyPlan 2.0'
      and used it for five consecutive weeks after baseline. 'MyPlan 2.0' was based on
      self-regulatory theory and focused on both pre- and post-intentional processes to increase
      PA.

      Technical information about the content of the MyPlan 2.0. intervention:

      MyPlan 2.0. was the eHealth intervention that was used in this study. MyPlan 2.0. is a
      theory- and user-based intervention. Theories used to develop the intervention are the
      self-regulation theory and the Health Action Approach model. The intervention targets pre-
      and post-intentional processes to reach behavior change. The intervention consists of five
      website visits in five weeks (one per week).

      During the first website visit, the participants fill in a short PA questionnaire and based
      on the answers, they receive personal feedback about their behavior (pre-intentional
      processes). Knowledge is also provided by giving users the chance to fill in an optional quiz
      about PA and its beneficial effects. Post-intentional processes are targeted during this
      first visit by asking the participants to make an action plan. Participants are asked what
      they want to do (e.g. being more active by cycling during leisure time), when (e.g. every
      Sunday morning), where (e.g. in the streets nearby) and for how long (e.g. 60 minutes). After
      answering these questions, the participants can identify difficult situations and possible
      barriers (i.e. coping planning) while pursuing their goals. Dependent on which barriers they
      select, specific solutions are given and the participants could choose which ones they
      consider appropriate and want to apply. After this first website visit, the users can
      indicate how they want to self-monitor their behaviour (e.g. using an agenda).

      One week after finishing the first website visit, the participants receive an email to
      revisit the website. During this second visit, they receive feedback about their behavioural
      change process and their goals (e.g. did the participant reach his/her goal or not?).
      Afterwards the participants have the possibility to adapt their action plan (e.g. setting
      new, more realistic goals). They can reconsider coping plans, based on barriers they
      experienced while pursuing their goals. Furthermore, participants can optionally read
      activity tips. Website visits 3, 4 and 5 are respectively activated one week after the
      previous visit. Again, the participants are reminded by email. These three last visits are
      identical to the second visit (review of the action and coping plan).

    <description>the validated International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) is used to assess self-reported weekly physical activity in three domains (leisure-time, transport, household). Within each domain, different intensities and types of physical activity are assessed. Minutes per week of physical activity in all subdomains are assessed, namely leisure-time walking, leisure-time moderate physical activity, leisure-time vigorous physical activity, moderate physical activity in the garden, vigorous physical activity in the garden, moderate physical activity at home, walking for transport and cycling for transport. The physical activity data are truncated to realistic maxima based on the official IPAQ guidelines. These guidelines subscribe that the maximum amount of physical activity for each subdomain is maximum 840 minutes per week.</description>

    <description>eHealth intervention to increase physical activity in older adults. MyPlan 2.0 consists of five website visits. The first website visit contains pre- and post-intentional processes. The following four website visits contains mainly post-intentional processes. During the first website, participants fill in a questionnaire about their physical activity levels, and receive feedback. Furthermore, they are asked to make an action plan and think about barriers to reach their activity goals and possible solutions to tackle these barriers. During the other four website visits, participants receive feedback about their behavior change process and their action plan (did they reach their goal)? During these website visits, they can adapt their action plans.</description>
