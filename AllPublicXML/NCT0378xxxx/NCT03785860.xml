  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this project is to conduct a randomized-order, double-blinded cross-over
      trial in 20 participants to test the effects of a dietary fiber formulation on gut microbiota
      composition and short chain fatty acid production, lipid profiles, glucose sensitivity,
      intestinal permeability, overall gut health, and markers of inflammation.
