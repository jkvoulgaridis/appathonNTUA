  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is intended to produce information on the pharmacokinetic characteristics (uptake
      into and elimination from the body) of two new patch formulations of the analgesic
      buprenorphine as compared to the reference patch Transtec (Registered Trademark) 35
      micrograms per hour (μg/h) in order to assess the suitability of the test formulations for a
      later confirmatory bioequivalence study.

      In addition to a reduced buprenorphine load, the new patch formulations may potentially
      provide improved wearing properties. A placebo patch formulation of the respective test or
      reference patch will be applied simultaneously to explore the skin tolerability and skin
      adhesiveness of the patch formulations. Furthermore, the safety and tolerability of the
      treatments will be assessed.

    <description>For the analysis of buprenorphine in human plasma a liquid chromatography-double quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-validated method will be used. AUC is calculated by summation of the partial areas AUC(0-t) and the residual area AUC(t-∞) represents the recalculated plasma concentration at the last sampling time point with a quantifiable concentration. Blood sampling for the determination of the plasma concentrations will be performed at the following time points:</description>

    <description>Area under data from administration until the last sampling point (tz) with a quantifiable concentration, calculated by the linear/log trapezoidal method, i.e., the linear trapezoidal rule is applied up to Cmax and then the log trapezoidal rule is applied for the remainder of the curve.
