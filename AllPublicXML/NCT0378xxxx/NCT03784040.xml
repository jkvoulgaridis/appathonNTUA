  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary hypothesis is that cancer vaccine can convert non-immunogenic gastric cancer into
      immunogenic phenotype susceptible to PD1 inhibition. This would lead to an improved
      radiological response rate and favorable immune contexture for immune checkpoint blockade

      Primary Objectives

        1. Safety cohorts: To evaluate the safety of OTSGC-A24 and nivolumab (+ ipilimumab) in
           patients with refractory gastric cancer.

        2. Arm A: To determine the objective response rate of OTSGC-A24 and nivolumab in advanced
           gastric cancer.

        3. Arm B: To determine the objective response rate of OTSGC-A24 and nivolumab + ipilimumab
           in advanced gastric cancer.

      Secondary Objectives

        1. To compare the difference in objective response rates between Arm A and Arm B

        2. To compare the tumoral immune contexture and PDL-1 expression before treatment, after
           OTSGC-A24, and after nivolumab (+ ipilimumab) in combination with OTSGC-A24.

        3. To determine the serum cytotoxic T-cell response using enzyme-linked immunospot assay
           (ELISPOT) in PBMC.

        4. To determine the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of Arm A and
           Arm B.

        5. To evaluate the effect of OTSGC-A24 and nivolumab + ipilimumab on clinical and immune PD
           markers.

        6. Evaluate the effects of treatment on peripheral T-cell phenotypic profiles with
           epitope-specificities by coupling mass cytometric analyses with highly-multiplexed
           peptide-MHC tetramer staining technology.

        7. Identify potential biomarkers for treatment response and mechanisms of secondary
           resistance by studying gene expression profiles and phenotypic/functional markers of
           tumour and infiltrating immune cells.

      End Points - Efficacy

      The endpoints for efficacy are:

        -  Induction of specific CTL response after vaccination

        -  Response rate

        -  Progression-free survival

        -  Overall survival End Points - Safety

      The endpoints for safety are:

      • overall adverse events observed, treatment-related adverse events, and category (eg
      percentage of patients with any-grade treatment-related adverse events and grade 3-4
      treatment-related adverse events).

    <description>OTSGC-A24 is administered as a subcutaneous (under the skin) injection. Nivolumab and ipilimumab are administered by intravenous (IV) infusion, meaning the drug is given through a catheter in a vein. A pump will be used to ensure the correct amount of medicine is given through the catheter. The nivolumab and ipilimumab infusions each take about 30 minutes. There will be a break of about 30 minutes in between the nivolumab and ipilimumab infusions (if given on the same day). OTSGC-A24 and nivolumab are administered every 2 weeks, while ipilimumab is administered every 6 weeks.</description>
