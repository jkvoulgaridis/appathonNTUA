    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish an optimal treatment duration and tolerable
      cumulative dose for BP-C1 in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer patients who had
      previously undergone at least three lines of chemotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BP-C1, solution for injection 0.05%, is currently being developed for treatment of patients
      with metastatic breast cancer with palliative intent. Active substance of the product, which
      is a novel platinum-containing anticancer agent developed for intramuscular administration,
      is cis-diammineplatinum(II) complexed with a polymer containing benzene polycarboxylic acids
      derived from lignin. The amphiphilic characteristics of the polymer have resulted in a
      product with clear and significantly altered and improved properties compared to other
      platinum analogues, e.g. cisplatin, carboplatin and oxaliplatin.

      BP-C1 preserves antitumour activity of its predecessors (e.g. cisplatin and carboplatin),
      additionally offering the following advantages that ensure favourable outcome of treatment of
      metastatic breast cancer patients:

        -  injectable solution (intramuscular) does not cause injection site reactions;

        -  can be administered at home by a nurse or a patient;

        -  has an improved pharmacokinetic profile;

        -  demonstrates efficacy comparable to cisplatin and much higher than carboplatin
           (in-vitro; in-vivo data);

        -  exerts an additional immunomodulatory activity.

      This study is an open-label, non-randomised, single-group, multi-centre study with a
      sequential safety design. The study consists of two parts: dose-response part and follow-up
      study.

      Dose-response part: Patients who have completed the first 32-day treatment period with BP-C1
      from Day 1 to Day 32 under Protocol BMC2011-1/Protocol MBC-BPC1/IIB or Protocol BMC2012-4,
      and having a maximum of &quot;moderate&quot; toxicity at the end of treatment are offered to continue
      in the second 32-day treatment period with BP-C1 from Day 33 to Day 64 under protocol
      BMC2011-02. Patients completing 64-day treatment period with BP-C1 will be followed up for 28
      days.

      Follow-up study: After 28-day follow-up period the patients without disease progression and
      without an increase in toxicity are offered to participate in the follow-up study. During the
      follow-up study the patients will be given BP-C1 as long as they obtain benefit from the
      treatment (i.e. until disease progression or increase in toxicity not above &quot;moderate&quot;
      grade).

    <measure>Sum Common Toxicity Criteria score (Sum CTC score)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to Day 64 of treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>Toxicity will be assessed according to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria version 2.0 (CTC v2.0). The CTC v2.0 is divided in 15 toxicity categories (variables); each category is divided by corresponding sub-variables. Each sub-variable is measured on five-point fixed scale from 0 to 4: 0-none, 1-mild, 2-moderate, 3-severe, 4-life-threatening. However, in this trial each sub-variable will be measured on modified fixed scale from 1 to 4: 1-none or mild, 2-moderate, 3-severe, 4-life-threatening. The classification of each toxicity variable will be judged based on the largest observed value for its sub-variables. The Sum CTC score will be calculated by taking the sum of each variable across all categories.</description>

    <measure>Treatment response</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to Day 64 of treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>In accordance with RECIST v1.1 the treatment response will be classified as 'complete response', 'partial response', 'stable disease' or 'progressive disease': Complete response (CR): disappearance of all target lesions. Partial response (PR): at least 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters. Progressive disease (PD): at least 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum might also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions will also be considered progression. Stable disease (SD): neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR, nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.</description>

    <description>Quality of life sub-scores will be obtained by general cancer questionnaire EORTC QLQ-C30. EORTC QLQ-C30 consists of 30 questions generally related to cancer. The questionnaire will be self-administered and will be given in patient's mother tongue. EORTC QLQ-C30 (version 3) is divided in the 3 major scales that will be presented as 15 sub-scores: i) global health status; ii) functional scale (physical functioning, role functioning, emotional functioning, cognitive functioning, social functioning); iii) symptom scale/item(fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain, dyspnoea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhoea, financial difficulties). Range of functional scale is 0-100 (high values are &quot;better&quot;). Range of symptom scale is 0-100 (low values are &quot;better&quot;).</description>

    <description>Quality of life sub-scores will be obtained by specific breast cancer questionnaire EORTC QLQ-BR23. EORTC QLQ-BR-23 consists of 23 questions related to breast cancer. The questionnaire will be self-administered and will be given in patient's mother tongue. EORTC QLQ-BR23 is divided in 2 scales that will be presented as 8 sub-scores: i) functional scale (body image, sexual functioning, sexual enjoyment, future perspective); ii) symptom scale/item (systemic therapy side effect, breast symptom, arm symptom, upset by hair loss). Range of functional scale is 0-100 (high values are &quot;better&quot;). Range of symptom scale is 0-100 (low values are &quot;better&quot;).</description>
