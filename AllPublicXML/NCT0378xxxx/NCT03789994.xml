  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This mixed-method study includes a randomised controlled trial and an exploratory qualitative
      study, and aims to examine the effects of caregiver-delivered affective touch on depressive
      symptoms, state of attachment security, self-esteem, and perceived family harmony among
      stroke survivors, and to explore the mediating effect of attachment security and how an
      intervention may affect depressive symptoms from stroke survivor's perspective. A total of
      184 survivor-caregiver dyads will be recruited from various non-governmental organisations.
      The dyads will be randomly allocated to intervention (IG) and control (CG) groups, stratified
      by the survivor's attachment style. IG caregivers will be taught to deliver a 15-minute
      affective touch intervention to stroke survivors. To address the attention effect, CG
      caregivers will be asked to sit with the survivors during a 15-minute fine motor coordination
      exercise. Both activities, affective touching and fine motor exercise, will be performed for
      12 weeks (3 times/week), and the outcomes mentioned earlier will be measured at baseline, 12
      and 36 weeks after study entry.

    <description>Number of depressive symptoms of stroke survivors will be measured by the Chinese version of the 20-item Centre of Epidemiology Studies Depression Scale, which rates participant's mood on a four-point Likert scale (0 = rarely or none of the time, 3 = almost or all of the time), higher score indicating more severe symptoms.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>State of attachment security of stroke survivors will be measured by the Chinese version of State Adult Attachment Measure (SAAM). The SAAM comprises 21 items and participants will be asked to use a seven-point Likert scale (1 = disagree strongly; 7 = agree strongly) to rate the extent to which they agree with the items assessing state of attachment security, state of attachment avoidance, and state of attachment anxiety.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of state self-esteem of stroke survivors at 3 and 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>State self-esteem of stroke survivors will be measured by the Chinese version of the State Self-esteem Scale (SSES). The SSES comprised 20 items and participants will indicate whether each item is true of themselves at that moment, using a five-point Likert scale (1 = not at all, 5 = extremely). Higher scores indicate greater state self-esteem.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of perceived family harmony of stroke survivors at 3 and 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Perceived family harmony of stroke survivor will be measured by the five-item Chinese version of the Family Harmony Scale (FHS). Participants will indicate whether they agree with the items describing family harmony on a five-point Likert-scale (1 = strongly agree, 5 = strongly disagree), lower scores indicating greater harmony.</description>

    <description>Survivors in the intervention group will receive a total of 36 sessions of a 15-minute affective touch intervention performed by their family caregivers in their homes. Sessions will be scheduled for every alternate weekday (three times a week) for 12 weeks. A trained research nurse (RN) will conduct three 30-minute caregiver training sessions to support the caregivers in delivering the affective touch.
To put caregivers in a more relaxed mood for delivering the intervention, the RN will work with them to identify a time that they feel less burdensome, and teach them to perform deep breathing for relaxation before the affective touching begins. Also, the survivor-caregiver dyad will be asked to sit in a comfortable position and switch off television or radio during the intervention.</description>

    <description>To address the additional attention given by caregivers during affective touch, the control group will be asked to sit beside the survivors when they go through the fine motor exercises which are commonly used for rehabilitation. Caregivers will be instructed to provide only necessary help in preparing the equipment, and to avoid touching or talking to the survivors during the 15-minute exercise session. Two such sessions will be arranged for survivors to master the skills needed, and for caregivers to practise the required level of interaction during the exercise training. Participants will be instructed to do the exercise three times a week (every alternate weekday) over 12 weeks.</description>

    <description>The affective touch comprises of two elements, namely the signal of care, love and acceptance, and stimulation of CT afferent of the skin. Caregivers will be trained to perform light stroking on stroke survivor's forearm while reviewing happy events with the use of photos.</description>
