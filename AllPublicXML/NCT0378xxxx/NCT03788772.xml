  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis is a common life-threatening inflammatory response to infection and is the leading
      cause of death in the intensive care unit. Septic patients exhibit a complex
      immunosuppressive response affecting both innate and adaptive components of immunity, with a
      possible link to nosocomial infections. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms
      resulting in secondary immunosuppression remain poorly understood, but may involve the
      antigen-presenting cells (APC, including dendritic cells and monocytes/macrophages) that link
      innate and adaptive immunity. Furthermore, the increasing phenotypic and functional
      heterogeneity of APC subsets raise the question of their respective role in sepsis. We
      propose to address the pathophysiologal role of APC using systems biology approaches in human
      sepsis.

      The objective is to go from low- to high-resolution analysis of APC subset diversity and
      underlying molecular and functional features in sepsis. The global objective will be reached
      through:

        1. Systematic description and phenotypic analysis of circulating APC subsets in sepsis

        2. Association of APC subsets distribution, phenotype and function with severe sepsis
           physiopathology and relevant clinical outcomes (ICU-acquired infections and death)

        3. High-resolution molecular profiling of circulating APC subsets using population level
           and single cell RNAseq.

      To this aim, the investigator designed a prospective interventional study in order to collect
      blood samples at significant time points in patients with sepsis or septic shock (the
      population of interest) and relevant control subjects, either critically ill patients with
      non-septic acute circulatory failure or age-matched healthy subjects. The study's
      intervention is limited to additional blood samples. The risks and constraints are related to
      additional blood samples (maximum 120mL), which will be performed either from an arterial
      catheter when present in ICU patients, or from a venous puncture for patients without
      arterial catheters and for healthy volunteers.
