  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the effect of daily supplementation of a
      combined orange- and pomegranate extract for a period of 4 weeks on physical fitness compared
      to placebo.

      In this crossover study, participants will daily receive either a placebo or Actiful®, a
      supplement containing 500 mg orange extract and 200 mg pomegranate actives, for 4 weeks
      followed by a wash-out period of 4 to 8 weeks. Subsequently, the second intervention period
      of 4 weeks (active product or placebo) will take place. The product and placebo will be
      supplied in capsules that participants can ingest with a glas of water (daily, prior to
      breakfast).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dietary habits and physical activity are two important components of a healthy lifestyle.
      Targeted nutritional interventions may improve health and stimulate physical activity. Both
      orange extracts and pomegranate concentrate have been shown to exert beneficial effects on
      health and exercise performance. However, the effects of a combination of the two extracts on
      exercise and physical activity have not been investigated yet. It is expected that this
      combination may be an effective dietary way to improve exercise performance, physical
      activity in the free-living state, and quality of life in a middle aged population.
