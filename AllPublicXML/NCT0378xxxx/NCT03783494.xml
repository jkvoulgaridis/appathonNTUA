    <textblock>
      Procedural sedation is an emergency medicine technique that provides a brief, deep sedation
      in order to perform very painful emergency emergent procedures such as displaced fracture or
      dislocated joints reduction. Propofol is recommended for this purpose, injected administered
      in slow IV bolus injections according to the technique known as manual titration. But despite
      this precaution, temporarily excessive sedation can happen, and a side effect can appear
      (arterial hypotension or respiratory depression). Target-controlled infusion (TCI) is an
      anesthesia technique that permits to obtain a precise constant and stable concentration of
      medication, boluses volumes of injection being calculated and delivered automatically by an
      electric syringe equipped with a software obedient to existing pharmacokinetic models. In the
      operating room, Ffor anesthetic induction, maintenance and awakening, respectively, in the
      operating room, the brain concentrations of propofol range respectively from 2 to 6 μg/mL, 2
      to 4 μg/mL, and between 0.8 and 1.2 μg/mL, respectively. Since TCI has never been used in
      emergency departments (ED), the brain propofol concentrations which are necessary for
      sedation and awakening of the patient are not known and must be determined experimentally.

      In this single-center, prospective, interventional study, safety and feasibility of TCI will
      be studied in one ED with the primary objective of determining the brain propofol
      concentrations necessary to reach the an optimal sedation in for patients with indications of
      sustaining very painful orthopedic emergency emergent procedures

      Procedural sedation is an emergency medicine technique that provides a brief, deep sedation
      in order to perform very painful emergency emergent procedures such as displaced fracture or
      dislocated joints reduction. For this purpose, propofol is a remarkable sedative agent for
      its very short elimination half-life, antiemetic property and myorelaxant effects. It is
      recommended to inject administer it in slow IV boluses injections according to the technique
      known as manual titration, but despite this precaution, temporarily excessive sedation can
      happen, and a side effect appear (arterial hypotension or respiratory depression).

      Target-controlled infusion (TCI) is an anesthesia technique that permits to obtain a precise
      constant and stable concentration of medication, boluses volumes of injection being
      calculated and delivered automatically by an electric syringe equipped with a software
      obedient to existing pharmacokinetic models.

      The age, size and weight of the patient are filledentered, then the syringe delivers the
      volume which is necessary and sufficient to reach and maintain the target concentration
      chosen by the practitioner. For anesthetic induction in the operating room, the brain
      concentrations of propofol used range from 2 to 6 μg/mL, then the general anesthesia
      maintenance is obtained with 2 to 4 μg/mL, and the patient awakening usually happens between
      0.8 and 1.2 μg/mL. Since TCI has never been used in emergency departments (ED), the brain
      propofol concentrations which are necessary for sedation and awakening of the patient are not
      known and must be determined experimentally.

      In this single-center, prospective, interventional study, safety and feasibility of TCI will
      be studied in an ED with the primary objective of determining the brain propofol
      concentrations necessary to reach the an optimal sedation in for patients with indications
      ofsustaining very painful orthopedic emergency emergent procedures. As secondary objectives,
      we will study the characteristics of sedations obtained (level, delays, lengths); the Delays,
      lengths and levels of sedation obtained, overall delivered doses of propofol administered;
      the , nature, appearance delays and lengths of potential adverse events (AE) related to
      procedural sedation, particularly complications related to procedural sedation, and necessary
      interventions necessary to handle these AE., will be studied as secondary objectives
