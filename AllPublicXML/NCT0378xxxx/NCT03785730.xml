  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this randomized clinical trial is to evaluate the efficacy of composite
      resin (CR) restorations compared to ultraconservative (UTC) treatment for proximal anterior
      teeth cavitated caries lesions, as well as the impact of these treatments on the
      cost-effectiveness of procedures, the discomfort of the patient in relation to the different
      techniques and in the perception of parents / guardians regarding the treatments received.
      Children aged 3 to 6 years will be randomly selected from the Clinical Center for Pediatric
      Dentistry at UNIB, at the Clinic of Infants and Pediatric Dentistry at Santa Cec√≠lia
      University and at Pediatric Dentistry Clinic at UNINOVAFAPI University Center. 196 teeth will
      be randomized into two experimental groups: (1) Selective removal of carious tissue and
      restoration with composite resin (RC) and (2) Ultraconservative treatment by means of cavity
      enlargement using metal sandpaper (UTC). The primary outcome will be the survival of the
      tooth that will be evaluated after 6, 12, 18 and 24 months by two trained and blinded
      examiners for the treatments performed. The duration of the treatments and the cost of the
      materials used will be considered for the estimation of the cost-effectiveness of each
      treatment. The discomfort reported by the participant will be measured after each procedure
      using the FIS scale. Parents perception will be evaluated through questionnaire. For the
      primary outcome, Kaplan-Meier survival and Cox regression with shared frailty will be used
      for comparison between groups. For all analyzes, the significance value will be adjusted to
      5%.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled, two-arms parallel-group (1:1) trial. Initially, it will be
      submitted to the Research Ethics Committee of the Ibirapuera University - UNIB. The other
      centers involved will be considered as co-participants (Santa Cecilia University - UNISANTA
      and Uninovafapi University Center - UNINOVAFAPI). Only those patients who meet the
      eligibility criteria will be included in the study after signing the Informed Consent Form by
      the parents and the child's assent to study participation.

      In order to carry out the sample calculation, the expected survival for the primary teeth
      with cavitated lesions on the proximal surface submitted to ultraconservative treatments is
      89.7% after a period of 24 months (Mijan et al., 2014). Thus, a clinically significant
      difference is expected to be 20% in the success rate between the groups. With this, adopting
      a level of significance of 0.05 and a power of 0.80, we reached the number of 136 patients.
      Since each child can contribute more than one tooth, 20% was added to that value (cluster per
      child), and 20% due to a possible sample loss. Thus, the final rounded number of 98 teeth per
      group resulted in 196 teeth in total (MedCalc version 15.8, Ostend, BE).

    <description>Parents perception of the treatments will be evaluated through a questionnaire - &quot;Child's and parent's questionnaire about teeth appearance&quot; - with possible answers varying from very satisfied until insatisfied. After the questionnaire is applied for the parents/guardians, the anwsers will bem transformed in scores 1 to 5, in according the original paper that validated the questionnaire. Higher scores mean a worse perception.</description>
