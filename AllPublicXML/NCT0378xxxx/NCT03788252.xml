    <textblock>
      This study is to assess the effect of 48 weeks administration of Renamezin capsule on
      prevention of sarcopenia in pre-dialysis patients with chronic kidney disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Skeletal muscle atrophy, referred to as sarcopenia, and impaired physical performance are
      accompanied in chronic kidney disease patients during disease progression. Decreased physical
      performance derived from sarcopenia precipitates poor prognostic influence in the clinical
      outcome, as reported in previous studies showing correlations between poor physical
      performance, poor quality of life, poor renal prognosis, and mortality. Therefore,
      maintaining physical performance is mandatory to improve the prognosis of chronic kidney
      disease patients.

      AST-120 is an oral absorbent capsule designed to remove circulating indoxyl sulfate, a uremic
      toxin. As indoxyl sulfate is reported to cause mitochondrial dysfunction in skeletal muscle,
      AST-120 contributes to the recovery of mitochondrial function by reducing indoxyl sulfate. In
      addition, AST-120 is reported to delay the initiation of dialysis and the decrease of
      glomerular filtration rate and the increase of serum creatinine level. However, the effect of
      AST-120 on sarcopenia in pre-dialysis patients have not been reported. This study is to
      investigate the effect of AST-120 on sarcopenia prevention in pre-dialysis chronic kidney
      disease patients.

    <description>Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is assessed via KDQOL-SF 1.3. KDQOL-SF 1.3 is validated questionnaires to assess HRQOL. HRQOL consists of three subscales; physical health, mental health, and kidney disease health. The summation of subscales ranges between 0 - 100, and the higher values indicate the better HRQOL status.</description>

    <measure>Charlson Co-morbidity Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 24 week, 48 week</time_frame>
    <description>Charlson Co-morbidity Index is used to assess underlying co-morbidity of each patient. Each comorbidity category has an associated weight (from 1 to 6), based on the adjusted risk of mortality or resource use, and the sum of all the weights results in a single comorbidity score for a patient. A score of zero indicates that no comorbidities were found. The higher the score, the more likely the predicted outcome will result in mortality or higher resource use. Age weighting is added to total comorbidity score in a score of zero to four.</description>
