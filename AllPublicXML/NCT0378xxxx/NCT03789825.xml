      Study to assess the prevalence of significant liver fibrosis in general population using
      Transient Elastography
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a population-based study. Subjects will attend a primary care center where a physical
      examination, general blood test and transient elastography will be carried out. Only the
      group of patients with high-risk for liver fibrosis will be evaluated in a second visit at
      the University Hospital.
