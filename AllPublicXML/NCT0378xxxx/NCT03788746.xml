  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the prevalence of pre-treatment tumor tissue PD-L1
      expression in patients diagnosed with advanced urothelial carcinoma.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Advanced urothelial carcinoma (UC) (locally advanced/unresectable or metastatic UC) is a
      fatal disease with 5-year survival rate of 5%. The most frequently studied diagnostic for
      advanced UC is the programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) protein expression in tumor tissue. A
      better understanding of PD-L1 expression in a &quot;real world&quot; setting could help understand its
      clinical utility in the management and decision making in advanced UC and clinical trial
      design.

    <description>1L advanced UC treatment patterns (such as regimen/agents used, start (first dose) and stop (last dose) dates, reasons for cis/carboplatin ineligibility) will be collected.
Objective Response: complete or partial response based on healthcare provider (HCP) assessment; Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria highly recommended Progression: evidence malignancy has become worse or spreads in the body (based on HCP assessment).
Objective response and survival endpoints (overall, stratified by PD-L1 expression [high vs. low] including the following: ORR: The proportion of patients with a complete or partial response based on HCP assessment; PFS: The time from the start of 1L advanced UC treatment until progression or death (any cause); and OS: The time from start of 1L advanced UC treatment until death (any cause)</description>

    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>bTMB levels will be summarized among the subset of patients with blood available for testing using the chosen assay who are newly diagnosed with advanced UC and have yet to start 1L treatment. Results for TMB can range from 0 (non-shedder) to very high values &gt;50 mut/Mb (no maximum has been determined). The results for pre-treatment bTMB will be presented by PD-L1 results (high vs low).</description>

    <measure>To assess changes in ctDNA levels (variant allele fractions [VAFs]) at 3 points of sample testing: (1) Before starting 1L treatment (pre-treatment) (2) before initiating treatment on day 1 of cycle 3, and (3) at the time of progression (if applicable)</measure>
    <time_frame>60 months</time_frame>
    <description>ctDNA levels will be summarized among the subset of patients with blood available for testing using the chosen assay who are newly diagnosed with advanced UC and have yet to start 1L treatment. VAF is the relative frequency of alleles at a particular locus in a population, expressed as a percentage, ranging from 0.3% to 100%. Changes in ctDNA levels at 3 points of sample testing will be assessed.</description>

    <description>bTMB levels will be summarized among the subset of patients with blood available for testing using the chosen assay who are newly diagnosed with advanced UC and have yet to start 1L treatment. Assay results for pre-treatment tTMB will be assessed by pre-treatment bTMB results.</description>

    <description>bTMB and ctDNA levels will be summarized among the subset of patients with blood available for testing using the chosen assay who are newly diagnosed with advanced UC and have yet to start 1L treatment. Objective response, PFS, and OS (defined in secondary outcome measures) will be assessed by the following: changes to ctDNA levels (VAFs) at 3 timepoints (defined above); and pre-treatment tTMB assay results compared with pre-treatment bTMB assay results.</description>
