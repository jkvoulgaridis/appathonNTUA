  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This observational prospective monosite study aims to describe, for the first time,
      management in a hospital-at-home programme of patients treated by immunotherapy for bronchial
      cancer.

      The feasibility in good conditions of this management, the patients' quality of life and
      their satisfaction will be evaluated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Those last years, immunotherapy treatment for bronchial cancers allowed considerable progress
      in terms of tumoral answer, survival without progression and global survival. Usually
      administered in the day hospitalization department, its preparation and administration to the
      patient are compatible with hospital-at-home management. Currently, this offer of care is
      rarely proposed, and only in particular situations. At the Hospital of Pau, it was introduced
      recently. It is proposed to patients who have been receiving immunotherapy for at least 4
      months. At the moment, there is no study stating the feasibility of home hospitalization for
      patients treated by immunotherapy. Given that there is neither regulatory obstacle nor any
      contraindication to care in home hospitalization, the choice of a descriptive study stands
      out.

      This study will be proposed to all the patients for whom home hospitalization has been
      decided and scheduled by the healthcare team in a medical staff meeting.

      The patients included in the study will be followed according to the common practice: a
      consultation every 3 months during 1 year.
