  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Proximal humeral fractures are common especially in the elderly population. The majority of
      these fractures are minimally displaced and may be treated non-operatively. There is however
      a controversy about which fractures that need surgery and randomised trials have not been
      able to show a clinically important advantage in patient reported outcome measures for those
      operated. The trend is therefore that also displaced and comminute fractures are treated
      non-operatively. There is however very little scientific support for how the non-operative
      treatment should be designed and performed. Therefore this prospective multicenter study is
      aiming at investigating the benefit of a four week immobilisation orthosis as compared to
      early range of motion exercises for those patients not assigned for surgery one week after
      the trauma.
