  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates the sensory profile of people suffering from whiplash associated
      disorders (WAD) during rehabilitation.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Altered pain sensitivity is commonly reported in WAD populations when compared to a healthy
      control group but how/if this changes over time during rehabilitation is unclear. This study
      investigates the effect of 2 weeks rehabilitation protocol on pain sensitivity in a group
      suffering from WAD compared to a healthy control group.

    <measure>Changes in Pressure Pain Thresholds</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 2 weeks, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in pressure pain thresholds will be determined with pressure algometry bilaterally over the neck and leg. PPT is defined as the exact time point where the pressure is first being perceived at painful.</description>

    <measure>Changes in Conditioned Pain Modulation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 2 weeks, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in condition pain modulation (CPM) will be measures by recording PPT bilaterally over the neck and leg prior to and following a painful stimuli (a pressure cuff is inflated around the upper arm to create the conditioned stimulus). CPM value is calculated by subtracting raw PPT (without painful stimuli) from PPT under the conditioned stimulus.</description>

    <measure>Neck Disability Index (NDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 2 weeks, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>A validated and reliable questionnaire that estimates the impact of neck pain on normal daily activities (self-rated disability). NDI consists of 10 dimensions that all are score from 0-5 giving a maximum score of 50. The overall score indicates the level of disability. Below 5 = no disability whereas increased scores indicates increased levels of disability.</description>
