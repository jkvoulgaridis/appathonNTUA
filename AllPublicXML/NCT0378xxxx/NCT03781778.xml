  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II pilot trial studies the effect of the consumption of foods made with resistant
      starch compared to foods made with corn starch on biomarkers that may be related to
      colorectal cancer progression in stage I-III colorectal cancer survivors. Foods made with
      resistant starch may beneficially influence markers of inflammation, insulin resistance, and
      the composition of gut bacteria in colorectal cancer survivors.

      Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I (ACTIVE GROUP): Participants eat a diet consisting of resistant starch foods daily
      for 8 weeks. Study foods are in addition to their own usual daily diet.

      GROUP II (CONTROL GROUP): Participants eat a diet consisting of regular corn starch foods
      daily for 8 weeks. Study foods are in addition to their own usual daily diet.
