  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Fecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT) product PRIM-DJ2727 is prepared from human stool
      from a healthy, screened donor.

      Requestors will contact the study team about the product (PRIM-DJ2727) by email, visit, or
      phone call. A screening list for donors will be provided to make sure that the list fits the
      requestor's requirements. A basic fee will be requested to recover the cost of making the
      product. After an agreement is made, a contract will be signed between the 2 parties. A week
      before the treatment, requestors will contact the study team for possible FMT product
      delivery. Delivery method will be confirmed for delivery by personnel (within 10 minutes
      driving distance) or by using FedEx services. Each delivered product will have an approved
      delivery form signed and dated by both the person who prepared the delivery and the person
      who received the package.
