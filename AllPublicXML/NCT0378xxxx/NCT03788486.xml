      This study will test the efficacy and safety of application of LED light to meibomian glands
      in upper and lower eyelids in eyes of patients suffering with meibomian gland disease.

      The primary objective of the study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of blue LED
      light with meibomian gland expression of the upper and lower eyelids in dry eye disease by
      change from baseline in subjective questionnaire and by measurement of non-invasive tear
      break up time.

      Primary Endpoint: Improvement of tear break up time over the length of the study

      Secondary endpoint: subjective patient comfort over the length of the study using a validated
      dry eye comfort questionnaire administered at each study visit, VAS, 0= no pain and 100 =
      maximal discomfort, Improvement in the number of corneal SPK that stain with fluorescein.

      20 study subjects 18-85 will be enrolled with male or female in the Nashville and Memphis, TN
      areas who are generally healthy but have signs and symptoms of dry eye disease with Meibomian
      gland dysfunction.
