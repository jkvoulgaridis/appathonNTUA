  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To examine the effect of changing levels of support during NAVA-ventilation (&quot;NAVA-level&quot;) on
      electrical diaphragm activity of the newborn on invasive or non-invasive NAVA ventilation.

      The aim is to explore whether a so-called 'breakpoint', as defined in previous studies on
      NAVA ventilation in adults and children(1, 9), can be determined in newborn infants.
      Knowledge of this breakpoint will be used to optimise the settings of NAVA level at
      initiation of invasive or non-invasive NAVA ventilation.

      This is an explorative study conducted in preparation of a randomized controlled trial that
      is planned in the near future to compare the effects of non-invasive NAVA with nasal
      continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in newborn infants.

    <description>A titration protocol will be used for changing NAVA levels. The NAVA level will be reduced to 0,5 cmH2O/µV for 3 minutes as a starting point. Limit peak pressure will be set to 35cmH2O (i.e. according to the standard manufacturer's settings) the maximum pressure that can be delivered to the patient is cut off at 30cmH2O). Other ventilator settings will be left unchanged and are as clinically indicated. Ventilator settings will be according to our standard of care and as following: PEEP between 4 and 7 mmHg, apnea time 2-5 sec, back-up ventilation with a pressure above PEEP between 5 and 15 mmHg and a frequency between 30 and 50 per minute.
Starting from a NAVA level of 0,5 cmH20/µV the level will be increased by 0,5 cmH2O/µV every 3 minutes until reaching a maximum NAVA level of 4,0 cmH2O/µV.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Newborns admitted to the NICU in need for respiratory support and put on invasive or
             non-invasive NAVA by the attending physician. Patients will be included when they are
             clinically stable and within 24h after starting NAVA or nivNAVA.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  - Congenital malformations of the diaphragm or respiratory system, including
             congenital diaphragmatic hernia.

          -  Patients with abnormalities of the upper airway (e.g. vocal cord paralysis,
             post-extubation laryngeal edema, Pierre-Robin sequence…).

          -  More than 20% of time spent in back-up ventilationWhen a patient on NAVA ventilation
             is apneic for a certain period of time (apnea time), the ventilator switches tot
             backup-ventilation. Backup-ventilation is pressure controlled, the apnea time can
             variate between 2 and 10 seconds.

          -  Clinically unstable patients:

          -  hemodynamic instability as defined by need of inotropic support or

          -  rapid respiratory deterioration on NAVA ventilation.

          -  No informed consent.
