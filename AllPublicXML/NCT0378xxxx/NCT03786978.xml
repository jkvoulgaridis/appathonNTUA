  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with the frequent use of polypharmacy at different times
      of administration and requires special attention from the patient or caregivers in order to
      properly treatment performed. The degree of Functional Literacy in Health is defined as the
      ability to apply literacy skills to health-related materials, including prescriptions,
      package inserts, and home care instructions. Several questionnaires are used in research and
      clinical practice to assess the pronunciation and understanding of commonly used medical
      terms, as the SAHLPA-18 (Short Assessment of Health Literacy for Portuguese Speaking Adults).
      The Brief Medication Questionnaire (BMQ) evaluates adherence to medication use from a
      patient's perspective.

      During the basal visit, after the characterization of the sample (n= 100), inpatients from
      Hospital de Cl√≠nicas de Porto Alegre (HCPA) were randomized to interventional or comparator
      group. The interventional group was follow up during a year after basal discharge. Comparator
      group received only a phone call, 30 days after the basal discharge, to question how was
      their healthy status. Readmission rates were evaluated for both groups. Also, a economic
      evaluation was made to measure the readmission rates in terms of costs.

      The first outcome of the clinical study was to measure the readmission rate through a
      structured pharmaceutical care model after basal hospital discharge and measure the effect of
      this intervention in terms of readmission reduction in a short term period of 30 days,
      regardless of the hospitalization reason.

      As secondary outcomes the investigators measured the readmission rates after basal hospital
      discharge and the effect of the intervention in terms of readmission reduction in 60, 90,180
      and 365 days after basal hospital discharge. Also, the readmission costs in terms of
      cost-effectiveness were evaluate.

      The sample consisted of 100 patients with DM associated with other comorbidities,
      hospitalized for any reason in the HCPA, of both sexes, older than 18 years.

      Informed consent, demographic and validated questionnaires data were collected in the basal
      visit. After that, patients were randomized to:

      Group 1: comparator; Group 2: structured pharmaceutical intervention.

      Seven days after basal hospital discharge, drugs adherence was verified.

      The interventional group received pharmaceutical care at basal hospitalization stay, after
      randomization, have their prescription reviewed until 7 days after discharge of basal
      hospitalization and also received structured phone calls and mobile SMS (Short Message
      Service) during one year follow up (30, 60, 180 and 365 days).

      Electronic medical records of the included patients (intervention and comparator groups) were
      reviewed monthly for 12 months, aiming to identify access to emergency services or hospital
      readmissions at the HCPA and, consequently, the reasons for readmissions and outcomes.
