  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to look at how the study medicine behaves in the participant's body
      and how it is removed from the participant's body. The study compares Japanese and Caucasian
      people who are normal weight, overweight or with obesity. The participants will either get
      NNC0174-0833 (a potential new medicine) or placebo (a &quot;dummy&quot; medicine similar to the study
      medicine but without active ingredients) - which treatment any participant gets is decided by
      chance. Participants will get 1 injection by a study nurse at the clinic. The injection will
      be with a needle in a skin fold in the participant's stomach area. The study will last for
      about 4 months, but duration of participation for any participant will last up to about 2
      months. The participants will have 8 clinic visits with the study staff.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male, aged 18-55 years (both inclusive) at the time of signing informed consent.

             descent.

             Overweight should be due to excess adipose tissue, as judged by the investigator.

          -  Body weight between 60 and 110 kg (both inclusive) at screening

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Male subject who is not surgically sterilised (vasectomy) and is sexually active (with
             female partner[s] of childbearing potential), who is not using a highly effective
             method of contraception (such as condom with spermicide) combined with a highly
             effective method of contraception for their non-pregnant female partner(s) (Pearl
             Index less than 1%), or intend to donate sperm in the period from screening until 3
             months following administration of the investigational medical product.

          -  Any disorder which in the investigator's opinion might jeopardise subject's safety or
             compliance with the protocol.
