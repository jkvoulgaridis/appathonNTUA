  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of a new product that uses human gene
      transfer (called hMaxi-K) when it is given to patients with overactive bladder. Human gene
      transfer is a new type of therapy that is the process of placing genetic material (DNA or
      RNA) into a person. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate safety parameters
      occurring subsequent to administration of a single intravesical instillation of study drug.

      Two different dose groups of hMaxi-K will be tested in this study: 5000 and 10000 micrograms.
      A 15000 microgram group was planned; however, the study was terminated before participants
      were dosed. hMaxi-K will be given as a single administration into the bladder through a
      catheter. Each women's participation in the study will last for up to 24 weeks (followed by
      an additional 18-month follow-up period).

      The safety parameters to be monitored include: adverse events, clinical laboratory tests,
      electrocardiograms, and physical examinations.

      The secondary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of a single intravesical instillation of
      hMaxi-K compared to the control group. Efficacy parameters that will be evaluated are: mean
      number of micturitions per 24 hours, mean number of urge incontinence episodes per 24 hours,
      mean number of urgency episodes per 24 hours, overall maximum bladder capacity, number of
      uninhibited contractions during the cystometry procedure, participant rating of urgency
      score, participant rating of perceived bladder condition severity, participant assessment of
      response to treatment, participant rating of Quality of Life (Kings Health Questionnaire),
      SF-12 Health Survey, International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire (ICIQ-SF), and
      pad weight measurement of accidental bladder leaks.

                  week.

          -  Non-response or poor tolerance to previous treatment for symptoms of overactive
             bladder and do not wish to continue with that treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A woman with a positive serum (HCG) pregnancy test or who is lactating

          -  History of three or more culture-documented recurrent urinary tract infections per
             year

          -  Current history or previous diagnosis of painful bladder syndrome (interstitial
             cystitis) with pain in the region of the pelvis, perineum, or lower abdomen relieved
             by voiding

          -  Current history of neurological bladder dysfunction

          -  A life expectancy of less than 12 months

          -  Current history of Grade 2 or greater cystocele

          -  Uncontrolled diabetes

          -  Latex allergy

          -  Stress urinary incontinence as determined by observation of the participant coughing
             while standing with a full bladder and/or response of 2 or 3 on the following Stress
             Urinary Incontinence question: Do you experience leakage when laughing, coughing,
             lifting heavy objects or other types of discreet, moderately intense activities?
             0=NONE: No leakage. 1=MILD: Minimal leakage on rare occasions during these types of
             activities; easily tolerated; do not use pads for this. 2=MODERATE: Enough leakage
             that it requires occasional use of pads and may interfere with usual activity and
             tasks. 3=SEVERE: Extreme leakage and discomfort that stops all activity and tasks and
             requires the use of pads on all occasions
