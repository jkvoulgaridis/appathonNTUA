  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will seek to determine whether non-invasive measures of endothelial function have
      utility as surrogate markers of cardiovascular risk in patients with peripheral arterial
      disease undergoing vascular surgery. Measurements of endothelial function will be made before
      and after initiation of atorvastatin, ascorbic acid, or placebo therapy during the
      pre-operative period. We will then examine cardiovascular events following surgery. We
      hypothesize that patients who have no improvement in endothelial function will have increased
      cardiovascular risk compared to patients with improvement in endothelial function.

      Part 1 of the study will involve only patients with PAD who are undergoing non-cardiac
      surgery and is an intervention study. Part 2 will involve patients with PAD who have
      participated in Part 1 and patients with PAD who are not undergoing surgery. This part of the
      study does not involve an intervention.

      The protocol for patients undergoing surgery is as follows: Part 1. Intervention study with
      follow-up for 30 days after surgery. Patients with planned surgery will be enrolled. We will
      test endothelial function at baseline using ultrasound and tonometry. They will then be
      randomzied to one of three groups: Atorvastatin 80 mg/d, Vitamin C 500 mg/d, or placebo.
      Subjects already on a statin medication at the time of enrollment will receive 40 mg/d of
      atorvastatin. Patients taking high dose statin (&gt;40 mg/day) will be randomized to received
      vitamin C or placebo, and will not be eligible to receive any additional statin as part of
      the study. In the week immediately prior to surgery, we will test endothelial function a
      second time. They will then be followed for 30 days beginning with the day of surgery for
      cardiovascular events. Part 1 of the study involves 4 visits as follows: Visit 1 at
      enrollment will take place within 7-30 days of non-emergent vascular surgery and will last
      approximately 60 minutes Visit 2 will take place within approximately 1 week of surgery and
      will last approximately 30-40 minutes Visit 3 will occur on the 1st post-operative day and
      will last approximately 10-15 minutes Visit 4 will take place only if the subject is still an
      in-patient. It will take approximately 10-15 minutes Telephone contact will occur at 30 days
      post surgery and every six months thereafter for two years. The duration of telephone
      follow-up is expected to be approximately 5-10 minutes. Part 2 (long term follow-up):
      Patients who have completed Part 1 will be continued on in Part 2 of the study. Part 2
      involves two year follow-up with no study medication. Telephone contact will be made every 6
      months. subjects will make a visit to our research unit one year after the initial visit for
      physical examination, and if applicable, an ultrasound study of their bypass grafts.

      The protocol for patients with PAD who are not undergoing surgery is as follows. These
      patients will participate in Part 2 of the study only (long-term follow-up with no
      intervention). Visit 1: will last approximately 60 minutes and involve measurement of
      endothelial function by ultrasound and tonometry. We will contact the subject every 6 months
      by telephone (5-10 minutes) for two years to determine whether a cardiovascular event has
      occurred. Visit 2 will occur at 1 year post enrollment and will last approximately 20-30
      minutes. If the subject has had peripheral bypass surgery, we will perform an ultrasound
      study to determine graft blood flow.

    <description>Change in flow mediated dilation with treatment: FMD visit 2 - FMD visit 1 FMD is measured by using vascular ultrasound to determine the baseline diameter of the brachial artery. Endothelium-dependent vasodilation is induced by 5-minute arterial occlusion with a blood pressure cuff. When the cuff is released, the resultant increase in blood flow (reactive hyperemia) stimulates vasodilation of the brachial artery. This flow-mediated dilation (FMD) is expressed as the percent change from baseline. Healthy individuals typical dysplay a 10 to 12% dilation. Individuals with PAD had markedly impaired dilation of 6-7. The currernt study sought to determine whether a change in FMD would occur following intervention.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male and female subjects age 21-99 years old.

          2. Peripheral Arterial Disease. PAD is defined clinically and by angiography, magnetic
             resonance imaging, vascular ultrasound, or ankle brachial index less than 0.9.

          3. Able to provide informed consent and complete the study procedure.

          4. Patients undergoing non-emergent vascular surgery (peripheral arterial bypass,
             abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, carotid endarterectomy, or limb amputation) or other
             non-cardiac surgery.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Emergent or urgent surgery that must be performed sooner than one week after
             enrollment

          2. Unstable angina, myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary revascularization, or
             decompensated heart failure within 1 month of enrollment. Patients who require cardiac
             catheterization and surgical or percutaneous coronary revascularization prior to
             vascular surgery will be excluded.

          3. Clinically evident major illness of other organ systems, including cancer, end-stage
             renal disease, hepatic failure, or other conditions that make participation
             inappropriate.

          4. Women who are lactating, pregnant, or of childbearing potential and not using a
             reliable contraceptive method. Pregnancy will be excluded by a urine pregnancy test.

          5. Patients with liver function tests or serum creatine kinase &gt;3 times the upper limit
             of normal.

          6. Patients who have received an investigational drug within 30 days of enrollment.

          7. Patients or subjects with a history of a psychological illness or condition such as to
             interfere with the subject's ability to understand the requirements of the study.

          8. Known occlusive atherosclerosis of the subclavian artery or upper extremity, because
             such disease will interfere with induction of reactive hyperemia during the brachial
             artery ultrasound studies.

          9. Patients will be excluded if they are taking vitamin C in a dose greater than 2 times
             the Recommended Daily Allowance (&gt;120 mg/day) within 1 month of enrollment.

        <title>Change in FMD</title>
        <description>Change in flow mediated dilation with treatment: FMD visit 2 - FMD visit 1 FMD is measured by using vascular ultrasound to determine the baseline diameter of the brachial artery. Endothelium-dependent vasodilation is induced by 5-minute arterial occlusion with a blood pressure cuff. When the cuff is released, the resultant increase in blood flow (reactive hyperemia) stimulates vasodilation of the brachial artery. This flow-mediated dilation (FMD) is expressed as the percent change from baseline. Healthy individuals typical dysplay a 10 to 12% dilation. Individuals with PAD had markedly impaired dilation of 6-7. The currernt study sought to determine whether a change in FMD would occur following intervention.</description>
