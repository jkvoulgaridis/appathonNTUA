    <measure>Visual Analogue Scale of pain</measure>
    <time_frame>This numeric measure is assed and recorded pre and post intervention at each of the study protocols bi-weekly interventions over (4) weeks, for a maximum of (8) sessions and a total of (16) measurements per individual patient.</time_frame>
    <description>This scale is used to asses change in pain intensity between pre and post intervention measures and change against established baseline measures. Patients are asked to rate their pain by choosing a number along a horizontal line of fixed length (100mm). The number scale ranges from 0-10, with 0 representing 'no pain' and 10 being 'worst pain possible'.</description>
