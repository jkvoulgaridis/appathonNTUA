      The MAC-HAPLO-MUD trial is a randomized prospective phase III trial comparing HLA 10/10
      matched unrelated donor and haploidentical allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
      after myeloablative conditioning regimen in patients, age 15 years or older, with Acute
      Myeloid Leukemia (AML) or Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) or Myeloproliferative Syndrome
      (SMP) or Myelodysplastic Syndromes (SMD) and requiring allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
      transplantation. Primary endpoint is the 1-year progression free survival without acute grade
      II-IV GvHD and without moderate and severe chronic GvHD.

    <textblock>
      An unrelated adult donor who is HLA-matched to the recipient at the allele-level (at HLA-A,
      -B, -C, -DQB1 and -DRB1) is considered the best choice in the absence of an HLA-matched
      sibling for patients needing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT).

      However, using matched unrelated donors (MUD) is limited by (1) a prolonged time to identify
      and schedule donation for some MUD allowing some patients to relapse before transplantation
      can be performed, and (2) limited availability of fully HLA-MUD for the non-Caucasian
      population.

      Alternative donors are used for transplantation in patients without a fully-MUD including
      single HLA mismatched unrelated donor, unrelated umbilical cord blood and grafts from
      haploidentical related donors but are associated with higher non-relapse mortality and
      delayed immune reconstitution.

      A more recent strategy for haploidentical (haplo) related donor SCT (haplo-SCT) has improved
      dramatically outcomes using T-cell replete grafts with administration of post-transplantation
      cyclophosphamide (PTCy).

      From retrospective studies, haplo-SCT with PTCy are associated with similar overall and
      progression-free survivals as with MUD stem cell transplantation (MUD-SCT), but with lower
      rates of toxicity and graft versus host disease (GvHD), and thus potentially better results
      than MUD-SCT after reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimen. Haplo-SCT with PTCy is thus
      highly discussed nowadays motivating prospective trials to confirm the benefit of this
      procedure.

      In the setting of a myeloablative conditioning (MAC) regimen in adults with high risk
      hematological malignancies, few retrospective non-controlled registry studies recently
      suggest that outcomes after haplo-SCT using PTCy approach might also be superior in terms of
      GVHD free survival to that after MUD stem cell transplantation (MUD-SCT).

      The investigators propose to address this question, in a randomized prospective phase III
      clinical trial comparing HLA 10/10 MUD and haplo-SCT after MAC regimen. The stem cell source
      will be bone marrow for haploidentical SCT and peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) for
      HLA-matched unrelated transplantation.

      The primary endpoint is the 1-year progression free survival without acute grade II-IV GvHD
      and without moderate and severe chronic GvHD.

-Relapse evaluation:
For myeloid malignancies, the relapse will be defined by the reappearance of leukemic cells after SCT.
For ALL, the relapse will be defined by: the reappearance of leukemic cells after SCT and/or an increase of at least 50 % of the smallest measure of any lymphnode considered abnormal in the pre-transplantation period for patients in partial response and in non-responders and/or the appearance of any new lesion in comparison with the pre-transplantation period evaluation.
- GvHD evaluation:
Grading of acute GVHD will be performed according to the classification of Glusckberg.
Grading of chronic GVHD will be performed according to the NIH classification.</description>

    <description>Severity of veno-occlusive disease. VOD severity will be assessed using new EBMT criteria (Mohty et al., 2016). EBMT criteria for grading VOD severity in adult patients are based on the level of bilirubin and its rate of change, liver function (transaminase), weight increase, renal function and the kinetic of their onset (Mohty et al., 2016). This grading system is divided into five categories as following: mild, moderate; severe, very severe; and death.

Each of the multi-item scales includes a different set of items - no item occurs in more than one scale. All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level. A high score for a functional scale represents a high/healthy level of functioning. A high score for the global health status/ QoL represents a high QoL and a high score for a symptom scale/item represents a high level of symptomatology/problems.
