  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ID-Cap System is classified as an ingestion event marker (IEM), a Class II medical
      device. The system is intended to record time-stamped ingestions with the ingestible sensor,
      ID-Tag which transmits a signal to a wearable device, the ID-Cap Reader. In this study, 12-18
      subjects will ingest capsules containing ingestible sensors while wearing the Reader and
      being observed in a clinic setting.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Enrollment will be stratified to include at least two study participants in each BMI-Gender
        category. The BMI-Gender categories will be: Normal/Underweight (BMI&lt;25), Overweight (BMI
        25.0 to &lt;30), and Obese (BMI&gt;30.0); and Male/Female.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men and women 18 years of age or older.

          -  For females of childbearing potential, negative urine pregnancy test at time of entry
             and assurance that a medically-accepted means of contraception will be used for the
             duration of the study.

          -  Able and willing to provide informed consent.

          -  Willing to adhere to all protocol requirements and study procedures.

          -  Adequate organ function at screening.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Unable to take oral medications.

          -  Women who are pregnant, breast-feeding, or plan to become pregnant during the study,
             and females of childbearing potential who are not using a medically-accepted means of
             contraception.

          -  Medical condition which may affect passage through the gastrointestinal tract
             (including, but not limited to, small bowel tumors, symptomatic intestinal adhesions,
             symptomatic active ulcerations, and radiation enteritis).

          -  Known hypersensitivity to any component of the ingestible ID-Capsule (including, but
             not limited to, gelatin, polyimide, magnesium, or silver).

          -  Significant medical condition, psychiatric condition, current alcohol or drug abuse,
             or other condition which may preclude the study participant from being able to follow
             study procedures or to safely participate in the opinion of the investigator.

          -  Participation in an investigational product study (e.g., medical device or drug study)
             within 30 days prior to screening, or prior participation in an Ingestion Event Marker
             study.

          -  Presence of an active implantable electronic medical device.

          -  Positive screen for drugs of abuse (detection of drug for which a valid prescription
             exists is not exclusionary).

          -  Any laboratory test result deemed clinical significant by the Investigator.
