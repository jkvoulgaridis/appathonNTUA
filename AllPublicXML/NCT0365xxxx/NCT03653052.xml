  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with cancer are increasingly being treated with drugs designed to modulate the
      response of their immune system, broadly to boost their body's defences against cancer.
      However, there is an unmet need to identify which patients are unlikely to benefit. Deciding
      on benefit from therapy uses standard imaging methods (e.g. CT scans), which can take time
      (months) whereas DNA in the bloodstream could be measured more rapidly.

      The main aim of this study is to assess whether changes in the level of circulating tumour
      DNA (ctDNA) can quickly determine a patients response. This would enable patients to change
      therapies more quickly if they are not responding and reduce exposure to unnecessary side
      effects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Measuring circulating (plasma) tumour DNA has been described as a 'liquid biopsy' able to
      study a tumour without invasive biopsy. By measuring ctDNA at different time points the
      investigators can detect tumour changes that indicate if the patient is responding to
      treatment or not.

      This trial has been designed as a prospective, open label, non-randomised trial where patient
      with advanced oesophageal cancer will be treated with MEDI4736 (durvalumab), a drug designed
      to alter the immune system response. Samples will be taken to regularly to measure ctDNA
      levels and compared to patients response at 6 months when undergoing standard CT scans.

      The study will run at a single centre (Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge). Nineteen,
      evaluable, patients will receive durvalumab until progression while detailed studies will
      assess their tumour and immune response.
