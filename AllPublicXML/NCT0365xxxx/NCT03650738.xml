      This study was a prospective, one-arm open phase II clinical trial. A systematic review of
      the pCR of apatinib in combination with the albumin paclitaxel and carboplatin regimens for
      the neoadjuvant therapy of triple-negative breast cancer, as well as the safety of treatment,
      at the same time, relevant exploratory biomarker research is conducted.

      Neoadjuvant program: apatinib 250mg oral d1-21; albumin paclitaxel 260mg/m2 intravenous drip
      d1; carboplatin AUC=5-6 intravenous drip d1; 21 days for 1 cycle. The treatment regimen was
      used for a total of 6 cycles, or to PD, or the toxicity was not tolerated. If there is still
      no PD after 6 cycles, the surgical approach is based on the tumor condition and the patient's
      wishes. If the condition progresses to terminate the treatment regimen, the patient may
      receive subsequent local or systemic treatment. The follow-up period was followed up to
      assess safety and effectiveness.

      MAIN OBJECTIVE: To systematically evaluate the pCR rate of apatinib combined with albumin
      paclitaxel and carboplatin regimen for neoadjuvant therapy of triple-negative breast cancer
      Secondary objective: To evaluate the safety of apatinib combined with albumin paclitaxel and
      carboplatin in neoadjuvant therapy for triple-negative breast cancer, an exploratory
      biomarker study
