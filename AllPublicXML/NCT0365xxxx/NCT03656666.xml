  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Genital erosive lichen planus (GELP) is a chronic inflammatory disease causing painful
      genital sores and scarring in women. Treatment options are limited and often unsatisfactory.
      This trial will study the effects of treatment with apremilast and quality of life and sexual
      function in women with GELP.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Genital erosive lichen planus (GELP) is a chronic, inflammatory and scarring genital disease.
      The disease may have a significant impact on daily living, quality of life and sexual
      function. There is a considerable lack of high-quality evidence on treatment options for GELP
      and few effective therapeutic facilities available in current clinical practice.

      The aims of this study are to investigate clinical and immunohistochemical effects of a new
      oral anti-inflammatory treatment, apremilast, for women with moderate-to-severe GELP in a
      double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial (RCT). Apremilast is an inhibitor of
      phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) with documented effect in several inflammatory skin diseases, but
      it has not yet been studied in patients with GELP. The drug dose and study design have been
      chosen based on relevant experience from other studies on apremilast, and is equivalent to
      the dose used for approved indications (chronic plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis).

      The main objective of this trial is to assess the efficacy of apremilast in the treatment of
      GELP in women.

      Secondary objectives include

        -  Description of immunohistochemical changes in lichen planus lesions

        -  Assessment of safety of apremilast in the treatment of GELP

        -  Assessment of quality of life and sexual function

    <description>The GELP (Genital Erosive Lichen Planus) score is a scoring system for clinical assessment of genital erosive lichen planus (GELP) in women.
