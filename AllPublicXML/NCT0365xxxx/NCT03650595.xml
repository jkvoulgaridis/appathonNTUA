    <textblock>
      This clinical research study is designed to determine the ability of in bore MRI guided Focal
      Laser Ablation (MRgFLA) in patients with early stage carcinoma of prostate. The results will
      be evaluated by repeated MRI and prostate biopsy. Previous prospective development study
      demonstrated that FLA may be a viable option for men with low-intermediate risk prostate
      cancer. The vast majority of patients undergoing this treatment experienced minimal side
      effects with no peri-operative complications. Over 80% of patients treated with MRgFLA remain
      on AS and were able to avoid radical therapy at mean follow up duration of 3 years.

      Study Objectives are to evaluate the proportion of patients with low-intermediate risk
      prostate cancer undergoing focal laser ablation (MRgFLA) prostate treatment who will be free
      of clinically significant PCa, when using a &gt; 5mm margins around the MR visible tumor in
      defining the ablation contour. The rationale of the study is to show that MRgFLA is a safe
      procedure that can significantly postpone or eliminate the need for patients with
      Low-Intermediate Risk prostate cancer to undergo a definitive treatment (i.e., Radical
      Prostatectomy or Radiation therapy) for their disease. Study population: patients with
      Low-Intermediate Risk Prostate Cancer who are willing to take part in the study and meet
      study eligibility criteria. Primary Study Objective is to show that MRgFLA can significantly
      reduce the need for definitive treatment (e.g., Radical Prostatectomy, or Radiation therapy)
      and is a safe procedure for patients with Low-Intermediate Risk Prostate Cancer defined in
      the current protocol as 1) Gleason score 6 and 7 (=3+4 or 4+3; No Grade 5 pattern), and 2)
      T1-T2, N0, M0.
