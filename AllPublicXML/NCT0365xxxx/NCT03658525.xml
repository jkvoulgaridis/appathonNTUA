  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently radiotherapy for prostate cancer is directed using scans or X-Rays, which ensures
      the radiotherapy treatment 'hits the target' and avoids the healthy tissues around the
      prostate. There are two current methods of radiotherapy image guidance- either placing small
      gold seeds into the prostate and taking XRays or doing a small CT scan of the prostate region
      each day. Neither of these methods are perfect and have drawbacks and inaccuracies.

      The best way to see the prostate is with an MRI scan - this shows the edge of the prostate
      much more clearly and can even show the area of most aggressive cancer within the prostate.
      Shortly the investigators will have the ability to use a new machine - an MR-Linac - which
      combines an MR scanner and a radiotherapy machine.

      As well as giving the investigators a clearer picture, and enabling the investigators to keep
      watching the prostate while the participant has their treatment (not currently possible with
      standard machines) this new machine will also allow the investigators to change the
      radiotherapy plan if they can see that the internal anatomy has shifted day to day. Currently
      the investigators have to give the same radiotherapy plan each day, which means the
      investigators have to treat a 'safety margin' around to prostate to allow for these day to
      day anatomy changes (e.g. rectal filling).

      The aim of this study is to assess the technical feasibility of delivering radical
      radiotherapy for prostate cancer using the MR-Linac, including the feasibility of changing
      the radiotherapy plan on a daily basis to mirror internal anatomy changes. The investigators
      will recruit 30 patients with localised prostate cancer who need radiotherapy. The team will
      deliver the same dose in the same number of days i.e. the same as standard radiotherapy. Side
      effects will also be assessed by physicians and using patient questionnaires.
