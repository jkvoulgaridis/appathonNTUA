  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In type 2 diabetic patients affected by chronic shoulder pain, subacromial injection with
      corticosteroid could be an effective treatment. The aim of this study was to measure the
      risk-benefit ratio of this treatment.Twenty patients with well-controlled diabetes were
      included in a prospective study. In a first pre-injection phase, patients were asked to
      measure glycemia for 7 days, before breakfast and dinner, then 2 hours after lunch and
      dinner. Baseline data including Constant Score (CS), Subjective Shoulder Value (SSV) and
      Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) for pain were collected. Patients were treated with subacromial
      injection with 40mg of Methylprednisolone Acetate and 2ml of Lidocaine. At discharge,
      patients were asked to re-measured glycemia for the following week.

    <time_frame>Patients were requested to measure their blood sugar levels 4 times a day for the following 7 days</time_frame>

    <measure>Constant Score (CS)</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days post-injection, 6 months post-injection</time_frame>
    <description>The CS is a 100-points scale composed of a number of individual parameters. These parameters define the level of pain and the ability to carry out the normal daily activities of the patient.
Subjective findings (severity of pain, activities of daily living and working in different positions) of the participants are responsible for 35 points and objective measurements (active range of motion without pain, measurements exo -and endorotation via reference points and measuring muscle strength) are responsible for the remaining 65 points.</description>

    <measure>Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days post-injection, 6 months post-injection</time_frame>
    <description>The OSS questionnaire contains 12 items, each with five potential answers. Patients are asked to rate their symptoms between 1 (minimal symptoms) and 5 (severe symptoms). The combined total gives a minimum score of 12 and a maximum of 60</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjective Shoulder Value (SSV)</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days post-injection, 6 months post-injection</time_frame>
    <description>The SSV is defined as a patient's subjective shoulder assessment expressed as a percentage of an entirely normal shoulder, which would score 100%</description>

    <measure>Subjective Outcomes Determination (SOD) score</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days post-injection, 6 months post-injection</time_frame>
    <description>The SOD score is a simple tool with a categorical and a numerical component to compare surgical outcomes to both the preoperative status as well as to the preinjury state. Patients are asked to compare how they feel currently to how they felt before their surgery and to state if they overall consider themselves to be better, worse ore they are not sure. If they feel better, they are asked to indicate if they consider the operated part of the body to be Improved, Greatly improved, Almost Normal, or Normal. If they feel worse, the respondent is asked if they are Worse, Profoundly Worse, or As Bad As Dying</description>

        Type-2 diabetic patients affected complaining of chronic shoulder pain resistant to at
        least 6 months of conservative therapy (NSAIDs, painkillers and physiotherapy).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Consent to participate in the study.

          -  Severe overall pain and night pain: Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) for pain[8] above or
             equal to 60/100; the scale was modified from 0-10 to 0-100 (0 = no pain 100 =
             unbearable pain).

          -  No significant improvement after at least 2 courses of physiotherapy (including direct
             assistance from a physical therapist with specific exercises, manual therapy, and
             physical agents in order to reduce inflammation and pain).

             affected shoulder

        Exclusion Criteria:

             &gt;1 according to Samilson-Prieto classification for eccentric and concentric arthritis
             respectively).

          -  Shoulder trauma within 3 months of inclusion evaluation for in this study.

          -  High blood pressure values (systolic blood pressure &gt;140mmHg, diastolic blood pressure
             &gt;80mmHg).
