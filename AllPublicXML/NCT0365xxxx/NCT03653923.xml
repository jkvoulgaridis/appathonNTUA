  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the neurophysiological correlates of spider phobia and its
      treatment with CBT based Exposure Therapy. This is the first study to investigate the
      neurophysiological correlates of Exposure Therapy in situ by means of functional
      Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS).

      30 spider phobic patients will be assessed and randomly allocated to 5 sessions of exposure
      therapy or waiting-list. Further, 30 non-phobic control subjects will be assessed (primary
      assessment only).

      During Exposure Therapy, changes in blood oxygenation will be measured with fNIRS in areas of
      the Cognitive Control Network. Regions of interest are the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal
      cortex (DLPFC), bilateral inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and somatosensory association cortex
      (SAC). Before the treatment, subjects will have one session of psychoeducation in which the
      rationale for the treatment is explained. In each therapy session subjects are exposed to 20
      trials (each lasting 40s) of guided exposure by a psychotherapist. Further, 20 control trials
      of equal length are assessed in which subjects work with an earthworm. During the therapy
      additional anxiety coping strategies (e.g., controlled breathing, attention refocusing,
      cognitive reappraisal) are trained. After the treatment or waiting-list phase, treatment
      conditions are switched: The waiting list will be treated and the treated subject will wait
      for approximately 6 weeks.

      Before treatment (primary assessment), after treatment (secondary assessment) and after study
      completion (final assessment), additional combined NIRS EEG measurements are done. On a
      peripheral physiological level heart rate and EMG of the facial corrugator supercilii are
      measured. During these measurements subjects are asked to watch 10s lasting video clips
      showing spiders (experimental condition) or pets (dogs and cats). On a psychometric level,
      spider phobia will be assessed by questionnaires (SPQ, FSQ, SBQ) and behavioral assessments.
