      Study Design and Investigational Plan:

      This is an open-label Phase 1/2 study to assess the safety and tolerability of combination
      PD-1 inhibitor (APL-501 or nivolumab) administered concomitantly with c-Met inhibitor
      (APL-101), to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose of the combination, and to obtain
      preliminary efficacy in HCC or RCC subjects with advanced or metastatic disease that have not
      been previously treated with a PD 1 inhibitor or a c-Met inhibitor. HCC subjects will receive
      the combination APL-501 plus APL-101 while RCC subjects will receive the combination
      nivolumab plus APL-101. In Phase 1, mandatory archival or fresh tumor biopsies will be
      collected. In Phase 2, a mandatory fresh tumor biopsy will be required for study entry and
      another fresh biopsy will be collected between Cycles 2 and 4. The frequency of
      administration of PD-1 inhibitors will be every 2 weeks starting in Cycle 1 on Day 8 and Day
      22 of a 35-day cycle with all subsequent cycles on Day 1 and Day 15 of 28-day cycles. APL-101
      will be administered orally every 12 hours continuously on an empty stomach.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For each potential subject, there is a 28-day screening and eligibility assessment period
      before enrollment; the first dose of study treatment will be administered on Day 1 of Cycle 1
      (C1D1) (Safety population). Subjects will continue to receive their assigned treatment
      throughout the study until the occurrence of confirmed disease progression [progressive
      disease (PD)] by irRECIST, death, unacceptable treatment-related toxicity, or until the study
      is closed by the Sponsor. During the treatment period, study visits will occur on Day 1, Day
      2, Day 8, Day 15, Day 22 of Cycle 1 and Day 1 and Day 15 of every subsequent cycle. Subjects
      who experience a response [Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR)] â‰¥ 2 cycles, PD 1
      plus APL-101 combination will be continued until disease progression based on irRECIST.
      Subjects should receive a minimal of 2 cycles of PD-1 and APL-101 for adequate evaluation of
      response (Evaluable population). Discontinuation of PD-1 and APL-101 should occur upon
      determination of disease progression as determined by irRECIST, intolerable toxicity or when
      the risk/benefit ratio is no longer beneficial for the subjects as determined by the
      Principal Investigator, or upon subject withdrawal of consent. Upon permanent discontinuation
      of study treatment, there is a Treatment Termination visit and three monthly follow-up visits
      for a 90-day safety follow-up visit period. Subjects who drop out before they complete the
      first cycle of combination treatment for reasons other than toxicity will be replaced
