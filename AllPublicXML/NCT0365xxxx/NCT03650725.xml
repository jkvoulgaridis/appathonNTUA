  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: In randomized controlled trials, split-dose bowel preparation for colonoscopy has
      been shown to provide better bowel cleansing than day before bowel preparation. However,
      people who volunteer to be in clinical trials may be more adherent to a challenging bowel
      preparation regimen than people in the general community undergoing colonoscopy. This may be
      especially true for colonoscopies scheduled for the morning, when the later dose of the
      split-dose bowel preparation would be administered in the early morning hours. Hence the
      results of the available trials may not be applicable to patients undergoing morning
      colonoscopy in routine medical practices.

      Aims: To compare the effectiveness of mandatory split-dose bowel preparation to optional
      split-dose bowel preparation protocols for morning colonoscopies in a non-inferiority
      pragmatic trial.

      Anticipated results and significance: The study will produce a better understanding of the
      most effective approach to bowel preparation for early morning colonoscopies and suggest
      specific recommendations for colonoscopy practice.

      Patient will be randomized by the central booking office. Patient experience survey will be
      administered prior to colonoscopy. Chart review will be done to obtain data from the medical
      records and endoscopy reports. Please see outcomes and planned analysis.

        Description of Population: We will enroll all persons who are scheduled to undergo
        colonoscopy by one of the four participating gastroenterologists at an outpatient
        hospital-based endoscopy centre in Winnipeg, Canada, in this trial. These four
        gastroenterologists have been in practice for 10 years or greater, and all perform over 400
        colonoscopies annually. Patients are referred to these gastroenterologists by a centralized
        referral program, which is responsible for scheduling the procedure and for distributing
        the bowel preparation instructions- This program is randomly assigning to mandatory and
        optional split preparation as part of routine care; stratified randomization by early vs.
        later morning.
