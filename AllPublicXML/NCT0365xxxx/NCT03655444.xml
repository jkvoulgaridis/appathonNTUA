  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In phase I of the trial, the investigators aim to explore the safety and feasibility of
      abemaciclib in combination with nivolumab in patients with recurrent/metatstatic head and
      neck squamous cell carcinoma (RM-HNSCC). A dose de-escalation study design will be used to
      determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of abemaciclib given with the standard dose of
      nivolumab.

      In phase II of the trial, the investigators aim to determine if abemaciclib and nivolumab
      will improve the one year survival from 36% (historical comparison with nivolumab) to 60%
      (abemaciclib + nivolumab) in patients with RM-HNSCC that had progressed or recurred within
      six months after platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients will be treated with abemaciclib at
      the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) in combination with standard doses of nivolumab. If this
      aim is met, genome sequencing, bulk and single cell RNAseq, and selected protein expression
      and deep cellular phenotyping will be performed on tumor tissue and blood obtained before and
      during treatment with abemaciclib and nivolumab. These biomarker data will be correlated with
      survival and tumor response to abemaciclib and nivolumab.
