        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female ≥18 years old.

          2. Subjects seeking for dermal filler/volumising treatment in at least two of the
             following indications:

               -  Nasolabial folds;

               -  Marionette lines;

               -  Cheek volume loss.

          3. Nasolabial folds volume deficit of moderate to very severe intensity (grade 2 4) on
             the Merz Nasolabial Folds Scale with symmetrical rating at Day 1 as determined by the
             blinded rater and confirmed by the treating investigator afterwards.

          4. Marionette lines volume deficit of moderate to very severe intensity (grade 2 4) on
             the Merz Marionette Lines Scale with symmetrical rating at Day 1 as determined by the
             blinded rater and confirmed by the treating investigator afterwards.

          5. Upper cheek volume deficit of moderate to very severe intensity (grade 2 4) on the
             Merz Upper Cheek Fullness Scale with symmetrical rating at Day 1 as determined by the
             blinded rater and confirmed by the treating investigator afterwards.

        At least two of the inclusion criteria 3, 4, and 5 must be fulfilled. Depending on the
        fulfilled criteria, the respective indications will be treated.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any prior treatment with silicone, polymethyl methacrylate, fat injections, poly L
             lactic acid or permanent dermal fillers in the face.

          2. Any prior facial surgery, including facial plastic surgery, thread lift, any unknown
             treatment, or any surgical permanent implant that could interfere with performance
             assessments.

          3. Prior treatment within the past 24 months with porcine based collagen fillers or with
             volumisers (e.g., Belotero® Volume or others) in the area to be treated.

          4. Prior treatment within the past 18 months with calcium hydroxylapatite in the area to
             be treated.

          5. Prior treatment within the past 12 months with hyaluronic acid in the area to be
             treated.

          6. Prior treatment within the past 6 months with facial dermal therapies (e.g. epilation,
             ultraviolet irradiation, radiofrequency, facial ablative or non-ablative laser
             treatment, microderm abrasion, mechanical or chemical peels, non-invasive
             skin-tightening [e.g., Ultherapy, Thermage] or surgical procedures) or plans to
             receive this during participation in the study.
