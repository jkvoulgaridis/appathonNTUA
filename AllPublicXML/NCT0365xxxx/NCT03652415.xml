  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The DRy eye Outcome and Prescription Study (DROPS) is a large observational multicentre study
      exploring the 'real world' effectiveness of artificial tears in dry eye disease and
      determinants of efficacy. The aim is to include at least 635 symptomatic dry eye patients who
      are prescribed artificial tears. All trainees and fellows in London are invited to become
      collaborators: collaborators are asked to consent patients, assess signs at baseline, and
      give patients questionnaires at baseline and 4 weeks (for home completion). In tandem, we are
      conducting a qualitative review of ophthalmologists' prescribing behaviours for dry eye
      disease.

    <description>Ocular Surface Disease Index, consists of 12 questions asking about frequency of dry eye symptoms, each scored on a 0-4 scale. Total score varies from 0 to 100, the lower the better. This score is calculated by the sum of the scores for all 12 questions answered multiplied by 100, which is divided by the total number of questions answered times four. It has 3 subscales: vision-related function, ocular symptoms, and environmental triggers, similarly calculated and similarly varying from 0 to 100.</description>

    <measure>SANDE</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Symptom Assessment iN Dry Eye. The two-item SANDE questionnaire score is calculated by multiplying the frequency of symptoms score with the severity of symptoms score and obtaining the square root, leading to a score from 0 to 100. The lower the score, the less severe the symptoms. The answers are given on a 100mm horizontal visual analogue scale.</description>
