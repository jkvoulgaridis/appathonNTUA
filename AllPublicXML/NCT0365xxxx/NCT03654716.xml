    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a novel drug called ALRN-6924 as a possible treatment for
      resistant (refractory) solid tumor, brain tumor, lymphoma or leukemia.

      The drugs involved in this study are:

        -  ALRN-6924

        -  Cytarabine (for patients with leukemia only)

      This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational
      intervention and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational
      intervention to use for further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is
      being studied.

      In this research study, the investigators are evaluating a new drug, ALRN-6924, as a
      potential new treatment for children with cancer.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved ALRN-6924 as a treatment for
      any disease.

      This is the first time that ALRN-6924 will be studied in children.

      ALRN-6924 is a drug that blocks certain proteins in tumor cells called MDM2 and MDMX. These
      proteins may be important in the growth of some cancers. Laboratory experiments and results
      from studies with adults show that ALRN-6924 may stop tumor growth and, in some cases, may
      cause tumor cells to die. ALRN-6924 has been tested in adults with cancer to find out about
      side effects and dosing in adults.

      The purposes of this study are:

        -  to evaluate side effects of ALRN-6924 and to find the best dose of ALRN-6924 when used
           in children.

        -  to determine whether this drug may have benefits against the types of cancer seen in
           children

        -  to see how the body breaks down ALRN-6924 by measuring the amount of ALRN-6924 in the
           blood.

      One part of the study is for children with solid tumors, lymphoma, and brain tumors (Cohorts
      A or B). Another part of this study is for children with leukemia (Cohort C).
