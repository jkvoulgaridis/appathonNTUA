  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication after surgery for congenital heart disease
      and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. To-date, no biomarker has been
      universally implemented for predicting AKI in neonates after cardiac surgery. In this study,
      the use of hematological ratios will be evaluated for predicting AKI and postoperative
      outcomes in this patient cohort.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In adults, hematological ratios which can be calculated from a routinely ordered complete
      blood count with differential, such as the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, have been
      demonstrated to be correlated with acute kidney injury (AKI) and other clinical outcomes
      after cardiovascular surgery. In this retrospective observational study, the association
      between hematological ratios (neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, platelet/lymphocyte ratio,
      neutrophil/lymphocyte*platelet ratio, monocyte/lymphocyte ratio, and plateletcrit) and
      postoperative AKI, morbidity (length of ICU stay, hospital stay, mechanical ventilation,
      vasoactive infusion-free days, etc.) and mortality will be evaluated in neonates who
      underwent cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass.
