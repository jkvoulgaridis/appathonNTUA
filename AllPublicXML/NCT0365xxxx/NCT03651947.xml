      A randomized, double-blind and parallel group study to compare the pharmacokinetic, safety
      and pharmacodynamic of QL1206 and Xgeva® in healthy adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I,single center, randomized, double-blind and parallel group clinical trial .

      The primary objective is to assess the pharmacokinetic similarity of single and subcutaneous
      injections of QL1206 or Xgeva® in healthy volunteers.

      The secondary objective are to assess the Clinical safety and immunogenicity similarity of
      single and subcutaneous injections of QL1206 or Xgeva® in healthy volunteers.

      Meanwhile，observing the pharmacodynamic similarities of QL1206 or Xgeva® preliminarily.

      Subjects would receive a single 120mg（1.7ml） of QL1206 or through subcutaneous injection.
