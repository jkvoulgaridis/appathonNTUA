    <textblock>

      instructions for 6-weeks. Baseline observations were compared to those collected after
      6-weeks of treatment.

      The use of the marketed natural product, LivRelief Varicose Veins Cream, was observed in 32
      patients with lower limb varicose veins. Participants were recruited from the patient
      population at The Mayer Institute in Hamilton Ontario, Canada. Patients that agreed to
      participate in the study and met the eligibility criteria were provided with a 6-week supply
      of the cream to use at home as directed on the product packaging. The following study
      measures were performed at the clinic prior to the first use of the cream, then again at the
      clinic after 6 weeks of use: CEAP (Clinical, Etiological, Anatomical, Pathophysiological)
      classification and VCSS (Venous Clinical Severity score). These are assessments performed by
      the doctor or nurse to determine the severity of their varicose veins and CVI (chronic venous
      insufficiency), measurements taken of the circumference of their legs to measure swelling of
      the legs, photographs of the varicose veins, a quality of life enjoyment and satisfaction
      questionnaire (QLES-Q-SF) completed by the subjects to describe their satisfaction with
      various aspects of their life over the last week and documentation of any reactions to the
      treatment. The cream was applied to their varicose veins twice a day for 6 weeks.

    <intervention_model_description>This was a single arm pilot study to determine the feasibility of conducting an appropriately sized RCT within the same population using the same clinical outcome measures.
Eligible adult patients of the clinic with varicose veins were asked to use the cream as directed on the packaging for 6-weeks and the post-treatment measures were compared to baseline data. This study also provided SDs of the sample for comparison to the study population.</intervention_model_description>
