      A novel home-based tool for self-management is to be evaluated for heart failure patients.
      The tool assists the patient with symptom monitoring, education and titration of diuretics.
      Patients who were recently hospitalized for heart failure will be randomized to receiving the
      tool or standard care for six months. The primary end-point will be self-care behaviour, as
      measured with the validated instrument the European Heart failure self-care behaviour Scale
      9-item questionnaire (Jaarsma et al). Secondary end-points are in-hospital days due to heart
      failure, quality of life (general and disease-specific) as measured by the SF-36 and KCCQ
      questionnaires, and finally knowledge about heart failure, assessed by the Dutch Heart
      Failure Knowledge Scale.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who are admitted to the emergency unit for decompensated heart failure at the three
      largest clinics in Stockholm, Sweden, are screened for recruitment. For patients to be
      eligible for study participation, they shall be discharged from the hospital to the general
      practitioner without being referred to a nurse led heart failure clinic, which is considered
      the gold standard in terms of improving patients' self-care behaviour. At the point of
      discharge, patients are approached about study participation and those who accept will be
      provided study information and forced to provide a written consent to participate. Continuous
      sampling is employed. Baseline characteristics are noted, as well as baseline data collected
      for the following end-points: Self-care, using the European Heart Failure Self-care Behaviour
      Scale (EHFScB), general quality of life using the SF-36 questionnaire, disease-specific
      quality of life using the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) and knowledge about
      heart failure using the Dutch Heart Failure Knowledge Scale (DHFKS). After this data is
      collected patients will be randomized, using sealed envelopes, to either receive standard
      care or receive the home-based tool that constitutes the intervention investigated. Within
      one week after discharge, the patients randomized to the intervention group will have he tool
      installed in their home.

      The tool consists of a tablet computer locked to a specialized software, and a Bluetooth
      connected weight scale. Every day the patient is encouraged by the tablet computer to step up
      on the weight scale. The weight is wirelessly transferred to the tablet computer and today's
      dose of diuretics is shown on screen together with a short tip about how to improve living
      with heart failure. Every five days the patient assess their self-perceived symptoms, as
      prompted on the tablet computer. For every patient equipped with the tool, a patient-specific
      normal dose of diuretics, as well as a high dose is input in the tool at the point of
      randomization. If the weight increases by 2kg or more in 3 days or less, the high dose is
      recommended for two days, after which the effect on the weight is assessed. If the weight was
      decreased back to where it was prior to the rapid weight gain, the dose is returned to normal
      and if it is still elevated, the patient will be encouraged to call his/her health care
      provider at the number presented on the table computer. If the self-assessed symptoms
      deteriorate, the same type of warning will appear on screen, urging the patient to contact
      the health care provider. Both the intervention patients and the control patients will be
      given the same discharge information in writing, describing the most important parts of
      self-management for heart failure patients. The data collected at baseline will be collected
      again after 3 months and 6 months after randomization. After 6 months data about
      hospitalizations will be retrieved from the medical records and adjudicated as either heart
      failure-hospitalization or not. The adjudication will be done by the cardiologists
      participating in the study and as the focus of the study is in estimating the net/marginal
      incidence rate ratio of in-patient hospitalization, absorbing competing events (e.g. death)
      will be handled by censoring.

    <description>Assessed by the validated instrument European Heart Failure Self-care Behaviour Scale. It measures how well the patient adheres to advice provided from the health care professional. It si made up of nine questions to which the patient answers between &quot;completely agree&quot; and &quot;completely disagree&quot;, corresponding to a score of 1 or 5 respectively. The possible scores on the questionnaire range from 9 to 45, where 9 corresponds to the most desireable self-care behaviour and 45 to the least favourable.</description>

    <description>Assessed by the 36-item Short Form survey (SF-36). The instrument includes 8 multi-item scales plus a single-item scale to compare the patient's current health with that 1 year ago. The 8 domains are physical functioning, physical role, bodily pain, general health vitality, social functioning, role of emotional health and role of mental health. SF-36 also consists of two summary scores: mental and physical. The scores range from 0 to 100 and higher scores indicate better quality of life.</description>

    <description>Assessed by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ). KCCQ is a 23-item (15 questions), self-administrating,disease-specifi c instrument that quantifi es 6 domains (scales) and 2 summary scores of patients' health status. The 6 domains are physical limitations, symptom score, symptom change, self-effi cacy, social interference and QoL. The 2 summary scores are labelled: clinical summary scores and overall summary scores. All scale scores are transformed to 0 - 100 scale, in which a higher score indicates better health related quality of life (HRQoL).</description>
