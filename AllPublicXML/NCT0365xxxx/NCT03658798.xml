    <textblock>
      This study tests the feasibility, safety and efficacy of garments embedding conductive
      electrodes (FES-shirt) for the independent delivery of functional electrical stimulation
      (FES). 12 people with SCI and 12 people with stroke who have some degree of arm paralysis
      will receive 40 hours of FES with these FES-shirt. The ability to use the FES-shirts and the
      improvement in function while receiving FES will indicate the immediate benefits. Their
      functional capabilities will be measured before and after 40 FES sessions to evaluate the
      carry-over effects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Spinal cord injury (SCI) and stroke can result in paralysis of arm and hand muscles
      preventing people from being able to use them in day to day activities, which can greatly
      impact quality of life. Functional electrical stimulation (FES) can activate the paralyzed
      muscles by sending a low energy electrical current through the skin. FES has been shown to
      improve the ability to control muscles in previous studies.In current simulators individual
      adhesive gel electrodes are positioned on the appropriate muscles to produce functional
      movements.This is time consuming and requires a therapist to guide electrode
      placement,besides the cables interfere with the individuals ability to perform functional
      movements with the FES.To approach this issue, we designed prototype shirts embedding all the
      necessary electrodes and wires to stimulate muscles around the hand, elbow and shoulder.

      24 individuals with difficulty performing routine day to day activities with their upper
      extremities will be recruited to the study: 12 people with SCI and 12 people with stroke.
      Each participant will receive a custom designed FES shirt made based on individual
      participant body measurements and optimal electrode positions identified with standard gel
      electrodes.Study participants will receive 40 sessions of intervention, 3 to 5 times a week
      over 2 to 3 months. Each session will be one hour in duration and participant will receive
      functional electrical stimulation therapy through this customized shirt. They will have to
      don, activate, and doff the garment as independently as possible. The exercises conducted
      will be defined by the investigator based on the functional status of the participant and
      eventual progress.

      Participants will be evaluated before and after the intervention using functional tests and
      questionnaires Participants will be invited to give their opinions on the shirt so that the
      researchers can improve its features.

    <description>For participants who had a stroke. A series of movement and object manipulations video-taped, timed, and rated for their quality of execution and success.
The TRI-Hand Function Test is a gross motor function test used to assess upper extremity function in SCI. There are two components of the test an object manipulation component and a strength measurement component.
The Wolf Motor Function Test is validated in stroke and it consists of performing 17 tasks (moving the hand on certain spots, handling daily life objects). The evaluator scores the quality of movement (e.g. 0 = does not attempt; 3. = movement with synergy, effort, at low speed; 5 = movement appears to be normal).</description>
