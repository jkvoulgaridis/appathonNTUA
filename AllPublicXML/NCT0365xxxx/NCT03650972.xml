  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this randomized controlled trial is to develop a clinical standard
      procedure for measuring lactate in amniotic fluid (amniotic fluid lactate = = AFL) during
      childbirth before oxytocin stimulation is started. The aim is to reduce the need for
      emergency caesarean section during dysfunctional labour. The aim is also to study how
      different substances (oxytocin and Samarin®) affect uterine metabolic status during labour.

      Labour dystocia, i.e. prolonged labour, occurs in up to 30% in primipara deliveries and in
      about 20% of all the deliveries. In 2016, in Finland oxytocin stimulation was used in 42% of
      all the deliveries.

      The uterus, myometrium, is one of the largest muscles in the human body and consists mainly
      of smooth muscle cells. During the contractions the myometrial vessels also contract, causing
      momentary hypoxia and activation of anaerobic metabolism: O2 and pH levels of the muscle cell
      decreases and the lactate concentration increases. After the contraction, the blood
      circulation is restored and the anaerobic metabolites gradually dissolve. Myometrium requires
      a sufficiently long break between the contractions to recover. In dysfunctional labour the
      anaerobic metabolites accumulate in the myometrium. Accumulation of lactate has proved
      significantly to reduce the spontaneous contractions of myometrium and hinder myometrium
      calcium metabolism, which in turn reduces the strength of the contractions. Amniotic fluid
      lactate is known to reflect the metabolic state of the uterus during the labour.

      Prolonged labour can in many aspects be compared to the athlete's tired muscles. Many of
      today's athletes try to control the accumulation of lactic acid in their muscles during
      training by drinking baking soda (bicarbonate) dissolved in water one hour before their
      physical activity. Bicarbonate is known to function as a lactic acid buffer. Bicarbonate is
      considered as food and is sold in grocery stores as baking soda and for example as Samarin®.
      Samarin® is safe to use during pregnancy because as a bicarbonate it does not pass through
      placenta and does not affect the fetus.

      The trial aims to research if high AFL values (AFL &gt; 12 mmol/L) in women with labour arrest
      are best treated by:

      A) treating the labour according to the hospital's current guidelines during labour arrest,
      i.e. starting the stimulation with oxytocin and measuring the AFL again after one hour B)
      administering bicarbonate (Samarin®) dissolved in water one hour before starting the
      stimulation with oxytocin
