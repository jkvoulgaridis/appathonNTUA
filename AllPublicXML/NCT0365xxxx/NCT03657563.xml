  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Burnout is usually regarded as a response to chronic professional stressors like high
      workload, unfavorable emotion and complex interpersonal relationships. A high prevalence of
      burnout was found in many countries, and large-scale studies also showed high levels of
      burnout in Chinese nurses. As a stress-related syndrome, burnout was found to have
      detrimental influences on both psychological and physical health of nurses. Psychological
      problems such as depression and insomnia are verified to be associated with burnout.
      Endocrine dysfunction such as abnormal cortisol secretion rhythm occurred in shift-work
      nurses. Thyroid dysfunction was increasing and a sample of nurses were diagnosed with thyroid
      nodules and thyroid hormonal disorder during annual physical examination. Therefore, it is
      important to take measures to alleviate nurses' burnout to improve health.

      Positive psychological interventions are defined as treatment methods or intentional
      activities to enhance person's positive emotions, cognitions and behaviours. In these methods
      and activities, people are usually required to finish a systematic exercise. According to a
      recent meta-analysis, Positive psychological interventions showed effectiveness in enhancing
      participants' well-being and reducing depressive symptoms. Therefore, this study aims to
      explore whether positive psychological intervention could reduce burnout and improve health
      of nurses.
