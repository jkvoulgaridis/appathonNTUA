  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      30 adults, aged 40 and older with mild to moderate COPD, will be recruited for this study.
      Participants must be willing to continually wear a FitBit activity monitor, have access to a
      smartphone or Wi-Fi/Data-enabled iPad, and be willing to complete respiratory muscle strength
      training exercises as well as reports on their smartphone at least 5 times per week for a
      6-week period. Participants will be given a bluetooth inhaler device and a training app
      (RESP-FIT). This application will collect inhaler data and allows patients to self-report
      their daily symptoms. The goal of this study is to test whether use of the personalized
      inhaler device with the app strengthens lung function, promotes physical activity, and
      improves disease symptom self-management in persons with COPD.

      RESP-FIT. The RESP-FIT program is a 6-week respiratory muscle strength training intervention
      adapted from previous respiratory muscle strength training (RMST) training regimens,
      consisting of 1) five training days/week using combined inspiratory and expiratory muscle
      training, consisting of breathing in and out against a combine inspiratory and expiratory
      muscle strength trainer (IMST/EMST), 2) individualized, progress-based text message training
      reminders and prompts related to timing and intensification calibration, and 3) use of a
      Fitbit for remote monitoring of physical activity and hours slept at night. Similar to other
      muscle strength training programs, exercises are done at regular intervals during the week (5
      breaths, 5 times a day, 5 days a week; the participant will receive graphical illustration of
      RESP-FIT training frequency and intensity achieved, and based on their training regimen, will
      be prompted and/or reinforced via SMS text messaging). As the use of an accelerometer or
      remote tracking device alone may affect physical activity, a control group will receive only
      the Fitbit. This study proposes to assess the feasibility and initial efficacy of RMST by
      obtaining estimates of variability in fatigue secondary to dyspnea, using a
      technologically-enhanced RESP-FIT intervention. Our overarching hypothesis is that a training
      regimen consisting of RMST along with technology-enhanced symptom-tracking will decrease
      dyspnea, dyspnea-related activity avoidance, and fatigue. Additionally, this application
      proposes to further develop Smartphone Airway Monitoring System (SAMS) which currently
      integrates EMA probe questions covering COPD symptoms and preventive care use with the new
      functions, use in an adult population with COPD, video captured training technique and
      logging of RMST training sessions. Up to thirty adults with COPD (age over 40) will complete
      the study and use the SAMS app for 6 weeks in the natural environment. We will evaluate the
      acceptability, feasibility, adherence, and performance of RESP-FIT + SAMS through
      quantitative methods to further optimize the app and related study procedures for the next
      phase of testing (i.e., large scale efficacy RCT).

    <intervention_model_description>This is a randomized longitudinal controlled observational study. The study will recruit 30 participants and utilize a control group experimental design with dependent pretest and posttest to derive data regarding (1) feasibility and (2) within-participant effect size of the RESP-FIT intervention in terms of satisfaction, use and adherence, technical issues and acceptability, and self-reported symptom severity (dyspnea and fatigue). When completed, 30 adults (15 in each group) will have used SAMS for 6 weeks.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Feasibility of intervention (treatment adherence measured by the Mobile Application Rating Scale). The Mobile Application Rating Scale asks the participant to report the appropriateness of the app for his/her target audience ranging from little or no (1) to very high level of the acceptability measure (5).</description>

    <description>Change in self-efficacy (measured with the PROMIS Self-Efficacy Scale). This measures the individual's confidence in his/her ability to successfully perform specific tasks or behaviors related to one's health, with 0 being &quot;not at all confident&quot; to 10 being &quot;totally confident.&quot;</description>

    <description>Change in fatigue (measured with the PROMIS v1.0 Fatigue Scale). This scale measures how fatigued (tired) the individual has been in the past 7 days. The participant can check one of with 5 items, ranging from &quot;not at all,&quot; &quot;a little bit,&quot; &quot;somewhat,&quot; &quot;quite a bit,&quot; and &quot;very much.&quot;</description>

The participant can select from 5 items evaluating how their shortness of breath over the past 7 days affected their ability to do various activities (Getting dressed, walking up stairs, household chores, or walking at a fast pace) ranging from &quot;I did not do this,&quot; &quot;no difficulty,&quot; &quot;a little difficulty,&quot; &quot;some difficulty,&quot; and &quot;much difficulty.&quot;</description>
