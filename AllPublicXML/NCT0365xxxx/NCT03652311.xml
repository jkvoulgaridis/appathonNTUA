      The purpose of this study is to determine efficacy and effect of CVS (caloric vestibular
      stimulation)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed as a nonrandomized, single-blind, sham-controlled trail in which
      willing participants will receive a 5 day course of twice daily caloric vestibular
      stimulation (CVS) or sham treatment. CVS involves twice daily sessions of CVS each lasting 15
      minutes. The week before the intervention baseline characterization of mood and substance
      craving will be conducted using standard mood and substance use questionnaires. Prior to
      treatment beginning participants will undergo structural and functional MR imaging.
      Participants will also undergo a standard battery of questionnaires, including cognitive
      testing, mood and affect surveys, and surveys specific to SUD. During each of the 5 treatment
      days the participants will be asked to fill out questionnaires related to mood and craving
      symptoms. Participants will be blinded to sham stimulation or the standard CVS protocol. At
      the end of the 5 day course participants will be scanned again in MRI and asked to fill out
      the same battery of questions. Consistent with the existing standard of care participants
      will also receive two urine drug screens (UDS)

    <masking_description>Participants will not know if they are receiving therapeutic CVS or sham stimulation.
Participant survey responses will be blinded during analysis and only the use of non-informative catalogue will be used. This will eliminate bias in the analysis of the survey data.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>ODAS score measuring craving severity</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Measured items 5a and 5b of the ODAS (Opiate Dosage Adequacy Scale) that deal with craving and craving severity directly. It is scored by Likert-type scores ranging from 1 to 5. The higher the score the higher the craving severity A reduction in craving and craving severity will be the primary outcome. This single dimension is important for risk of relapse, but does not by itself represent treatment adequacy as a whole.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>ODAS score measuring adequacy of treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by ODAS (Opiate Dosage Adequacy Scale).The ODAS clinical interview includes 10 items that evaluate six components of the construct &quot;dose adequacy.&quot; Questions on the ODAS that measure symptom frequency are coded with Likert-type scores ranging from 1 to 5. Questions that measure symptom severity are coded on a visual analogue scale (VAS) using the same score range. The dimensional model provides a total score derived from a weighted sum of the scores of the individual items. The higher the total score, the more &quot;adequate&quot; the dose is considered to be. An increase in the total ODAS dimensional model score will indicate improved adequacy of treatment. This adequacy includes craving, but also represents multiple dimensions relevant to the treatment of OUD. An improvement of adequacy, irrespective of craving, is indicative of an effective treatment, and would indicate an effect of treatment on a feature of OUD other than craving.</description>

    <description>Study participants will undergo 10 sessions 15 minutes each of Caloric Vestibular Stimulation across 5 days with the FDA approved CVS device. This will be administered in home by study coordinators. Participants will be asked to fill out ODAS, GAD-7, and PHQ-9 on each of the five days during treatment; there is the possibility that other drug specific surveys will be used. Participants will receive two approximately 1 hour MRI scans at the beginning and at the end of the study period.</description>
