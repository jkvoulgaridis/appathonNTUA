      The adjusted Cancer Thriving and Surviving Program (CTS) for women with breast cancer living
      in Switzerland (CTS-BC-CH) is a course of 7 weekly sessions of 2.5 - 3 hours led by trained
      peer-leaders (women with breast cancer experience). This pilot study aims to explore the
      reach of the CTS-BC-CH program (integrated into the clinical pathway) and to investigate its
      preliminary effectiveness with regard to Swiss breast cancer patients' self-efficacy and
      self-management.

    <textblock>
      In 2016/17, the self-management program for cancer survivors, the Cancer Thriving and
      Surviving Program (CTS) was translated into German. The content of the CTS was adapted to
      breast cancer specific needs in three interdisciplinary workshops based on a participatory
      approach including active patient engagement. Additional disease-specific topics were
      developed and confirmed applying a multi-stakeholder e-rating approach. After a consensus
      meeting with the participation of breast cancer survivors, health care professional and
      international experts in the field of self-management, consensus on the program was reached
      in June 2017, resulting in the CTS-BC-CH program, i.e. a standardized manual for course
      leaders.

      This pilot study aims to explore the reach of the CTS-BC-CH program (integrated into the
      clinical pathway) and to investigate its preliminary effectiveness for female Swiss breast
      cancer patients. The CTS-BC-CH is delivered in two breast cancer centers in in the
      German-speaking part of Switzerland as a group-based program with seven weekly sessions of
      2.5 - 3 hours led by trained peer-leaders. Course leaders have to complete a 4-days training
      provided by certified master trainers. First, participants are enrolled for usual care,
      followed by participants who will attend the CTS-BC-CH course. Participants will complete
      self-reported questionnaires at three time points over a period of 6 months.
