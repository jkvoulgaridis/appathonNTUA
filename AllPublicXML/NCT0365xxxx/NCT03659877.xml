  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to identify and evaluate the range of values provided
      by accelerometers during a variety of typical daily lifestyle activities for heart failure
      patients, and to relate these to the measured intensity of performing each activity in the
      heart failure population.

    <textblock>
      The precise measurement of physical activity is now possible with advances in wearable
      technology, namely accelerometers. This is useful in order to properly evaluate interventions
      such as cardiac rehabilitation that aim to increase physical activity. One of the challenges
      with accelerometry is the need for raw data to be translated into meaningful behavioural
      units. This is addressed through a calibration study, where accelerometry data is related to
      oxygen consumption and cut points are derived where activity is considered light, moderate or
      vigorous intensity. However, calibration studies have only been done in young and healthy
      adults, not in the elderly or those with chronic disease such as heart failure where
      movements are slower and exercise capacity is reduced. This means there is a risk of
      underestimating the true level of physical activity in this population. Therefore the aim of
      this study is to run a calibration study with 18-30 heart failure patients.

      Adults (aged 18 years and older) diagnosed with heart failure, with stable symptoms that are
      willing and able to give informed consent will be eligible for the study. Patients with
      contraindications to physical activity will be excluded from the study. Patients will be
      identified from the Royal Devon &amp; Exeter NHS Foundation Trust and the study will be conducted
      in the sports science laboratory at St Luke's Campus, University of Exeter. Each patient will
      be required to attend a single study visit that should last approximately 3 hours in total.
      During the visit patients will be required to complete a number of physical activity tasks
      (such as lying, sitting and walking) whilst wearing various accelerometers and gas analysis
      equipment.
