  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goals of total knee replacement (TKR) surgery are to relieve pain and to allow
      patients to remain active. Sunnybrook is working with Kineris Inc.to advance a wearable
      device, the Knee Connect, aimed at tracking the physical recovery of patients after total
      knee replacements. After surgery, patients experience a gradual progression in function as
      their knee range of motion (ROM) increases and their gait patterns normalize. Goals for these
      metrics are well documented after the patient is fully recovered. However, there is a lack of
      detailed information available about the week by week improvements patients make in these
      metrics. The main objective of this study is to determine the accuracy of the Knee Connect
      device in quantifying the weekly improvements in ROM and gait parameters of patients
      recovering from surgery.

      A research assistant will conduct in person data collections on 36 patients using the Kineris
      wearable device. The device is an electronic goniometer connected to a smart phone
      application. Patients will be recruited from the &quot;Patient Orientation Program&quot; (POP) at the
      Sunnybrook Holland Centre. Data collection will occur preoperatively, at the end of each
      physiotherapy Knee Class session, and at the three month postoperative clinic visit. The
      research assistant will help fit and attach the wearable device to each patient's knee.
      Patients will be asked to bend their knee (flexion and extension) while wearing the device
      which will measure patients range of motion. The research assistant will also measure knee
      range of motion using a handheld protractor. Afterward, patients will be asked to walk 10
      steps, using any walking aids or techniques they typically use at home. There will be 15
      collections per patient requiring ten minutes per session. Chart reviews will also be
      conducted to determine patient reported outcomes which will be then correlated with the
      functional measures.

      All data will be extracted and input into an excel file. For both the ROM tests, the accuracy
      of the Knee Connect device will be compared against the plastic goniometer. This will be done
      by using a paired t-test and calculating interclass correlation coefficient. The data will
      then be analyzed using a repeated measures ANOVA and Bonferroni post-hoc analysis to
      determine differences in the variables week to week. Additionally, a regression analysis will
      be used to estimate the week by week improvements in these variables.
