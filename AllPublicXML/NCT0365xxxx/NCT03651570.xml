  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Informed by a previous trial in general cancer patients, the investigators aim to conduct a
      multi-centre Phase III explanatory RCT to demonstrate a significant impact of PTSD Coach on
      levels of anxiety in head and neck cancer (HNC) patients, including saliva and hair cortisol
      as bio-immunological indicators for stress. However, prior to proposing a larger trial
      requiring 267 patients, the investigators aim to demonstrate feasibility of recruitment and
      compliance with protocol procedures in a Phase II Pilot of 60 newly diagnosed HNC patients.
      The EG will receive PTSD Coach + usual care, compared to two control groups (UC and AC). AC
      will be comprised of a game app (e.g., Tetris, Candy Crush, or Solitaire) and will be
      structurally equivalent to the EG to control for distraction (attention on something pleasant
      or a task) and the human factor involved in usage prompting (i.e., same exposure time +
      contacts with personnel), since either distraction or the human contact with staff may,
      alone, lower anxiety. From a resource allocation perspective, it is important to know if the
      positive effects of PTSD Coach are due to the intervention itself or to the use of an app and
      its usage prompting. The investigators believe that PTSD Coach will be even more effective at
      reducing anxiety in HNC patients, as it teaches specific CBT techniques and uses
      psychoeducation already found to be more effective than distraction alone.

    <description>PTSD Coach is a mobile mental health app developed by US Veterans Affairs translated into French by Veterans Affairs Canada in partnership with the Department of National Defence and the Canadian Mental Health Association. It was developed for a male population (92% of veterans are men), as is predominantly found in HNC, and addresses the issue of mental health and stigma as found in our HNC patients. PTSD Coach can be used as a stand-alone education and symptom management and contains 4 modules: 1) Learn- Module, 2) Self-Assessment-Module, 3) Manage Symptoms-Module and 4) Find Support-Module. The content of the first and last modules were adapted to the oncological population.</description>

    <description>Patients will be assigned to three apps involving playing a game (i.e., Candy Crush, Tetris, or Solitaire), during the waiting time before and between medical treatments in the hospital, on the same weekly schedule as the experimental group. The game apps contain no element of intervention and were selected based on popularity and capacity to interests.</description>

    <description>The Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery (OHNS) Departments do not offer systematic interventions on anxiety and self-management, neither does any intervention address stigma. However, participating recruitment centres are already offering a best-of-care approach with well-established psychosocial oncology services, including psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, nurses, and volunteers. All participants will be free to use hospital- or community-based support throughout the study, which will be tracked in all groups via questionnaire and chart review.</description>
