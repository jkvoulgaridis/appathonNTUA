  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate Allograft Adipose Matrix (AAM) in the face of people
      with age-related volume deficit - fat loss. AAM is a tissue used to correct fat loss.
      Participation in this study requires injections for placing AAM in the bilateral pre-jowl and
      malar areas of the face. The research will tell whether AAM is effective in maintaining
      mid-face fullness and whether the appearance of the skin improves after injection.
