    <textblock>
      The IVF Offspring Born in Guangzhou Cohort Study (IVF-BIG) was established to investigate the
      short- and long-term effects of exposure in early life on the health of mothers and offspring
      in Guangzhou, China. Data are collected regarding assisted reproductive technology (ART),
      environmental, occupational and lifestyle exposures as well as health outcomes in their later
      life. Biological samples including blood and tissue samples are also collected from
      participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It has been 40 years since the first IVF baby born in the world. The effects of hormonal
      drugs used on women and health of IVF offspring have always been concerned in the
      reproductive field and in public. With the increase of the prevalence of infertility and
      development of ART, China is facing a IVF babies boom. It has been reported that ART was
      associated with higher risk of cancers among women undergoing treatment of ART, and an
      increased incidence of autism and noncommunicable chronic diseases, such as obesity, among
      IVF offspring. Epigenetics is documented as one of the possible mechanisms, while answers
      remain to be explored. A birth cohort would provide an opportunity to examine the short- and
      long-term effects of ART exposure on health consequences of the mothers and babies.
