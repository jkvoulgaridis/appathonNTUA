  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a disease characterized by long-term poor
      airflow, resulting in chronic pulmonary heart disease, chronic respiratory failure or even
      death. Till now, the damaged pulmonary bronchus structures in COPD patients cannot be
      repaired by recent clinical methods so far. In this study, we intends to carry out a
      single-centered, non-randomized and self-controlled clinical trial at an early phase. During
      the process, autologous bronchial basal cells (BBCs) will be dissected from trial tissue from
      bronchoscopic brushing. Then the BBCs will be expanded and detected by quality control. In
      the following, qualified BBCs will be injected directly into the lesion by fiberoptic
      bronchoscopy after lavage. After six-month observation, the investigators will evaluate the
      safety and effectiveness of the treatment by measuring a serial of indicators, including
      occurrence of adverse events, pulmonary function, the CT imaging, 6 minute walk distance
      (6MWD), St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), modified medical research council
      (mMRC) dyspnea scale and COPD assessment test (CAT).
