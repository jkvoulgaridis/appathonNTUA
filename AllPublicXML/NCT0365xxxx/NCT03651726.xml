    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of THX-110 in the management of tics and other
      symptoms (e.g. rage attacks, anxiety, depression, sleep difficulties) in patients with
      Tourette syndrome. In the first part of the study, half of the patients will receive THX-110,
      while the other half will receive a placebo. After completion of the first study part,
      patients will have the opportunity to continue into the second part of the study. In this
      part, all participants will receive THX-110.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      THX-110 is an investigational drug and is being developed for the treatment of patients with
      Tourette syndrome and other conditions. THX-110 consists of an active substance from cannabis
      (dronabinol, tetrahydrocannabinol, THC) and PEA, a substance that occurs naturally in the
      human body, in animals and plants.

      Dronabinol and similar active substances are already approved in some countries for the
      treatment of other conditions. In some countries, various cannabis-based medications are
      currently being used in the treatment of patients with Tourette syndrome, mostly without
      official approval.

      PEA has already been used and well tolerated in numerous clinical trials. The combination of
      PEA and dronabinol is assumed to show better efficacy compared to treatment with dronabinol
      alone.

      The planned study will evaluate the efficacy of THX-110 in the management of tics and other
      symptoms in patients with Tourette syndrome. Other objectives are to assess study drug dosage
      and to identify side effects that may be associated with the study drug.

      In the first part of the study, half of the patients will receive THX-110, while the other
      half will receive a placebo. The treatment phase will last 12 weeks. After completion of the
      first part, patients can decide if they want to participate in the second part of the study.
      In this optional second part of the study, all patients will receive THX-110 for 12 weeks.

    <time_frame>Baseline, week 7 and week 12 of the double-blind phase, week 19 and week 24 of the extension open label phase</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-S score obtained at the baseline (initiation) visit serves as a good basis for making this assessment. Only the following one query is rated on a seven-point scale: &quot;Compared to the patient's condition at admission to the project [prior to medication initiation], this patient's condition is: 1=very much improved since the initiation of treatment; 2=much improved; 3=minimally improved; 4=no change from baseline (the initiation of treatment); 5=minimally worse; 6= much worse; 7=very much worse since the initiation of treatment.&quot;</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, week 7 and week 12 of the double-blind phase, week 19 and week 24 of the extension open label phase</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-Severity (CGI-S) asks the clinician one question: &quot;Considering your total clinical experience with this particular population, how mentally ill is the patient at this time?&quot; which is rated on the following seven-point scale: 1=normal, not at all ill; 2=borderline mentally ill; 3=mildly ill; 4=moderately ill; 5=markedly ill; 6=severely ill; 7=among the most extremely ill patients.
This rating is based upon observed and reported symptoms, behavior, and function in the past seven days. Clearly, symptoms and behavior can fluctuate over a week; the score should reflect the average severity level across the seven days.</description>

    <measure>Adult Tic Questionnaire (ATQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 7 and week 12 of the double-blind phase, week 19 and week 24 of the extension open label phase</time_frame>
    <description>The ATQ includes a list of 14 common motor tics and 131 common vocal tics. For each type of tic, participants are asked to indicate its presence during the past week by selecting &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no.&quot; Subsequently, for each tic endorsed, participants indicate its frequency and intensity, both on a 4-point Likert-type scale. For the frequency ratings, scores range from a few times a week or less (1), to constantly, almost all the time during the day (4). For the intensity ratings, participants are asked to check (1) if the specific tic was very mild in intensity in the past week, (2) or higher if the tic was obviously noticeable to others; and 3 or higher if the tic was much more forceful and very noticeable to others during the past week. A separate score of tic severity was calculated by summing the intensity and frequency score, resulting in a score between 2 (minimal frequency and intensity) to 8 (maximum frequency and intensity) for each tic endorsed.</description>

    <measure>Tourette Syndrome-Quality of Life Scale (GTS-QoL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 7 and week 12 of the double-blind phase, week 19 and week 24 of the extension open label phase</time_frame>
    <description>HRQOL is often measured by four core questions that asked about general health status and number of unhealthy days in the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS).
HrQoL in GTS patients is evaluated using the generic EQ-5D instrument (ref: EuroQol-Group. EQ-5D. Available at:www.euroqol.org. 2006.). It includes a five dimension descriptive system and a visual analog scale (EQVAS). The five dimensions include ''Mobility,'' ''Self-Care,'' ''Usual Activities,'' ''Pain/Discomfort,'' and ''Anxiety/Depression.'' All dimensions are subdivided into three levels (no problems, some problems, and extreme problems). Calculation of EQ-5D index score was performed using a regression algorithm generated by Greiner et al (ref: Greiner W, et al. The measurement and valuation of health status using EQ-5D: a European perspective. Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic Publisher; 2003.)</description>

    <measure>Pre-monitory Urge for Tics Scale (PUTS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 7 and week 12 of the double-blind phase, week 19 and week 24 of the extension open label phase</time_frame>
    <description>The PUTS is a 9-item self-report questionnaire measuring premonitory sensations in individuals with tics. Each item is scored from 1 (not at all true) to 4 (very much true). The total score is computed by summing the 9 items. Thus, total scores range from 9 to 36, and higher scores represent greater premonitory urges. The PUTS has demonstrated good internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and construct validity among youths between 11 and 16 years of age.The present manuscript reports the first psychometric data on the 9-item PUTS in an older adolescent and adult sample.</description>

    <description>Add up the score for each of the twenty-one questions. The highest possible total for the whole test would be sixty-three. This would mean the number three was answered on all twenty-one questions. Since the lowest possible score for each question is zero, the lowest possible score for the test would be zero.

    <time_frame>Baseline, week 7 and week 12 of the double-blind phase, week 19 and week 24 of the extension open label phase</time_frame>
    <description>The YBOCS is a 10-item clinician-rated measure of OCD symptom severity. Raters assess obsessions and compulsions separately in five domains: time spent, interference, distress, resistance, and control. Each domain is rated on a scale from 0 to 4. Thus, total scores range from 0 to 40, with higher scores indicating greater symptom severity.</description>

    <measure>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 7 and week 12 of the double-blind phase, week 19 and week 24 of the extension open label phase</time_frame>
    <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) contains 19 self-rated questions and 5 questions rated by the bed partner or roommate (if one is available). Only self-rated questions are included in the scoring. The 19 self-rated items are combined to form seven &quot;component&quot; scores, each of which has a range of 0-3 points. In all cases, a score of &quot;0&quot; indicates no difficulty, while a score of &quot;3&quot; indicates severe difficulty. The seven component scores are then added to yield one &quot;global&quot; score, with a range of 0-21 points, &quot;0&quot; indicating no difficulty and &quot;21 &quot; indicating severe difficulties in all areas.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, week 7 and week 12 of the double-blind phase, week 19 and week 24 of the extension open label phase</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-12 is a multipurpose short form survey with 12 questions, all selected from the SF-36 Health Survey. The questions were combined, scored, and weighted to create two scales that provide glimpses into mental and physical functioning and overall health-related-quality of life.
Physical and Mental Health Composite Scores (PCS &amp; MCS) are computed using the scores of twelve questions and range from 0 to 100, where a zero score indicates the lowest level of health measured by the scales and 100 indicates the highest level of health.</description>
