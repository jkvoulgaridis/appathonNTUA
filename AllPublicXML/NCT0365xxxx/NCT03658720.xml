  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Disintegration time is an important quality attribute of ODTs, and the evaluation of
      disintegration time is positioned as a key step in formulation development, manufacturing,
      and clinical practice. The standard recommended over-the counter dose of 200mg Nurofen
      ibuprofen ODT is one (200mg) to two (400mg) tablets. To reflect this, the disintegration time
      of both one (200mg) and two (400mg) tablets will be assessed in this study.

      Studies have been performed assessing in vivo ODT disintegration time and have created
      standardised oral conditions by giving water prior to dosing, to moisten/wet the mouth. In
      this study it is therefore necessary to standardise the oral conditions as much as possible,
      despite the interpersonal variability, to measure the time it takes for the ODT to
      disintegrate. For this study, 20 mL of water is swallowed prior to dosing to standardise oral
      conditions. Thirty-three healthy volunteers are required to be randomised into the study, to
      allow evaluable data to be obtained for 30 subjects. Subjects are given a light meal/snack
      and then fast for 2 hours 15 minutes (± 15 minutes) before dosing, in order to bring the oral
      cavity environment as close as possible to standard levels and to minimise variability in
      salivation. Directly before dosing, subjects drink (with oral cavity rinsing) 20 mL of water.
      Subjects are dosed according to the sequence they have been randomised and the ODT
      disintegration time assessed.

      Following the first dose, subjects complete a washout period of a minimum of 4 hours, in
      accordance with the recommended posology, before receiving the second dose. During this
      washout period, subjects are given a second light meal/snack (the same as the previous light
      meal/snack), timed to allow subjects to fast for 2 hours 15 minutes (± 15 minutes) before the
      second dose. Directly before the second dose, subjects drink (with oral cavity rinsing) 20 mL
      of water. Subjects then receive the alternative dose to the dose they received during the
      first assessment, in accordance with the randomisation sequence.

      Following completion of the disintegration assessments, or upon subject withdrawal, subjects
      are asked whether they are experiencing any symptoms or complaints. Any AEs are recorded in
      the CRF and followed up as necessary by the Investigator. Subjects then leave the
      clinic.Subjects are contacted by the Investigator (or designee) from 24 to up to 48 hours to
      ensure any AEs are captured.
