  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was conducted to assess the evaluation of micro and Macro surgical approach in the
      treatment of grade II gingival recessions using the laterally repositioned flap
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study total, 30 patients were selected The patients initially received a
      comprehensive periodontal examination and complete plaque control program including oral
      hygiene to eliminate habits related to the aetiology of recession. Scaling, root planning and
      occlusal adjustments were done The patients were randomly assigned and divided into two
      groups. Group A and Group B. Patients with miller class II were treated with a laterally
      repositioned flap to obtain root coverage using conventional macrosurgical approach
      (15patients) and microsurgical approach(15patients)

      The clinical parameters evaluated were height of gingival recession relative clinical
      attachment level which was measured as the distance from a fixed point in a stent to the
      bottom of the pocket and gingival biotype at baseline, 3 months and 6 months period

    <description>Group A-15 patients were allocated to the microsurgical group for root coverage. following scaling and root planning, the laterally repositioned flap was done using the microsurgical approach

    <description>Group A: After administration of local anaesthesia using ophthalmic microsurgical knives a V-shaped incision was made in the gingival recession area. the gingiva was removed .the adjacent partial thickness pedicle flap was reflected from the donor area .the pedicle flap was then covered over the recipient site. then secured with 6-0 absorbable sling suture without tension. the surgical procedure was done with seilar microscope 40X magnification.
Group B: After administration of local anaesthesia using 15 no blade a V-shaped incision was made in the gingival recession area . gingiva was removed .the adjacent partial thickness pedicle flap was reflected from the donor area .the pedicle flap was then covered over the recipient site. then carefully secured with 4-0 absorbable sling suture</description>
