  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of gefapixant
      (MK-7264) in premenopausal female participants with moderate to severe endometriosis-related
      pain. The primary hypothesis: gefapixant is superior to placebo in reducing the average daily
      pelvic pain score (cyclic and non-cyclic) during Treatment Cycle 2.
