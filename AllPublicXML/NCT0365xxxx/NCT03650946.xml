  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is the 7th leading cause of cancer death for men in Taiwan. It is important
      to identify the extent of disease extent to deliver adequate treatment, either for primary
      staging or in recurrence. However, conventional imaging techniques including computed
      tomography, bone scintigraphy, and immunoscintigraphy with 111In-capromab pendetide are not
      sensitive or specific enough to detect metastatic or recurrent disease. Although more widely
      applied, magnetic resonance still relies on size and shape criteria. 68Ga-PSMA is a new novel
      positron emission radiotracer which several preliminary data has shown to be effective of
      detecting recurrent or metastatic prostate cancer. These studies are confined to a small
      retrospective European population. In this study we aim to synthesize the novel tracer, find
      the usefulness of 68Ga-PSMA PET in detecting prostate cancer, including primary staging and
      recurrence, explore the relationship between imaging and clinical parameters, and seek the
      possibility of 68Ga-PSMA PET to predict tumor nature and prognosis.
