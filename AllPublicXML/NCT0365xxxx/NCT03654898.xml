  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This a multi-center, parallel group, randomized controlled outcome assessor blinded trial
      with a qualitative descriptive component that seeks to assess the effectiveness of a brief
      facility-based video intervention to optimize retention and adherence to ART among pregnant
      and breastfeeding women with HIV infection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Universal HIV testing and treatment can accelerate population-level ART initiation and is
      critical to realize the UNAIDS 90-90-90 goals. Malawi pioneered Option B+ (B+), a novel
      application of test-and-treat that provided life-long ART for HIV+ pregnant and breastfeeding
      women. While maternal ART uptake improved 7-fold, retention and adherence remained
      suboptimal: only 59% were retained after two years, and of these, only two-thirds achieved
      adequate ART adherence. Other B+ countries are observing suboptimal retention.

      VITAL Start (Video-intervention to Inspire Treatment Adherence for Life) is a brief
      facility-based video intervention, created with formative participatory research, applied
      theoretical frameworks, and evidence-based message framing techniques. VITAL Start was
      designed to help optimize retention and adherence to ART among pregnant and breastfeeding
      women in Malawi.

      The study will evaluate the impact, implementation and cost effectiveness of VITAL Start in a
      multisite randomized controlled trial (RCT) in Malawi with the primary composite outcome of
      retention and adherence (viral suppression) 12 months after starting antiretroviral therapy
      (ART). The study will also examine the delivery of VITAL Start via surveys and interviews
      with patients and partners and conduct cost-effectiveness analyses.

      If successful, VITAL Start will provide an intervention that (1) standardizes and improves
      counseling at a critical teaching moment through an engaging and culturally sensitive
      experience, (2) is inexpensive and rapidly scalable without decelerating ART expansion, and
      (3) allows more efficient use of health care worker time.

    <measure>Composite of retention in ART clinic and viral suppression</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome is an aggregate measure. The study will measure if participants are both retained in ART clinic and also virally suppressed. Participants will be considered retained in care if they are verified by clinic records as active on ART. Amongst those retained the study will then assess viral suppression which will be measured as viral load less than 1,000 copies per milliliter.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Behavioral adherence, self-reported</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported adherence will be measured by a three-item adherence scale. The three items will include an assessment of the number of days with missed ART doses in the preceding 30 days; a scale rating of how good a job the participant did taking their medicines in the preceding 30 days and a scale rating of how often the participant took their medicines the way they were supposed to in the preceding 30 days. Item responses for the three adherence items will be linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale.
Scores will be analyzed as both a continuous and binary variable (binary according to cut-off score of either &lt;90 and &lt;100: good adh vs. not good adh).</description>
