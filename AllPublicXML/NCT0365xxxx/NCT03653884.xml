    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the ultrasound characteristics and outcome of
      pregnancies with fetal Intra-abdominal umbilical vein aneurysm.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intra-abdominal umbilical vein aneurysm is a rare pathology of the fetal venous system. Its
      incidence is low, evaluated between 0.4 and 1.1 / 1000.

      Intra-abdominal umbilical vein aneurysm is identified as an oval or rounded, anechoic mass
      located between the abdominal wall and the lower edge of the liver.

      It is defined by two criteria: either a diameter greater than 9 mm or a diameter of the
      subhepatic segment of the umbilical vein greater than 50% of the diameter of its intrahepatic
      segment.

      The complications that can occur during pregnancy are mainly represented by the MFIU, the
      occurrence of thrombosis and intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR). Their overall frequency
      is evaluated at 10%.

      A complete fetal morphological assessment is necessary to eliminate the presence of other
      lesions. However, ultrasound monitoring is recommended during the third trimester in search
      of an increase in dilation and especially the appearance of a thrombus. A particular clinical
      form, related to abnormal umbilical vein involvement in the infra-hepatic portal system, must
      be individualized because of a high risk of thrombosis. It justifies the realization of an
      abdominal ultrasound in the first days of life

    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 2 years.</time_frame>
    <description>From birth, it is necessary to evaluate the state of the child. This evaluation is done by the APGAR coefficient. The following actions are systematically performed: place the child on a heating table, aspire mouth, pharynx, nostrils. Specify rapidly, heart and respiratory rhythms, quality of cry, baby's color and responses to skin stimulation. These five criteria rated from zero to two make it possible to determine the Apgar score: it is practiced at one, three, five and ten minutes of life. This assessment helps to guide the behavior of the newborn: if the score is greater than eight to one minute, it means that the newborn has a good adaptation to the ectopic life. If it is less than three to one minute, the newborn is in a state of apparent death involving emergency resuscitation. An intermediate figure, witnessing hypoxia-anoxia, justifies management adapted.</description>

    <description>The complications that may occur during pregnancy are mainly an MFIU, the occurrence of thrombosis and intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR). A complete fetal morphological assessment is necessary to eliminate the presence of other lesions. However, ultrasound monitoring is recommended during the third trimester in search of an increase in dilation and especially the appearance of a thrombus. A particular clinical form, related to abnormal umbilical vein nicking in the infra-hepatic portal system, must be individualized because of a high risk of thrombosis.

    <description>It is defined by two criteria: either a diameter greater than 9 mm, or a diameter of the subhepatic segment of the umbilical vein greater than 50% of the diameter of its intrahepatic segment. There are two forms: an isolated form and a form with other associated abnormalities, which accounts for 29-35% of cases (cardiovascular anomalies, urogenital and hydramnios). Chromosomal abnormalities are found in 6% of cases (T21, T18, T9, triploidy (28% for associated forms and 2% for isolated forms).</description>
