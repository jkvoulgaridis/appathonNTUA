  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy of radiofrequency ablation of the medial
      branch nerves (RFA-MBN) in relieving pain and improving physical function in patients with
      subacute and chronic vertebral compression fractures (VCF).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study examines a novel approach to treat pain associated with VCFs. The usual care
      therapy currently involves utilizing physical therapy, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
      medications, opioids, and bone re-building medications known as bisphosphonates. A usual
      treatment plan may include some, if not all the above. There is growing evidence that the
      posterior spinal elements contribute to pain that patients with VCFs experience. RFA-MBN,
      which targets these posterior spinal elements, may provide more sustained pain relief and
      improved physical function compared to usual care for these fractures. The procedure
      essentially &quot;ablates with heat&quot; the medial branch nerves which send pain signals from the
      posterior elements to the brain.

      Patients will be randomly selected into one of two groups. The treatment group will receive
      the RFA-MBN procedure along with usual care therapy. The control group will undergo usual
      care. The control group will have the option to cross over to receive RFA-MBN at a defined
      interval during the study. There will be follow up visits at various intervals to compare
      pain relief and function based on various surveys of the treatment, control, and cross-over
      groups.

    <description>VAS pain scale (0-10 scale): Overall, at rest, and in bed at night
The VAS Pain scale is a measure of pain intensity. For pain intensity, the scale is anchored by &quot;no pain&quot; (score of 0) and &quot;pain as bad as it could be&quot; or &quot;worst imaginable pain&quot; (score of 10).
Subjects will report their pain prior to the procedure and at dedicated intervals after to assess change in pain intensity they experience.</description>

    <measure>Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire at dedicated time frames listed below to assess change.</measure>
    <time_frame>0 weeks, 1 week, 12 weeks, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Roland-Morris Questionnaire (RMQ) is a self-administered disability measure in which greater levels of disability are reflected by higher numbers on a 24-point scale. The RMQ has been shown to yield reliable measurements, which are valid for inferring the level of disability, and to be sensitive to change over time for groups of patients with low back pain. It is a series of 24 questions in which a &quot;Yes&quot; response appoints one point. A total score of is 24 possible. Clinical improvement over time can be graded based on the analysis of serial questionnaire scores. If, for example, at the beginningof treatment, a patient's score was 12 and, at the conclusion of treatment, her score was 2 (10 points of improvement), we would calculate an 83% (10/12 x 100) improvement.</description>

    <measure>QUALEFFO-41 (Quality of Life questionnaire) Scale at dedicated time frames listed below to assess change.</measure>
    <time_frame>0 weeks, 1 week, 12 weeks, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Qualeffo-41 is a specific quality of life instrument, which is developed for patients with vertebral compression fractures. This questionnaire comprised of 41 questions, covers main aspects of quality of life: pain, physical functions, social functions, general health and mental health. All answers are standardized so that 1 represents the best and 5 (or 3, or 4) represents the worst quality of life (reverse scores on questions 33, 34, 35, 37, 39, 40). The total score is calculated by summing all answers of questions 1-41. The raw total score ranges from 41 to 205 (or less when some answers are missing) and this is transformed to scores from 0 to 100. The higher the score the poorer the quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) at dedicated Time Frames listed below.</measure>
    <time_frame>0 weeks, 1 week, 12 weeks, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PHQ-9 is a multipurpose instrument for monitoring and measuring the severity of depression. The PHQ-9 incorporates leading major depressive symptoms into a brief self-report tool. It is comprised of a series of 9 questions that assess a series of feelings/symptoms related to clinical depression over the past two weeks and are graded on a scale of 0-3 (gradation of not at all 0 to every day 3). The scores are tallied up for a total score of 0 to 27. The higher the score the greater the severity of the depression.</description>
