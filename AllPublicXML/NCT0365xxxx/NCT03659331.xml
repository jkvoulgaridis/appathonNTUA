  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The assumption is that in some of the carriers, the increase in enzymes reflects tissue
      damage due to excess copper. The reduction of the amount of copper absorbed will decrease
      excess copper in the liver, which will result in a decrease in the level of liver enzymes.
      Zinc causes the induction of metalothionines in the intestine, which in turn prevents
      absorption of copper from the digestive system. Zinc administration in Wilson's patients
      causes the depletion of copper deposits and constitutes one of the cornerstones in the
      treatment of this disease.

      The research group is composed of patients over the age of 18 referred for unexplained
      elevation of liver enzymes and carry a single mutation in the ATP7B gene. After a washout
      period of 3 months these patients will be re-checked for liver enzymes and if high will
      receive zinc therapy at a dose of 300 mg / day for 6 months, after which the liver enzymes
      will be checked again.
