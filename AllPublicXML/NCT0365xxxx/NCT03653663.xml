  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposal seeks to determine whether near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) can differentiate
      between patients with confirmed SAMS and those with non-specific muscle complaints. NIRS is a
      non-invasive technique of assessing skeletal muscle tissue oxygenation and mitochondrial
      function. Mitochondrial dysfunction is a possible cause of SAMS, but NIRS has never been
      evaluated as a diagnostic tool for SAMS. Investigators will enroll 40 patients with a history
      of SAMS in an 8 wk randomized, double-blind crossover trial of simvastatin 20 mg/d and
      placebo separated by a 4 wk washout phase. Tissue oxygenation will be measured using NIRS
      during a short handgrip exercise protocol before and after each treatment period.
      Investigators will query patients about muscle complaints weekly during both phases of the
      study with a validated survey to assess muscle pain. Investigators will classify patients as
      testing positive for SAMS if they report pain on simvastatin and not placebo. Investigators
      hypothesize that these patients, vs. patients experiencing pain on both treatments, placebo,
      or neither treatment, will be distinguished by reduced tissue oxygenation during simvastatin
      treatment relative to placebo, demonstrating efficacy of NIRS as a clinical tool that can be
      eventually used for the diagnosis and ultimately treatment of SAMS.

      Study Overview: Forty patients with possible SAMS will be recruited from the Cholesterol
      Management Center at Hartford Hospital, advertisements and contact with physicians' offices.
      Subjects will be withdrawn from all statin lipid lowering medications for at least 4 weeks.
      Subjects will then undergo baseline testing (tissue oxygenation will be measured using NIRS
      during a short handgrip exercise protocol) and be randomized to treatment with simvastatin 20
      mg daily or matching placebo for up to 2 months. Subjects will be called weekly to assess
      symptoms of muscle pain and administer the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI). NIRS measurements will
      be repeated and treatment (simvastatin or placebo) will be stopped after 2 months or after
      subjects have experienced muscle symptoms continuously for one week. After 4 weeks washout,
      subjects will again be randomized to simvastatin or placebo treatment and the monitoring and
      measurement processes will be repeated (see study schematic below). Those patients developing
      muscle symptoms during statin treatment but not during placebo treatment will be considered
      to have confirmed SAMS. Investigators hypothesize that patients with confirmed SAMS will be
      distinguished from all other patients with reduced tissue oxygenation during simvastatin
      treatment relative to placebo, demonstrating efficacy of NIRS as a clinical tool that can be
      eventually used for the diagnosis and ultimately treatment of SAMS.

      Study Subjects: Statin myopathic symptoms have been poorly defined in the medical literature.
      For the purpose of this study, investigators will use similar criteria as the previous CoQ10
      in Statin Myopathy Study when recruiting eligible subjects. Subjects will be considered to
      have had prior statin related complaints and recruited for participation in the study if the
      following occurred: 1) They developed new myalgia, cramps, or muscle aching during statin
      treatment; 2) The symptoms resolved within 4 weeks of stopping the statin; 3) The identical
      symptoms recurred during repeat statin exposure. Investigators will recruit men and women ≥40
      yrs of age, since older age is a risk factor for SAMS and 25% of U.S. adults ≥40 yrs report
      statin use. Investigators will enroll equal numbers of men and women to improve the
      generalizability of the results. Investigators will not exclude individuals with diagnosed
      coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, or an elevated CK off treatment&lt;10
      upper normal limit (UNL) because spontaneous elevations in CK levels are normal in the
      general population. During the study, subjects will be contacted by phone weekly to inquire
      about muscle complaints using the Brief Pain Inventory (Short Form) (BPI-SF). Results will be
      recorded on paper forms and entered into the database. After 1 week of persistent symptoms or
      as soon as possible if the patient has intolerable symptoms, the subject will undergo NIRS
      testing and be taken off study drug. This reduces undue subject burden such that subjects do
      not have to maintain statin treatment for multiple weeks with pain symptoms. Subjects who do
      not report recurrent symptoms will be treated for 8 weeks, at which time they will undergo 4
      weeks washout and move on to the crossover phase. Subjects will be reimbursed $200 for study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects &gt;40 years of age, equal numbers of age, with a prior history of
             statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS). Subjects will be considered to have had
             prior statin related complaints and recruited for participation in the study if the
             following occurred: 1) They developed new pain, cramps, or muscle aching during statin
             treatment; 2) The symptoms resolved within 4 weeks of stopping the statin; 3) The
             identical symptoms recurred during repeat statin exposure.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects who have had cancer within 5 years of entry, have hepatic disease (ALT &gt; 2 times
        normal) or renal disease (creatinine &gt; 2 mg/L) since these patients may require more
        careful monitoring during the study and would be best managed in a totally clinical setting

          -  Subjects presently treated with other medications known to alter statin metabolism;

          -  Subjects with hypo- or hyperthyroidism defined as a TSH &gt; 5 or &lt;0.01 IU/L since these
             conditions are known to be associated with statin intolerance and muscle weakness,
             respectively;1,2

          -  Subjects with hepatic dysfunction evidenced by a baseline alanine aminotransferase
             (ALT) level &gt; 2 UNL;1,2

          -  Subjects with renal dysfunction defined as a baseline creatinine &gt; 2mg/dl;

          -  Subjects with physical disabilities prohibiting the handgrip protocol;

          -  Women who are pregnant as determined by a urine pregnancy test using an Accutest Early
             Pregnancy Test Kit, or who are trying to become pregnant, and/or who have not been
             using a form of birth control for at least the last 3 months, since the impact of
             statins on pregnancy-related outcomes has not been well studied;1

          -  Subjects who regularly use corticosteroids or other drugs known to affect skeletal
             muscle metabolism or regularly have intramuscular injections that will affect CK
             levels.

        Subjects who are unwilling to limit their alcohol intake to an average of two or less
        drinks daily.
