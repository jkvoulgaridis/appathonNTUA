  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus are highly variable and may result in graft rejection
      (underdosing) or toxicity (overdosing).

      The risk of transplant rejection and the toxicity of tacrolimus can be reduced by
      pharmacological therapeutic monitoring of the molecule, based on the measurement of residual
      blood concentrations. Nevertheless, some patients are victims of rejections or toxic signs
      even though their blood concentrations are in the therapeutic target.

      The aim of the study is to describe the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus diffusion in
      mononuclear cells as well as the kinetics of effect of the drug on its target protein

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Factors responsible for pharmacokinetic variability of tacrolimus are multiple: compliance,
      diet, drug interactions and also genetic polymorphism of cytochrome P450 3A5 (CYP 3A5) and
      efflux protein ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein, P-gp).

      The mechanism of action of tacrolimus is based on inhibition of calcineurin in T cells.
      Therefore, tacrolimus intra-lymphocyte concentration may be a finer marker of the risk of
      transplant rejection or toxicity. The degree of inhibition of calcineurin in the T lymphocyte
      could also be a pharmacodynamic marker more relevant than the blood concentration. The
      hypothesis that the ABCB1 efflux pump is the main factor limiting the diffusion of tacrolimus
      into mononuclear cells is advanced.

      The diffusion of tacrolimus into mononuclear cells and the impact of the ABCB1 efflux pump on
      this diffusion have not been studied to date. The effect kinetics of the drug on calcineurin
      in mononuclear cells is also unknown.

      The aim of the study is to describe the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus diffusion in
      mononuclear cells as well as the kinetics of effect of the drug on its target protein:
      calcineurin in the presence or absence of an efflux pump inhibitor ABCB1 at room temperature
      and at 4 Â° C (in order to inhibit all transport proteins) from blood obtained from 18
      patients undergoing bleeding as part of maintenance treatment for hemochromatosis.

    <description>The study is conducted with mononuclear cells obtained from patients undergoing phlebotomy as part of a hemochromatosis treatment.
The blood samples will be recovered immediately after their completion. 40 mL of blood will be collected and the mononuclear cells separated using a ficoll gradient.

    <description>Three levels of tacrolimus will be tested. Each aliquot will be supplemented with an amount of tacrolimus to achieve one of these three levels of concentration.
At 0, 5, 15, 30, 60, 120, 240mn, the samples will be separated into 2 aliquots : one dedicated to the determination of tacrolimus in mononuclear cells, the other dedicated to the determination of calcineurin activity. in mononuclear cells.</description>
