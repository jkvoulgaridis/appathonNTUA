  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glargine is commonly used in insulin supplemental therapy in patients with type 2
      diabetes(T2D) at present. However, many patients who treated with glargine still have poor
      blood glucose control because of insufficient insulin dose or improper oral medication. This
      study aims to investigate the optimal treatment scheme in order to improve the blood control
      in these patients. Continuous Glucose Monitoring System (CGMS) will be used to assess the
      blood glucose control at baseline and the moment when the patients achieved standard. Oral
      medications will be standardized first, and insulin doses will be adjusted according to blood
      glucose values obtained by self-monitoring. Glycemic control will be considered as reaching
      target of glucose if the fasting capillary blood glucose is less than 6.1 mmol/L. The maximum
      period of blood glucose adjustment will be 1 months. Oral medication, the type and dosage of
      insulin, exercise status, insulin injection skill evaluation, islet function, duration of
      diabetes, complications and insulin antibodies will be recorded in detail at baseline,
      reaching target of glucose standard and 3 months after reaching target of glucose.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with T2DM, which was defined bypublished Criteria of World Health
             Organization in 1999;

          2. Patients were using glargine with or without oral hypoglycemic drugs and having a
             stable dose of glargine for more than 2 month would be recruited into this study;

          3. Patients had relatively constant diet and exercise in 2 month before the study.

          4. Fasting blood glucose was between 6.1 and 16mmolL, and postprandial (or random) blood
             glucose &lt;22.2mmol/L

        Exclusion Criteria:

             attack, myocardial infarction, unstable angina, coronary artery bypass grafting,
             percutaneous coronary intervention, and heart failure;

          2. Patients with severe infectious diseases;

          3. Patients with acute complications of diabetes on admission, such as diabetic
             ketoacidosis, diabetic hyperosmolar nonketotic coma, and lactic acidosis;

          4. Patients with history of psychiatric disorders and were unsuitable to use CGMS;
