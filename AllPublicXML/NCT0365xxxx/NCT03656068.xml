      To evaluate the safety and tolerability of NTZ 500mg bid after 24 weeks of treatment in
      patients with NASH induced Stage 2 or Stage 3 fibrosis

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Based on the anti-fibrotic properties demonstrated in the animal models of fibrosis, this
      proof of concept clinical study aims at evaluating NTZ in patients with non-alcoholic
      steatohepatitis (NASH) and fibrosis stage 2 and 3. Although NTZ has been evaluated in liver
      disease populations (viral hepatitis C) up to 60 weeks, this is the first study evaluating
      NTZ treatment in a population with NASH induced stage 2 and 3 fibrosis. The aim of this study
      is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of NTZ 500 mg BID after 24 weeks of treatment in
      this population.

      This proof of concept study will also evaluate the anti-fibrotic effect of NTZ as a secondary
      objective.

      The methods of evaluation of fibrosis will include an innovative method of metabolic
      labeling. This approach is based on the concept that liver status can be determined by
      measuring the ratio of newly synthesized/pre-existing proteins. The turn-over rate of newly
      synthesized collagen and proteins represents the hepatic fibrogenic disease activity.
      Patients will be given &quot;heavy water&quot; to drink. Heavy water contains D20, deuterium being a
      stable isotope of hydrogen. Mass spectrometry is used to identify individual proteins and to
      quantify the ratio of labeled protein to total protein. The results are expressed as
      fractional synthesis rate of these proteins (FSR). This method has been previously published
      (Decaris et al, 2017).

      Other non-invasive methods will be used to evaluate the liver stiffness changes after NTZ
      treatment: Magnetic Resonance Elastography (MRE) and FibroScan®.
