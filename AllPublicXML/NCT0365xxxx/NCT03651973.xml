  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Myofascial pain syndrome is a common cause of chronic pain characterized by myofascial pain
      and trigger points. Recommendations regarding management of pain after breast cancer don't
      mention myofascial syndrome despite a study suggests possible myofascial syndrome with
      roughly 75% of patients in pain.

      144 patients having a local breast cancer requiring surgery will be randomized in this study,
      ratio 1:1 standard and experimental groups.

      Every patients (standard and experimental groups) will attend 4 specific consultations during
      which standard recommendations will be given, pain, quality of life, shoulder range of
      motion, global upper limbs force will be assessed.

      In addition, patient randomized in experimental group will attend self massages and self
      stretching workshops, one before surgery and one after surgery. Patients will be encouraged
      to performed daily self massages and self stretching.

      The aim of the study is to assess impact of self massages and self stretching workshops on
      sequelae pain further surgery for breast cancer.
