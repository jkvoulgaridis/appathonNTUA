  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center prospective study of two standard-of-care treatments to evaluate the
      efficacy of the Neutrogena® Light Therapy Acne Mask an Over the Counter (OTC) Blue/Red light
      LED mask, as compared to the combination of topical OTC benzoyl peroxide 2.5% gel and OTC
      adapalene 0.1% gel, for the treatment of mild-to-moderate facial acne. This will be an
      investigator-blinded, randomized, 12-week study to observe these over the counter treatments.
      The two arms will be: (1) Neutrogena® Light Therapy Acne Mask (MASK), (2) topical OTC benzoyl
      peroxide 2.5% gel and OTC adapalene 0.1% gel (TOP). Both treatment groups in this study will
      also receive and use standardized, non-medicated cleansing and moisturizing products. All
      products will be purchased through commercial sources.

    <description>The Acne-QoL contains 19 questions organized into four domains (self-perception, role-social, roleemotional, and acne symptoms) which refer to facial acne. For all domains, higher scores reflect better HRQoL. The total score varies from zero to 114, distributed as follows: 0- 30 (self-perception), 0-24 (role-social), 0-30 (role-emotional), and 0-30 (acne symptoms).</description>
