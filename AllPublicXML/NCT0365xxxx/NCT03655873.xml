    <textblock>
      This study is a safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics phase Ⅰstudy of a selective 5-ht6
      receptor antagonist, HEC30654AcOH,in healthy subjects.This test is divided into two parts,
      the first part is the healthy adult subjects single ascending-dose research;The second part
      is the healthy adult subjects multiple ascending-dose research.

      The single ascending-dose research:

      There have set up seven dose group(5、10、15、30、60、90、120mg）.The first group(5mg)contains 3
      health subjects，Which have been a preliminary experimental group. Each other groups contains
      10 health subjects(8 health subjects take experimental drugs,2 health subjects take the
      placebo).Within 15min before taking the medicine and after 0.5h, 1h, 1.5h, 2h, 4h, 6h, 8h,
      10h, 12h, 24h, 48h, 72h, 96h, 120h to take blood samples for pharmacokinetics(PK) detection.

      The multiple ascending-dose research:

      There have set up three dose group(15、30、60mg）.Each group contains 12 health subjects(10
      health subjects take experimental drugs,2 health subjects take the placebo).Each dose group
      in D1-D7 8:00（±1h）in the morning, 18:00（±1h）, with 240 ml warm water to take corresponding
      study drug，but Day 8 only 8:00（±1h） in the morning take subjects drugs.Total for 15 times.on
      the morning of day 1 within 15minutes before the first drug and after 0.5h, 1h, 1.5h, 2h, 4h,
      6h, 8h, 10h, 12h, on the morning of Day 6, Day 7 and Day 8 within 15 minutes before the drug
      collecting blood sample test concentration, on the morning of Day8 medication after 0.5h 1h,
      1.5h, 2h, 4h, 6h, 8h, 10h, 12h, 24h, 48h, 72h, 96h, 120h collects pharmacokinetics(PK) blood
      samples.
