  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People who are overweight often find it difficult to lose weight through diet and medications
      because weight loss reduces the amount of energy spent by the body and increases appetite.
      Glucagon, when given as an injection, reduces appetite and increases the amount of energy
      spent by the body, even when resting. Based on studies in animals, it does so by working on
      the brain. However, when gives as an injection it raises blood sugar levels by acting on the
      liver and therefore it is not used as a weight loss drug. It has previously been shown that
      hormones such as glucagon, when given as a spray through the nose, can reach the brain with
      no major effect on the liver. Importantly it does not increase blood sugar. In this study the
      research team is investigating whether nasal glucagon reduces appetite and increases energy
      spent by the body compared to a placebo spray. If it does, it may be a potential treatment
      for losing weight.

      Resting energy expenditure, appetite and food intake is being investigated in up to 20
      individuals. Participants are their own control in a single-blind, placebo-controlled,
      crossover design. Participants are admitted after an overnight fast and allowed to rest for 1
      hour before either intranasal glucagon (0.7mg) or intranasal placebo (sterile diluent) is
      administered. Study visits occur 1-3 weeks apart with intranasal glucagon or placebo applied
      in random order. Resting energy expenditure is measured via indirect calorimetry at baseline
      and over 90 minutes post-spray in 10-20 minute segments. Blood samples are taken at baseline
      and at regular intervals post-spray to measure glucagon, glucose and other
      hormones/metabolites. Appetite is assessed by visual analogue scale at 90 minutes post-spray
      followed by provision of a buffet-style meal for ad libitum food intake measurement.
