  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In ten years, the labor force has grown by 1.4 million people according to French national
      institute for statistical and economic studies. This increase is partly due to the increased
      presence of women in the labor market. Thus, the majority of some 800,000 annual births come
      from working women. However, some women in professional activity may be exposed to
      occupational risks, which may have effects on the develop-ment of the fetus during pregnancy.
      France benefits from protective legislative measures against pregnant women. Recommendations
      already exist.

      But with medical desertification, pregnant women may have more difficulty contacting their
      occupational doctor or treating physician and to access information about the risks to her
      work-related pregnancy.

      It seems to us important to be able to better quantify the information needs of women in this
      problem.
