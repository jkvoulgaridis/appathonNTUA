  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A novel stent, called Universal Partially Covered Removable Self-expanding Stent and
      Anchoring System for the Treatment of Refractory Benign Esophageal Strictures (UAS-RBS) was
      designed to improve the treatment of benign esophageal refractory strictures with a novel
      stent. This study aims at evaluating the safety of this new device.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Refractory strictures are defined as benign esophageal strictures who do not achieve
      acceptable symptom relief despite an intensive dilation schedule. Considering the failure of
      balloon or mechanical dilation other techniques such as intralesional injection of
      corticosteroids or stents placement were developed.

      Self-expandable metal stents, plastic stents and biodegradable stents are also used in that
      indication. In a meta-analysis of 18 studies with 444 patients, clinical success was achieved
      in 41 percent of patients. Stent migration occurred in 29 percent of patients, and adverse
      events occurred in 21 percent.

      A self-expending nitinol stent has been design to reduce the migration risk. The stent is
      partially covered on both extremities, allowing the formation of small hyperplasia in the
      middle part of the stent. This design with the inner sheet (usually, when using fully covered
      stents, the sheet is outside) allows formation of hyperplasia (therefore reducing the risk of
      migration) but partly controlled by the inner sheet to reduce the risk of lumen occlusion. By
      this design, the balance between hyperplasia formation to avoid the risk of migration and
      reducing the risk of lumen occlusion could be entailed stable esophageal calibration.

      The UAS-RBS system is a reversible procedure to treat Refractory Benign Esophageal Strictures
      through stent implantation. Above standard of care monitoring, safety assessment of the
      procedure and device performance decreases the risk and unforeseen events.

    <description>An upper endoscopy will be performed with the use of fluoroscopy. Depending on the size of the stricture a dilation can be performed prior to the stent deployment. Otherwise, the stent will be deployed over a guidewire, under fluoroscopy.
After, the gastroscopy will go through the esophagus to check for the stent deployment, or any complications.
An injection of contrast agent will be done to be sure of the correct positioning and that no complications was happened.
The patient will be kept overnight, with liquid food for 3 days and under PPI until one month after the stent placement.</description>

    <description>Six months after implantation, the removal of the stent will be performed. Patient will undergo a first endoscopy under general anesthesia for the placement of a FCSEMS. Then, depending on the importance of the hyperplasia, removal of both stents, under general anesthesia, will be done after 7 to 10 days.</description>
