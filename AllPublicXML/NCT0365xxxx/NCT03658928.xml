    <textblock>
      ICAN was a non-interventional study to explore the EGFR gene mutation status, clinical
      outcome and recurrent risk factors in early stage Chinese NSCLC with adenocarcinoma histology
      after complete resection (NIS-OCN-DUM-2009/1). The study had enrolled 571 patients from Apr.
      2010 to Dec. 2010 in 24 sites located in the mainland of China. The study had completed and
      major results showed that EGFR mutation rate was 55.1% and 3-year DFS rate was 61.7% in early
      stage Chinese NSCLC with adenocarcinoma histology after complete resection. Postoperative
      pathologic stage, gender, surgical and resection types had a statistically significant
      association with 3-year DFS.

      This study is ICAN extension study with the purpose to collect the overall survival data from
      previous ICAN study. Approximately 571 patients who participated in ICAN study will be
      enrolled.

      Primary objective

        -  To observe the overall survival of early stage NSCLC with adenocarcinoma histology after
           complete resection that had enrolled in I CAN study.

      Secondary objectives

        -  To observe the updated DFS of early stage NSCLC with adenocarcinoma histology after
           complete resection that had enrolled in I CAN study;

        -  To observe the treatment pattern after tumor recurrence of early stage NSCLC with
           adenocarcinoma histology after complete resection that had enrolled in I CAN study in
           real-world setting;

        -  To explore the risk factors of OS for early stage NSCLC with adenocarcinoma histology
           after complete resection that had enrolled in I CAN study in real-world setting, such as
           EGFR mutation status, gender, smoking history, treatment pattern after recurrence, etc.
