      Early Check provides voluntary screening of newborns for a selected panel of conditions. The
      study has three main objectives: 1) develop and implement an approach to identify affected
      infants, 2) address the impact on infants and families who screen positive, and 3) evaluate
      the Early Check program. The Early Check screening will lead to earlier identification of
      newborns with rare health conditions in addition to providing important data on the
      implementation of this model program. Early diagnosis may result in health and development
      benefits for the newborns. Infants who have newborn screening in North Carolina will be
      eligible to participate, equating to over 120,000 eligible infants a year. Over 95% of
      participants are expected to screen negative. Newborns who screen positive and their parents
      are invited to additional research activities and services. Parents can enroll eligible
      newborns on the Early Check electronic Research Portal. Screening tests are conducted on
      residual blood from existing newborn screening dried blood spots. Confirmatory testing is
      provided free-of-charge for infants who screen positive, and carrier testing is provided to
      mothers of infants with fragile X. Affected newborns have a physical and developmental
      evaluation. Their parents have genetic counseling and are invited to participate in surveys
      and interviews. Ongoing evaluation of the program includes additional parent interviews.

      Newborn screening (NBS) is a state-based public health program that screens babies for a
      panel of over 30 conditions. It is estimated that about 12,500 newborns each year in the
      United States are identified with one of the conditions screened in NBS, with each child
      receiving the benefit of early treatment [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
      Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) 2012]. For inclusion in newborn screening there
      must be evidence that pre-symptomatic treatment is more effective than treatment after
      clinical presentation. Most conditions proposed for newborn screening are rare, however, and
      researchers have difficulty identifying sufficient numbers of babies to test the benefits of
      pre-symptomatic identification and treatment. This lack of data is central to challenges that
      the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Advisory Committee on Heritable
      Disorders in Newborns and Children (ACHDNC) faces when making federal recommendations to
      states on which conditions should be included in newborn screening programs. ACHDNC is often
      asked to consider conditions for inclusion in newborn screening for which there is limited
      evidence of the natural history, prevalence, and especially about the benefit of early
      treatment. That evidence gap, especially in the rare disease context, makes it important to
      develop and test a system to efficiently generate high-quality data about conditions that
      have the potential to be candidates for state newborn screening. The Early Check program will
      address this gap through screening newborns for a carefully selected panel of conditions,
      offered under a research protocol with maternal permission. Early Check will identify
      pre-symptomatic infants with rare disorders, accelerate the acquisition of data on the early
      natural history of rare disorders, and demonstrate the feasibility of a statewide program to
      offer voluntary opt-in newborn screening for a panel of conditions not currently included in
      state' standard newborn screening. Further, Early Check will facilitate the public health
      'on-boarding' of conditions that are ultimately recommended for state newborn screening
      programs. The initial panel of conditions screened in the Early Check program include spinal
      muscular atrophy (SMA) and fragile X syndrome (FXS). SMA causes progressive weakness and FXS
      causes intellectual disability and behavioral outcomes. These conditions are rare; SMA has an
      estimated incidence of 1 in ~10,000 and FXS has an estimated incidence of 1 in ~4,000 males
      and 1 in ~4,000-6,000 females. We also propose a sub-study with a secondary permission
      process that offers mothers the choice to obtain additional data about the gene that causes
      FXS: specifically, whether the infant has a premutation in the gene, which has an uncertain
      impact on the infant's learning and development. This uncertainty is the reason why
      premutation results are offered separately under a sub-study. For a wide range of rare
      disorders there is evidence that a delayed diagnosis (i.e., the frequently-described
      diagnostic odyssey as parents search for a diagnosis) can have negative health outcomes on
      children who miss out on treatments or interventions and on families who experience negative
      psychosocial impact. Thus, the identification of affected newborns through Early Check may
      improve health outcomes for the children and the wellbeing of their parents and families. The
      evidence supporting the benefit of newborn identification of SMA is strong enough that on
      July 2, 2018, SMA was added to the Recommended Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP) by the
      Secretary of HHS. There will likely be a considerable time lag (historically multiple years)
      before SMA newborn screening can be implemented by individual states. The inclusion of SMA on
      the Early Check panel will provide important data to the North Carolina State Laboratory of
      Public Health as they prepare for implementation, without delaying the access of infants with
      SMA to the potential benefits of early diagnosis. In the future, Early Check will integrate
      new conditions to the screening platform as science advances and funding is secured, and
      conditions may be removed from the screening platform as associated research questions are
      answered and/or conditions achieve inclusion in state newborn screening programs (as may be
      the case with SMA). The overall research question is whether Early Check is an effective
      onboarding program to inform newborn screening policy decision-making.

      Early Check will also provide the infrastructure to facilitate translational research studies
      and clinical trials. A dilemma in research in rare diseases is a lack of sufficient numbers
      of presymptomatic patients. New treatments are being developed for rare diseases at a rapid
      pace. Presymptomatic treatment often has the best potential for effective treatment.
      Currently, early identification and intervention is based on the prenatal or early diagnosis
      of a sibling of a patient with known disease, which greatly limits the numbers of
      presymptomatic patients available for trials. Newborn screening has the greatest potential to
      identify presymptomatic infants. Ultimately the research program should more rapidly advance
      understanding of diseases and treatments, reducing the length of time for appropriate
      conditions to be added to the recommended panel for inclusion in state newborn screening
      programs, and provide early identification of affected newborns.

If the confirmatory test is positive, then the child receives a diagnosis of the disease. Children identified with a disorder are referred for treatment, their parents receive information and counseling on what a positive diagnosis means for their child, and they are offered participation in follow-up and registry activities for the disorder.</description>
