  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The approach described here is based both on theoretical concepts and on the work of several
      teams of researchers. By positioning the baby and the appropriate adult, a speech bath, a
      sustained look and an expressive face, it is hypothesized that this early communication
      exercise will significantly improve the transition from passive feeding, active feeding of
      the premature child, from a qualitative and quantitative point of view.

    <description>The intervention concerns the passage from the passive feed (gastric tube) to the active feed (breast, feeding bottle).
We propose to set up a pleasant moment just before his meal. This is a practical exercise of a few minutes.
The aim of this special moment is to facilitate child-adult exchanges, improve active food intake and reduce the length of hospital stay.</description>
