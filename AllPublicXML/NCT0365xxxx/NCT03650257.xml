      RATIONALE: heat shock protein gp96-peptide complex made from a person's tumor cells may help
      the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells.

      Overall Goals:

      - to evaluate the safety and induction of anti-tumor immunity by administration of an
      immunogenic human tumor cell vaccine, and assess immune response in relation to clinical
      outcome.

      Primary Aim:

      - to further evaluate effectiveness of autologous gp96 treatment of glioblastoma on the basis
      of preliminary work.

      Secondary Aims:

      to study the immune response to vaccination, to monitor clinical responses , to further the
      safety of vaccine.

    <description>Patients receive standard treatment with radiation and temozolomide after surgery.
Then 6 times of autologous gp96 vaccination are administered via subcutaneous injection in 25μg doses at the 2nd week after the end of postoperative radiotherapy.
( gp96 is administered once a week for the first 4 weeks, the 5th injection is administered 2 weeks after the 4th injection, and the 6th injection is administered 3 weeks after the 5th injection. )
The first adjunctive temozolomide startes on the day of the fifth gp96 injection.
(150-200 mg/m2/day for 5 days, then stop for 23 days, one cycle is 28 days for a total of 6 cycles)</description>
