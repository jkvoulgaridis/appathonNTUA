    <textblock>
      Randomized Controlled trial of 370 aged participants over 75 years old coming from clinics of
      Geriatric Departments in three University Hospitals in Spain (Pamplona, Getafe y San
      Sebastián). Participants who met inclusion criteria will be randomized to control (usual
      care)l or intervention group (multicomponent exercise program). The main objective of the
      trial is to study the effect of a multicomponent exercise training program (resistance,
      aerobic, strength, balance and flexibility) in frail aged participants who live in the
      community with cognitive decline in: functional capacity, strength, power, cognition, falls ,
      depression, quality of life, institutionalization and hospital admissions

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Usual care group (control) Participants randomly assigned to the usual care group will
      receive normal outpatient care, which includes physical rehabilitation when needed.

      Intervention group (training) The intervention will consist of a multicomponent exercise
      training programme -VIVIFRAIL-(A Practical Guide for Prescribing a Multi-Component Physical
      Training Program to prevent weakness and falls in People over 70, Showed in
      www.vivifrail.com), which will be composed of supervised progressive resistance training,
      balance-training, flexibility and cardiovascular for 7 days/week. During the training period,
      patients will be trained between 2 and 120 minutes each day.

      The supervised multicomponent exercise training programme will be comprised of upper and
      lower body strengthening exercises, tailored to the individual's functional capacity, using
      dumbbells aiming for 2-3 sets of 10-15 repetitions at an intensity of 30-50% of 1RM combined
      with balance-training, flexibility and gait exercises that progressed in difficulty. The
      resistance exercises focused on the major upper and lower limb muscles. During the
      progressive resistance training, instruction will be provided to the participants to perform
      the exercises at a high velocity of motion. However, care will be taken to ensure that
      exercises were executed with correct form. Balance and gait training exercises that
      progressed in difficulty will be also implemented: e.g. semitandem foot standing, line
      walking, stepping practice, walking with small obstacles, proprioceptive exercises, and
      altering the base of support and weight transfer from one leg to the other. An experienced
      physical trainer will carefully explain all the exercises. Participants and their carer /
      family members will be carefully familiarized with the training procedures in advance.

    <description>The functional capacity of patients will be evaluated by the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) which evaluates, balance, gait ability, and leg strength using a single tool. The total score ranges from 0 (worst) to 12 points (best). The SPPB test has been shown to be a valid instrument for screening frailty and predicting disability, institutionalization, and mortality. A total score of less than 10 indicates frailty and a high risk of disability and falls. A one-point change in the score has clinical relevance</description>

NPI is a validated informant-based interview that assesses 12 neuropsychiatric symptoms over the previous month.Initial responses to each domain question are &quot;Yes&quot; (present) or &quot;No&quot; (absent). If the response to the domain question is &quot;No&quot;, the informant goes to the next question. If &quot;Yes&quot;, the informant then rates both the Severity of the symptoms present within the last month on a 3-point scale and the associated impact of the symptom manifestations on them (i.e. Caregiver distress) using a 5-point scale. The NPI provides symptom Severity and Distress ratings for each symptom reported, and total Severity and Distress scores reflecting the sum of individual domain scores.</description>

    <measure>Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ)</measure>

    <description>The Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ) measures instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), such as preparing balanced meals and managing personal finances. Since functional changes are noted earlier in the dementia process with IADLs that require a higher cognitive ability compared to basic activities of daily living (ADLs), this tool is useful to monitor these functional changes over time. It evaluates 10 items and it is necessary to ask informant to rate patient's ability using the following scoring system: • Dependent = 3
Requires assistance = 2
Has difficulty but does by self = 1
Normal = 0
Never did [the activity] but could do now = 0
Never did and would have difficulty now = 1 It is ranged between 0-30. Cut-point of 9 (dependent in 3 or more activities) is recommended to indicate impaired function and possible cognitive impairment.</description>

In our case we choose a fluency verbal test because it´s simplicity in participants with sensorial deficits and illiteracy . We will ask the participants to say by loud in one minute words that starts with word &quot;P&quot;. correct and wrong answers will be noted.
