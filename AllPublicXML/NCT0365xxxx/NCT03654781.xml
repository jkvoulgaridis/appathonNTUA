  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The efficacy of conventional systemic antibiotic therapy for eradication of gastric H. pylori
      has been seriously challenged by antibiotic resistance. Identification of alternative
      therapeutic strategies might help to overcome the limitation. The investigators' aim was to
      examine the effect of adjunct periodontal therapy, on gastric H. pylori eradication rate.

    <intervention_model_description>Participants with positive for both for H. pylori in gastric biopsy specimens and dental plaque samples by histologic examination with immunostaining and the rapid urease test (RUT), on gastric biopsy specimens obtained during gastrointestinal endoscopy were divided into 2 groups. Patients were allocated to one of the eradication regimens: triple therapy only or triple therapy combined with periodontal treatment. Each participant in both group received of a 10-day course of a proton pump inhibitor (Lansoprazole ) combined with amoxicillin (2 × 1 g daily) and clarithromycin (2 × 500 mg daily). Meanwhile, combined treatment group further received periodontal treatment consisted of scaling or combined with root planing and oral hygiene instructions.</intervention_model_description>
