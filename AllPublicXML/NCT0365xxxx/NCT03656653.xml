  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A pragmatic, 4-week, 4-group, between-subjects, factorial randomised controlled trial
      conducted at a specialist NHS outpatient addictions clinic and hospital clinical research
      facility to determine if mental imagery (of past and future positive [recovery oriented] and
      negative [cocaine aversive] events) can help reduce cue-induced cocaine craving and cocaine
      use.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cocaine, a powerful stimulant drug, is used by 2.2% of people aged 16-59 in England and each
      year about 150.000 people seek help for cocaine use disorder from the NHS or non-governmental
      organisations (NGO). There are currently no approved medication-assisted treatments or
      specific psychosocial interventions for CUD. General counselling is offered by the NHS and
      NGO addiction services, but this is not particularly effective.

      The transition from regular cocaine use to cocaine abuse is often marked by intense episodes
      (binges), which may last several days and are followed by a 'crash' with no or little use.
      For many people, repeated administration of cocaine over a short duration of time creates
      vivid episodic memories of euphoria which can inform future craving content. Craving or
      strong urges are a distinctive feature of CUD and are often reported as involuntary,
      distressing and uncontrollable.

      Research has demonstrated that craving experiences can be voluntarily evoked or elicited by
      conditioned drug cues in the environment and internal processes such mood or physical
      sensations. The associations between cues and use are established through classical and
      instrumental reward-based conditioning and are important for the development and maintenance
      of CUD. Enhanced attention to cocaine cues develops and remains heightened for at least six
      months into abstinence.

      Craving-related experiences are informed by memories of intense reward, physical sensations
      and include pro-drug beliefs, appraisals, expectancies and vivid mental imagery. Drug-imagery
      is often initially pleasurable and affectively charged and can motivate drug-seeking
      behaviour. If impeded or delayed, drug imagery highlights a deficit and can be experienced as
      distressing and intrusive. Treatment of intrusive images has been successful in various
      psychological disorders using imagery rescripting. Imagery rescripting has recently been used
      in memory-focused cognitive therapy to help reduce cocaine craving. Reducing intrusive
      image-induced negative affect through positive imagery is important for relieving
      psychological distress but there is also evidence that aversive imagery may reduce
      maladaptive approach behaviours.

      This will be a pragmatic, 4-week, 2x2, between-subjects, factorial randomised controlled
      trial. It will be conducted at a specialist NHS outpatient addictions clinic (Lorraine Hewitt
      House; LHH) operated by South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation trust (SLaM) and at the NIHR
      Wellcome Trust King's Clinical Research Facility (CRF) at King's College Hospital.

      Informed consenting adult participants will be randomised to one of four conditions:

        -  future-based (prospective) recovery-oriented imagery;

        -  future-based (prospective) cocaine-aversive imagery;

        -  past (autobiographical) recovery-oriented imagery; or

        -  past (autobiographical) cocaine-aversive imagery.

      Participants will undergo a craving induction procedure designed to elicit cue-induced
      craving. In response to elevated craving, participants will be asked to reduce their craving
      levels using a mental imagery intervention.

      Following the procedure in the research facility, participants will be given a digital audio
      player to take home. This will contain a recording of the imagery condition they are
      allocated to. Participants will be asked to listen to this recording each day during a 14-day
      follow-up, and ad libertatem when experiencing cocaine craving. After 14 days participants
      will be invited for a follow up conducted at the community addictions clinic.

    <time_frame>baseline (Week 0) and at two week-follow up (Week 4)</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measure will be number of days abstinent from cocaine (percentage). A higher percentage indicates a higher number of abstinent days from cocaine.
This will be expressed as the cumulative distribution function for change (between baseline and follow-up) using a Timeline Follow Back method (calendar prompt).
Percentage days abstinent is measured for two weeks before the first assessment and two weeks post craving-induction procedure.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in Craving Experience Questionnaire Score (CEQ-12)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline (Week 0) and at two week-follow up (Week 4)</time_frame>
    <description>The CEQ-12 is an 12-item, self-report instrument measuring intensity, imagery and intrusiveness dimensions of craving. Each item is rated on a 11-point scale (0-10), ranging from 0-120, where a higher score expresses increased craving.
The intensity subscale ranges from 0 to 30 where 30 indicates a constant urge to use cocaine.
The imagery subscale ranges from 0 to 60 where 60 indicates a constant sensory craving experience The intrusiveness subscale ranges from 0 to 30 where 30 indicates constant intrusive thoughts about cocaine
The CEQ-12 is measured at baseline (craving for past 2 weeks) and at two week-follow up (craving for past two weeks)
The total craving score will be expressed as cumulative distribution function for change in cocaine craving.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Episodic Foresight Score (EFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>EFS is assessed during the assessment session (Week 1)</time_frame>
    <description>based on the Adapted Autobiographical Interview (AI (Levine et al. 2002; adapted version, Addis, Wong and Schacter (2008)); adapted for this study. The Episodic foresight score (EFS) provides an index of the extent to which participants are personally experiencing an event during mental imagining. This translates into episodic foresight capabilities.
EFS is derived from transcribed mental image descriptions. Details are segmented and categorised as either internal or external. The number of internal details provided an index of the extent to which participants are personally experiencing the event during mental imagining.
High score of external details/ Low score of internal detail signify limited episodic foresight whereas a low score of external detail/high score of internal detail signifies good episodic foresight.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Substance Related Imagery Semi Structured Interview (SRI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1 (Assessment)</time_frame>
    <description>A semi structured interview examining intrusive imagery in substance use. This interview will be used to explore individual craving experiences and help prepare the participant for the imagery intervention.
Consists of 21 questions exploring imagery in substance use. These are divided into three sections: Exploring Substance Related Images, Link to memories and Negative Valence Imagery.
Interview consists of a mix of open-ended questions, visual analogue scales and Yes/No questions.
The interview schedule will be used during the craving experiences interview in the stage 1 assessment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Predominance of verbal and imagery-based thoughts visual analogue scale (PV-IT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 2 ( x2; Post Craving Induction; Post Imagery Intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Consists of two rating questions to assess the use of imagery versus verbal thought;
'How much of the time has your thinking taken the form of verbal thoughts over the past 5 minutes?', 'How much of the time has your thinking taken the form of mental imagery over the past 5 minutes?',
along with two analogue scales ranging from 'none of the time' to 'all of the time', from 0-9 where 9 indicates all of the time. A higher score indicates frequency of thought in either a visual or verbal modality.
Scale will be administered post craving induction procedure and post imagery intervention.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Positive and Negative affect Schedule (PANAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 2 ( Post Imagery Intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>A self-report questionnaire to measure positive and negative affect. The PANAS consists of 20 different affect-related words. Participants indicate if and to what extent they experience the described feeling at the moment of filling in the questionnaire. The scale ranges from 1-5, where 5 indicates a strong experience of a feeling whereas 1 indicates very slightly or not at all.
The PANAS provides two scores, one for negative affect and one for positive affect, where higher scores indicate higher levels of negative and positive affect respectively.
The PANAS will be administered post imagery intervention.</description>
