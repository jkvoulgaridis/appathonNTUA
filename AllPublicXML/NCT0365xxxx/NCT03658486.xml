  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This feasibility study will investigate whether men with metastatic prostate cancer can take
      part in and progress through a home-based exercise program. This study will evaluate the
      effects of exercise on a range of disease and treatment-related outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This 12 week multicomponent, tailored, progressive program will consist of both moderate
      intensity walking and strengthening exercises at home. This single centre, single arm study
      will incorporate a behavioural change consultation at baseline and weekly behavioural support
      throughout. This study will follow-up patients at 24 weeks to determine exercise maintenance.
      Outcome measures will be completed at baseline, 12 and 24 weeks. A qualitative evaluation
      will be conducted after the 24 week follow-up to determine impact, patient experience and
      measures that might assist in refining the program.

    <description>Patients will complete an International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ-SF). This questionnaire will comprise 4 generic items to obtain comparable health-related physical activity. Patients will detail the number of days, hours and minutes that they undertake (1) vigorous exercise (2) moderate exercise (3) walking exercise and (4) sitting. Total physical activity will be generated and monitored for improvement or decline.</description>

    <description>12 weeks of progressive, home-based, moderate intensity, aerobic and strengthening exercise. Aerobic exercise will be completed 5 days per week, commencing with a single 10 minute bout and progressing to 30 minutes of continuous brisk walking at week 12. Strengthening exercises will involve whole body activities and commence with 1 set of each exercise (8-15 repetitions) and progress to 3 sets. The strengthening exercises will gradually progress in difficulty throughout the program.</description>

    <description>Exercise programs will be individually tailored to the capabilities of each participant and gradually progressed accordingly. Each patient will be assigned a moderate intensity walking and strengthening program to complete at home. At baseline, 12 and 24 weeks patients will wear an accelerometer to determine activity levels. At these time points, patients will also complete a physical fitness assessment (timed sit-to-stand and six minute walking tests) and a range of quality of life questionnaires. At baseline, patients will receive a behaviour change consultation and continued support throughout the intervention. Each patient will receive a pedometer during the home-based, unsupervised regime to monitor step count and they are expected to complete a daily physical activity diary. Upon completion of the 24 week follow-up, patients will be invited to partake in semi-structured interviews to determine the effectiveness of the program and their experience throughout.</description>
