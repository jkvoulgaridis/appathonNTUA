  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To develop and test the effect of a patient-centered HIV prevention decision aid on HIV
      pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) uptake among women with substance use disorders (SUD) in
      treatment.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To test the effect of the informed decision aid intervention on PrEP uptake among women with
      substance use disorders in treatment. Investigators hypothesize that compared to those
      receiving standard harm reduction information, women receiving the decision aid will have a
      significant increase in PrEP uptake at 6 and 12 months post-intervention.
