  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study tests the feasibility (Phase I) and efficacy (Phase II) of PATH
      neurotraining to improve working memory and attention in mTBI patients rapidly and
      effectively to provide clinical testing of a therapeutic training for the treatment of
      neurological disorders caused by a concussion. This study will contribute to the fundamental
      knowledge of how to remediate concussions from a mTBI to enhance the health, lengthen the
      life and reduce the disabilities that result from a mTBI.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will provide clinical testing of therapeutic training for the treatment of
      neurological disorders caused by a concussion. We will extend previous results from a pilot
      study of 4 mTBI subjects (Lawton &amp; Huang, 2019) to a much larger sample of mTBI subjects.
      During Phase II we will determine whether these results are sustained over time. The proposed
      study tests the feasibility (Phase I) and efficacy (Phase II) of PATH neurotraining to
      improve working memory (primary outcome) and attention (secondary outcome) in mTBI subjects
      rapidly and effectively. This study will compare PATH training (C.3.1), presenting dim gray
      patterns moving left or right to activate the dorsal stream (Ungerleider &amp; Mishkin, 1982;
      Livingstone &amp; Hubel, 1988; Kaplan &amp; Shapley, 1986), with sham training (C.3.2), presenting
      high contrast colored stationary patterns tilted left or right to activate the parvocells in
      the ventral stream. We predict that sham training does not improve attention and working
      memory in mTBI. Since PATH training must be followed by cognitive exercises to improve
      cognitive function (Lawton, 2015, 2016), having subjects drive to and from the test site,
      when possible, provides cognitive exercises that facilitate improving cognitive function in
      mTBI. MEG recordings (Huang et al., 2014, 2016, 2018) before and after training will provide
      a biomarker to determine whether PATH training improves the function of the dorsal,
      attention, and working memory networks more than found after a sham treatment. MEG recordings
      will also be used to determine whether PATH training strengthens coupled theta/ gamma
      activity, and/or alpha/ gamma activity. To increase its commercialization ability, PATH
      neurotraining must be shown to improve brain function using a biomarker, as stated by
      neurologists and therapists in letters of support. During Phase II the impact of PATH
      neurotraining will be evaluated on a much larger sample of mTBI subjects and will be offered
      to mTBI subjects after they finish the sham training. Whether cognitive improvements are
      sustained over time will be evaluated by measuring whether mTBI subjects improve on
      neuropsychological tests of cognitive function 3 and 6 months after training.

    <intervention_model_description>During Phase I and Phase II of this study, we will show that working memory and attention improve more in TBI patients after neurotraining that improves sensory and processing speed functions, improving the motion working range (PATH), more than after sham training that activates a different visual pathway to show its feasibility and efficacy. MEG brain imaging will be used to show that PATH neurotraining improves the function of the dorsal, attention, and working memory networks (e.g., PPC, DLPFC and ACC/PCC areas), reducing over recruitment, more than found after sham training.</intervention_model_description>

Joint Estimation of Treatment and Placebo Effects in Clinical Trials with Longitudinal Blinding Assessments. A questionnaire will be administered to all participants, as well as to research assistants who are administering the task. The items will be: (1) three response categories for treatment guess: 'New treatment', 'Placebo (or control)', or 'Don't know (DK)', and (2) five response categories: 'Strongly believe the treatment is new treatment', 'Somewhat believe the treatment is new treatment', 'Somewhat believe the treatment is placebo', 'Strongly believe the treatment is placebo', or 'DK'. We may re-ask those who answered DK initially to make their best guess regarding their assignment. These data can then be used in a joint statistical model to estimate and isolate the relative effect of patient and experimenter effects on treatment efficacy.</description>

    <description>Subject looks at computer screen to determine whether dim gray stripes in fish-shaped window move left or right relative to stationary background stripes. The subject reports which way center stripes move by pushing left or right arrow key, receiving brief tone if incorrect. Program adaptively changes contrast of test pattern in order to keep subject at 79% correct. There are levels of difficulty introduced by making the background pattern more similar to that in fish, by increasing pattern's complexity level, and by increasing number of directions of movement from one to two directions of motion. Intervention will be trained for one training cycle, between 10-20 minutes, 3 times each week for 12 weeks.</description>

    <description>The sham treatment will be Orientation Discrimination training that is identical to PATH training except instead of low contrast sinewave gratings moving left or right, 100% contrast stationary test and background sinewave gratings are used, both red, green, and black and white gratings, see patterns in Fig. 4 below. These patterns are randomly oriented left or right, at decreasing tilt angles as the test grating's orientation is identified correctly. These patterns only activate parvocells in ventral pathways (Ungerleider &amp; Mishkin, 1982; Kaplan &amp; Shapley, 1986) instead of activating dorsal pathways, the key component of PATH neurotraining. Therefore, this task does not speed up the brain's visual timing, which is a function of the dorsal stream. For the Orientation Discrimination task, the subject pushes the left arrow key when the test pattern is tilted left and the right arrow key when pattern is tilted right. Otherwise the two training tasks use the same paradigm.</description>

    <description>Improve visual timing and sensitivity in the dorsal stream. The mTBI subject will sit 57 cm in front of a computer monitor. During the presentation, the bars in the 'fish-shaped' window in the center of the screen formed by a sinusoidal grating, move left or right very briefly. When the screen goes blank, the subject reports which way the center pattern moved by pushing the left or right arrow key. A brief tone is presented after incorrect responses. The program adaptively changes the contrast of the test pattern so that the subject detects motion at lowest contrast possible. A sequence of patterns in each training cycle that are designed to optimally activate magnocellular neurons are shown to the subject. There are two programs, the first measures the contrast needed to see one direction of movement, and the second program measures the contrast needed to see two directions of movement, requiring memory.</description>
