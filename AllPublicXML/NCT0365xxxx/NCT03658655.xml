      To evaluate the safety and efficacy of Stem Cells From Human Exfoliated Teethtransplantation
      in patients with type 2 diabetes to provides scientific basis for further clinical studies to
      verify the safety and efficacy of type 2 diabetes.On the basis of maintaining the original
      treatment, intravenous drip of Stem Cells From Human Exfoliated Teeth.

      Basic treatment:

      The original treatment regimen was maintained. During the study period, insulin dose could be
      adjusted with the change of blood glucose, while the type and dose of oral hypoglycemic drugs
      remained unchanged (except when side effects of drugs or insulin preparations were stopped or
      patients still had frequent hypoglycemia).

      Stem cell therapy:

      Dosage: Stem Cells From Human Exfoliated Teeth were calculated at 0.1IU/kg body weight .

      Course of treatment: 3 times, respectively at the time of enrollment, 1 week after enrollment
      and 4 weeks after enrollment.
