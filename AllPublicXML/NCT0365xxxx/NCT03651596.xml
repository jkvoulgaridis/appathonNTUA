      The overall goal of this study is to develop and test effectively framed mobile health
      (mHealth) messages to promote medication adherence in teens with chronic kidney disease
      (CKD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension is a risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression. Only 77% of
      adolescents with CKD are adherent to antihypertensive medications despite evidence that
      adherence slows disease progression. Mobile health (mHealth) applications show promise for
      improving adherence but most are not designed within health-promotion frameworks, only send
      medication reminders, use unreliable outcome measures, and/or have small effects on
      adherence. Nonadherence is a public health problem that may benefit from using health
      communication strategies to advance beyond reminders and improve mHealth efficacy. Highly
      effective health messages modify perceptions, attitudes, and skills to facilitate behavioral
      change; inappropriately framed messages (e.g., use of fear appeals) may have unintended,
      negative effects on health behaviors (i.e., reduce adherence). For adolescents with CKD,
      framing mHealth messages to motivate adherence may be a key factor in preventing disease
      progression; however, there has been little research to guide the use of this approach.
      Hence, the current study aims to develop and test effectively framed mobile health (mHealth)
      messages to promote medication adherence in teens with CKD.

      Prior to study recruitment, the intervention messages will be developed by the research team
      and key stakeholders before testing in this pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT).
      Adolescents/young adults with CKD will be invited to participate in the pilot RCT to evaluate
      the intervention messages versus an active control condition; the primary outcome is
      antihypertensive medication adherence and secondary outcomes are participants' responses to
      surveys.

    <description>The construct, beliefs about medication, is measured with the Beliefs About Medication Scale. Mean scores are calculated for the the Positive Outcome Expectancies subscale (scale range = 1 to 7, higher scores indicate more positive beliefs) and the Negative Outcome Expectancies subscale (scale range = 1 to 7, higher scores indicate more negative beliefs).</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 4 weeks before the study begins and up to 4 weeks after the study ends</time_frame>
    <description>The construct, barriers to adherence, is measured with the Adolescent Medication Barriers Scale (AMBS). The AMBS is reported as an overall mean score ranging from 1 to 5 with higher scores indicating more barriers to adherence.</description>
