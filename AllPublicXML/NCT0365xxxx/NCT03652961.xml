      The immune system of patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is different from that of people
      who do not have RA. The purpose of this study is to examine your immune cells and proteins
      before you start to take study medication and after you start treatment with an approved
      therapy for RA, abatacept that will be given in combination with Methotrexate and/or
      anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDS) that are approved for the treatment of RA. This study will
      assess whether you have clinically responded to these medications. This assessment will also
      include a study of whether characteristics of your immune system were changed by therapy with
      the study drug, abatacept.

    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Direct quantitation of the frequency of circulating Anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA)-bearing memory B cells as a percentage of total B cells and memory B cells at baseline and at followup as measured by flow cytometry. These will be correlated with clinical response.
Flow cytometric determinations of effects on B-cell subsets, to determine whether abatacept normalizes disease-associated increases in activated memory B cells, and the plasmablast expansions that are associated with active RA disease.
Serum will be collected for cytokine/chemokine profiling, which will be highly informative due to the challenge/dechallenge design.
Site will count absolute numbers of PBMC in samples obtained from defined volume of blood and calculate percentages of B cell subsets, CD4 vs CD19 ratios. And percentages of Memory vs naïve B cells amongst CD45 positive cells.</description>

    <measure>Quantification of relationships between co-primary endpoints over time and then confirm this relationship by dechallenge of Abatacept after induction of low disease activity at 24 weeks - RAPID-3 questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Abatacept therapy that induces clinical benefits, are paralleled by reductions (i.e., normalization) in the in vivo representation of disease-associated anti-citrullinated protein antigen (ACPA) memory B cells after 6 months of treatment. Response will be measured by RAPID-3 questionnaire.
The RAPID3 includes a subset of core variables found in the Multi-dimensional Health Assessment Questionnaire HAQ (MD-HAQ, scoring of physical function from 1-10 , a patient global assessment (PGA) for pain from 1-10, and a PGA for global health from 1-10. RAPID3 scores are quickly tallied by adding subsets of the MD-HAQ.
-Scoring 1-10 where 10 is maximal activity
A patient who scores between 0-1.0 is defined as near remission (NR); 1.3-2.0 as low severity (LS); 2.3-4.0 as moderate severity (MS); and 4.3-10.0 as high severity (HS).</description>

    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The CDAI is a clinical composite score for following patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
CDAI = SJC(28) + TJC(28) + PGA + EGA SJC(28): Swollen 28-Joint Count (shoulders, elbows, wrists, MCPs, PIPs including thumb IP, knees) TJC(28): Tender 28-Joint Count (shoulders, elbows, wrists, MCPs, PIPs including thumb IP, knees) PGA: Patient Global disease Activity (patient's score of overall RA disease activity on a scale 1-10 where 10 is maximal activity) EGA: Evaluator's Global disease Activity (evaluator's score of overall RA disease activity on a scale 1-10 where 10 is maximal activity) INTERPRETATION Remission CDAI ≤ 2.8 Low Disease Activity CDAI &gt; 2.8 and ≤ 10 Moderate Disease Activity CDAI &gt; 10 and ≤ 22 High Disease Activity CDAI &gt; 22 A CDAI reduction of 6.5 represents moderate improvement.</description>

    <time_frame>24 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>SJC(28): Swollen 28-Joint Count (shoulders, elbows, wrists, MCPs, PIPs including thumb IP, knees) Joint Assessor will conduct a standard 28 tender and swollen joint count of patient at each visit throughout the trial. The swollen joint count is the amount of inflamed synovial tissue, and the tender joint count scores the level of pain. This score will be used in the Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) calculation.</description>

                  exempt from contraceptive requirements. However they must still undergo pregnancy
                  testing as described in this section. Investigators shall counsel WOCBP and male
                  subjects who are sexually active with WOCBP on the importance of pregnancy
                  prevention and the implications of an unexpected pregnancy.

               9. Investigators shall advise WOCBP and male subjects who are sexually active with
                  WOCBP on the use of highly effective methods of contraception. Highly effective
                  methods of contraception have a failure rate of &lt; 1% when used consistently and

              10. At a minimum, subjects must agree to use one highly effective method of
                  contraception as listed below.

          -  Highly effective methods of contraception

               1. Highly effective methods of contraception have a failure rate of &lt; 1% when used
                  consistently and correctly. WOCBP and female partners of male subjects, who are
                  WOCBP, are expected to use one of the highly effective methods of contraception
                  listed below. Male subjects must inform their female partners who are WOCBP of
                  the contraceptive requirements of the protocol and are expected to adhere to
                  using contraception with their partner.

                    1. Progestogen only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of
                       ovulation.

                    2. Hormonal methods of contraception including oral contraceptive pills
                       containing estrogen + progesterone, vaginal ring, injectables, implants and
                       intrauterine devices (IUDs) such as Mirena

                    3. Nonhormonal IUDs, such as ParaGard

                    4. Bilateral Tubal occlusion

                    5. Vasectomized partner with documented azoospermia 90 days after procedure

               2. Vasectomized partner is a highly effective birth control method provided that
                  partner is the sole sexual partner of the WOCBP trial participant and that the
                  vasectomized partner has received medical assessment of the surgical success.

               3. Intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS)

               4. Complete abstinence- Complete abstinence is defined as the complete avoidance of
                  heterosexual intercourse

                    1. complete abstinence is an acceptable form of contraception for all study
                       drugs and must be used throughout the duration of the study treatment (plus
                       5 half-lives of the investigational drug plus 30 days).

                    2. It is not necessary to use any other method of contraception when complete
                       abstinence is elected.

                    3. Subjects who choose complete abstinence must continue to have pregnancy
                       tests

                    4. Acceptable alternate methods of highly effective contraception must be
                       discussed in the event that the subject chooses to forego complete
                       abstinence.

                    5. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to
                       the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of
                       the subject.
