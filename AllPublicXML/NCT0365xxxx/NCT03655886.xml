  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to the guidelines of the European Association of Urology (EAU), the first-line
      treatment for newly diagnosed mPC consists of immediate castration with the addition of
      docetaxel or abiraterone acetate. As seen in other well-known solid tumours - such as
      ovarian, colon and renal cancer - local treatment (LT) of the primary tumour could lead to a
      survival benefit compared to standard of care (SOC). Several retrospective studies have
      suggested a survival benefit of local treatment of the primary tumour with SOC versus SOC
      only in mPC. These patients also have less local symptoms of their disease, which has a major
      impact on quality of life (QoL). Several prospective studies have already been set up to
      compare either surgery or radiotherapy with the SOC. In expectation of their results and
      because randomization seems challenging, the investigators want to set up a trial to evaluate
      the feasibility of randomization between both local treatment groups.
