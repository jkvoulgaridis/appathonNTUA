  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medication reconciliation is a systematic process by which health care professionals obtain
      the most complete and accurate information about the drugs regularly taken by patients.
      Internationally, the value of this procedure is mainly attributed to the reduction in the
      number of adverse drug events, which can cause drug-related morbidity and mortality, as well
      as unnecessary health care costs.

      As part of the Progress! Pilot project Safe Pharmacotherapy at the interface points, promoted
      by the Federal Office of Public Health, coordinated by the Swiss Patients Safety Foundation
      and held in several Swiss hospitals, medication reconciliation at hospital admission was
      introduced at the regional hospital Beata Vergine in Mendrisio, from 2014 to 2016. During
      this pilot project it was shown that medication reconciliation after obtaining the best
      possible medication history by a pharmacist at hospital admission, in comparison with the
      standard medication history obtained by the physician at admission, reduced the number of
      clinically relevant drug discrepancies.

      A structured, well-established and practicable procedure of medication reconciliation that
      improves patient safety assuring a better quality of care at hospital admission might provide
      evidence that medication reconciliation could be a valuable intervention to be applied
      systematically in all EOC hospitals at admission, as well as subsequently potentially at the
      other hospital interfaces.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether obtaining the best possible medication
      history and performing medication reconciliation at hospital admission results in improving
      some specific healthcare outcomes.

      The study seeks primarily to determine if obtaining the best possible medication history and
      performing medication reconciliation, in comparison with the standard medication history,
      reduces the number of subsequent unplanned all-cause hospital visits (readmissions and
      emergency department visits within 30 days after initial discharge). As secondary objectives,
      the study aims at assessing if best possible medication history with medication
      reconciliation, in comparison with the standard medication history, reduces the incidence of
      adverse drug reactions during hospital stay, shortens length of stay, leads to a reduction in
      the use of hospital resources, and/or is associated with a decreased number of deaths.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients of the control group will not receive the best possible medication history with
      medication reconciliation at admission. The standard physician-acquired medication history
      will be performed as usual.

      Eligible patients, randomized within the intervention arm, will receive medication
      reconciliation according to the following steps:

        1. The pharmacy assistant will obtain the best possible medication history by compiling a
           comprehensive list of the medications the patient is taking and details about how the
           drugs are taken. In order to confirm the accuracy of the history, the pharmacy assistant
           will use at least two sources of information, one of which being, when possible, the
           interview with the patient and/or family members, in addition to referral letters,
           prescriptions and drug lists from primary care centres, and other.

        2. The clinical pharmacist will reconcile best possible medication history with prescribed
           medicines and, to resolve unclear or ambiguous discrepancies between the two lists
           and/or to propose any adaptations of the pharmacotherapy, the clinical pharmacist will
           refer to the medical doctor.

        3. The medical doctor will decide potential changes in pharmacotherapy and communicate them
           to the patient providing complete information on medicines.

    <description>To measure the incidence of ADRs developed by patients during the hospital stay, the active pharmacovigilance system currently in use at the Centro Regionale di Farmacovigilanza del Canton Ticino, will be exploited. EMRs identified through this system and referring to patients from both the two study sites, aged ≥85 years or with more than 10 medications at admission, will be manually validated (to discard false positive cases). Subsequently, ADRs will be categorized as not serious or serious (according to the WHO seriousness criteria, for resulting in death, being life threatening, prolonging hospitalization, resulting in persistent disability or incapacity and other). Outcome assessor will be masked to group allocation. At the end of the analysis, ADRs will be matched to either the intervention or the control group</description>
