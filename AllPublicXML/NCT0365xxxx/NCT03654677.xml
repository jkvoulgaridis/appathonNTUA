  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity after one primary
      dose and one additional dose (administered twice at an interval of 6 months) of inactivated
      hepatitis A vaccine are administered in adolescents (16 years of age or older) or adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For this, a two-group comparison study will be conducted using a previously approved
      inactivated hepatitis A vaccine (Havrix Inj., manufactured by GSK) as the control vaccine to
      prove that the immunogenicity of the test vaccine treatment group is not inferior to the
      control vaccine treatment group and to statistically confirm that there is no difference in
      safety.
