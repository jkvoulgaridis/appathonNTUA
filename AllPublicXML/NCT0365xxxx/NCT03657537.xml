  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes negatively affects cognition and increases the risk of developing overt dementia.
      Decreased cerebral glucose metabolism may be contributing to this effect, thus providing a
      glucose substitute using ketone bodies might improve neuronal function.

      In this study the investigators propose to provide quantitative results on cognitive
      performance during acute hyperketonemia in patients with type 2 diabetes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It has been proposed that hypometabolism in the brain contributes to the neuropathology that
      leads to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Additionally cognitive disturbances in patients with AD
      are associated with and paralleled by a decrease in cerebral glucose metabolism. This AD-like
      reduction in cerebral metabolism has also been associated with insulin-resistance, and may
      contribute to one of the links between diabetes and AD. Therefore manipulating
      neuro-energetics by providing a glucose substitute seems to be a means of improving neuronal
      function.

      Here the investigators will examine the effect of ketone bodies on cognitive performance in
      patients with type 2 diabetes by a randomized cross-over trial. Each subject will meet for
      two experimental visits separated by 2-6 weeks. During the two visit days subjects will, in a
      randomized order, receive ketone bodies (β-hydroxybutyrate) or placebo (saline)
      intravenously. On both test days plasma glucose levels will be clamped. After glucose levels
      have been stabilized cognitive performance will be assessed by a battery of validated
      cognitive tests.
