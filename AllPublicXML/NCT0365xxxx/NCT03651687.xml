      Screening for microcephaly is important at birth and during early childhood. The Guangzhou
      Surveillance and Clinical Study in Microcephaly (GSCSM) aims to establish a multicentric
      surveillance system for microcephaly in newborns and infants, to develop a new head
      circumference reference and microcephaly criteria basing on the local population in
      Guangzhou, to improve the prediction model of microcephaly, and to follow up the outcomes of
      the children diagnosed with microcephaly.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Microcephaly is associated with neurological dysfunctions in infants and children. There is
      not a uniform diagnostic criteria for microcephaly. The World Health Organization (WHO)
      recommended a criteria of head circumference (HC) less than 2 standard deviations (SD) below
      the mean of the Intergrowth-21 standard, which was found not applicable to the newborns and
      infants in Guangzhou.In the GSCSM, the HC measures of newborns are conducted by trained
      midwives using a standard tool, and extensive information including adverse perinatal
      outcomes are collected. Longitudinal follow up of infants' neurodevelopment in cognitive,
      motor, emotional and other domains are also to be conducted. The GSCSM intends to find out
      the infants who are 'real microcephaly' and most at risk of short-term or long-term adverse
      outcomes in Guangzhou.
