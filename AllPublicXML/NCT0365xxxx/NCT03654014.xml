      Pulsed Electromagnetic Field (PEMF) Reduction of CSF and Serum Biomarkers After Traumatic
      Brain Injury (TBI).

      The primary objective of this pilot study is to determine whether PEMF treatment (PEMF+)
      reduces the magnitude and duration of the increase in CSF and blood biomarkers after
      traumatic brain injury (TBI) compared to a PEMF untreated (PEMF-) group. Values in both
      groups are compared to uninjured brain CSF and blood biomarker levels obtained from
      hydrocephalus patients undergoing ventriculo-peritoneal shunt placement. A secondary
      objective of this pilot study is to determine whether PEMF treatment improves the physiologic
      status of the brain as evaluated by brain tissue monitors of thermal dilution cerebral blood
      flow (CBF), intracranial pressure (ICP), and tissue PO2 (PbtO2). Improved physiologic status
      would be reflected by increased CBF, PbtO2, and reduced ICP. Improved physiologic status may
      also be inferred from derived variables reflecting improved cerebrovascular and intracranial
      pressure autoregulation.

      A tertiary objective of this pilot study is to obtain preliminary data on the relationship
      between the time course and magnitude of post-TBI CSF and blood biomarker levels as they
      relate to three month outcome by Glasgow outcome score extended (GOSE) and modified Rankin
      Score (mRS).

      Investigators will enroll a total of 45 subjects, 30 after TBI and 15 patients with
      hydrocephalus having ventriculo-peritoneal shunts inserted. It is anticipated that in order
      to enroll 30 TBI participants investigators will need to screen approximately 50 subjects;
      and for the patients undergoing ventriculo-peritoneal shunt placement we will need to screen
      30 patients in order to enroll 15. Of the 30 TBI patients, 15 will have PEMF+ and 15 will
      have PEMF-. PEMF+ means that the device will be in place and will be on, PEMF- means that the
      device will be in place but will not be turned on.

      The study will be double blinded. The honest broker (HB) Dr. Amal Alchbli, will not be
      involved in the study except to turn on the PEMF device with the indicator light showing when
      the PEMF device is on , will be hidden from view by tape. The HB will keep a list of the
      patients treated with PEMF+ or not PEMF- along with their MRN# coded and the start and end
      times of PEMF treatment during their stay in the NSI. The nurses in the unit will be asked to
      indicate on the CNS monitor when the PEMF applicators are on or off the patient.

      The subjects will participate in this study for up to one week while in the Neuroscience
      Intensive Care Unit (NSI). There will also be follow up on secondary clinical outcome
      measures at discharge, one and three months post discharge. The one and three month follow
      ups will be conducted over the phone.

      The duration of enrollment is expected to be two years. The estimated date for the
      investigators to complete this study (complete primary analyses) is 3.0 years.

      The estimated time for data retention is 5 years.

    <description>The Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) is a global scale for functional outcome that rates patient status into one of five categories: Dead, Vegetative State, Severe Disability, Moderate Disability or Good Recovery. The Extended GOS (GOSE) provides more detailed categorization into eight categories by subdividing the categories of severe disability, moderate disability and good recovery into a lower and upper category:
