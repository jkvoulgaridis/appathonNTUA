  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Respiratory complications range from 8% to 79% of the frequency after open heart surgery
      where the patient is on-pump operated by cardiopulmonary machine. There were many changes in
      physiology due to anesthesia and cardiac surgery which cause volume and barotrauma
      complications with mechanical ventilation. These complications increase cost by prolonging
      morbidity and morbidity as well as hospital stay. Intraoperative and postoperative mechanical
      ventilation strategies can prevent these complications. CPB stimulates the systemic
      inflammatory response to the secretion of neutrophil, endotoxin and proinflammatory cytokines
      in the complex, increasing the permeability of the capillaries. Although coronary artery
      bypass graft surgery (CABG) is associated with a 0.4% to 2.0% acute respiratory distress
      syndrome (ARDS), mortality is quite high. Lung-protective ventilation strategies commonly
      used for prevention of ARDS. Ferrando et al. have proposed pulmonary ventilation with a tidal
      volume (TV) of less than 10 mL / kg as a pulmonary intraoperative protective ventilation
      strategy. Investigators aimed to compare oxygenation and ventilation parameters with
      respiratory mechanics in patients who underwent open heart surgery and were ventilated with 6
      ml / kg tidal volume and 8 ml / kg TV, which were recommended as lung protective ventilation
      strategies during anesthesia.
