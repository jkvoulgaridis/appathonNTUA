  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized controlled trial that will enroll patients undergoing
      unilateral meniscal root repair or meniscus transplant. The objective of this study is to
      determine if immediate postoperative strength training of the contralateral (non-surgical)
      lower extremity reduces postoperative loss of strength in an immobilized lower extremity.

      After the completion of surgery, patients will be randomized to either the experimental
      treatment (Group 1) or control group (Group II)for postoperative rehabilitation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Group I will receive knee flexion and extension strength training exercises for the
      contralateral (non-operative) lower extremity in addition to standard of care postoperative
      rehabilitation. The experimental strength training will be performed with moderate resistance
      and will require moderate effort. Exercises will include unilateral leg presses, lunges, step
      ups, and step downs. These exercises are performed as standard of care but are not typically
      introduced into the physical therapy regimen until 10-12 weeks postoperatively. In the
      experimental group, these exercises will be introduced starting with the first postoperative
      physical therapy session, but only for the contralateral (non-operative) leg.
