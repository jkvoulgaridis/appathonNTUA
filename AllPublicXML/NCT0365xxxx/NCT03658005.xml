      The purpose of this study is to assess:

        -  the population pharmacokinetics of unbound ticagrelor and its metabolite in acute
           coronary syndrome patients treated by ticagrelor

        -  ticagrelor and its metabolite levels by LC-MS/MS
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ticagrelor is an anti-platelet agent of the cyclopentyltriazolopyrimidine class. It is
      administered by the oral route, rapidly absorbed (2-3 hours), and has a bio-availability
      estimated at around 36%. Contrary to other P2Y12 inhibitors, ticagrelor is not a pro-drug and
      does not need to be metabolized to exert is pharmacodynamic effect. It had been previously
      showed that stimulation of platelets by ADP or inhibitors of platelets by ticagrelor modified
      the organisation of the platelet membrane, with a re-distribution of cholesterol and P2Y12
      receptors towards the lipid rafts. This suggests that lipid membranes and cholesterol may
      play an important role in the anti-platelet activity of ticagrelor.

      In this context, the aim of the study is to assess:

        -  the population pharmacokinetics of unbound ticagrelor and its metabolite in acute
           coronary syndrome patients treated by ticagrelor

        -  ticagrelor and its metabolite levels by LC-MS/MS.
