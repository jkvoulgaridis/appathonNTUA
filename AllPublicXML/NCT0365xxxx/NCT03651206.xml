  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Carcinosarcomas (CS) (malignant mixed Müllerian tumors) are highly aggressive and rare tumors
      with a worldwide annual incidence between 0.5-3.3 cases/100.000 women. Gynecological CS, i.e.
      ovarian CS (OCS) and uterine CS (UCS), have a 5-year overall survival (OS) &lt; 10% and a poor
      prognosis. After initial treatment (surgery +/- adjuvant radiotherapies +/- chemotherapies
      (CT)), vast majority of patients relapsed and received diverse CT producing modest benefits,
      and nearly all patients will die. After first line CT including platinum salt, monotherapy
      (doxorubicin or paclitaxel) is frequently used for relapsed patients, but the response rate
      (RR) is &lt;20%, progression-free survival (PFS) &lt;4 months, and OS &lt;1 year. In this unmet need
      situation, a better knowledge of these aggressive neoplasms is essential to propose new
      therapeutic options.
