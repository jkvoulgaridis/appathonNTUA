  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a phase II study to evaluate the efficacy of carboplatin
      monotherapy in the tumor subgroup of metastatic castration-resistant prostatic carcinomas
      with somatic abnormality in the Homologous Recombination (HR) pathway.

      This study may also better characterize the molecular abnormalities of tumors required for
      the carboplatin response

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients &gt; 18 years old

          -  Patients with adenocarcinoma or poorly differentiated prostate carcinoma,
             histologically confirmed (small-cell histology or high-grade neuroendocrine histology
             excluded)

          -  Tumor presenting a somatic pathogenic variant likely to alter the homologous
             recombination pathway previously detected on a tumor biopsy or on circulating tumor
             DNA, or germinal mutation among the list of genes defined in the study

          -  Castration-resistant tumor defined by progression despite well-conducted androgen
             deprivation treatment: testosterone ≤50ng /dL agonist / antagonist of luteinizing
             hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) or surgical castration. The patient must agree to
             continue concomitant LHRH-mediated (agonist or antagonist) therapy throughout the
             duration of the study regimen for patients with no history of surgical castration.

          -  Patients must have performed at least one line of chemotherapy by taxane in case of
             castration resistance:

               -  Patients who have received docetaxel treatment in a hormone-sensitive situation
                  must have received at least treatment with cabazitaxel in case of castration
                  resistance

               -  Patients who have not received chemotherapy in a hormone-sensitive situation must
                  have received docetaxel AND cabazitaxel or have a contraindication to discontinue
                  treatment.

          -  Patients must have been treated with at least 2nd generation hormone therapy (eg,
             abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide)

          -  Patients may have been treated with a poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor (PARP)

          -  Performance Status &lt;2

          -  Metastatic disease progressive

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Absence of previous treatment with taxane in situation of sensitivity or resistance to
             castration.

          -  Absence of previous treatment with cabazitaxel in case of resistance to castration
             (except contraindication explaining the non-administration of treatment)

          -  No treatment with 2nd generation hormone therapy (eg abiraterone acetate or
             enzalutamide) unless contraindicated to explain non-administration of treatment

          -  Previous treatment with platinum

          -  Symptomatic and untreated central nervous system (CNS) metastases. Patients with
             asymptomatic and pre-treated CNS metastases are included if they are clinically stable
             (not requiring corticosteroid therapy for 28 days) and must have a brain MRI
             evaluation at screening and during follow-up.
