    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to analyse the efficacy of MACS technique for the selection of
      spermatozoa and its effects on implantation, pregnancy and miscarriage rate. This study will
      be performed by two IVI clinics (IVI Sevilla and IVI Madrid) with the purpose of finding new
      techniques that allow us to better select spermatozoa and improve the results of assisted
      reproduction techniques.

    <description>MACS is a technique that allow us to tag and detect apoptotic spermatozoa. These apoptotic spermatozoa have phosphatidylserine in their membranes, so we add magnetic beads with Annexin V, which binds specifically to phosphatidylserine. The spermatozoa are then tagged and can be retained in a magnetic field, allowing us to collect just the non-apoptotic spermatozoa.</description>
