  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to 1) investigate the differences and variances in circadian rhythms at
      several levels, including physical activity, dim light melatonin onset, diurnal patterns of
      cortisol, and body temperature between the offspring of patients with bipolar disorder (BD)
      and offspring of healthy parents by using a high-risk study design; and 2) determine whether
      these indicators correlate with psychopathological symptoms as measured by the psychometric
      measurements.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bipolar disorder (BD), characterized by episodes of mania or hypomania with frequent
      depressive episodes, is commonly found in the general population with a lifetime prevalence
      of 1-2% in the world. The morbidities and mortality associated with bipolar disorder are huge
      and the repercussion on their family members is considerate. Nonetheless, there is no
      existing well-established prevention strategy that may prevent this distressing mental
      disorder. A major reason is that there was limited understanding of the prodromal phase of
      BD. On the other hand, the genetic background determines about 60-85% of risk variance of BD.
      In other words, the offspring carries significant risk and propensity to develop future BD.
      Limited existing studies suggested that offspring of patients with BD have a higher rate of
      sleep and circadian disturbances and mental disorders than those offspring of parents without
      BD. Nonetheless, it is still unclear whether sleep and circadian disturbances are prodromal
      markers or risk factors for the development of bipolar disorder in this high-risk population.

      In light of our research and other studies' preliminary findings on the relationship between
      circadian rhythms dysregulation and BD and robust heritability in BD, we hypothesize that

        1. Circadian rhythm dysregulations are prodromal features and endophenotypes of BD. The
           offspring of BD parents will have more circadian rhythm dysregulations than those
           offspring of healthy controls;

        2. The biologic indices of circadian rhythm dysregulations will be correlated with
           subsyndromal psychopathology.

    <measure>Dim light melatonin onset (DLMO, free day)</measure>
    <time_frame>9 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The subjects will be instructed to arrive at our sleep laboratory 9 hours before their usual bedtime. Saliva samples will be collected into clear sterile tubes every 30 minutes for eight hours, starting six hours before and 2 hours after individual's habitual bedtime. Subjects will be asked to stay in the light-controlled study room (&lt;30 lux in any direction of gaze) and remain awake and sit quietly.</description>

    <measure>Actigraphy and sleep diary</measure>
    <time_frame>one week</time_frame>
    <description>One-week Actigraphy (GENEActiv) and sleep diary will be employed to continuously measure sleep/wake patterns and physical activity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Body temperature</measure>
    <time_frame>one week</time_frame>
    <description>Consecutive one-week period Skin temperature will be measured by iButton DS1921H (Dallas, Maxim) at 3 places: right on the middle of the frontal aspect of the thigh, abdomen (1 cm above the navel), and the right infraclavicular area. It has been demonstrated that iButton has satisfactory validity, reliability, and utility in the measurements of circadian rhythms and sleep/wake cycles.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Circadian rhythm pattern of salivary cortisol (free day)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will be instructed to collect saliva samples using salivettes upon awakening (0 minute, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, and 45 minutes to measure cortisol awakening response) and then every 4 hours to measure the circadian rhythm patterns of cortisol secretion.</description>

    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>During the night of DLMO measure, all subjects will be instructed to collect a 24-h urinary samples (nearly 1000 mL) for the urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin assessment.</description>

    <measure>Sleep macroarchitecture by polysomnography</measure>
    <time_frame>One-night (nearly 8 hours)</time_frame>
    <description>One-night polysomnographic assessment will be measured to document the sleep architecture, together with DLMO measure. The recordings include electro-oculogram (EOG), electroencephalogram (EEG), electromyogram (EMG; monitoring over chin and bilateral anterior tibialis muscles), electrocardiogram (ECG), nasal-oral airflow and respiratory movements. The PSG data will be scored according to the most updated scoring manual of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine.</description>

    <description>Chronotype will be estimated by the Morningness-eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ) or the Children's ChronoType Questionnaire (CCTQ). Sleep disorders, such as insomnia and delayed sleep phase disorder, will be also determined by the Diagnostic Interview for Sleep Patterns and Disorders (DISP).</description>

        Patients with BD will be recruited from psychiatry outpatient clinics in Hong Kong and
        mainland China. Healthy parents will be recruited from our on-going community-based
        projects. In addition, the investigators will also recruit subjects through public
        advertisement through various media such as Facebook, poster, and emails. In view of the
        potential sex differences in these circadian rhythms indicators of interest, the adolescent
        offspring of healthy parents will be age- and sex-matched to the adolescent offspring of BD
        parents.
