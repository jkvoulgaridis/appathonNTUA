  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a new therapeutic tool used in
      psychiatry. Non-invasive, well tolerated and requiring no premedication, it is performed on
      an outpatient basis. The principle of this technique is to stimulate the cerebral cortex from
      an electromagnetic coil placed on the scalp. Unlike electroconvulsive therapy, rTMS induces
      an electrical current on a well-defined region of the cerebral cortex.

      In psychiatry, this technique is mainly considered in the treatment of depressive disorders
      resistant to antidepressant medication. The brain target, obtained from brain imaging data in
      depressed patients, is the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). The Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) has recognized the interest of rTMS for treating depressive disorders
      (October 7, 2008).

      However, some stimulation parameters still need to be optimized before rTMS can be considered
      a therapeutic method in its own right and used routinely. Indeed, its effectiveness over time
      has not yet been evaluated, and rTMS has shown a lack of reproducibility between subjects
      [Foucher, 2007]. Finally, the therapeutic results of rTMS are very modest whatever the study
      [Daskalakis, 2008]. Additional studies are therefore needed to optimize stimulation
      parameters.
