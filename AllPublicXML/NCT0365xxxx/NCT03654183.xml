      Predictive value of intraoperative indocyanine green clearance measurement during selective
      hepatic vascular trial clamping on remnant liver function after anatomic liver resection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, we will prospectively and consecutively enroll patients undergoing
      hemi-hepatectomy or lateral segmentectomy. ICG clearance measurements will be performed both
      preoperatively and intraoperatively under partial blood blocking of resecting segments. This
      study will use PHLF, C-D grade, MELD grade and postoperative hospital stay to evaluate and
      compare the potential of these measurements to predict postoperative liver function.
      Accordingly, we are supposed to demonstrate the sensitivity and specificity of intraoperative
      ICG clearance measurement in detecting postoperative liver failure. Furthermore, cut-off
      values would be defined to identify high, medium or low risk patients.

    <description>Severe posthepatectomy liver failure (PHLF) was defined as Serum total bilirubin more than 120umol/L, prothrombin activity more than 50% or PHLF grade B/C. PHLF grade was defined by the International Study Group of Liver Surgery (ISGLS). Grade A PHLF requires no change of the patient's clinical management. The clinical management of patients with grade B PHLF deviates from the regular course but does not require invasive therapy. The need for invasive treatment defines grade C PHLF.</description>

    <description>Grade I surgical complication was defined as any deviation from the normal postoperative course without the need for pharmacological treatment of surgical, endoscopic, and radiological interventions; grade II surgical complication was defined as requiring pharmacological treatment with drugs other than such allowed for grade I complications, blood transfusions and total parenteral nutrition are also included; grade III surgical complication was defined as requiring surgical, endoscopic or radiological intervention; grade IV surgical complication was defined as life-threatening complication requiring IC/ICU management; and grade V surgical complication was defined as death of a patient.</description>
