    <textblock>
      A Phase 1, Randomised, Double-blind, Single-centre, Placebo-controlled, Dose-Escalation study
      to evaluate the Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of single S.C. doses of RD01
      (Pegerythropoietin) in Healthy Chinese Subjects. Doses were escalated from 0.2μg/kg up to
      4.8μg/kg with 12 subjects (randomized to 5:1 for test or placebo) in every cohort.
