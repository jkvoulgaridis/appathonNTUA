  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (TKA) was introduced to attempt to enhance the
      precision of bone preparation, component alignment and ultimately improve clinical results
      and survivorship of TKA. Although several published data suggest that bone preparation, and
      knee component alignment were improved by using robotic assistance, there is no high-quality
      evidence from randomized trials at long-term of which investigators are aware evaluating
      whether the improved bone preparation and knee component alignment improved clinical function
      or longevity of the TKA.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Robotic-assisted TKA was introduced in an attempt to enhance component alignment and to
      improve long-term clinical results and implant durability, particularly in younger patients.
      Several comparative studies of conventional and robotic-assisted TKAs demonstrated that
      improved alignment of the components was obtained after the robotic-assisted TKAs than
      conventional TKAs.

      To date, however, no comprehensive synthesis of long-term randomized data has been conducted
      specifically for robotic-assisted TKA, particularly in younger patients. It is crucial to
      determine whether improved alignment of the TKA components obtained by using
      robotic-assistance, would improve better long-term and functional results and survivorship of
      TKAs.

      The aims of the current study were to examine the two groups of patients after long-term
      follow-up to determine whether the clinical results, radiographic and CT scan results, and
      the survivorship of TKA would be better after robotic-assisted TKA than after conventional
      TKA.

    <description>A tool to evaluate patient function associated with knee. The WOMAC measures five items for pain (score range 0-20), two for stiffness (score range 0-8), and 17 for functional limitation (score range 0-68). The total score is summed from individual sections, and 0 is the best possible score.</description>

    <description>Total knee arthroplasty is carried out with help of robotic surgery system, using a Robodoc system. CT-based preoperative planning using ORTHODOC (Integrated Surgical Technology Corp) performed in the first step before the day of surgery, and the robotic-assisted surgery using the ROBODOC surgical assistance in the second step. The bone markers are registered to the computer, and the computer arm does all the cutting and preparation of bones. This is in contrast to conventional jigs and cutting blocks. Actual implantation of the implants is done by a surgeon. A Duracon posterior cruciate-substituting total knee prosthesis (Stryker Orthopedics, Mahawh, NJ, USA) are used in all knees.</description>

    <description>Total knee arthroplasty is carried out with classical, conventional, manual method. A surgeon measures the angle, length of the cuts with bone landmarks and specialized surgical instruments. After all the cuts actual implantation is done. A Duracon posterior cruciate-substituting total knee prosthesis (Stryker Orthopedics, Mahawh, NJ, USA) are used in all knees.</description>
