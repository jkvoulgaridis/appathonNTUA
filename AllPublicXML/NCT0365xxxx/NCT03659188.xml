  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients at the Orthodontic Department of University of Damascus Dental School will be
      examined and subjects who meet the inclusion criteria will be included.

      Then, initial diagnostic records (diagnostic gypsum models, internal and external oral
      photographs, as well as radiographic images) will be studied to ensure that the selection
      criteria are accurately matched.

      The aim of this study is to compare flapless bone cutting by mechanical drills to evaluate
      the acceleration of the retraction of upper canines versus traditional bone cutting by
      piezo-surgery in comparison with a control group without bone cutting after extraction of
      upper first premolars in class II type I patients.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Canine Retraction Speed</measure>
    <time_frame>T1: At the end of alignment (which is expected within 3 months); T2: 1 month after canine retraction; T3: After two months; T4: After 3 months; T5: at the end of canine retraction which is expected within 5 months</time_frame>
    <description>The rate at which canine is going to be retracted (mm/month) in each group will be calculated.
This outcome will be measured by the following steps:
Drawing a projection from the upper canine apex to the middle palatal bone line.
Drawing a projection from the mesial ending of the third palatal rugae to the middle palatal bone line.
Measuring the distance (mm) between the two orthogonal projections.
The rate of canine retraction will be measured by dividing the distance between the two orthogonal projections by the time elapsed between assessment times.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Anchorage Loss</measure>
    <time_frame>T1: At the end of alignment (which is expected within 3 months); T2: 1 month after canine retraction; T3: After two months; T4: After 3 months; T5: at the end of canine retraction which is expected within 5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Anchorage loss in related the mesial drift of the first molar. This outcome will be measured by drawing two projections from the central groove of the first maxillary molar and the mesial ending of the third palatal rugae to the middle palatal bone line. The mesial migration of the first maxillary molar (mm) will be measured by dividing the distance between the two projections by the time elapsed between assessment times.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Canine Rotation</measure>
    <time_frame>T1: At the end of alignment (which is expected within 3 months); T2: 1 month after canine retraction; T3: After two months; T4: After 3 months; T5: at the end of canine retraction which is expected within 5 months</time_frame>
    <description>The angle between the middle palatal bone and the line through the mesial and distal edges of the canine will be measured on each side. The rotation will be assessed by calculating the difference between the angles on two different times. Then, the speed of rotation will be calculated by dividing the rotation angle (degrees) by time that elapsed between assessment times.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Canine Axis</measure>
    <time_frame>T1: at the end of the alignment stage (which is expected within 3 to 4 months); T2: at the end of the canine retraction stage (which is expected to occur with 4 to five months following the onset of this stage).</time_frame>
    <description>The changes in the canine axis during retraction will be studied by calculating canine angulation (arithmetic mean of the angulation of the right and left upper canine axis with the anterior cranial base plane) on lateral cephalometric radiographs. The difference between the canine angulation on T1 and T2 will be calculated after comparing the two cephalometric using Viewbox version 4.0.0.98.</description>
