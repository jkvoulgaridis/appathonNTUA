  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dexmedetomidine（DEX）is a potent and highly selective α 2 adrenergic receptor agonist. It has
      the pharmacological effects of sedation, hypnosis, analgesia, anti-sympathetic and
      neuroprotective. Its sedative effect is similar to normal sleep, and easy to wake up. DEX is
      widely used clinically because of its advantages and acceptable side effects. The best
      clinical use of DEX is uncertain, including intravenous, intramuscular, oral, intralnasal and
      sublingual administration. Its clinical recommended use is intravenous load infusion for more
      than 10 minutes, followed by continuous infusion. However, the clinical recommended usage is
      inconvenient, time-consuming and other shortcomings, for the growing popularity of daytime
      surgery, will inevitably affect the operation process and turnover. If a suitable dose range
      of DEX can be found for a single intravenous injection to achieve clinical efficacy quickly
      without significant hemodynamic effects, this will improve the patient's postoperative
      recovery. We will speed up the utilization and turnover of medical resources. The aim of this
      study was to investigate the optimal dosage of DEX for single intravenous injection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing thyroidectomy under general anesthesia were treated with routine
      anesthesia induction and maintenance, and DEX was injected intravenously 30 minutes before
      the end of operation. Single bolus is for more than 1 minute. In the first case, the dosage
      of DEX was 0.1 ug/kg. If the cardiovascular reaction was positive (MAP or heart rate was more
      than 20% before intravenous injection), the dosage of DEX in the next patient decreased by a
      gradient (0.05ug/kg). If the cardiovascular response was negative, the next patient increased
      the dose of DEX by a gradient (0.1ug/kg); if a patient withdrew from the study, the next
      patient received the same dose as the patient who withdrew. There were 8 turning points of
      cardiovascular reaction and the test was completed. The changes of blood pressure and heart
      rate per minute in 10min were recorded after single bolus. The dosimetric map of patients
      with DEX was drawn, and the ED50 and ED95 were calculated by probit probabilistic unit
      regression (Bills method).
