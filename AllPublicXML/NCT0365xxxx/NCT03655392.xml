    <textblock>
      Background: Patient education is one of the pillars of asthma treatment according to GINA
      guidelines. It has considered essential for adherence to treatment and for correct technique
      of inhaled devices.

      Objective: analyze clinical, functional and inflammatory features of adult patients with
      partly controlled and uncontrolled asthma, before and after an educational intervention.
      Methods: 58 adult asthmatic patients (18-70 years old) were randomized into two groups:
      intervention group (IG) (n=38) or control group (CG) (n=26). IG patients were submitted to
      three 30-minutes intervention of a shortterm educational program delivered by a nurse in 3
      visits with a one-month interval. CG group did not receive educational intervention. All
      patients were submitted to a spirometry, induced sputum collection, nitric oxide measure,
      collecting exhaled condensed (cytokine analysis) air and it's ph measure, Asthma Control Test
      (ACT), Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ), Asthma Quality Life Questionnaire (AQLQ), Beck
      Depression Inventory (BDI), and answered a symptoms diary, Statistical analysis: repeated
      measures (Sigma Plot Software 3.0).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Induced sputum samples to assess airway inflammation</measure>
    <time_frame>One day</time_frame>
    <description>Induced sputum samples were collected in 3 visits with a one-month interval to assess the degree of airway inflammation. Markers of inflammation included eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes and total cell counts, as well as cytokines in the sputum supernatant. In the processing performed the subjects received up to three nebulizations with 3% hypertonic saline, the aerosol was generated by an ultrasonic nebulizer (Ultraneb 99; DeVilbiss, Somerset, PA) each challenge was monitored with peak flow before, after and between nebulizations.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pulmonary function by spirometry</measure>
    <time_frame>One day</time_frame>
    <description>Pulmonary function was assessed by spirometry pre and after bronchodilator (Salbutamol, short action beta-agonist), according to ATS guidelines, in 3 visits with a one-month interval after withholding short-acting beta-agonists for ≥ 6 hours and long-acting betaagonist for ≥ 24hours. Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) % predicted was used as a proxy variable for overall lung function</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Asthma control by Asthma Control Test (ACT)</measure>
    <time_frame>One day</time_frame>
    <description>Asthma Control Test (ACT) was used to assess clinical control of asthma in the last month; is a questionnaire composed of five questions (score varying from 5 to 25 points) assessing asthma in relation to physical activity limitation, nocturnal and diurnal symptoms, shortness of breath and use of rescue medication. The higher the overall score, the greater the asthma control, and a 3-point difference in the mean ACT score is considered a clinically relevant change.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Depression symptoms by Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI II)</measure>
    <time_frame>One day</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the symptoms of depression reported in the last 30 days, BDI II was used, a questionnaire composed of 21 items with scores ranging from 0 to 63 points, the higher the score the worse the severity of the symptoms</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Asthma quality of life by Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>One day</time_frame>
    <description>Asthma quality of life was assessed using the AQLQ, which has four domains: activity limitations, symptoms, emotional function and environmental stimuli. A higher AQLQ score indicates a better quality of life.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO)</measure>
    <time_frame>One day</time_frame>
    <description>FeNO was collected also to assess airway inflammation in acoordance with the ATS recommendations; all measurements were determinad by chemiluminscence (Sievers 280). This analysis procedure was performed by a blinded investigator. The patients were advised to blow into a Mylar bag, with a breath pressure of 12 cmH20, monitored by the pressure gauge, reaching a flow rate of 200 mL/s.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Exhaled breath condensate (EBC)</measure>
    <time_frame>One day</time_frame>
    <description>A Turbo DECCS® condenser (Medivac SRL, Italy) (29) was used which was cooled to -20øC for at least thirty minutes prior to use. The subjects were instructed to perform oral breathing using the mouthpiece of the equipment and with the aid of a nasal clip. The EBC (exhaled breath condensate) was collected for 15 to 20 minutes in tidal volume for pH analysis and cytokine dosing.</description>

CG group did not receive educational intervention. All patients were submitted to a spirometry, induced sputum collection, nitric oxide measure, exhaled breath condensate air measurement, and answered the questionnaires ACT, ACQ, AQLQ, BDI: Asthma Control Test (ACT), Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ), Asthma Quality Life Questionnaire (AQLQ), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI).
