      The purpose of this study was to use Delphi method to screen the nursing observation indexes
      of patients with stroke, and to screen the sensitive indexes with high correlation with the
      severity of stroke.It is used to guide nursing staff to observe the nursing of patients with
      cerebral apoplexy.
