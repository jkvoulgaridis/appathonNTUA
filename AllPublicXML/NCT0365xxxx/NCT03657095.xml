  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label study for eligible subjects who were actively
      participating in the BPS-314d-MR-PAH-302 study at the time the study was concluded. This OLE
      study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of long-term treatment of the
      esuberaprost sodium tablets (Beraprost Sodium 314d Modified Release tablets) study drug.

      Subjects will sign an informed consent to continue treatment for PAH with esuberaprost sodium
      tablets in this open-label extension (OLE) study. At the Enrollment Visit for this study,
      subjects will begin a blinded transition from the BPS-314d-MR-PAH-302 study to the OLE study
      over a 4-week period. The first dose for all subjects in this OLE study will be 2 tablets.
      During this blinded transition period, those subjects on active study drug in the
      BPS-314d-MR-PAH-302 study will continue with blinded active study drug 4-times daily (QID);
      those subjects on placebo study drug will receive one active tablet and one placebo tablet
      QID (blinded) during the first 2 weeks and increase to 2 active tablets QID (blinded)
      thereafter. After the first dose, the investigator may adjust the dose as medically
      warranted. The maximum dose for this study is 30 μg QID with a minimum accepted dose as 15 μg
      QID. For the first 4 weeks, contact with the subject should occur weekly to ensure
      up-titration to the fixed dose is tolerated and assess adverse events (AEs).

      Subjects will return to the clinic at Week 4 to be supplied open-label esuberaprost sodium
      tablets and complete protocol specified procedures. At the Week 4 Visit, subjects will be
      dosed with two 15 μg tablets (30 μg total), administered orally QID (provided the target dose
      is tolerated) or follow the Investigator's (or designee's) directions if adjustment is
      needed. Following the Week 4 Visit, each subject will return to the clinic at Months 3, 6, 9,
      and 12, and quarterly thereafter for assessments.

      At the conclusion of the study or if a subject discontinues the study prematurely, subjects
      will return to the clinic for an End-of-Study (EOS) Visit. Subjects will be provided
      instructions about down titration off esuberaprost sodium tablets by the investigator.

    <masking_description>Treatment during the first 4 weeks of this study is double-blind. The investigator and study staff, the subjects, the monitors, and the sponsor will remain blinded to the treatment group allocation from BPS-314d-MR-PAH-302 study and to study drug during the first 4 weeks of the OLE study. After the 4 weeks, the study will continue as unblinded and open label.</masking_description>
