  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malnutrition affects 50% to 70% of hospitalized elderly people, and is all the more worrying
      in the elderly because of its clinical impact. A measurement of food consumption is essential
      to recognize needs, monitor the nutritional status of the elderly in hospital and implement
      specific therapeutic action such as supplements or an increase in energy-protein to combat
      malnutrition or the risk of malnourishment. Unfortunately, this measure is rarely done
      effectively in practice, keeping the patient in nutritional deficit, contributing to a risk
      of increased morbidity and mortality.

      Although weighing food intake is the reference method, it is a routine burden for healthcare
      teams. To overcome these constraints in hospital environments, intake is estimated by food
      readings over three consecutive days using a semi-quantitative method. It should be noted
      that this method remains complex, imprecise and reserved only for the most malnourished
      patients. In recent years, the development of photographic methods has become an interesting
      alternative to the measurement by weight. Based on photographs taken before and after the
      meal in order to deduce what is actually ingested, these methods obtain results comparable to
      the weighing method, though there is still a number of limitations (need for human
      intervention, constraint to have standardized menus in weight and lack of nutritional
      management adapted to patients). To overcome these limitations, an automated photographic
      method based on modern techniques for automatic processing of 2D and 3D images coupled with
      techniques derived from artificial intelligence has recently been developed in the
      investigator's unit, but has not yet been validated.

      The originality and innovation of this project lies in the automated analysis of the photos
      taken and the conversion into percentage of remaining food thanks to the design of algorithms
      for image preprocessing and neural classification by a 2D and 3D software (patent pending).

    <description>The nursing staff will position the tray for automatic picture taking before and after the meal. Taking a photograph of the entire tray will allow the patient's identity to be identified by his meal card which will then be coded for analysis and the plate will be targeted at the time of the nutritional analysis by the software. This method will automatically provide the percentage of each main dish food consumed using an advanced image processing algorithm and an optimized artificial intelligence system that will recognize the food before and after consumption. Automatic processing and transfer will enable food intake to be collected.</description>
