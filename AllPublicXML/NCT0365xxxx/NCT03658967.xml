    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the efficacy of Lymfactin® in patients with secondary lymphedema
      associated with the treatment of breast cancer by comparing the effects of active study
      treatment Lymfactin® to placebo. The study product will be administered in combination with a
      surgical lymph node transfer operation. In addition, the safety and tolerability of the
      Lymfactin® treatment will be evaluated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centre clinical study, in which
      40 patients with breast cancer associated secondary lymphedema will be randomized 1:1 either
      to Lymfactin® (1 x 10E11 viral particles, vp) or placebo (0.9% physiological saline) group.

      The study product (Lymfactin® or placebo solution) will be administered as a single dose in a
      volume of two (2) mL, by ex vivo perinodal injection into the fat pad of a flap of tissue
      containing lymph nodes from the patient's own abdominal wall or the groin area. This flap of
      tissue will then be surgically implanted into the axillary region of the affected arm. This
      treatment with the study product is performed in combination with a surgical lymph node
      transfer, in conjunction with or without breast reconstruction surgery.

      Patients will be followed-up for efficacy and safety according to a specified schedule up to
      5 years post-treatment.

    <description>Assessment of changes in the quality of life using Lymphedema Quality of Life Inventory (LQOLI) in which the patients assess how their lymphedema is affecting the activities of daily living. LQOLI consists of three dimensions: Physical, psychosocial and practical, which are reported separately as the mean score of that part. Each part of the LQOLI is scored from 0 to 3, where score 0 means &quot;no impact&quot;, 1 means &quot;a little bit impact&quot;, 2 means &quot;somewhat impact&quot; and score 3 means &quot;significant impact&quot; on the quality of life of the patient, the smaller score thus being the better.</description>

               -  A patient with childbearing potential should be using a reliable contraception
                  method: combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception
                  associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral, intravaginal or transdermal,
                  progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation
                  (oral, injectable or implantable), intrauterine device (IUD), intrauterine
                  hormone releasing system (IUS), bilateral tubal occlusion, vasectomised partner

                  required. A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an
                  alternative medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the
                  postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not
                  using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy.

               -  For permanently sterile patient neither contraception nor a pregnancy test is
                  required. A permanently sterile is defined by history of hysterectomy, bilateral

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosed for T4 and/or N2b/N3 stage breast cancer at the time of the original

             cancer (except basal cell carcinoma or cervical in situ carcinoma).

          3. Diagnosed for metastatic breast cancer.

          4. Pregnancy, lactation or a positive or indeterminate pregnancy test.

          5. Current treatment with Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors should be interrupted from

          6. Previous treatment with, or participation in a trial of a gene therapy product.

          7. Participation in a clinical trial, which has included interventions in the preceding 6
             months or will involve future interventions. Participation in a non-interventional
             clinical trial, or in a non-interventional follow-up of any clinical trial, does not
             make the patient inappropriate for the entry into this study.

          8. Current treatment with immunosuppressive drugs.

          9. Current history of drug abuse, including nicotine-containing products, or alcohol
             abuse.

         10. Known human immunodeficiency virus- or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related
             illness.

         11. History of hepatic dysfunction, cirrhosis, or hepatitis.

         12. Allergy to any ingredients of the Lymfactin® solution for injection.

         13. Other concurrent severe acute and/or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or
             laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with the study
             participation or study drug administration, that would, in the Investigator's
             judgement, affect the patient's ability to follow study-related procedures, or that
             may interfere with the interpretation of study results and would make the patient
             inappropriate for the entry into this study.

         14. Doubtful availability, in the opinion of the Investigator, to complete the study.
