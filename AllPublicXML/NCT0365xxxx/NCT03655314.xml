  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Weight loss is normal for healthy newborns in the first few days, especially for those
      exclusively breastfed, who may have low enteral intake for several days. Although most
      newborns tolerate this early period of weight loss well, those with pronounced weight loss
      become at increased risk of feeding problems and hyperbilirubinemia, which are the two most
      common causes of neonatal readmission. To facilitate the assessment of risk for an individual
      newborn, the Newborn Weight Tool (NEWT) has been developed to categorize each infant's weight
      loss according to population norms, so that formula can be administered when weight loss is
      pronounced and avoided when weight loss is normal. The Healthy Start study will be a
      randomized, controlled trial testing whether displaying NEWT to clinicians providing newborn
      care can improve neonatal health outcomes including formula use, weight loss and readmission.
      Newborns will be randomly assigned either to display weight with NEWT weight categorization
      to their providers in the electronic health record (EHR) or to usual care (weight displayed
      without NEWT categorization).
