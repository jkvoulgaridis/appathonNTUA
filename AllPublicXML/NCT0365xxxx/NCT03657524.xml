    <textblock>
      Deciding the optimal timing for extubation in patients who are mechanically ventilated can be
      challenging, and traditional weaning predictor tools are not accurate. Recent studies suggest
      that isolated sonographic assessment of the respiratory and cardiac function (ie diastolic
      function and filling pressure), in mechanically ventilated patients may assist in identifying
      patients at risk of weaning failure. Recently, the association of conventional
      echocardiography and lung ultrasound showed promising results for the prediction of post
      extubation distress. Speckle Tracking is an emerging tool in intensive care medicine that has
      never been investiguated for the prediction of weaning failure. It could early detects
      diastolic dysfunction and and elevated filling pressure. Of more, speckle tracking is known
      to be less operator dependant. The main objective of our study is to evaluate the diagnosis
      accuracy of speckle tracking echocardiography performed during a weaning trial to predict
      weaning failure. The secondary objectives are to assess the diagnosis accuracy of combined
      heart and lung ultrasound to predict weaning failure.
