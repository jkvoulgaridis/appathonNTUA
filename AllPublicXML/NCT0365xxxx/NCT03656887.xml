  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes is a major public health problem that has been growing steadily in recent years. Its
      prevalence is very high in the elderly, in whom there is an increased risk of hypoglycemia.

      Hypoglycaemia in elderly diabetics has serious consequences:

        -  increased mortality,

        -  increased cardiovascular morbidity,

        -  increased risk of falling,

        -  impairment of quality of life.

        -  Hypoglycaemia is also a risk factor for dementia in type 2 diabetes. The frequency of
           asymptomatic and atypical hypoglycemia has been shown to be greater in the elderly, but
           the exact prevalence of hypoglycemia in the elderly remains unknown.

      Elderly diabetic patients in institutions are particularly fragile and have more frequent
      cognitive problems than non-diabetic subjects. A study conducted in this population of
      patients showed that a third of them had HbA1C &lt;6.5%, which suggests a higher frequency of
      hypoglycemia though the figures were not available.

      We therefore decided to conduct a study to assess the frequency of hypoglycemia in order to
      better understand the contributing factors and to improve the management of this fragile
      population.
