  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of computer systems has become a highly accepted approach in neurorehabilitation
      currently. Virtual reality (VR) is frequently used in different disease groups for this
      purpose. By using various VR equipment (sensors, balance board, control, etc.), exercises can
      be individualized to suit individual needs and aim to stimulate neural plasticity according
      to motor learning principles with repetitive activities.

      In recent years, it has been observed that boxing training (boxing therapy) in individuals
      with neurological diseases (e.g. Parkinson's disease and stroke) gives positive results. It
      has been shown in the literature there are short and long-term improvement in daily life
      activities, quality of life, balance and gait functions after boxing training in patients
      with Parkinson' disease despite the progressive nature of Parkinson's disease. Additionally
      it was found that boxing program in sitting has positive effects on upper extremity
      functions, balance, walking and quality of life in stroke patients. In the literature, there
      were no studies comparing virtual and boxing therapy in stroke patients. Therefore, the aim
      of this study is to compare the effects of virtual and real boxing training in addition to
      neurodevelopmental training (NDT) on cognitive status, upper extremity functions, balance and
      activities of daily living in hemiparetic stroke patients.

      Patients who have had a stroke for the first time with hemiparesis, who are between the ages
      of 18-70, who has Mini Mental Test score above 23, whose functional level is less than 4
      according to the Modified Rankin Scale, who has upper extremity spasticity lower than 3 on
      Modified Ashworth Scale will be included in this study. In case of hypertension which may
      prevent rehabilitation, heart disease, subluxation and fracture at the shoulder, visual
      impairment, limitation in passive normal joint movement in hemiplegic side, botulinum toxin
      administration or surgical operation in the last 6 months patients will not be excluded.

      All the patients will be measured with Addenbrooke's Cognitive Assessment (ACA), Minnesota
      Hand Skill Test, Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT), Fullerton Advanced Balance Scale (FAB),
      Frenchay Activity Index (FAI) and video boxing analysis of punching.The measurements will be
      made at the beginning of the treatment (0 weeks) and at the end of the treatment (8 weeks).

      NDT approaches consist of upper extremity facilitation techniques and activities in
      accordance with the patient's functional level, weight transfer and walking exercises to
      increase sitting and standing balance, mat exercises with the same purpose considering the
      functional level for each patient. In the real boxing (RB) group in addition to the NDT
      program, real boxing training will be given. Accordingly, the physiotherapist and the patient
      will wear boxing gloves and the patients will punch the physiotherapist's glove with a
      pre-specified treatment protocol. Resistance and frequencies between levels will be increased
      by the physiotherapist as the sessions progress. The RB group will have 30 minutes of real
      boxing training for 3 sessions per week for 8 weeks. In the virtual boxing (VB) group, in
      addition to the NDT program, virtual boxing training will be given by using Kinect Xbox
      Boxing. For the VB group, virtual boxing training will be held for 3 weeks 30 minutes a week
      for 8 weeks.

    <measure>Wolf Motor Function Test</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Wolf Motor Function Test (WFMT) quantifies upper extremity motor ability through the use of timed and functional tasks. The widely used version of the WMFT consists of 17 items, items 7 and 14 are related to subject strength and the other 15 to subject functional ability during various tasks. Performances are scored using a 6-point functional ability scale and the less affected upper extremity followed by the most affected side. The total score, also referred to as Functional Ability score (WMFT-FAS), is the sum of the 15 items score (with a 6-point ordinal score from 0 to 5). The maximum total score is 75 and minimum is 0. Lower scores indicating lower functional levels.</description>

    <measure>Minnesota Manual Dexterity Test</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Minnesota Manual Dexterity Test (MMDT) measures the speed of gross arm and hand movements (arm-hand dexterity) during rapid eye-hand coordination tasks. The MMDT involve five subtests:The Placing Test (1st item: taking the blocks with one hand and putting them in the holes on the board in a standardized order) and Two-hand Turning and Placing Test (5th item: taking the blocks with two hands and putting them in the holes on the board in a standardized order) were the two items selected for this study.The number of seconds it took to complete the task on each of the trials was recorded. The lower the score, the better the outcome.</description>

    <measure>Video Boxing Analysis of Punching</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Video Boxing Analysis (VBA) evaluation method was used to evaluate the goal-oriented performance analysis of upper extremity. For boxing analysis patients were videotaped while punching with their right side, punching with side left and punching bilaterally. Than the videotape were watched to analyze and the number of right unilateral punches in 1 minute, number of left unilateral punches in 1 minute and number of bilateral punches in 1 minute were recorded. This analysis were done for the quantitative assessment of punch number per minute (number of punch/minute). This measurement method is created and constructed by the authors of this study. Higher number of punches indicate better outcome on this analysis.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fullerton Advanced Balance Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Fullerton Advanced Balance (FAB) scale was developed to evaluate sensitive changes in many aspects of balance. This performance-based scale consists of 10 test items assessing functional balance (static and dynamic) status in older people. The individual test items are: 1. Feet together, eyes closed, 2. Reach forward to retrieve an object, 3. Turn in a full circle, 4. Step up and over a bench, 5. Tandem walk, 6. Stand on one leg, 7. Stand on foam, eyes closed, 8. Two-footed jump, 9. Walk with head turns, 10. Reactive postural control. Each test item is scored using a 0-4 scale. The highest score that can be obtained on this multidimensional balance assessment is 40 points, and the lowest is zero. Higher scores indicate better balance abilities. The FAB scale is quick to administer (~10-12 minutes) and can be administered in a relatively small area.</description>

    <measure>Addenbrooke's Cognitive Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Addenbrook's Cognitive Assessment - Revised (ACE-R) is sensitive in the differential diagnosis of early stage dementia. However, the design and psychometric properties is also suitable to provide information about cognitive functions and cognitive deficits in patients without dementia after a stroke. The ACE-R consists of five domains including attention/orientation, memory, verbal fluency, language and visuospatial ability. The ACE-R total scale score ranges from 0 to 100. The ACE-R subscale scores ranges between; 0-18 points for attention, 0-26 for memory, 0-14 for fluency, 0-26 for language and 0-16 for visuospatial processing. Higher scores indicate better cognitive functioning. ACE- R scale was found as reliable and valid in Turkish population.</description>

    <measure>Frenchay Activities Index</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Frenchay Activities Index is a measure of instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) for use with patients recovering from stroke. The Frenchay Activities Index (FAI) assesses a broad range of activities associated with everyday life. The benefit of the FAI is that while activities of daily living scales tend to focus on issues related to self-care and mobility. The FAI comprises 15 activities, each of which is scored on a 4-point scale (0 to 3), to yield a total score ranging from 0 (inactive) to 45 (active). Scoring is based on the frequency with which the activities are carried out. It can be broken down into three subscales: domestic chores, leisure/work, and outdoor activities. Each subscale's score ranges from 0 to 15.</description>

        <title>Wolf Motor Function Test</title>
        <description>Wolf Motor Function Test (WFMT) quantifies upper extremity motor ability through the use of timed and functional tasks. The widely used version of the WMFT consists of 17 items, items 7 and 14 are related to subject strength and the other 15 to subject functional ability during various tasks. Performances are scored using a 6-point functional ability scale and the less affected upper extremity followed by the most affected side. The total score, also referred to as Functional Ability score (WMFT-FAS), is the sum of the 15 items score (with a 6-point ordinal score from 0 to 5). The maximum total score is 75 and minimum is 0. Lower scores indicating lower functional levels.</description>

        <description>Video Boxing Analysis (VBA) evaluation method was used to evaluate the goal-oriented performance analysis of upper extremity. For boxing analysis patients were videotaped while punching with their right side, punching with side left and punching bilaterally. Than the videotape were watched to analyze and the number of right unilateral punches in 1 minute, number of left unilateral punches in 1 minute and number of bilateral punches in 1 minute were recorded. This analysis were done for the quantitative assessment of punch number per minute (number of punch/minute). This measurement method is created and constructed by the authors of this study. Higher number of punches indicate better outcome on this analysis.</description>

        <title>Fullerton Advanced Balance Scale</title>
        <description>Fullerton Advanced Balance (FAB) scale was developed to evaluate sensitive changes in many aspects of balance. This performance-based scale consists of 10 test items assessing functional balance (static and dynamic) status in older people. The individual test items are: 1. Feet together, eyes closed, 2. Reach forward to retrieve an object, 3. Turn in a full circle, 4. Step up and over a bench, 5. Tandem walk, 6. Stand on one leg, 7. Stand on foam, eyes closed, 8. Two-footed jump, 9. Walk with head turns, 10. Reactive postural control. Each test item is scored using a 0-4 scale. The highest score that can be obtained on this multidimensional balance assessment is 40 points, and the lowest is zero. Higher scores indicate better balance abilities. The FAB scale is quick to administer (~10-12 minutes) and can be administered in a relatively small area.</description>

          <title>Fullerton Advanced Balance Scale</title>
          <description>Fullerton Advanced Balance (FAB) scale was developed to evaluate sensitive changes in many aspects of balance. This performance-based scale consists of 10 test items assessing functional balance (static and dynamic) status in older people. The individual test items are: 1. Feet together, eyes closed, 2. Reach forward to retrieve an object, 3. Turn in a full circle, 4. Step up and over a bench, 5. Tandem walk, 6. Stand on one leg, 7. Stand on foam, eyes closed, 8. Two-footed jump, 9. Walk with head turns, 10. Reactive postural control. Each test item is scored using a 0-4 scale. The highest score that can be obtained on this multidimensional balance assessment is 40 points, and the lowest is zero. Higher scores indicate better balance abilities. The FAB scale is quick to administer (~10-12 minutes) and can be administered in a relatively small area.</description>

        <title>Addenbrooke's Cognitive Assessment</title>
        <description>Addenbrook's Cognitive Assessment - Revised (ACE-R) is sensitive in the differential diagnosis of early stage dementia. However, the design and psychometric properties is also suitable to provide information about cognitive functions and cognitive deficits in patients without dementia after a stroke. The ACE-R consists of five domains including attention/orientation, memory, verbal fluency, language and visuospatial ability. The ACE-R total scale score ranges from 0 to 100. The ACE-R subscale scores ranges between; 0-18 points for attention, 0-26 for memory, 0-14 for fluency, 0-26 for language and 0-16 for visuospatial processing. Higher scores indicate better cognitive functioning. ACE- R scale was found as reliable and valid in Turkish population.</description>

        <title>Frenchay Activities Index</title>
        <description>Frenchay Activities Index is a measure of instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) for use with patients recovering from stroke. The Frenchay Activities Index (FAI) assesses a broad range of activities associated with everyday life. The benefit of the FAI is that while activities of daily living scales tend to focus on issues related to self-care and mobility. The FAI comprises 15 activities, each of which is scored on a 4-point scale (0 to 3), to yield a total score ranging from 0 (inactive) to 45 (active). Scoring is based on the frequency with which the activities are carried out. It can be broken down into three subscales: domestic chores, leisure/work, and outdoor activities. Each subscale's score ranges from 0 to 15.</description>
