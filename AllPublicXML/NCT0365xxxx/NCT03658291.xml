    <textblock>
      In order to evaluating the efficacy, safety and immune mechanism of Sanjin tablets for the
      treatment of acute simple lower urinary tract infection and its influence on recurrence rate
      and through research data to guide clinical, improving the rational use of drugs, especially
      the rational application of antibiotics. In this study, a randomized, double blind, parallel
      control of positive drugs, multi-center clinical study will be established. According to the
      relevant regulations of the CFDA, 252 cases need to be registered at least. These cases will
      be divided into treatment group（Sanjin tablets+ levofloxacin simulants），control group
      1（Sanjin tablets simulants +levofloxacin）and control group 2（Sanjin tablets+ levofloxacin）.
      Each group will be treated for 7 days and followed up for 2 times. The efficacy indicators of
      this study were mainly from three dimensions: syndrome, laboratory routine examination and
      bacteriology examination. The symptom scores and cytokine changes of each group before and
      after treatment were observed.
