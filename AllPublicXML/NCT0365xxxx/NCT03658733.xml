  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess efficacy of a new 14-day sequential therapy for the
      rescue treatment of refractory Helicobacter pylori infection, and whether it is safe while
      maintaining an ideal eradication rates. The researchers also want to testify whether a
      double-dose rabeprazole has equal efficacy to double-dose esomeprazole to provide sufficient
      acid inhibition.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Half of the world's population is infected with Helicobacter pylori. Strong evidence supports
      that H.pylori eradication is an effective approach to reduce the risk of developing gastric
      cancer. However, eradication rates of first-line therapy decreased over years due to the
      rapidly emerging antibiotic resistance of H. pylori worldwide. An ideal rescue therapeutic
      regimen to cure refractory H.pylori infection is currently warranted. Traditional sequential
      therapy failed to achieve an ideal eradication rates (over&gt;95%) as a third line treatment in
      the region with high antibiotic resistance. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of
      14-day modified sequential therapy in the patients with two or more treatment failure, and
      whether the adverse effects of this new modified sequential therapy are tolerable. Then, this
      study will also compare the performance of a double-dose esomeprazole with double-dose
      rabeprazole containing therapy to optimize therapeutic regimen.

    <description>Both intention to treat(ITT) and per-protocol(PP) analyses will be used for the assessment of the eradication rates of Helicobacter pylori infection. The ITT analysis includes all randomly assigned patients who take at least one dose of the study medications. The PP analysis is limited to patients who take over 90% of the study medications and complete follow-up.</description>

    <description>All the participants will go through a gastroscopy. Biopsy specimens will be taken for histologic assessment and rapid urease test. Two additional biopsy samples will be obtained from the antrum and body for bacterial culture and antimicrobial susceptibility test. Liver and kidney function will be monitored by blood test before and after the treatment. Then, patients will receive a 14-day modified sequential therapy containing esomeprazole for the Helicobacter pylori eradication irrespective of antimicrobial susceptibility test results. The regimen contains esomeprazole, amoxicillin, tetracycline and furazolidone for the first 7 days, followed by esomeprazole,amoxicillin, tetracycline and colloidal bismuth pectin for the second 7 days.
Drugs: 1. esomeprazole 40mg bid for 14 days, 2. amoxicillin 1000mg bid for 14 days, 3. tetracycline 500mg qid for 14 days, 4. furazolidone 100mg tid for the first 7 days, 5. colloidal bismuth pectin 200mg bid for the second 7 days.</description>
