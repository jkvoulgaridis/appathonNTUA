  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research project about services provided to African American patients with
      glaucoma. The goal of the project is to improve communication between providers and
      African-American patients about glaucoma.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Intraocular Pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Intraocular pressure measurements will be extracted from each patient's medical record at the baseline, 6 month, and 12 month follow-up visits. For all time points, a mean intraocular pressure will be calculated by averaging the intraocular pressure across both eyes. Change in intraocular pressure over the 12 month period will then be assessed by calculating the difference in mean intraocular pressure.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Glaucoma Medication Percent Adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Medication adherence will be measured using the number of recorded doses from the Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS) data, divided by the number of prescribed doses. Medication adherence can range from 0% to 100%.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Glaucoma Medication Adherence Self-Efficacy Score</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Medication adherence self-efficacy is measured using a 21-item scale that has a reliability of 0.89. Scores can range from 21 to 63, and a higher score indicates a better outcome.</description>

    <intervention_name>Educational Video and Question Prompt List</intervention_name>
    <description>A short educational video will be presented on an iPad about the importance of encouraging patients to ask questions and to be involved during glaucoma visits to improve self-management skills. A question prompt list will also be completed where participants check questions of interest to ask the provider.</description>
