  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nucleotides are the building blocks for a variety of molecules, including ATP, which is
      broken down in the skeletal muscle cells to provide fuel for exercise. Nucleotides can be
      obtained from the diet, and produced or salvaged by the body. Though nucleotides provide the
      building blocks for ATP, the sugar ribose has been suggested to be rate limiting for
      synthesising ATP.

      Previous studies have shown a decrease in ATP levels in the muscle after intense exercise,
      and this is linked to fatigue. Other studies have also reported benefits of nucleotide and/or
      ribose supplementation on exercise performance. However, any potential link between ATP
      metabolism and exercise performance has not been explored.

      This study will look at the effects of nucleotide and nucleotide-ribose supplementation in
      fuel utilisation and performance in skeletal muscle during endurance exercise.
