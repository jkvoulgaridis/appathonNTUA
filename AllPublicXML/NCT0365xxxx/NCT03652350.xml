    <textblock>
      In order to conduct a multicenter comparative effectiveness clinical research of phase II to
      investigate safety and efficacy of applying microwave ablation in patients with Great-glass
      lung nodules ≤ 3cm, a single center, non-randomized, open label pilot study is conducted to
      examine the flexibility, safety and efficacy of using Microwave Ablation in Patients with
      Ground Glass Nodules that are poor candidate of surgery.

    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the most common cancer worldwide contributing 13% of the total number of new
      cases diagnosed. The main treatments of lung cancer are based on surgical resection and
      adjuvant postoperative chemotherapy. However, the patients who are intolerant of surgery
      wouldn't be benefit from surgical resection. Microwave ablation provide new choice for lung
      cancer, which can effectively treat early lung cancer. The diagnosis of early lung cancer can
      be based on the results of biopsy of ground-glass nodules (GGNs), which is one of the
      diagnostic criteria for preoperative diagnosis of early lung cancer. The microwave ablation
      is the good choice for patients who cannot tolerate surgical resection. However, the
      flexibility, safety and efficacy of using Microwave Ablation in Patients with Ground Glass
      Nodules are still unclear.
