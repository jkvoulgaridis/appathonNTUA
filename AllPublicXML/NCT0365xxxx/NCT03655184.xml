  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medication overuse headache (MOH) is a disabling and costly disorder which is characterized
      by chronic headache and overuse of different headache medications. Patients with MOH are more
      likely to coexist with affective disorders such as anxiety and depression, and are more
      likely to suffer from sleep disturbances than those with episodic headache.

      Melatonin is a hormone secreted from the pineal gland. Melatonin is an antioxidant,
      antinociceptive, hypnotic, anticonvulsant, neuroprotective, anxiolytic, sedative and
      analgesic.

      This observational study aims to investigate clinical characteristics of patients with MOH
      and to explore the relationship between the serum melatonin level and medication overuse
      headache. Researchers hope to provide a new idea for the clinical treatment of MOH: melatonin
      can be used as an adjuvant therapy for MOH in the future.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      30 patients with MOH，30 patients with episodic migraine and 30 age-matched healthy volunteers
      were recruited in the study. A series of neuropsychological test scale including Hospital
      Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) and Leeds
      Dependence Questionnaire (LDQ) were evaluated among all the recruited. Blood samples were
      taken at 10 a.m. and centrifuged. The serum was separated and collected at −70 °C for the
      measurement of melatonin .
