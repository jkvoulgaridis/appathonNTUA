  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of a home-based exercise training
      program in COPD patients who did not participate in an inpatient or outpatient rehabilitation
      program within the last 2 years.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Exercise training is an important component of pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) the management
      of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and numerous trials have shown large
      improvements in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and exercise capacity in persons with
      COPD. However, the great majority of patients who would benefit from PR never follow such a
      program. Moreover, many COPD patients are either not instructed to exercise at all or fail to
      adhere to exercise training at home after completing PR.

      This study evaluates a newly developed exercise training program that requires minimal
      equipment (i.e., only a chair and elastic bands) and can be easily implemented long-term in
      the patient's home-setting.

    <description>Home-based exercise training program that requires only minimal equipment, and is individually adaptable to the participant's exercise level (6 times per week; 15-20 min; 38 exercise cards and one interactive training agenda booklet). After randomization, a health care professional (HOMEX coach) will visit the intervention group participants at their home to set up the training location, to instruct the exercises and to establish individualized goals. Follow-up visits are planned after 3 and 8-9 weeks. Regular telephone calls will be conducted by the same HOMEX coach to motivate the patients, to discuss training progress and concrete benefits and barriers, and to adapt goals and the training program. Additional intervention elements are that a relative or friend is involved as a &quot;sparring&quot; partner to support the participant. The general practitioner is informed about the participation of his/her patient in the intervention.</description>
