  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of this study is to establish an ultrasound technique to aid in oral and
      dental examination of soft and hard tissues. Ultrasound is currently not used in Dentistry
      and associated oral examinations and its usefulness for clinical practice will be explored.
      This study will investigate the use of ultrasonic imaging for planning and placing dental
      implants, as well as evaluate the use of ultrasonic imaging for monitoring marginal bone loss
      around dental implants.

      This study will involve two different groups of subjects: Patients scheduled for a dental
      implant procedure, and patients scheduled for a revision surgery after developing infection
      after implant surgery.

      Twenty subjects examining only specific aim one is funded and will be studied. If future
      funding is granted and additional 30 subjects for aim one and 40 for aim two will be studied
      Subjects in both groups will receive an ultrasound examination of the oral cavity prior to
      their clinically-scheduled dental surgery. Subjects in group 1 also may receive a CBCT scan
      if not previously clinically-ordered.
