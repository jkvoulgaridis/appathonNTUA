  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Limited data are available on the efficacy of beta-blocker therapy for secondary prevention
      in Actue Coronary Syndrome(ACS) patients. This study sought to investigate the association of
      beta-blocker therapy at discharge with clinical outcomes in patients with ACS after
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines
      recommend beta-blockers for secondary prevention in patients with ACS without regard to
      reperfusion therapy. However, evidence supporting this recommendation originated from studies
      conducted before the introduction of reperfusion therapy or studies in patients treated with
      fibrinolysis. In the present era of PCI, there are no prospective randomized studies looking
      at the effects of long-term beta-blocker therapy on clinical outcomes in ACS patients.
      Moreover, results from registry data and post-hoc analysis on beta-blocker therapy in
      patients undergoing PCI are inconsistent.

      In particular, the beneficial effect of long-term beta-blocker therapy has not been well
      established in patients with relatively low risk, such as preserved left ventricular systolic
      function or single-vessel disease. Therefore, we investigated the association of beta-blocker
      therapy at discharge with clinical outcomes in ACS patients after PCI.
