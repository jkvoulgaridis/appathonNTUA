    <textblock>
      This randomized, fixed-dose, double-blind, multicenter trial investigated the safety and
      efficacy of AR19 in the treatment of ADHD in adults from 18 through 55 years of age. Safety
      parameters and therapeutic effect were evaluated throughout the trial. A target of 312
      subjects was set for enrollment. Once subjects were determined to have met all inclusion
      criteria and were screened, they were randomized to 20 or 40 mg AR19 daily or plac

             Medications that are being taken for psychiatric or medical disorders other than ADHD
             should not be discontinued for the purpose of qualifying for study participation
             unless the medication is deemed medically unnecessary by the prescribing physician.

             participate in the trial or submit to urine drug testing if they are using any
             controlled or recreational drug (other than a prescribed stimulant for ADHD), and
             non-use should be confirmed prior to testing.

         20. Has a positive blood alcohol level at Screening. Note: subjects should be informed
             that alcohol consumed within 12 hours of screening may result in a positive test.
