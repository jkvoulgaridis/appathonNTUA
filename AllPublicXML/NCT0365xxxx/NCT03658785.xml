    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, side effects and benefits of autologous
      tumor infiltrating lymphocytes(TIL) specific to personalized Neo-antigens in the treatment of
      patients with recurrent, metastatic and advanced solid tumors.

    <textblock>
      Adoptive cell transfer therapy that utilizes an autologous TIL manufacturing progress is
      originally developed by the NCI for the treatment of patients with recurrent, metastatic
      cervical cancer. TILs specific to personalized neo-antigens will be expended in vitro and
      given back to the patients through vein. A total of 20 patients will be enrolled in the
      single-arm, open label, interventional study.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        To be eligible for the study, patients must meet ALL of the following criteria prior to
        enrollment in the study:

          1. Must be â‰¥ 18 years of age at the time of consent.

          2. Must have recurrent, metastatic, or persistent carcinoma that is not amenable to
             curative treatment with surgery and/or radiation therapy and for which no other
             therapies are expected to have significant benefit, in the opinion of the
             Investigator.

          3. Must have at least 1 lesion that is resectable for TIL generation. The resected TIL
             generating lesion(s) should yield at least 1.5 cm in diameter post-resection of tumor
             tissue. Following resection for TIL generation, must have a remaining measurable
             target lesion as defined by RECIST v1.1.

          4. Patients must have progressive disease while receiving or after the completion of the
             most recent prior treatment.

          5. Any prior therapy directed at the malignant tumor must be discontinued at least 28
             days prior to tumor resection. Radiation therapy may have been received up to 28 days
             prior to tumor resection for lesions not expected to be used for TIL generation or
             target lesions.

          6. Have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1.

          7. Patients must be seronegative for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

          8. Patients with positive serology for hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg),
             hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc), or hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) indicating acute
             or chronic infection may be enrolled if the viral load by polymerase chain reaction
             (PCR) is undetectable with/without active treatment.

          9. Hematology:

             to to 1.6 mg/dl.Total bilirubin less that or equal to 1.5 mg/dl, except in patients
             with Gilbert's Syndrome who must have a total bilirubin less than 3.0 mg/dl.

         11. Women of child bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test because of the
             potentially dangerous effects of the treatment on the fetus.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who have received an organ allograft or prior cell transfer therapy.

          8. Patients who have a diagnosis of end-stage renal disorder requiring hemodialysis.

          9. Patients who have a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt; 45% or who are New
             York Heart Association (NYHA) Class 2 or higher.

             Patients who have a forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) of less than or equal
             to 60% of predicted normal.

             regimen.

             disadvantage by participating in this study.
