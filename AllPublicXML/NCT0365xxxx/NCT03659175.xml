      We will focus on the intestinal flora structure, risk factors and clinical features of male
      elderly with SIBO in our study.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our previous study had found that the prevalence rate of small intestinal bacterial
      overgrowth(SIBO) in male elderly was high up to 63.1%. In the recent years, SIBO has been
      found be associated not only with abdominal symptoms such as abdominal distention, pain and
      so on, but also with various diseases such as diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, joint pain,
      chronic prostatitis, fatty liver, liver cirrhosis etc. SIBO has significant impact on the
      health of elderly. Methane and hydrogen lactulose breath test(LBT) is effective and
      noninvasive for the diagnosis of SIBO. High throughput sequencing is a leading technique for
      the study of intestinal microflora.

      Although more and more studies have focused their concern on the intestinal flora now, few
      SIBO-related studies are available in elderly patients. But we have found SIBO was very
      popular in the elderly. The conflict between high prevalence rate of SIBO in elderly and very
      few relevant studies is barrier to study of pathophysiology, early diagnosis and treatment of
      SIBO in elderly adults.

      So in our study, we will apply LBT and high throughput sequencing technique to study the
      intestinal flora structure, risk factors and clinical features of male elderly patients with
      SIBO. And further, we will try to develop standard treatment for elderly patients with SIBO.
