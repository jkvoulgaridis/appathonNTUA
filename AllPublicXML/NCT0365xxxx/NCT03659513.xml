  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the pharmacokinetics of the various, routinely given antibiotics,
      sedatives, and opioids in patients undergoing venous-venous extra-corporal oxygenation
      (ECMO). Little is known about the distribution and effectiveness of antibiotics in this
      particular patient population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with severe hypoxia that is refractory to traditional therapies are occasionally
      placed on venous-venous extracorporal membrane oxygenation (vv ECMO) to provide a bridge
      during the time when lungs alone cannot provide necessary support. This procedure is gaining
      prominence but it is largely unknown how medications, especially antibiotics, given to the
      patient on ECMO is distributed throughout the body as compared to patients without ECMO.
      Since the serum level of medication determines the biological activity of the drug, it is
      important to know if there is a difference in drug distribution between ECMO and non-ECMO
      patients. The investigator already collected well-established data on several antibiotics on
      non-ECMO as a part of FDA labeling. The study will help to determine if the concentration of
      currently prescribed are sufficient enough to reach their intended concentration in the
      study.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pharmacokinetics of the antibiotics - Maximal Serum Antibiotic Concentration</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome is the data describing the Maximal Serum Antibiotic Concentration (Cmax) of the antibiotics after the onset of infusion.This will be achieved by serial measurements of the serum antibiotic levels at discrete time points for total of 24 hours after starting antibiotics. We will calculate Cmax to demonstrate maximal concentration of the antibiotics.</description>

    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome is the data describing the Area Under Curve (AUC) of the antibiotics after the onset of infusion. This will be achieved by serial measurements of the serum antibiotic levels at discrete time points for total of 24 hours after starting antibiotics. We will calculate AUC to further demonstrate the distribution of antibiotic patients undergoing ECMO treatment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>

    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will correlate serum concentration of antibiotics to the resolution of infection, pressor requirements, and survival in patients. The surveillance will take place up to 3 months after the conclusion of the study protocol.</description>

      Enrolled subjects will have blood samples taken just before antibiotics transfusion, 30
      minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 8 hours, 12 hours and 24 hours after routine
      administration of the drug in question. Each sample will be about 1-2 mL, for a total of
      about 12 mL.

        All patients undergoing ECMO will be invited to participate. In order to determine
        pharmacokinetics of the drugs, the investgators need at least 10-15 subjects in order to
        create a pharmacological model. Since the site plan to study 3 antibiotics, propofol and
        hydromorphone, the investigators calculated the initial sample size at 50
