  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, open-label, randomized-controlled trial is designed to evaluate the use of
      the Traxi panniculus retractor-- a commercially available Class I FDA-exempt device will
      improve surgical outcomes, cardiopulmonary function, and provider/patient satisfaction in
      morbidly obese women undergoing cesarean delivery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Morbidly obese women (BMI &gt;/= 40) undergoing non-emergent cesarean delivery will be recruited
      and randomized to Traxi panniculus retraction or standard of care for panniculus retraction.

      The primary outcome evaluated will be operating time (incision to closure). Other secondary
      outcomes related to surgery including estimated blood loss, surgical site infection, and
      number of scrubbed personnel.

      A secondary aim of the study is to evaluate the hypothesis that the Traxi retraction device
      reduces chestwall compression panniculus retraction and will improve intraoperative pulmonary
      function. To do this, the investigators will measure the difference in individual participant
      pulmonary function tests (forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume) before and after
      panniculus retraction using a bedside spirometer.

      A tertiary aim of the study is to evaluate the hypothesis that the Traxi retraction device
      will improve patient and provider satisfaction due to improved delivery experience and
      maintaining patient dignity. Patient and provider-reported outcomes will be evaluated using
      surveys.
