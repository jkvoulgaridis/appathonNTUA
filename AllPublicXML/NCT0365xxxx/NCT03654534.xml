      Background: It is known that postoperative malnutrition remains inevitable for gastric cancer
      patients with adjuvant chemotherapy, which could have prejudicial influence on the compliance
      of subsequent adjuvant chemotherapy and survival of the patients. A multi-institutional
      prospective phase 2 study had demonstrated the efficacy of oral nutritional supplements (ONS)
      for gastric cancer patients undergoing gastrectomy. However, previous studies did not focus
      the gastric cancer patients with adjuvant chemotherapy. Thus, it is unknown whether the ONS
      could benefit the gastric cancer patients with adjuvant chemotherapy. A multicenter, phase 3
      randomised controlled trial was conducted to compare the ONS with standard diet for
      postoperative gastric cancer patients with adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients and method: In
      this study, pathological confirmed stage II-III or T1N1M0 gastric cancer patients who are
      supposed to receive adjuvant chemotherapy, aged from 18 to 75 years, with body mass index
      (BMI) from 18.5 to 28.0 kg/m2, and with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status
      ≤2, are randomized 1:1 to receive oral administration of NutrenOpimum (Nestle Suisse S.A.), a
      liquid enteral nutritional food for special medical purpose (FSMP), or standard diet.
      NutrenOpimum administration was recommended with a dosage of 400 kcal/400 ml per day within 7
      days postoperatively and was continued for 3 months postoperatively. The primary end point
      was postoperative malnutrition, as defined as ratio of the weight loss at 3 months
      postoperatively to the days 7 postoperatively body weight (body weight loss ratio) higher
      than 10%; body weight loss ratio at 1, 3, 6 months. Secondary end points were chemotherapy
      withdrawal, time to adjuvant chemotherapy failure, period of adjuvant chemotherapy, quality
      of life, grade 3/4 neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and severe side effects on
      digestive tract. Final study analysis will be conducted after the last patient's enrollment.
