      This study compared the performance of three automated immunoassays, Architect (Abbott),
      Immulite (Siemens) and Liaison (Diasorin), for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) serology. Ninety-one
      serum samples collected in Amiens University Hospital were analyzed for the presence of Viral
      Capsid Antigen (VCA) IgG and IgM and Epstein-Barr Nuclear Antigen (EBNA) IgG. The agreement
      between the three assays was calculated for each marker individually and for determination of
      the EBV profile, based on interpretation of the combination of these three EBV markers.

      This retrospective study was conducted on 91 samples collected between 2014 and 2015 for
      which EBV diagnosis was requested. The serological diagnosis of EBV infection was performed
      in the Amiens University Hospital virology laboratory (France). The median age of patients
      was 34 years (mean: 38 years, range: 3-82 year) with a sex ratio of 50%. Sixteen of the 91
      samples concerned children (&lt;15 years).

    <description>The aim of the present study is to evlaute the capacity of the three tests to detect VCA IgM. 91 samples was collected and tested for EBV VCA IgG, EBV VCA IgM and EBV EBNA IgG in order to determine infection status (primary EBV infection, past infection, absence of infection and indeterminate status).</description>

    <description>The serological diagnosis of EBV infection was performed in the Amiens University Hospital virology laboratory (France). 91 routinely collected samples were analyzed by Immulite, Architect, and Liaison Blood samples were centrifuged for 15 min at 2500g at room temperature. Sera were aliquoted and first analyzed by Immulite. All samples were tested for EBV VCA IgG, EBV VCA IgM and EBV EBNA IgG in order to determine infection status (primary EBV infection, past infection, absence of infection and indeterminate status).</description>
