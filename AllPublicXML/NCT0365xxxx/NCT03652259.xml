      The proposed clinical trial is the first-in-human, single-center, open-label, systemic gene
      delivery study of SRP-9003 LGMD2E patients. A minimum of six patients will be enrolled. Based
      on data from Cohort 1, there is a potential to escalate dose for Cohort 2.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA

          -  Subjects ages 4 through age 15, inclusive

          -  Males or females of any ethnic group

          -  Beta-sarcoglycan (SG) DNA gene mutations at both alleles.

          -  Weakness demonstrated based on history of difficulty in running, jumping and climbing
             stairs.

          -  100 meter walk/run (MWR) test result: &gt;= (greater than equal to) 40 percent (%) of
             predicted for age, height, gender and weight matched healthy controls at the screening
             visit.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA

        Individuals who meet the following exclusion criteria will not be eligible to participate
        in the study:

          -  Active viral infection based on clinical observations.

          -  Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) determined left ventricular ejection fraction
             less than (&lt;) 40%.

          -  Serological evidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, or hepatitis B
             or hepatitis C infection.

          -  Abnormal laboratory values considered clinically significant.

          -  Concomitant illness or requirement for chronic drug treatment that in the opinion of
             the PI creates unnecessary risks for gene transfer.

        Other inclusion/exclusion criteria apply.
