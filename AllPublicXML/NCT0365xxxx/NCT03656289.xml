  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Short-interval pregnancy (SIP) or rapid, repeat pregnancy is defined as a pregnancy within
      one year of prior delivery. These pregnancies are often unintended and are associated with
      adverse risks. Low contraceptive initiation during the postpartum period is a contributing
      factor to SIP. This study will be the first to investigate the initiation of a
      highly-effective, immediately active contraceptive device during the antepartum period. The
      antepartum period serves as an ideal time for postpartum contraception counseling, due to
      patients' active involvement with the healthcare system. The pharmacokinetic analysis
      proposed in this study will be the first to investigate whether and to what extent ENG
      hormone crosses the placenta. This data will enrich understanding of the pharmacology of
      exogenous progestins administered during pregnancy and provide information that can be
      incorporated into future patient counseling regarding the risks of fetal exposure with
      exogenous progestin use.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant women (ages 18-34 years) â‰¥37 weeks gestational age who are interested in
             using an ENG contraceptive implant for their postpartum birth control method.

          -  Women with a history of at least one uncomplicated vaginal delivery at term who have
             received routine prenatal care (at least five visits) including an anatomy ultrasound
             with confirmed dating.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women outside the gestational age outlined above.

          -  Women who are seen outside of the enrolling clinics.

          -  Women 35 years and older at the time of anticipated delivery, as these women meet the
             clinical definition of advanced maternal age which has been associated with increased
             adverse events in pregnancy.

          -  Women with any condition that necessitates a medically indicated delivery (e.g.
             diabetes mellitus, any hypertensive disorder), multiple gestations, fetal anomalies,
             Class III obesity (body mass index &gt;40), concurrent use of either an injectable or
             vaginal progestin, and any concerns related to ENG implant use based on the US Medical
             Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use (defined as a class 3 or 4 recommendation).
