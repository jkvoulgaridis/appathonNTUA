  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the use of an established internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy
      intervention in a group of adolescents with type 1 diabetes and mild to moderate depressive
      symptoms. Half of the participants will receive the internet-based intervention while the
      other half will receive usual care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adolescents with diabetes have a higher incidence of subclinical and clinical depression
      compared to healthy adolescents. Patients with diabetes who are clinically or subclinically
      depressed are at high risk for poor glycemic control.

      Studies evaluating prevention and treatment strategies for depression in patients with type 1
      diabetes have shown that group cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and individual
      interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) can reduce the risk of depressive illness in adolescents
      with diabetes. Computerized interventions show evidence of being efficacious, and have been
      recommended as the &quot;first line&quot; intervention.

      The Competent Adulthood Transition with Cognitive Humanistic and Interpersonal Teaching
      (CATCH-IT) internet program has shown positive results with adolescents at risk for
      depression, but has not been used in patients with a chronic illness like diabetes. CATCH-IT
      is based on established CBT and IPT treatment models. It includes a) an innovative and
      effective brief practitioner-provided motivation enhancement component (in person at
      enrollment and through phone calls) and b) self-directed modules for the adolescent that can
      be accessed on the internet.
