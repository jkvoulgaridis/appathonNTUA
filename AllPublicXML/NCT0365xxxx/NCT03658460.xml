  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer patients have a poor prognosis and only around 20 % is alive after 5 years.
      However, for advanced non-small cell lung cancer immunotherapy has become a cornerstone of
      treatment.

      Two immunotherapeutic drugs for lung cancer have been approved in the last two years.
      Immunotherapy blocks the capability of cancer cells to inactivate the patient´s immune
      system, thus re-enabling eradication of cancer cells. In clinical trials, immunotherapy has
      shown superior survival and less toxicity compared to standard chemotherapy.

      Whether the patients are candidates for immunotherapy or not is currently based on an
      unprecise biomarker that poorly predicts the patients who may benefit from immunotherapy.
      Immunotherapy can cause severe adverse effects and is expensive. Consequently, novel
      biomarkers are urgently needed from a patient perspective as well as a socioeconomic
      perspective.

      The objective of the project is to investigate changes in genes and other signals in tissue
      and blood samples from immunotherapy treated lung cancer patients. The investigators expect
      to identify new biomarkers that can predict with high precision, which patients may benefit
      from immunotherapy. On-treatment, the investigators also aim to identify biomarkers that
      predict the treatment response and reveal the underlying mechanisms when cancer cells become
      resistant to the treatment.

        Around 100 patients with advanced NSCLC, who meet the inclusion criteria, are consecutively
        included in the study. The outpatient clinic at the Departments of Oncology, Aalborg
        University Hospital and Aarhus University Hospital recruit and include the patients.
        Patients are candidates to the LimBio protocol regardless of immunotherapy treatment line.
