  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Eligible subjects will receive either different dosages of HK-001 or placebo in a 3:1 ratio
      in 1 of the 7 dose cohorts. After single dose administration, followed by an independent Data
      and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) meeting for safety assessments (including the available
      plasma pharmacokinetic profile), the subjects will be allowed to receive (Z)-BP or placebo
      twice a day orally at the study site for 14 consecutive days and follow up on the 28th day
      after the last dose administration by a site visit. The study drugs (including placebo) will
      be administered at the study site by following the investigator's instructions to either
      perform blood sampling for pharmacokinetic evaluation or maximize the treatment compliance.

      There will be 7 cohorts and subjects will be randomized into cohorts consisting of 8 subjects
      each (6 active and 2 placebo controls per cohort). Dose cohorts will be escalated
      sequentially from low to high dose (50 mg, BID; 100 mg, BID; 150 mg, BID; 225 mg, BID; 300
      mg, BID; 400 mg, BID; 525 mg, BID) by following a modified Fibonacci sequence, and based on
      the decision of an independent DSMB at a set time point. Following all subjects of a cohort
      complete the safety and PK evaluation after receiving the last dose administration, a cohort
      at the next dose level will be launched if the DSMB does not identify significant safety
      concerns after reviewing safety data and PK profiles.

             potential, she must have been amenorrheic for at least 2 years, or must have had a
             hysterectomy, a bilateral tubal ligation, and/or a bilateral oophorectomy (as
             determined by the medical history). The male partner of a female study subject with
             childbearing potential must use a condom and ensure that his partner uses a suitable
             method of contraception as outlined above.
