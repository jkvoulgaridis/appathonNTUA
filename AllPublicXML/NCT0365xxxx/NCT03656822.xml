  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether adding new methods of data visualization to
      routine clinical care will improve (i) surgical planning and (ii) surgical outcomes in
      patients with kidney and prostate tumors.

      This early phase I trial studies how well indwelling pleural catheters with doxycycline work
      compared to indwelling pleural catheters alone in treating participants with malignant
      pleural effusions. These types of catheters are commonly used to treat pleural effusions
      (build-up of fluid in the lungs). Doxycycline is an antibiotic that is also used to treat
      pleural effusions. It is not yet known whether giving doxycycline with indwelling pleural
      catheters works better than indwelling pleural catheters alone in treating participants with
      cancerous pleural effusions.
