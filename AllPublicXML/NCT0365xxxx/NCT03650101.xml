  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neonatal postinfectious hydrocephalus (PIH) is a major public health problem in East
      Africa.The standard treatment has long been placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS)
      but these devices require life-long maintenance and nearly all fail multiple times.
      Endoscopic Third Ventriculostomy (ETV) with Choroid Plexus Cauterization (ETV/CPC) is an
      alternate treatment to give patients a shunt-free life. In this study, the investigators aim
      to optimize the metrics of evaluation as quantitative prognostic indicators of treatment
      response and long term outcomes.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Bayley Scales of Infant Development, Third Edition (BSID-3), cognitive scaled score</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months of age</time_frame>
    <description>Scores on the BSID-3, which is used to evaluate infants and toddlers 1 to 42 months of age, range from 1 to 19, with higher scores indicating better performance; the mean (±standard deviation(SD)) score in the general population is 10±3.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of ETV/CPC treatment failure</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment failure or success will be determined with the use of clinical and radiographic criteria.
Treatment success will be determined as the shift in the growth of head circumference to a normal rate, as plotted on a standard growth chart; decompression of the anterior fontanel; relief of symptoms of elevated intracranial pressure, such as irritability and vomiting; resolution of down-gaze or sixth cranial nerve palsy; and a decrease or arrest in ventriculomegaly as determined on Computerized Tomography (CT).
Treatment failure will be defined as treatment-related death or the need for a second operation for infection or for the recurrence of hydrocephalus.</description>
