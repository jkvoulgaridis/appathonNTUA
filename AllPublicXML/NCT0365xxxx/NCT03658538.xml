  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COPD is characterized by lung injury and inflammation caused by noxious particles and gases,
      including those emanating from cigarette smoke and air pollution. Despite the clear
      detrimental impact of poor air quality on respiratory outcomes, regardless of smoking status,
      to investigators' knowledge, there are no studied environmental interventions targeting
      indoor air quality to improve respiratory health of smokers, thus ignoring a potential target
      for harm reduction. Investigators propose a randomized controlled intervention trial to test
      whether targeted reductions of multiple indoor pollutants (PM, SHS and NO2) in homes of
      smokers with COPD will improve respiratory outcomes. Investigators have chosen a potent,
      multimodal intervention (active air cleaners + Motivational intervention for SHS reduction)
      in order to maximize the opportunity to prove that there is a health benefit to active
      smokers with COPD from indoor air pollution reduction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People with COPD who have higher exposure to indoor pollutants, including particulate matter
      (PM), second hand smoke (SHS), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) have worse respiratory morbidity
      including a higher risk of exacerbations. These effects are not obscured by smoking habit.
      Unfortunately, despite the clear detrimental impact of poor air quality on respiratory
      outcomes, regardless of smoking status, to investigators' knowledge, there are no studied
      environmental interventions targeting indoor air quality to improve respiratory health of
      smokers, thus ignoring a potential target for harm reduction.

      Investigators propose a randomized controlled intervention trial to test whether targeted
      reductions of multiple indoor pollutants (PM, SHS and NO2) in homes of smokers with COPD will
      improve respiratory outcomes. Investigators have chosen a potent, multimodal intervention in
      order to maximize the opportunity to prove that there is a health benefit to active smokers
      with COPD from indoor air pollution reduction. After a one-month run in period in which all
      participants will receive smoking cessation strategies including Motivational Interviewing
      (MI) and nicotine replacement therapy, participants unable to quit smoking (n=120) will have
      1:1 randomization to receive either 1) multi-component environmental intervention (active
      &quot;high-efficiency particulate air&quot;(HEPA) air cleaners + MI intervention for SHS reduction) or
      2) sham air cleaners. All participants will continue to receive smoking cessation counseling
      throughout the study period, including those that quit smoking during the run in period.
      Investigators aim to determine whether a multi-component environmental intervention
      (targeting PM, SHS and NO2 reduction) will improve respiratory morbidity (i.e., symptoms,
      quality of life, lung function and exacerbation risk) (Specific Aim #1) and intermediate
      outcome measures (i.e., markers of airway and systemic inflammation and oxidative stress)
      (Specific Aim #2) in smokers with COPD. Investigators anticipate that results from this study
      will inform clinical practice guidelines and health care policies aimed at reducing COPD
      morbidity and may have broader implications for indoor environmental recommendations for
      smokers with chronic disease.
