  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Uterine arteriovenous malformations (UAVM) are short circuits between systemic arterial and
      venous networks within the uterus. They are congenital or acquired (in the course of an
      endo-uterine gesture such as curettage or interventions such as caesareans or myomectomies).

      They can be manifested by severe metrorrhagia that can go as far as to put the patient's
      vital prognosis at risk.

      There are no recommendations for the management of UAVM since this pathology is rare and
      therefore series are performed with few cases. If some of these UAVM disappear spontaneously
      after a therapeutic abstention, when the clinical context allows it, in case of symptomatic
      UAVM, a selective embolization with arteriography is often carried out to postpone the
      hysterectomy of hemostasis.

      There are also more marginal management options such as Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone
      agonists, methotrexate or curettage that are decided on a case by case basis depending on the
      symptoms and protocols of each medical team.

      Regarding subsequent fertility and pregnancy outcomes after conservative treatment, the
      number of studies is even lower.
