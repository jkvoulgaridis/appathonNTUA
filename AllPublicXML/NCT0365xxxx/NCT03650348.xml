      A Phase 1b, open-label, dose escalation study of PRS-343 in combination with atezolizumab in
      patients with HER2-positive advanced or metastatic solid tumors.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label Phase 1b study to determine the MTD and RP2D and to assess
      the safety and efficacy of PRS-343 administered in combination with atezolizumab, a PD-L1
      antibody, in previously treated advanced or metastatic HER-2 positive solid tumors (e.g.,
      bladder, breast and gastrointestinal). The study will include a dose escalation period
      followed by an expansion period. PRS-343 and atezolizumab will be given intravenously once
      every three weeks (Q3W).

      All available safety data, emerging PK, pharmacodynamic data, and dose limiting toxicities
      (DLTs) will be considered in guiding the Safety Committee's decisions regarding subsequent
      doses to be tested during the escalation phase of the study. Once the MTD and RP2D have been
      established, an expansion cohort will be enrolled.

      One treatment cycle is defined as 21 days (3 weeks).

         15. Autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past (i.e., with use of
             disease-modifying agents, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement
             therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy
             for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is allowed.

             noninvasive or indolent malignancy.

         19. Receipt of investigational treatment within 3 weeks of scheduled Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1)
             dosing.

         20. Receipt of cytotoxic chemotherapy within 3 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas and
             mitomycin C) of scheduled C1D1 dosing.

         21. Receipt of radiation therapy within 3 weeks of scheduled Day 1 dosing, unless the
             radiation comprised a limited field to non-visceral structures (e.g., limb bone
             metastasis).

         22. Receipt of treatment with immunotherapy, biological therapies, hormonal therapies
             within 3 weeks of scheduled C1D1 dosing.
