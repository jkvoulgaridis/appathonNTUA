  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be an open-label study designed to assess the safety and plasma PK of topically
      applied IDP-126 Gel compared to Control Gel.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and plasma pharmacokinetics (PK) of clindamycin and adapalene in
      IDP-126 Gel compared with that from Control Gel in subjects with moderate to severe acne
      vulgaris (acne) during once daily topical application of IDP-126 Gel for 28 days.

    <intervention_model_description>Approximately 48 subjects who meet the study criteria will be enrolled and will receive treatment with one of the 2 study drugs. Approximately 20 subjects will be enrolled in the Control Gel treatment arm and approximately 28 subjects in the IDP-126 Gel treatment arm will be enrolled</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>All AEs will be followed from onset of the adverse event through the end of Study Day 28 visit</time_frame>
    <description>During the study, subjects will be assessed for the occurrence of new and ongoing AEs. Descriptions of AEs will include the dates of onset and resolution, maximum severity, seriousness, action taken regarding study drug, corrective treatment, outcome, and investigator's assessment of causality. Worsening of disease will not be considered an AE unless it results in discontinuation of the subject from the study or requires medical intervention prohibited by the protocol.</description>

             consent must sign an assent for the study and a parent or a legal guardian must sign
             the informed consent (if subject reaches age of consent during the study they should
             be re-consented at the next study visit);

          3. Subject must have a score of 3 (moderate) or 4 (severe) on the Evaluator's Global
             Severity assessment at the screening and baseline visit

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Use of an investigational drug or device within 30 days of enrollment or participation
             in a research study concurrent with this study;

          2. Any dermatological conditions on the face that could interfere with clinical
             evaluations such as acne conglobata, acne fulminans, secondary acne, perioral
             dermatitis, clinically significant rosacea, gramnegative folliculitis, dermatitis,
             eczema;

          3. Any underlying disease(s) or some other dermatological condition of the face that
             requires the use of interfering topical or systemic therapy or makes evaluations and
             lesion count inconclusive;

          4. Subjects with a facial beard or mustache that could interfere with the study
             assessments;

          5. Subjects with more than two (2) facial nodules;

          6. Evidence or history of cosmetic-related acne
