      The aim of the proposed study is to assess the feasibility of using the BrainSonix BX Pulsar
      1002 low-frequency and Low-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Pulsations (LIFUP) in human subjects
      suffering from intractable temporal lobe epilepsy. The patients selected will already be
      scheduled to undergo surgery for resection of the temporal lobe, and the investigational
      therapy will be applied to the temporal lobe at least one day prior to its scheduled removal.
      The study is intended to provide preliminary evidence of safety, and establish the
      feasibility of LIFUP treatment as evidenced by a modulation of the Blood-oxygenation level
      dependent (BOLD) signal in functional MRI (fMRI), and normal findings from histological
      examination of the resected brain tissue.

    <textblock>
      Non-invasive and controllable suppression of regional brain activity may open new avenues for
      the treatment and management of epilepsy. There is good evidence that direct stimulation of
      epileptogenic sources can powerfully suppress seizure rates, but so far minimally invasive
      attempts have shown limited success. Currently, there are no approved non-invasive procedures
      for seizure suppression.

      Focused ultrasound (FUS) is a promising new potential treatment, because it can target any
      region in the brain, regardless of depth, with high spatial specificity. FUS allows for the
      non-invasive delivery of acoustic energy to a well-localized and circumscribed brain region
      of a few millimeters in diameter, depositing mechanical or thermal energy. The possibility of
      transcranial application of FUS into deep brain areas has already been demonstrated by the
      strategic placement and operation of an array of multiple ultrasound transducers.

      The ultrasound based BrainSonix device is a highly novel non-invasive alternative to direct
      stimulation. Capitalizing on non-invasive high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU),
      BrainSonix, using an animal model, found early evidence of selective suppression of regional
      neural activity in the brain. Importantly these effects were non-thermal and reversible.
      Further study is required to validate and characterize the degree of suppressive effects on
      epilepsy to ensure safe application in human subjects. Low Intensity Focused Ultrasound
      Pulsation (LIFUP) differs from HIFU because the intensities of ultrasound used are an order
      of magnitude lower than HIFU. Also, whereas ablative HIFU is administered continuously, LIFUP
      is administered in short pulses, which reduces energy deposition. The investigators' and
      others data have demonstrated that administration of ultrasound, as LIFUP, causes a
      significant, but reversible, neuromodulatory effect, while preventing the tissue from being
      thermally damaged.

      Study Procedures

      Visit 1 Assessment The initial assessment will be performed shortly after signing the consent
      form. The patient will meet with the clinician and baseline demographic information and
      general physical information will be collected. The patient will also undergo a
      psychiatric/neurological evaluation, including a neurological exam, and several
      neuropsychiatric questionnaires using the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) self-report, the Beck
      Depression Inventory (BDI) self-report, a neuropsychiatric battery of tests described in
      section 9.2.4 below, the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) and the
      Mini-Mental Status Assessment (MMSE). They will also be required to complete an Magnetic
      Resonance Imaging (MRI) screening questionnaire to detect the presence of any devices that
      might present a safety risk.

      Visit 2 Treatment and Assessment At visit 2, the participant's temporal scalp will be shaved
      on the side to undergo surgery. Participants will be given the option to have their whole
      head shaved if they prefer for cosmetic reasons. This process typically takes about 10
      minutes.

      The location of the epileptic focus will be determined based on previously performed studies
      as part of the individual's routine epilepsy evaluation. The location of the epileptic focus
      will be determined based on previously performed studies as part of the individual's routine
      epilepsy evaluation. Brain MRI, interictal electroencephalogram (EEG), ictal EEG, interictal
      positron emission tomography (PET), ictal PET, interictal single-photon emission computerized
      tomography (SPECT), ictal SPECT, interictal magnetoencephalography (MEG), ictal MEG, and
      magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy data may be available and utilized to determine each
      participant's epileptogenic zone.

      LIFUP will be administered to the temporal region on the side to undergo surgery, within the
      focus producing seizures (as determined by the comprehensive epilepsy evaluation). LIFUP
      session will take place during the 7 days prior to the operation. See Section 8.2.1 for more
      details regarding the LIFUP Sonication procedure.

      The subject's heart rate and blood pressure will be monitored during the procedure. Routine
      electrode electroencephalography (EEG) will be recorded immediately before and after the
      LIFUP sonication session. Recording will last approximately 60 minutes.

      The same neurological exam and neuropsychiatric questionnaires using the Brief Symptom
      Inventory (BSI) self-report, the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) self-report, and the
      neuropsychiatric battery of tests described above will be performed at Visit 2, as well.
      Testing will last approximately 2 hours.

      LIFUP Sonication Procedure

      Low-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Pulsation (LIFUP) sonications will be conducted using the
      LIFUP experimental device BX Pulsar 1002 produced by the Brainsonix Corporation. For the
      purposes of safety LIFUP sonications will be initiated at the Food and Drug Administration
      (FDA) limit for diagnostic ultrasound. However, the minimally effective dose in humans
      applications, according to, when derated is approximately 1125mW/cm2.

      In the investigators' previous investigational device exception (IDE), the investigators
      based the intended dose on studies done in small animals. Since then, there has been
      sufficient work done on humans and non-human primates to warrant a new approach. Many of
      these studies calculate the estimated intensity inside the brain, but to allow for a more
      direct comparison the investigators will specify approximate non-derated values.

      In 2013 Deffieux and colleagues published a study of focused ultrasound neuromodulation on 2
      awake macaque rhesus monkeys. To alter saccadic eye movements they utilized transcranial US
      at a non-derated spatial-peak, pulse average of (Isppa) of 7.06W/cm2. As they only used
      single pulses, this corresponds a 100% duty cycle and thus to an Ispta of 7.06W/cm2 as well.
      Although they did use pulses of only 100ms.

      In addition to this non-human primate study, there have also been 2 recent studies of focused
      ultrasound neuromodulation in humans. In 2014 a group from Virginia Tech conducted a focused
      ultrasound neurmodulation study on 10 human volunteers, attempting to alter activity in
      primary somatosensory cortex. They used a non-derated US intensity of 8.6W/cm2. Then, this
      year a Korean group also published a study used focused ultrasound to modulate primary
      somatosensory cortex activity on 8 human volunteers. They utilized intensities of 1.5W/cm2.

      Of these human or non-human primate studies only one adverse event has been reported from
      focused ultrasound sonication, specifically one patient complained of feeling &quot;slower&quot; after
      the procedure for 45 minutes before fully recovering. Thus the investigators intend to
      utilize US intensities in the same range. The highest level of US intensity the investigators
      will use is a derated Ispta of 5760mW/cm2. The standard derating equation (It = Iw x e−2αL)
      addresses the issue of soft tissue absorption, which states that at 6.1mm deep (focal length)
      at 650KHz, the focal intensity will be reduced by approximately 25%. So the investigators'
      proposed highest derated intensity corresponds to a non-derated intensity of approximately
      7680mW/cm2.

      LIFUP will be administered to the temporal region on the side to undergo surgery, within the
      focus producing seizures (as determined by the comprehensive epilepsy evaluation). In
      addition the functional magnet resonance imaging (fMRI) recording will be done during the
      LIFUP to determine the target area of activity and to navigate the focus of the transducer to
      that area. The ultrasound will be focused on the highest activity area within the temporal
      lobe. Functional MRI of the brain will be obtained throughout the LIFUP session. Initially
      LIFUP will be administered below the minimum effective dose determined in previous animal
      experiments. Up to 8 sonications will be administered during the LIFUP session. The total
      dose of LIFUP is not to exceed 2 min. The total time within the MRI machine will be up to 90
      minutes. See fMRI procedure below for more details.

      After the participant is fitted with the transducer they will be placed in the MRI machine
      and undergo a series of scans. After placing the transducer over the anterior tip of the
      temporal lobe the participant will undergo fMRI BOLD scans with LIFUP excitation: Tone Burst
      Duration = 2ms and Pulse Repetition Frequency = 250Hz) at four levels of intensity
      (720mW/cm2, 1440mW/cm2, 2880mW/cm2 and 5760mW/cm2). Before increasing the intensity, the
      transducer will be moved approximately 5mm posterior. The excitation scans will be analyzed
      immediately for evidence of BOLD activation. After the last excitation scan the LIFUP
      parameters will be changed to inhibitory parameters: Tone Burst Duration = 0.5ms and Pulse
      Repetition Frequency = 100Hz).

      Surgical Resection and Histology After surgical resection of the anterior temporal lobe,
      histology will be performed on the resected tissue to look for evidence of tissue injury not
      characteristic of temporal lobe epilepsy or previously identified on the routine brain MRI.

      Three Month Follow-up At three months the epilepsy surgeon will assess the healing of the
      surgical wounds and will conduct a Structural MR. The results will be reported back to the
      investigator.

      Six Month Follow-up At six months the epilepsy surgeon will carry out a neurogical exam, and
      several neuropsychiatric questionnaires using the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) self-report,
      the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) self-report, a neuropsychiatric battery of tests
      described in section 9.2.4 below, the MINI, and the Mini Mental Status Assessment.

      Evaluation Methods

      MRI Screening Questionnaire The MRI screening questionnaire will be used to detect the
      presence of any devices that might present a safety risk. This questionnaire is a slightly
      more restrictive version of that developed by the International Society of Magnetic Resonance
      in Medicine and is designed to be comprehensive.

      Neuropsychological Assessments The following neurological and neuropsychological assessments
      will be performed at both study visits.

      Neurological Exam A neurological exam which includes confrontational visual field testing,
      strength testing, fine finger movement assessment and testing of primary and secondary
      sensory modalities will be performed.

      Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) The Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) self-report questionnaire
      will be employed to assess for potential psychiatric side effects. This is a self-report
      questionnaire which takes about 10 minutes to complete, and covers a wide range of
      psychiatric symptomatology, including somatization, obsessive-compulsive, interpersonal
      sensitivity, depression, anxiety, hostility, paranoid ideation, and psychoticism. The BSI
      instrument provides an overview of a patient's symptoms and their intensity at a specific
      point in time. The Global Severity Index (GSI) is designed to help quantify a patient's
      severity-of-illness and provides a single composite score for measuring the outcome of a
      treatment program based on reducing symptom severity. The reliability, validity, and utility
      of the BSI instrument have been tested in more than 400 research studies.

      Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) will be given to
      assess mood more thoroughly. This is also a self-report questionnaire, and requires 5 minutes
      to complete. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI, BDI-II), created by Dr. Aaron T. Beck, is a
      21-question multiple-choice self-report inventory, one of the most widely used instruments
      for measuring the severity of depression. It is composed of items relating to symptoms of
      depression such as hopelessness and irritability, cognitions such as guilt or feelings of
      being punished, as well as physical symptoms such as fatigue, weight loss, and lack of
      interest in sex. The BDI-II was a 1996 revision of the BDI, developed in response to the
      American Psychiatric Association's publication of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
      Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition. The BDI-II contains 21 questions, each answer being scored
      on a scale value of 0 to 3. The cutoffs used differ from the original: 0-13: minimal
      depression; 14-19: mild depression; 20-28: moderate depression; and 29-63: severe depression.
      Higher total scores indicate more severe depressive symptoms.

      Neuropsychiatric Battery of Tests The following battery of neuropsychiatric tests will be
      performed on the study subjects at one of the participant's standard clinical visits, as part
      of their standard clinical care and at visit 2 following the LIFUP sonication procedure. This
      battery of tests has been designed to not interfere with their standard clinical care. The
      Visit 2 scores will be compared to the Visit 1 (Baseline) scores to assess neuropsychiatric
      changes as a result of the LIFUP procedure.

      Seizure Account Participants will be instructed to maintain a daily log of all seizures from
      the date of consenting until the date of the operation.

      Functional MRI (fMRI) BOLD Scans &amp; Analysis Functional MRI recording will be done during the
      LIFUP to determine the target area of activity and to navigate the focus of the transducer to
      that area. Furthermore, functional MRI of the brain will be obtained throughout the LIFUP
      session. The total time within the MRI machine will be up to 90 minutes.

      After placing the transducer over the anterior tip of the temporal lobe the participant will
      undergo fMRI BOLD scans with LIFUP excitation (refer to section 8.2.1). The excitation scans
      will be analyzed immediately for evidence of BOLD activation, as follows:

      Localizer scan If the transducer is not in the appropriate location, then the patient will be
      removed from the scanner, and it will be adjusted. This process will be repeated until the
      transducer is in the appropriate location.

      Matched Bandwidth high resolution scan - 3 minutes fMRI BOLD scan with no LIFUP (resting
      state) - 6 minutes fMRI BOLD scan with eight 0.5s excitation pulses at 720mW/cm2 - 6 minutes
      fMRI BOLD scan with eight 0.5s excitation pulses at 1440mW/cm2 - 6 minutes fMRI BOLD scan
      with eight 0.5s excitation pulses at 2880mW/cm2 - 6 minutes fMRI BOLD scan with eight 0.5s
      excitation pulses at 5760mW/cm2 - 6 minutes MPRAGE high resolution scan - 9 minutes fMRI BOLD
      scan with two 30s inhibition pulses - 6 minutes This will be done at the lowest intensity at
      which activation was seen. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) scan - 15 minutes

      Reliability and repeatability of fMRI scanning will be ensured. For the activation related
      work in the present experiments, centroids of activation will be identified using the
      canonical general linear model (GLM) methods in common use, thresholding regions using z
      statistics calculated under the analysis stream embodied in FSL. In comparing signals across
      trials and stimulus conditions the extent of suprathreshold activity will not be evaluated,
      but the activation magnitude, essentially the slope of regression (&quot;beta weights&quot;) derived
      from the GLM will be evaluated. The investigators have shown that, by comparison to the
      threshold extents, this measure is highly reliable and repeatable across not only individual
      scans, but over multi-day scanning sessions. Additional information regarding fMRI image
      processing and analysis is provided in Appendix A.

      Additionally, MRI anisotropy images and diffusion tensor maps of the brain area following
      resection will be performed (using a 3 Tesla MRI system).

      Heart Rate and Blood Pressure Monitoring The patient will be affixed with a heart rate
      monitor. A periodic blood pressure check will be performed if the heart rate increases more
      than 30% during or immediately after sonication. The investigators' lab has the capacity to
      measure those parameters in MRI. If the patient's blood pressure has also increased more than
      10% then they will be withdrawn from the study.

      EEG Monitoring Routine electrode electroencephalography (EEG) recorded immediately before and
      after the LIFUP sonication session. Recording will last approximately 60 minutes.

      A 30-minute awake EEG using scalp electrodes placed according to the International 10-20
      System of electrode placement will be performed immediately before and immediately after the
      LIFUP treatment.

      A digital 21 channel EEG will collect data. The number of epileptiform discharges during a
      30-minute period before and a 30-minute period after LIFUP will be counted. The investigator
      responsible for counting epileptiform discharges will be blinded as to which record is pre-
      and post-treatment. Epileptiform Discharge frequency (DF) before and after the treatment
      sessions will be determined, and the percent-change in DF (d%-DF) will be calculated.

      Data Collection Symptoms reported by the participant during a treatment session will be
      recorded on a standard worksheet for that treatment session. A standard worksheet for the
      neurological exam will be filled out by a neurologist. The BSI is a self-administered
      questionnaire. The neuropsychiatric battery results will be performed and recorded by a
      neurologist trained to do so by a neuropsychologist. All demographic and neuropsychological
      data will be entered into a database for further analysis.

      Histology After surgical resection of the anterior temporal lobe, histology will be performed
      on the resected tissue to look for evidence of tissue injury not characteristic of temporal
      lobe epilepsy or previously identified on the routine brain MRI. The investigators'
      neuropathologist (Dr. Yong) will assess irreversible disruption to the blood brain barrier,
      apoptosis and ischemia in the specimens, as recommended by the FDA. Dr. Yong believes that
      the investigators will be able to differentiate the damage produced by LIFUP vs. usual
      epilepsy related changes in the temporal lobe. Ultrasound damage is characterized primarily
      by apoptosis, disruption of the blood-brain barrier and coagulation, and, at very high
      intensities, hemorrhage. In contrast, standard epilepsy related changes are more confined to
      glial abnormalities, sclerosis, dilated perivascular spaces and minor inflammatory changes.

      Dr. Yong will perform the histology experiments. Tissue from ultrasound-treated and control
      (untreated) areas of brain will be fixed in 10% formalin for 12-16 hours and formalin-fixed
      paraffin embedded (FFPE) blocks will be prepared. Five micron FFPE sections will be cut and
      stained with hematoxylin and eosin to evaluate for histologic evidence of ischemia,
      apoptosis, and hemorrhage in treated and in control tissues. In addition, a Terminal
      deoxynucleotidyl transferase (dUTP) nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay (ApopTag® Plus Peroxidase
      In Situ Apoptosis Kit, Chemicon, Temecula, CA) will be utilized to detect apoptosis in
      treated and control tissues. Portions of brain from ultrasound-treated and control areas will
      be fixed in glutaraldehyde and epon sections will be prepared for electron microscopy.
      Electron microscopy will be performed to evaluate the blood brain barrier (including
      endothelium and associated glia) of the microvasculature.

      One potential difficulty in analysis arises when acute traumatic and ischemic changes occur
      during the operation. According to the investigators' epilepsy team these occurrences are
      rare and the investigators will exclude the patients that have excessive trauma during the
      brain resection. The specimen from the sonication location will be compared to specimens that
      did not undergo sonication from the same patient and as well as un-sonicated control
      patients.

      Tissue-Marking Dye will be used to permanently mark the margins of the resected tissue area
      which will not be affected by the treatment (control tissue) and to mark the margins of each
      resected tissue area affected by the treatment. Appropriate markings will designate the
      exposed treatment condition to which the tissue was subjected. Although markings will be used
      to designate excised tissue, prepared slides of the tissue will contain coded labels so that
      an independent pathologist examining the sample will remain blinded to the origin of the
      sample.

      Interim Safety Analysis The data will be analyzed after the first subject in order to
      determine subsequent treatment paradigm in the next 2 subjects. After the first participant,
      histology data will also be analyzed by the investigator. If the participant shows
      histological damage in the a category (i.e. apoptosis, irreversible blood brain barrier (BBB)
      disruption, ischemia) at a given intensity then the investigators will continue with the next
      cohort of 2 participants, but the investigators will no longer use that intensity, or higher
      intensities. If more than one participant shows histological damage in the same category at
      the lowest intensity (720mW/cm2), then the study will be stopped.

      Biostatistical Analysis

      Statistical analyses will be performed using SAS® v9.3 or higher (SAS Institute, Cary NC,
      USA).

      If any statistical tests will be performed, they will be two-sided. The required significance
      level of findings will be equal to or lower than 5%. Where confidence limits are appropriate,
      the confidence level will be 95%.

      All statistical analyses of safety and performance measures will be descriptive in nature.
      Continuous variables will be summarized by a mean, standard deviation, minimum, median and
      maximum, and categorical variables by a count and percentage. Confidence intervals will be
      provided where relevant.

      If multiple evaluations are taken in a single patient, statistics described below will be
      appropriately modified to accommodate the within patient correlation.

      Demographic, medical and clinical history variables will be tabulated. Continuous variables
      will be summarized by a mean, standard deviation, minimum, median and maximum, and
      categorical variables by a count and percentage.

      The numbers of patients who were enrolled and completed each visit of the study will be
      provided, as well as the reasons for all enrollment discontinuations, grouped by major reason
      (e.g., lost to follow-up, adverse event). A list of discontinued patients, protocol
      deviations, and patients excluded from the efficacy analysis will be provided as well.

      Histological results in the resected tissue of the anterior temporal lobe will be presented.

      Comparison of all neurological assessment scores at the pre-treatment visit and at the
      post-treatment visit will be presented.

      Comparison of the number of epileptiform discharges and Epileptiform Discharge frequency (DF)
      during a 30-minute period before and a 30-minute period after LIFUP will be presented.

      Change in BOLD signal during or after LIFUP sonication will be presented.

      Subjects who do not have valid data for the efficacy measures will be treated as missing
      values. No imputation is planned.

      Risks and Discomforts

      Some participants might feel uncomfortable answering questions in the psychiatric evaluation
      during the first study visit. They will not be forced to answer if they do not wish to answer
      any particular question. Additional the psychiatric evaluations being used solicit active
      suicidal ideation. Should a participant answer &quot;Yes&quot; to questions B5 to B11 on the MINI, or
      response box 3 or 4 on question 9 of the BDI-II, or any other spontaneous expression of
      suicidality, the licensed physician investigator administer the evaluations will then triage
      to a higher level of psychiatric care.

      There are no known or foreseeable risks or side effects associated with conventional EEG
      recordings.

      MRI is a safe and painless procedure for most people and there are no known health risks
      associated with scanning. The loud gradient noise of the MRI scanner could cause hearing
      damage if no hearing protection was used. All subjects will be required to wear earplugs to
      ensure that scanner noise is reduced to safe levels. Careful screening for contra-indicators
      (e.g., electrically, magnetically, or mechanically activated implants) will be conducted
      before scanning. MRI sessions, the examiner and the technologist performing the measurements
      will maintain voice contact with participants for the entire time that they are in the
      measurement device and repeatedly inquire if they are well and comfortable. If a subject
      becomes claustrophobic or uncomfortable during scanning, s/he will immediately be taken out
      of the measurement device and the experimental session will be discontinued.

      A subject will be withdrawn from the study for any of the following reasons:

      The investigator decides that the subject should be withdrawn due to safety issues The
      patient withdraws consent.

      If a subject withdraws before completing the study, the reason for withdrawal will be
      documented on the case report form (CRF).

      Potential Benefits

      Participation in this study has no direct benefit to the participants. It is hoped that
      future psychiatric patients might benefit if the results of the study help to advance our
      understanding of brain function. The MRI scan is not a diagnostic procedure. However, if the
      investigators believe that an abnormality in a MRI scan has been found a physician, who is
      trained in the reading of MRI scans, will be asked to assist. If the physician determines
      that there is an abnormality (e.g., tumor) in a MRI scan, he will then contact the
      participant and provide him or her with assistance for further follow-up of such an
      abnormality.

      Monitoring and Quality Assurance

      In accordance with Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) guidelines, and as outlined to the
      participants in the consent form, their confidentiality will be ensured throughout the study.
      All data will be identified by code numbers only and no description of individual patients
      will be included in any publication. Participants will be told that they should only write
      down their code number on the questionnaires but not any identifying information such as name
      and demographic data. Any adverse event will be reported according to the reporting
      guidelines. Data will be stored in a locked file cabinet in the Psychiatric Neuroscience
      Program at Charlestown Navy Yard(CNY) 149 at MGH. Additionally, data will be stored
      electronically and on a public website, all in de-identified format.

      Study Completion/Termination A subject will be considered to have completed the study if
      he/she completed the MRI procedure and subsequently underwent temporal lobe surgery.

      The study is considered completed with the last visit of the last subject undergoing the
      study. The sponsor reserves the right to close the investigational site or terminate the
      study at any time. The investigational site will be closed upon study completion.

      The investigators will be trained in the use of the BrainSonix BX Pulsar 1002 device by the
      sponsor. The sponsor will select an investigator who is knowledgeable and experienced with
      the temporal lobe resection procedures performed as part of this study.

      Protocol Modifications The investigator will not modify this protocol without a formal
      amendment. Protocol amendments must not be implemented without prior International
      Electrotechnical Commission (IEC)/Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval, except when
      necessary to eliminate immediate hazards to the subjects in which case the amendment must be
      promptly submitted to the IEC/IRB and relevant competent authority.

      Protocol Deviations The investigator will contact the sponsor representative by fax or
      telephone regarding any situations requiring a deviation from the protocol. If possible,
      contact will be made before implementing any deviation from the protocol. In all cases
      contact with the sponsor must be made as soon as possible in order to discuss the situation
      and agree on an appropriate course of action. The data recorded in the CRF and source
      document will reflect any deviation from the protocol, and the source documents will describe
      this deviation and the circumstances requiring it. Additionally, a protocol deviation form
      will be completed with a detailed explanation of the protocol deviation.

      Subjects Confidentiality Volunteers' name and personal data will remain confidential and will
      not be published in any way.

      Case Report Form Completion All data relating to the study will be recorded in CRFs. Data
      will be entered into CRFs in English only. The CRFs are to be completed at the time of the
      subject's visit, so that they always reflect the latest observations on the subjects
      participating in the study. The investigator must verify that all data entries in the CRFs
      are accurate and correct.

    <description>Low-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Pulsation (LIFUP) sonications will be conducted using the LIFUP experimental device BX Pulsar 1002 produced by the Brainsonix Corporation. For the purposes of safety LIFUP sonications will be initiated at the FDA limit for diagnostic ultrasound. However, the minimally effective dose in humans applications, according to (Lee et al., 2015), when derated is approximately 1125mW/cm2.</description>

    <description>LIFUP will be administered to the temporal region on the side to undergo surgery, within the focus producing seizures. The ultrasound will be focused on the highest activity area within the temporal lobe. Functional MRI of the brain will be obtained throughout the LIFUP session.
After the participant is fitted with the transducer they will be placed in the MRI machine and undergo a series of scans. After placing the transducer over the anterior tip of the temporal lobe the participant will undergo fMRI BOLD scans with LIFUP excitation (from (Lee et al., 2015): Tone Burst Duration = 2ms and Pulse Repetition Frequency = 250Hz) at four levels of intensity (720mW/cm2, 1440mW/cm2, 2880mW/cm2 and 5760mW/cm2). Before increasing the intensity, the transducer will be moved approximately 5mm posterior. After the last excitation scan the LIFUP parameters will be changed to inhibitory parameters (from (Yoo et al., 2011): Tone Burst Duration = 0.5ms and Pulse Repetition Frequency = 100Hz).</description>
