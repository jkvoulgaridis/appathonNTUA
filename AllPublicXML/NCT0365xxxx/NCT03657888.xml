      The aim of the trial is to assess the effectiveness of the volunteer intervention Family Club
      Denmark (FCD). Participants are 200 vulnerable families with children aged 2-12 years, who
      would like to participate in a family club.

      The study is a prospective controlled trial with two conditions: (1) intervention group
      participating in Family Club Denmark and (2) wait-list control group. Participants are
      allocated to intervention after a first-come-first-serve principle. When the maximum number
      of participants in a specific family club is reached, any further families will join the
      wait-list and be offered participation after 6 months.

      Most participating families will be characterized by at least one of the following:

        -  Single parent

        -  Small or no network

        -  Low level of support

        -  Low income

        -  Physical or mental health problem

        -  Unemployed

        -  Loneliness

        -  Lack of contact with other adults

        -  Difficulty with creating relationships

        -  Having a hard time making ends meet during the week

      A family club consists of up to 9 families. Most families are vulnerable but each club also
      includes nun-vulnerable families. The club is run by 3-6 volunteers who have received a 1-day
      training. Participants meet every two weeks for 6 months (12 sessions).

      FCD is based on four principles: 1. Meal community; 2. Play, learning, and togetherness; 3.
      Support and advice; 4. Bridging to the civil society and the public sector

      The 12 sessions center around 7 value posters:

        1. Fun with smiles

        2. Together but not in line

        3. The time is now

        4. Notice and say thank you

        5. More than me

        6. Courage to dare

        7. Taste the world Data are collected at baseline, and after 6 and 12 months. The study is
           conducted in the Region South in Denmark.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (WEMWBS)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>WEMWBS is a 7 item measure of maternal mental health. A total score is calculated by summing the 7 items and converting the raw score according to a published conversion table. Score range 7- 35 for both raw and converted scores. High score is better outcome.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Parent Behavior Inventory (PBI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>(PBI) is a 20 item that measure parenting behaviors in parents of early school-aged children. The PBI includes two subscales with high internal consistency: supportive/engaged (α =.83) and hostile/coercive (α =.81). The PBI has adequate test-retest reliability (r = .69-.74) in an ethnically diverse sample of mothers. To reduce the total number of items we include 10 items - 5 from each of the two subscales: Supportive/Engaged: items 6, 10, 11, 12, 14, and Hostile/Coercive: items 5, 9, 15, 17, 20. Score range is 0-25 for each subscale. High score is better for Supportive/Engaged, low score is better for Hostile/Coercive.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Parental Stress Scale (PSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>PSS is an 18 item measure of parenting stress that is rated on a five-point scale (Strongly disagree, Disagree, Undecided, Agree, Strongly agree). We use the revised Danish version with 16 items where the original items 2 and 11 are left out. The Danish version consists of two subscales: Parental Stress (9 items) and Lack of Parental Satisfaction (7 items). Responses are reversed for the lack of parental satisfaction items, and all responses for all items are dichotomized (0-1) before scoring. Total score range 0-9 (Parental Stress subscale) and 0-7 (Lack of Parental Stress subscale). A low score is better for both subscales.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>General self-efficacy scale (GSE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>GSE is a 10 item measure of optimistic self-beliefs to cope with a variety of difficult demands in life. To reduce the total number of items we include 3 items (8,9, and 10). Score range is 3-12, high score is better.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-worth</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>We use 3 items from the HBSC project to measure self-worth. The 3 items are inspired by Rosenbergs concept of self-esteem. Items are scored from 1 (completely disagree) to 5 (completely agree) and summed. High score is better.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Family routines</measure>
    <time_frame>BAseline, 6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>We use 5 items (1,4,9,11,21) from the Child Routine Inventory (CDI - 39 item version). Item 1,3,4, and 5 are from the Daily Living Routines subscale and item 2 is from the Household Responsibilities subscale. Inspired by the CDI we developed 5 extra items on family routines around mealtimes and language. Items are scored from 0 (never) to 4 (always). High score is better.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Kidscreen-10</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Kidscreen-10 is a 10 item measure of child well-being (health-related quality of health). Items are scored from 1 (never) to 5 (always) except from items 1 and 9 (reverse). Items 1 and 2 explore the level of the child's/adolescent's physical activity, energy and fitness. Items 3 and 4 cover how much the child/adolescent experiences depressive moods and emotions and stressful feelings. Items 5 and 6 ask about the child's opportunities to structure and enjoy his/her social and leisure time and participation in social activities. Item 7 explores the quality of the interaction between child/adolescent and parent or carer and the child's/adolescent's feelings toward their parents/carers. Item 8 examines the nature of the child's/adolescent's relationships with other children/adolescents. Finally, items 9 and 10 explore the child's/adolescent's perception of his/ her cognitive capacity and satisfaction with school performance. Higher score is better</description>
