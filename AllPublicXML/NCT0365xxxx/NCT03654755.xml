  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized open label study to evaluate the long term safety of ASN002 in subjects
      with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (AD).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized open label study where subjects with moderate to severe atopic
      dermatitis will roll over from the Phase 1 ASN002AD-101 and ASN002AD-201 Ph2b study and be
      randomized to receive ASN002 at 40mg, 60mg, or 80mg once daily for up to 24 months. This
      study will also characterize the pharmacokinetics of ASN002 through blood sampling from
      subjects who consent.

    <description>The 5-D Pruritus (Itch) Scale is a multidimensional questionnaire which assesses itch-related quality of life. The questions cover five dimensions of itch including the degree, duration of itch/day, direction (improvement/worsening), disability (impact on activities such as work), and body distribution of itch. A lower total score represents better quality of life.</description>

    <time_frame>4, 13, 26, 39, 52, 65, 78, 91, 104 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Intensity of itch will be measured using an NRS used to indicate the intensity of the worst itching over the past 24 hours using a 0 to 10 numeric rating scale, where &quot;0&quot; represents &quot;no itching&quot; and &quot;10&quot; represents &quot;worst itching imaginable&quot;</description>
