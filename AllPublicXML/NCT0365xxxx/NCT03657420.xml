    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a combination of drugs as a possible treatment for multiple
      myeloma.

      The drugs that will be administered are:

        -  ABI-009 (nab-rapamycin)

        -  Pomalidomide

        -  Dexamethasone

      This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational
      drug and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational drug to use for
      further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved ABI-009 as a treatment for
      any disease.

      The FDA has approved pomalidomide and dexamethasone as treatment options for multiple
      myeloma.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether ABI-009 (study drug) will be safe and slow
      the progress of the disease when used in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone,
      depending on what type of cancer.

      ABI-009 is an inhibitor of an overactive biological pathway in the cancer cells. Pomalidomide
      is an immunomodulatory agent and believed to work by affecting the growth signals that keep
      cancer cells alive. Dexamethasone is a steroid which is believed to kill cancer cells. The
      investigators hope that the combination of ABI-009 with pomalidomide and dexamethasone will
      help stop the growth of the cancer.

    <description>The maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) is the highest dose of ABI-009 (nab-rapamycin) when administered in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone that dose not cause unacceptable side effects. The maximum tolerated dose is determined in clinical trials by testing increasing doses on different groups of people until the highest dose with acceptable side effects is found. A standard 3+3 dose escalation design will be used to assess the MTD.</description>
