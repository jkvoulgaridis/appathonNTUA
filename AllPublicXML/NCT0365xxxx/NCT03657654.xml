  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study of voice outcomes in participants following thyroidectomy or
      another head and neck surgery that does not involve risk to the larynx other than risks
      incurred due to intubation alone. These comparative (non-thyroidectomy) surgeries would not
      be expected to interfere with the primary nerves involved with voice production, so they
      would help to better understand the effect of intubation alone on voice outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Voice difficulty is a common complaint following thyroidectomy, and while the procedure risks
      injury to laryngeal nerves involved in voice production, voice difficulty is common even in
      the absence of evident injury to these nerves. The cause of voice change in these situations
      is not well defined, and multiple mechanisms have been suggested. Some potential mechanisms
      include trauma to the laryngeal skeleton from intraoperative manipulation of the strap
      muscles, cricothyroid muscle, thyroid, cartilage, or trachea. However, it is also possible
      that irritation due to intubation and edema to the neck and oral or pharyngeal soft tissues
      that develops after the surgery as a result of intubation plays a role in postoperative voice
      change. These mechanisms can occur in any operation requiring general endotracheal anesthesia
      even when the laryngeal nerves are not specifically at risk of injury.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate voice outcomes after thyroidectomy (both objective
      and subjective patient and clinician reported) and compare those to voice outcomes after
      other surgeries that do not put the recurrent or superior laryngeal nerves at risk or
      traumatize the laryngeal skeleton, but do require general endotracheal anesthesia. The
      primary assessment tool will be the Voice Handicap Index-10 (VHI-10), which is a
      questionnaire that asks about the patient's interpretation of his/her voice quality and the
      impact it is having on daily activities. Data analysis will be done to see if participants
      have a significant change in their pre-operation VHI-10 score at approximately 1 week and 3
      months post-operation. Additional assessments tools will include nasolaryngoscopy and
      nasolaryngeal stroboscopy to assess global vocal fold function, Consensus Auditory Perceptual
      Evaluation of Voice (CAPE-V) and computerized speech lab (CSL) acoustics to assess voice
      quality, and vocal aerodynamic analysis to determine air flow through the larynx.

    <measure>Video nasolaryngeal stroboscopy</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 week following surgery, 3 months following surgery</time_frame>
    <description>This imaging is another form of nasolaryngoscopy but has the addition of a strobe light. The strobe light provides an optical illusion in which the vocal cords appear to be moving in slow motion on the video, even though its movement is unaltered.</description>

    <measure>Vocal Aerodynamics Analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 week following surgery, 3 months following surgery</time_frame>
    <description>This assessment is performed by fitting the participant with a mask that is attached to a tube that goes just inside the participant's lips. This positioning allows for the participant to close his/her lips around the tube without occluding it. The participant is asked to produce repeated syllables like pi-pi-pi-pi-pi, which allows for airflow and air pressure to be measured and reflects vocal fold function.</description>

    <measure>CAPE-V</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 week following surgery, 3 months following surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The CAPE-V is a tool used for clinical auditory-perceptual assessment of voice. It is intended to describe the severity of various auditory attributes of a voice problem, and it is determined by the clinician's auditory assessment of the patient's voice.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>CSL acoustics</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 week following surgery, 3 months following surgery</time_frame>
    <description>This assessment involves having the participant speak into a microphone. The patient says a few scripted sentences, as well as repeated sounds, which is then analyzed by the computer software. The assessment allows for determination of vocal loudness, pitch, and voice quality. Voice quality is determined based on measures including vocal shimmer, vocal jitter, and background noise in the voice. Shimmer measures variation in voice amplitude and jitter measures variation in frequency.</description>
