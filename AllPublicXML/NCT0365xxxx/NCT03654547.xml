  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human, phase I clinical research study with TT-00420, an investigational,
      oral, multi-target, dual mechanism kinase inhibitor targeting both mitosis and tumor
      micro-environment, for the treatment of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and other
      advanced solid tumors. The study consists of a dose escalation part followed by a MTD
      expansion part.

      Dose Escalation Cohorts: Eligible adult patients with advanced solid tumors will be enrolled
      into Dose Escalation cohorts. Starting dose of TT-00420 mono-therapy will be 1 mg p.o., q.d.
      TT-00420 capsule will be administered once daily on a continuous schedule. A treatment cycle
      consists of 28 days. An ABLRM guided by the EWOC principle will evaluate the risk of
      under-dose or over-dose for the dose tested in each cohort and provide the recommendation
      dose for next cohort. Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) will be evaluated per the pre-defined DLT
      criteria and managed by the pre-defined rules detailed in the protocol. Maximum Tolerated
      Dose (MTD) and/or Dose Recommend for Dose Expansion (DRDE) will be determined in Dose
      Escalation cohorts.

      Dose Expansion Cohorts:

      TNBC Cohort:

      TNBC Dose-Expansion cohort will be opened to enroll the patients with advanced TNBC and
      evaluate the safety, PK and preliminary efficacy of TT-00420 to identify the optimal
      biological dose (OBD), when feasible, in patients with advanced TNBC.

      SAT Cohort:

      A parallel basket SAT Dose Expansion Cohort will be open to enroll patients with selected
      advanced tumors (SAT) to evaluate the safety, PK and preliminary efficacy of TT-00420 to
      identify the optimal biological dose (OBD), when feasible, in patients with SATs.

      Recruitment in dose expansion cohorts may be put on hold if any significant safety finding(s)
      that was not observed in dose escalation cohorts is identified. Bayesian modeling will be
      updated with the new findings to evaluate if the previously determined MTD or DRDE still
      suitable for further enrollment.
