  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple organ failure (MODS) is still the leading cause of death in children in ICU. The
      treatment of MODS is mainly organ function monitoring and organ replacement therapy. Life
      support technology in vitro mainly includes mechanical ventilation, continuous renal
      replacement therapy (CRRT), non-biological artificial liver and extracorporeal membrane
      oxygenation technology (ECMO). However, critically ill patients who have multiple organ
      failure often require multiple organ support meanwhile. Combined extracorporeal life support
      (CELS) is still in its infancy to be applied in the treatment of critical illness due to
      nonstandard technology and theory without key breakthroughs and evidence-based medicine in
      the treatment of severe children organ failure.Solving the system problems supported by CELS
      can effectively reduce the mortality and disability rate of critically ill children and
      enhance health care in Shanghai, even across China.

      The whole study is described below. To investigate the timing ,curative effect and mode of
      CRRT and ECMO treatment for critically ill children,we choose sepsis children especially
      those who are combined with septic shock as research object.

      Furthermore,refractory shock is the therapeutic indications of ECMO. According to their
      clinical manifestation and severity of the disease,they are treated by CRRT or/with ECMO in a
      non-randomized way.

      Comparing the laboratory index and prognosis of critically ill children treated by CRRT and
      those treated by ECMO,we aim to investigate the the timing ,curative effect of ECMO in the
      treatment of septic shock especially refractory shock.

      The critically ill children who treated by CRRT are divided into three groups according to
      their treatment mode of CRRT. The laboratory index and prognosis are also be compared to
      investigate curative effect of CRRT in the treatment of septic shock.

      The study also include severe sepsis children without CRRT or ECMO treatment as a control
      group.

    <description>The PRISM score is a quantification of physiologic status using predetermined physiologic variables and their ranges that use categorical variables to facilitate accurate estimation of mortality risk.The PRISM components were separated into cardiovascular (heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and temperature), neurologic ( pupillary reactivity and mental status), respiratory (arterial Po2, pH, Pco2, and total bicarbonate), chemical (glucose, potassium, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine), and hematologic (WBC count, platelet count, prothrombin, and partial thromboplastin time) component.The score above 10 indicates a poor prognosis and higher mortality of critical ill children. The score below 10 indicates a relatively favorable prognosis and lower mortality .</description>
