  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ultrasound guided interscalene nerve blockade with local anesthesia is a standard regional
      anesthetic technique for providing postoperative analgesia during shoulder arthroscopy and
      wide variety of shoulder procedures. There is a paucity of data regarding the effects of
      shoulder arthroscopy on ultrasound image quality, including the effects of muscle
      mobilization and the use of large volume irrigation and subsequent tissue absorption, though
      increased neck circumference and airway edema are known complications of arthroscopic
      shoulder procedures.

      The objective of the study is to determine if there is a difference in ultrasound image
      quality of the interscalene block anatomy, by Likert scale, pre- versus post-operatively in a
      cohort of patients undergoing shoulder arthroscopy who routinely receive blockade of the
      brachial plexus for postoperative analgesia. Further, if there are differences in imaging
      quality, correlations with surgical and patient factors will be studied.
