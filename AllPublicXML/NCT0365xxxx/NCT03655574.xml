  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates a brief motivation-building intervention for parents and teens to reduce
      truancy and substance use. It is hypothesized that the motivational intervention will result
      in better outcomes compared to an education-only intervention.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adolescents who use marijuana and are truant from school are a high-risk population with
      increased likelihood of substance use disorders, criminal justice involvement, and long-term
      impairments in vocational, family, and peer domains.

      This study will test a theory-driven intervention for early adolescent marijuana using,
      truant youth identified through Rhode Island Truancy and Family Courts. Adolescents will be
      randomly assigned to one of the 2 conditions: a motivational interview versus
      psychoeducation.

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The MET individual session covers three constructs; 1) intentions to use marijuana; 2) normative beliefs about peer substance use; and 3) attitudes towards peer substance use. These same three constructs are also addressed with respect to truancy. In addition, motivation to abstain from substance use is discussed.
The FCU session with teens and parents/caregivers begins by collecting self-report measures and conducting a videotaped Family Assessment Task (FAsTask) to assess parent-teen interactions. The FAsTask is the basis of FCU feedback. There are four specific phases of the feedback session: 1) Self-assessment, 2) Support and clarification, 3) Feedback, and, 4) Action plan.</description>

    <description>An interventionist will review a set of educational materials with the parents regarding teen marijuana use, effects of marijuana on the brain, body and behavior, risks associated with marijuana use, how to tell if a teen is engaging in marijuana use or truancy, and parenting skills. A comparable set of materials will be reviewed with the adolescent.</description>

    <intervention_name>Motivational + Family Check-up (MET+FCU)</intervention_name>
    <description>In the MET session, motivational strategies of individualized normative feedback, examining decisional balance, and providing information/advice will be used to support goals for behavior change and to examine barriers to changes. There are four specific phases of the FCU session: (1) Self-assessment: Parents are asked if they learned anything about their family from participating in the assessment. (2) Support and clarification: The interviewer supports the parent's self-assessment efforts, assesses their level of understanding, and clarifies issues within the family. (3) Feedback: A summary form of the assessment is reviewed. (4) Action Plan: Throughout the session, the counselor works with the parent to develop a brief, written Action Plan about communication and monitoring.</description>
