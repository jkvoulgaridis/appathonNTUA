  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Persistent epithelial defects (PED) are corneal ulcers that do not heal within the first two
      weeks of treatment with artificial tears or ocular lubricant ointment. It is believed that
      this condition is the result of the loss of certain substances normally present in the tears
      that aid in the healing process of the cornea. When the eye is healthy, these ulcers
      typically heal rapidly. However, when there is an underlying disease such as diabetes, this
      healing process is altered and it takes longer for the ulcer to heal. Autologous
      platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is a substance that is obtained from the patient's own blood and
      it is believed this substance may replace those missing factors in the tears of patients with
      PED. The purpose of this investigation is to find out whether PRP combined with a bandage
      contact lens is better than preservative free lubricant combined with bandage contact lens or
      than eye patch with ocular lubricant ointment for the treatment of PED. Participants will be
      randomly assigned to one of the three groups and will get the treatment until the ulcer heals
      completely. We will count the days it takes for the PED to heal and based on that we will
      determine wich treatment is more effective (the treatment that takes the least days to heal
      will be considered the most effective). Since this disease is difficult to treat and doesn't
      have a gold standard treatment, usually the available treatments are not as good as we would
      like, therefore, the ulcer might progress even to perforation regardless of the treatment. In
      these cases, we will provide appropriate treatment for progressive corneal thinning and
      corneal perforation.

      Persistent epithelial defects (PED) are corneal lesions that do not heal within the first two
      weeks of conventional treatment (i.e. preservative-free lubricant, bandage contact lens
      (BCL), ocular lubricant ointment, eye patching). These defects are the result of the loss of
      certain lacrimal factors that maintain the integrity and homeostasis of the corneal
      epithelium and ocular surface. Normally, PED heal rapidly in the healthy eye. However,
      underlying ocular surface pathology can slow down the healing process and contribute to the
      persistence of the epithelial defect. Hematopoietic derivatives such as autologous
      platelet-rich plasma (PRP) may replace these missing components and eventually lead to
      complete healing in a faster and more comfortable way for the patient. The objective of this
      study is to determine if PRP combined with BCL is more effective than preservative-free
      lubricant combined with BCL or than eye patch with ocular lubricant ointment for the
      treatment of PED. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the three groups and
      treatment will be administered until achieving complete defect closure. The effectiveness of
      each treatment will be measured in terms of days taken to achieve complete closure. Since PED
      is a complex disease that is difficult to treat, the available treatments are not very
      effective, therefore, PED might progress even to perforation regardless of the treatment. In
      this last scenario, we will provide appropriate treatment for progressive corneal thinning
      and corneal perforation

    <intervention_model_description>Subjects will be randomly assigned to three groups. Demographic characteristics and underlying etiologies will be identified. Subjects will undergo a general ophthalmologic evaluation (baseline) and PED size will be measured. Treatments will be administered until complete defect healing is achieved and visits will be scheduled weekly or as needed for continued ophthalmologic evaluation. After complete closure, subjects will be followed for three months with visits every 2 to 4 weeks to evaluate progress and identify recurrences.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Ocular pain will be assessed using the Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale. The scale ranges from 0 (no pain) to 10 (maximum pain), and includes 6 faces (visual representation), numbers, and written descriptions that represent the level of pain. The first face represents a pain score of 0 and it reads &quot;no hurt&quot;; the second face represents a pain score of 2 and it reads &quot;hurts little bit&quot;; the third face represents a pain score of 4 and it reads &quot;hurts little more&quot;; the fourth face represents a pain score of 6 and it reads &quot;hurts even more&quot;; the fifth face represents a pain score of 8 and it reads &quot;hurts whole lot&quot;; the last face represents a pain score of 10 and it reads &quot;hurst worst&quot;.

    <description>Ocular surface symptoms as assessed by the Symptom Assessment in Dry Eye (SANDE) questionnaire. The SANDE questionnaire consists of two questions presented in visual analog scale. The first question assesses the frequency of dry eye syndrome and the scale ranges from &quot;rarely&quot; to &quot;all the time&quot; on a 100 mm line. The second question assesses the severity of dry eye syndrome and the scale ranges from &quot;very mild&quot; to &quot;very severe&quot; on a 100 mm line. Patients are asked to place a mark on the line to represent the extent of their symptoms, then the location of the marks on each line are measured from left to right in mm. The SANDE score is calculated by multiplying the frequency value times the severity value and obtaining the square root. Lower scores represent a better outcome.</description>

    <description>Ocular surface symptoms as assessed by the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI). The OSDI questionnaire consists of 12 questions that assess dry eye symptoms and their effects on vision related function. The questionnaire is divided in 3 subscales: ocular symptoms, vision-related function, and environmental triggers. Patients are asked to rate their responses on a 0 to 4 scale where 0 represents &quot;none of the time&quot;, 1 &quot;some of the time&quot;, 2 &quot;half of the time&quot;, 3 &quot;most of the time&quot;, and 4 &quot;all of the time&quot;. The total score is calculated using the following formula: ([sum of scores for all questions answered x 100] / [total number of questions answered x 4]). Lower scores represent a better outcome.</description>

    <description>Quality of life as assessed by the National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI VFQ-25). The NEI VFQ-25 questionnaire consists of 25 questions that assess the effect of visual impairment on the patient's quality of life. The 25-item questionnaire gives a score on a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 is the worst score and 100 is the best score. Higher scores represent a better outcome.</description>
