      To address the critical scientific gaps in PrEP safety for transgender youth and to plan for
      appropriate implementation of PrEP in transgender youth communities, the study will be
      conducted in 3 integrated phases. In Phase 1, a pharmacokinetic (PK) study exploring the
      interactions of cs-HT for both TW and TM youth on TDF/FTC will be conducted. Simultaneously,
      in Phase 2, ethnographic data via focus groups (FGs) and in-depth interviews (IDIs) to inform
      the development of a tailored intervention to improve uptake and adherence to PrEP for
      transgender youth will be collected. In Phase 3, a small demonstration trial of PrEP use in
      transgender youth, utilizing the ethnographically developed intervention to improve uptake
      and adherence, while also monitoring renal and bone safety outcomes will be implemented.

      The project has the following important specific aims:

      Aim 1: To evaluate the differential PK of TDF/FTC in a cohort of transgender youth on cs-HT
      by conducting a PK trial of daily TDF/FTC among 24 TW taking estradiol and 24 TM taking
      testosterone (ages 15-24 years) using video-based directly observed therapy (DOT) to insure
      daily adherence and maximize drug exposure.

      Aim 2: To develop a culturally, developmentally, and gender-affirmative intervention to
      increase uptake of and adherence to PrEP among TW and TM youth that is grounded in theory
      (Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills Model of Behavior Change, Gender Affirmation,
      Empowerment Theory) and incorporates the PK data from Aim 1. The investigators will conduct
      FGs with young TW (N=20-30) and TM (N=20-30) and conduct IDIs with participants from the PK
      study (Total N=10-14). Investigators will solicit continuous input and feedback from TW and
      TM on the project's Youth Advisory Board.

      Aim 3: To conduct a small randomized controlled trial within a PrEP demonstration project
      comparing the newly developed intervention with standard of care (SOC) in TW (N=50) and TM
      (N=50) ages 15-24 years.

      Transgender women (TW) are one of the most vulnerable populations for acquiring HIV
      infection, and the scant available data on transgender men (TM) suggests they are also at
      risk. TW have accounted for only 0.2% of all participants in bio-behavioral HIV prevention
      trials using pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), and TM have typically not been included. TW and
      TM adolescents have received even less attention in PrEP trials.

      Although tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC), the FDA-approved PrEP drug,
      would not be expected to interact with cross-sex hormone therapy (cs-HT; estradiol and
      testosterone) based on known mechanisms and data from studies with hormonal contraceptives,
      there are no data that prove this. Given this lack of data, TW and TM youth on cs-HT have
      decreased PrEP uptake and adherence due to concerns that PrEP may reduce the effectiveness of
      cs-HT. To address these critical scientific gaps in PrEP safety for transgender youth and to
      plan for appropriate implementation, the investigators propose the following study in 3
      integrated phases. In Phase 1, the investigators will conduct a PK study exploring the
      interactions of cs-HT for both TW and TM on TDF/FTC. Simultaneously, in Phase 2, the
      investigators will collect ethnographic data via focus groups and in-depth interviews to
      inform the development of a tailored gender-affirmative intervention to improve uptake and
      adherence to PrEP in transgender youth. In Phase 3, the investigators will conduct a small
      demonstration trial of PrEP use in TW and TM youth, utilizing the ethnographically developed
      intervention to improve uptake and adherence, while also monitoring renal and bone safety
      outcomes.
