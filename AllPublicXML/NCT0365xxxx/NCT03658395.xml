  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants who undergo laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy (LSCP) plus posterior repair (PR) will
      demonstrate greater improvement bowel symptom scores compared to participants who undergo
      LSCP alone at 3 months postoperatively.

  <detailed_description>

      Those who provide informed consent will be randomized into either laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy
      (LSCP) alone or laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy (LSCP) plus posterior repair (PR). Participants
      will be randomized with equal probability to the LSCP only arm or LSCP plus PR arm.

      The surgical technique for LSCP will be similar to that described by Paraiso et al. for LSCP
      [14] and by Elliott et al. for robot-assisted LSCP [15], with minor variations. A Y-shaped
      polypropylene mesh graft, 10 cm in standard length and tailored to each patient's anatomic
      specifications during surgery, will be used with all SCP procedures.

      PR is performed by midline fascial plication. Plication of superficial perineal muscles
      (perineorrhaphy) is performed in conjunction with PR. All repairs are performed using
      polydioxanone 2/0 for fascial repair and 4/0 polyglactin suture for skin closure.

      Participants will also complete questionnaires and undergo an endovaginal ultrasound (using a
      9-16 MHz, 360° rotational transducer, type 8838, BK Medical, Peabody, MA) prior to surgery
      and three months following surgery.

    <description>The primary outcome of this study (AIM 1) is to compare bowel symptom scores in patients with ODS who undergo LSCP+PR compared to those who undergo LSCP only. Our primary outcome is a composite score from Questions 4, 7, and 8 of the PFDI-20.The responses to these three questions will be summed to a maximum score of 12. The ODS questionnaire is a validated, disease-specific, scoring system commonly used in the colorectal literature, which measures constipation severity, specifically outlet obstruction. Validated pelvic floor symptom survey data using the Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory-20 (PFDI-20), Pelvic Floor Impact Questionaire-7 (PFIQ-7), and Pelvic Organ Prolapse/Urinary Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire-12 (PISQ-12) will be obtained at study time points.</description>

    <measure>Secondary Outcome (correlation between bowel symptoms scores and 3D ultrasound measurements)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months postoperative</time_frame>
    <description>For our secondary outcome, (AIM2) we will establish a correlation between bowel symptoms score and 3D ultrasound measurements of rectal support and LAM defects. Sonographic data will consist of Levator Ani Deficiency (LAD) score and Levator Plate Descent (LPDA) angle. Bowel symptom scores will be a subscale of the PFDI calculated using questions 4, 7, and 8 referring to splinting, straining, and incomplete emptying, respectively. The responses to these three questions will be summed to a maximum score of 12. We refer to these three questions collectively as the PFDI-Obstructed (PFDI-O), to represent obstructed defecation.</description>
