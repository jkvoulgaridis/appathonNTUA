  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study involves a single family, including 1 patient, father, mother and sister. The
      patient presented with a new phenotype associating premature white hair, renal polycystosis,
      aortic dilation/dissection and lymphopenia. Samples were taken in order to identify the
      origin of the symptomatology highlighted in the index case.

      In addition, it was observed that mice invalidated for bcl-2, normal at birth and
      indistinguishable from control mice, showed, after one week, a phenotype similar to that
      observed in this patient.

      The overlap between the patient's main clinical signs (lymphopenia, white hair and polycystic
      renal disease) and the manifestations presented by the invalidated murine model for BCL2
      suggests that its phenotype may be secondary to a Bcl-2 expression defect.
