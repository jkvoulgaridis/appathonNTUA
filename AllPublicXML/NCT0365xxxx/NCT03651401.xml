  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rotator cuff lesions (RCL) are one of the most common shoulder joint disorders. The most
      important cause of RCL is the impairment of the balance of synergies and force couples of
      muscles responsible for scapulothoracic stabilization.This study aims to investigate the
      relationship between scapular muscle endurance (SME), pain, muscle strength, and function in
      patients with shoulder RCL.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eighty nine patients with shoulder RCL and 32 healthy controls were evaluated. Patients with
      subacromial impingement syndrome (SIS) (n:25) and partial rotator cuff tears (PRCT) (n:28),
      who met the inclusion criteria, and 23 healthy controls were included in the study.
      Participants were assessed for SME, pain (rest, activity, night), shoulder girdle and
      scapular muscle strengths and upper extremity function (FIT-HaNSA). In addition, Constant &amp;
      Murley score, the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI), and the Nottingham Health
      Profile (NHP) were administered.
