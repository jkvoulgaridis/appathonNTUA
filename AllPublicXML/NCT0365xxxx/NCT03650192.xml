  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study assesses the investigational sensor's (INVSENSOR00027) performance for detection
      of subjects' position and posture in bed, along with heart rate and respiratory rate.

    <measure>Sensitivity of INVSENSOR00027's posture change detection</measure>
    <time_frame>approximately 55 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>For each subject's position detection, INVSENSOR00027 output will be compared against observer's notes at each turn of the subject. Correctly detected position changes will be marked as True Positive. Missed detections (if any) will be counted. The sensitivity of INVSENSOR00027's posture change detection will be computed as Sensitivity = True Positive/(True Positive+Missed Detection)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Heart Rate Detection</measure>
    <time_frame>approximately 55 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>When INVSENSOR00027 heart rate readings are available, it will be compared against reference pulse-rate by computing mean and standard deviation of the differences.</description>

    <measure>Respiratory Rate Detection</measure>
    <time_frame>approximately 55 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>When INVSENSOR00027 respiratory rate readings are available, it will be compared against reference respiratory rate by computing mean and standard deviation of the differences.</description>

          -  Has signed all necessary related documents, e.g. written informed consent, volunteer
             payment form, confidentiality agreement

          -  Has completed Health Assessment Questionnaire and passed health assessment screening

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has any medical condition which in the judgment of the investigator, renders
             them inappropriate for participation in this study
