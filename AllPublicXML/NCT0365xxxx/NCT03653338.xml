  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate what effect, if any, mismatched unrelated volunteer
      donor and/or haploidentical related donor stem cell transplant may have on severe sickle cell
      disease and other transfusion dependent anemias. By using mismatched unrelated volunteer
      donor and/or haploidentical related donor stem cells, this study will increase the number of
      patients who can undergo a stem cell transplant for their specified disease. Additionally,
      using a T-cell depleted approach should reduce the incidence of graft-versus-host disease
      which would otherwise be increased in a mismatched transplant setting.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CD3/CD19 depletion of mismatched donor grafts in the setting of reduced intensity,
      immune-ablative conditioning for patients with sickle cell disease and other
      transfusion-dependent anemias should sufficiently achieve engraftment while decreasing the
      incidence of treatment-related toxicities and achieving an acceptable incidence of graft
      versus host disease. Utilizing mismatched unrelated volunteer donors and haploidentical
      related donors will increase the number of patients able to undergo hematopoietic stem cell
      transplant (HSCT) for these diseases. Additionally, the institutional availability of
      virus-specific, donor-derived cytotoxic T lymphocytes should address complicated viral
      infections refractory to standard anti-viral therapy.

      The purpose is to:

        -  To provide alternate donor transplantation from cryopreserved stem cell grafts that are
           fully characterized for safety and potency to patients with severe sickle cell disease,
           beta-thalassemia major, or Diamond-Blackfan anemia who do not have matched sibling
           donor, matched unrelated donor or cord blood donor options.

        -  To utilize a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen to achieve minimal treatment-related
           morbidity and mortality while attaining sustained donor engraftment and donor chimerism
           &gt;20% in order to rescue disease phenotype, specifically in SCD patients.

        -  To utilize ex-vivo T-cell depletion methods to prevent graft-versus-host disease in the
           setting of mismatched donor transplantation.

        -  To utilize additional donor cell products to ensure sufficient immune reconstitution in
           the immediate post-transplant period, to improve mixed chimerism or provide non-specific
           anti-viral activity in patients with virus reactivation in the post-transplant period.

        -  To utilize calcineurin inhibitor-free regimen in an effort to minimize/prevent central
           nervous system toxicity

    <description>All patients will receive a CD3+/CD19+ depleted stem cell transplant. In this study, the investigators will use HLA mismatched unrelated or haploidentical related donor peripheral blood stem cells. Prior to transplantation, the marrow (90-95%) will be negatively selected for CD3/CD19 using the ClinicMACs® depletion device. The remaining (5-10%) will undergo CD45+RA+ depletion and be frozen for future use as an immune boost.
Subjects will undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplant utilizing CD3+/CD19+ depleted cells following conditioning therapy.</description>
