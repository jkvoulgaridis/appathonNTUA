    <textblock>
      Insulin resistance is a positive protective reaction against surgery .this resistance has
      some negative consequences for patient health. It is associated with infectious
      complications. At the same time, Postoperative insulin resistance has been shown to correlate
      with the length of postoperative stay in hospital. Recently several clinical studies have
      shown that a carbohydrate-rich drink given 2 h before surgery diminishes postoperative
      insulin resistance in patient. The aim of our study is to investigate the influence on
      insulin resistance in patient with diabetes.

      Insulin resistance is a positive protective reaction against surgery . As a response to
      surgery, activation of neuroendocrine and inflammation systems occurs as a protective
      reaction. However, this resistance has some negative consequences for patient health. It is
      associated with infectious complications. At the same time, Postoperative insulin resistance
      has been shown to correlate with the length of postoperative stay in hospital. Recently
      several clinical studies have shown that a carbohydrate-rich drink given 2 h before surgery
      diminishes postoperative insulin resistance in patient. The aim of our study is to
      investigate the influence on insulin resistance in patient with diabetes.
