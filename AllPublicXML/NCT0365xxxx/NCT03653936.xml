  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rebion (Rebiscan, Inc) has developed a noninvasive, handheld device that uses retinal
      birefringence scanning (RBS) to rapidly assess eye fixation and retinal integrity in adults
      and children. The proprietary technology uses a scanned annulus of polarized laser light to
      create a signature that confirms central fixation within seconds. The project described
      herein aims to provide accurate assessment of brain dysfunction in TBI (Traumatic Brain
      Injury) patients through the use of the developed device, which is called the Head and
      Intraocular Trauma Test (HITT) device.

    <description>Rebion has developed a noninvasive, handheld device that uses retinal polarization scanning (RPS) to rapidly assess eye fixation and retinal integrity in adults and children. RPS can automatically detect the fixation of the human eye with proprietary technology that uses a scanned annulus of polarized laser light to create a signature that confirms central fixation within seconds. RPS requires no calibration or imaging, and eye movement recordings are not required. The HITT device is a repurposed Pediatric Vision Scanner (PVS), Rebion's first commercial product which has passed all applicable safety and performance standards.</description>

        Cohort study of individuals tested with the Rebion device followed by SCAT3 examination.
        Two data sets will be taken and compared: a cohort with non-contact sport athletes
        (swimmers, tennis, track) and a cohort of contact sport athletes (lacrosse, spring
        football, and spring soccer).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Student-athletes who present to schools affiliated with the Bluegrass Sports Clinica

          -  Engaged in sports

          -  Older or equal to 11 years of age, and less than 21 years of age.

          -  Provide informed consent; youths must have their parents sign the informed consent
             document. Children will be presented with a written assent statement and that they
             will be asked to sign the assent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Catastrophic polytrauma that would interfere with follow-up and outcome assessment

          -  Amblyopia/strabismus

          -  Pregnancy in female subjects

          -  Any injury to eye including, puncture, scratch, occlusion, fracture to orbital socket
             (or any fracture to face that would negatively impact eye movement/vision) that would
             interfere with ability to complete study-device assessment.

          -  History of poor vision prior to injury (Visual acuity worse than 20/40 in either eye)

          -  Intoxication or chemical impairment at time of examination (upon initial presentation)
