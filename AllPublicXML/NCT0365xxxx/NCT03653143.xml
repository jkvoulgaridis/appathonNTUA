  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine whether JASPER (Joint Attention, Symbolic Play,
      Engagement, Regulation), which is an intensive, targeted early behavioral intervention
      focused on a developmentally based approach for teaching joint engagement, joint attention,
      and play skills can improve behavioral / emotional regulation, social communication skills,
      and developmental trajectories in Down syndrome (DS). The investigators will also explore the
      potential use of EEG and event-related potentials (ERP) as outcome measures, as this approach
      may help elucidate mechanisms of change in behavior and development, and may help explain
      differences in development of social communication skills in individuals with DS. EEG and ERP
      measure may also help to predict treatment outcome.

    <intervention_model_description>Participants will initially undergo brief telephone screen to assess eligibility. Inclusion in this study will be limited to children who are currently able to: walk across a room independently, use at least 5 words/signs. Participants will complete a series of survey and ERP/EEG assessments during the Baseline visit. After completion of the Baseline visit, participants will be randomly assigned to either the treatment group or the control/waitlist group. Group assignment will be random. The treatment group will start with 3 months of JASPER intervention and then have 3 months of their usual clinical care. The control/waitlist group will start with 3 months of their usual clinical care and then undergo 3 months of JASPER intervention. The 3-month treatment phase will involve weekly sessions with the JASPER interventionist, each 60 minutes long. Survey and ERP/EEG assessments will be repeated at the 3 month and at 6 month research visits for all participants.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Change in cognition</measure>
    <time_frame>Administered at baseline assessment #1 (0 months), assessment visit #2 (3 months), and assessment visit #3 (6 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Composite scores from the Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL) will be used to measure cognition and language development. Composite scores are calculated averages based on MSEL subscales 1) Gross motor 2) Visual reception 3) Fine motor 4) Receptive language 5) Expressive language.

    <description>JASPER is a therapist and parent-mediated intervention that (1) targets the foundations of social communication, (2) uses naturalistic behavioral strategies to increase the rate and complexity of social communication and (3) includes parents as implementers of the intervention to promote generalization across settings and to ensure maintenance. This intervention is individualized and centered around two key developmental domains critical for social communication function: joint engagement and joint attention.</description>
