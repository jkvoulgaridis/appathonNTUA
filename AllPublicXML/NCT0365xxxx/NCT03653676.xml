  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recommendations for exercise prescription currently do not exist for individuals with sickle
      cell anemia (SCA) despite the known impact that SCA-related complications has on physical
      functioning and fitness. A major barrier to increasing physical activity in SCA is the
      concern that the well-described inflammatory effects of exercise could precipitate or
      exacerbate complications such as vaso-occlusive pain or airway bronchoconstriction (i.e.
      exercise-induced asthma). Although the investigator's preliminary data suggest that
      increasing physical activity may be beneficial rather than harmful in children with SCA, the
      pro-inflammatory effects associated with repeated bouts of moderate to vigorous exercise
      remain poorly understood in this population. The long term goal is to address the safety and
      health impact of regular exercise in children with SCA. This proposal would help establish
      the safety of moderate to vigorous intensity exercise in children with SCA and importantly,
      will inform the design of future clinical trials focused on exercise training as a
      transformative strategy to improve fitness and overall well-being in this population.

  <detailed_description>

      The investigator's plan to evaluate the effect of acute exercise and exercise intensity on
      circulating systemic pro-inflammatory mediators and airway bronchoconstriction in SCA. The
      investigators hypothesize that regular exercise at moderate to vigorous intensity is safe for
      children with SCA and do not precipitate SCA-related symptoms. In this multicenter study, 70
      non-asthmatic children with SCA and 70 controls without SCA will first undergo a maximal
      cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET), then be randomized to an exercise challenge by
      controlled intensity interval training (CIIT) at either moderate or vigorous intensity (8
      exercise bouts at 50% or 70% peak workload, respectively). The Investigator's Aims are to: 1)
      Determine the influence of exercise intensity on the acute inflammatory response to exercise,
      defined by an increase in soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM) and other adhesion
      molecules, and 2) Define the effect of moderate to vigorous exercise on forced expiratory
      volume in 1 second (FEV1) and acute bronchoconstriction in children with SCA. The
      investigators will also explore exercise- induced changes in gene and microRNA expression in
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells, tissue oxygenation during exercise by near infrared
      spectroscopy as well as the role of hyperventilation in bronchoconstriction using eucapnic
      voluntary hyperventilation testing in a subset of participants.
