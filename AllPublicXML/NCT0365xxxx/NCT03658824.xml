  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bipolar Disorders affect around 2% of the population. Most people with Bipolar experience
      depression; these periods can cause difficulties with relationships, work and daily life.

      Psychological therapies for &quot;unipolar&quot; depression (for people who experience depression but
      never mania or hypomania) are widely available, but there is little research in to how
      effective these therapies are for people with Bipolar. Knowing this could give greater choice
      to people with Bipolar in terms of the therapy they have, and how easy it is to get within
      the NHS. One such therapy is called Behavioural Activation (BA). BA is an established therapy
      for people with unipolar depression. It helps people to re-establish healthier patterns of
      activity, but so far there is very little research into offering BA to people with BD.

      The current research involves a small number of people with Bipolar Depression receiving BA
      to see if it seems sensible and worthwhile to them, and to help us to make any necessary
      improvements to the therapy. The study is taking place in Devon and is sponsored by the
      University of Exeter. 12 people that are currently experiencing Bipolar Depression who choose
      to take part will receive up to 20 individual therapy sessions of BA that has been adapted
      for Bipolar Depression (BA-BD), and will complete regular questionnaires and interviews. The
      results of this study will not give the final answer on how effective BA is for people with
      bipolar depression, but will help to plan for a larger study that can answer this question.

    <masking_description>It is not possible to blind the assessor to phase or baseline duration of participants in the case-series, as the length of time between assessments will reveal this. Nevertheless, the assessor and clients will be asked not to disclose which therapist is treating them. Use of self-report measures as the primary outcome measure is intended to minimise potential biases on the side of the researcher.</masking_description>

    <intervention_name>Behavioural Activation (BA)</intervention_name>
    <description>BA is based on the assumption that depression may be precipitated and is maintained by a reduction in &quot;healthy&quot;, adaptive behaviours and positive reinforcement of these, and an increase in avoidance behaviours. Together, these changes reduce the person's immediate distress, often at the expense of their medium and longer term goals. The therapy involves helping the individual to re-establish healthy patterns of activity, and replace avoidance behaviours with more adaptive behaviours that are constructive in the longer term.
The intervention consists of up to 20 individual therapy sessions of Behavioural Activation, with one booster session three months after the end of therapy. Each session lasts approximately 50 minutes and this is supplemented by home practice between sessions.</description>

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  current/past learning disability, organic brain change, substance dependence (drugs

          -  currently receiving other psychosocial therapy for depression or bipolar disorder

          -  presence of another area of difficulty that the therapist and client believe should be
