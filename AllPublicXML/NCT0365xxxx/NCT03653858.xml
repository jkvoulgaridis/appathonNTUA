      The primary objective of this multicenter, randomized, sham-controlled, double blind (patient
      and observer blinded) clinical trial is to assess the antidepressant effect of Deep Brain
      Stimulation (DBS) in patients with treatment resistant major depression using the Boston
      Scientific implantable Vercise™ GEVIA™ DBS system compared to sham.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this clinical trial is to assess the putative antidepressant efficacy
      of a therapeutic method called Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) in patients suffering from
      severe, treatment-resistant depression, i.e. in patients who have not sufficiently improved
      under established antidepressant therapies (such as psychotherapy, antidepressant drug
      therapy, and electroconvulsive therapy).

      DBS, also known as &quot;brain pacemaker&quot; therapy, is a neurosurgical therapeutic method that is
      widely established for the treatment of other conditions such as Parkinson's disease.
      However, DBS is not yet approved for the treatment of patients with depression.

      In order to initiate DBS treatment, a neurosurgical procedure is performed in which
      electrodes are placed in a brain region termed 'medial forebrain bundle' (MFB). The
      electrodes are then used to stimulate this region with electric pulses. From previous
      investigations and studies with small numbers of patients, it is believed that DBS might have
      a positive effect on depressive symptoms in patients treated with the method.

    <measure>Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Primary outcome (Efficacy). MADRS is an established instrument to rate symptoms of depression. The questionnaire includes questions on the following symptoms 1. Apparent sadness 2. Reported sadness 3. Inner tension 4. Reduced sleep 5. Reduced appetite 6. Concentration difficulties 7. Lassitude 8. Inability to feel 9. Pessimistic thoughts 10. Suicidal thoughts Each of the 10 items yields a score of 0 to 6. These item scores are summed up to yield a total score. The range of the total score is thus 0 to 60; higher total scores indicate more severe depressive symptoms.
Usual cutoff points are:
0 to 6 - normal/symptom absent; 7 to 19 - mild depression; 20 to 34 - moderate depression; &gt;34 - severe depression</description>

    <measure>Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-28) total score</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>HDRS is an established instrument to rate symptoms of depression. Different versions exist, using between 17 and 29 items. In this study, the 28-item version (HDRS-28) is used. The patient is rated by a clinician, items are scored either on a 3-point or 5-point Likert-type scale.
Single item scores are summed up to yield a total score. The total score ranges from 0 to 85; a higher total score indicates more severe depressive symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Clinical Global Impression Score (CGI) total score</measure>

    <description>The CGI is a scale that measures the global severity of illness, the global improvement relative to the beginning of the study as well as the therapeutic effect and adverse reactions, score ranges from 0 to 7 for severity of illness and global improvement, a higher score indicates more severe symptoms and a worsening of symptoms; score ranges from 0 to 8 for the efficacy index, 0 means that the efficacy can't be evaluated, a score of 2 means best efficacy while a score of 8 means no therapeutic effect and more adverse reactions</description>

After DBS OFF, re-onset of DBS will be performed, followed by 6 months continuous DBS.
