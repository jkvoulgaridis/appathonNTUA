  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change caregiver burden as measured by Zarit Burden Interview</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 22 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Zarit Burden Interview is a caregiver self-report measure. The Interview uses a 5 point Likert Scale (Never - 0, Rarely - 1, Sometimes - 2, Quite Frequently - 3, Nearly Always - 4). Score can range from 0- to 88. 0-21 - little or no burden, 21-40 mild to moderate burden, 41-60 moderate to severe burden, 61-88 severe burden. A lower score represents a better outcome.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change caregiver resiliency as measured by Brief Resiliency Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 22 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Brief Resilience Scale is a self report of items using a 5 point Likert Scale. Three of the items, the scale is as follows: (Strongly Disagree-1, Strongly Agree -5) For the remaining 3 items, the scale is reversed (Strongly Agree - 5, Strongly Agree 1) Score can range from 6-30 and is divided by 6. A higher score represents a better outcome.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Determine if intervention helps recovery from agitation and disruptive behavior for caregivers as measured by salivary cortisol levels</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to week 10</time_frame>
    <description>Salivary cortisol level</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Determine if intervention improves caregiver's perception of care recipient's quality of life as measured by Quality of Life - Alzheimer's Disease</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 22 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of Life - Alzheimer's Disease is a self-report of items using a 4 point Likert Scale (Poor - 1, Fair - 2, Good - 3, Excellent - 4) The score ranges from 13-52. A higher score represents a better outcome.</description>
