  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is evaluating the feasibility and safety of radical resection of single-hole
      inflatable mediastinal mirror synchronization with laparoscopic esophageal carcinoma, as well
      as the clinical value of the radical resection of single-hole inflatable mediastinal mirror
      synchronization with laparoscopic esophageal carcinoma as a new minimally invasive operation
      for esophageal carcinoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter, open clinical study in which 155 patients (including 5%
      shedding rate) who require surgical treatment are scheduled to be included in the study.
      Prior to any screening process, each subject / legal guardian should sign the informed
      consent form. Screening tests are used to determine whether each subject is eligible for the
      study. Eligible subjects who meet the standard will be treated with radical resection of
      single-hole inflatable mediastinal mirror synchronization with laparoscopic esophageal
      carcinoma and followed up until 3 years postoperatively. Primary study outcome are the
      prioperative complication rate and the number of intraoperative lymph node dissection.
