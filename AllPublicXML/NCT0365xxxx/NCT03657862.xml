  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this proposed clinical study is to compare the success rates of ART
      restorations placed in untreated and SDF-treated dentine caries lesions in primary teeth. The
      secondary objective is to describe the change in parents' satisfaction with the aesthetics of
      their child's teeth and the change in oral health-related quality of life of preschool
      children before and after placement of ART restorations.

      The study population is preschool children attending kindergartens in different districts in
      Hong Kong. Children attending grades 1 or 2 in nine kindergartens were invited to receive a
      free dental examination and had their decayed primary teeth restored, if possible, in the
      kindergarten by dentists. Parental informed consent was obtained before the dental
      examination and treatment. Half of the children with decayed primary teeth needing
      restorations were assigned randomly to receive SDF treatment around 10 weeks before receiving
      the restoration. The restored teeth were re-examined every 6 months for 24 months to assess
      the treatment outcome. Parents of the study children were asked to complete a questionnaire
      at baseline, 6 months and 24 months so as to obtain data on their satisfaction with the
      aesthetics of their child's teeth and the oral health-related quality of life of the study
      children.

      The study population of this proposed study is Hong Kong preschool children. Children
      attending grade 1 or 2 in nine selected kindergartens were invited to join this study. An
      invitation letter with information on the purpose and procedures of the study was sent to the
      parents of the children through the kindergarten. The parents were asked to give written
      consent for allowing their child to receive a free oral examination and ART restorations, if
      indicated for treating the decayed primary teeth in their child's mouth, provided by dentists
      in the kindergarten. Parental consent were obtained before inclusion of a child in this
      study.

      Cavitated caries lesions in the primary teeth of the study children were restored following
      the ART procedures (Holmgren et al., 2013). The instruments used were LED illuminated dental
      mirror, sickle probe, tweezers, hatchet, excavators and flat plastic. The dental restorative
      material used was a high-strength chemical-cured glass ionomer (Ketac-molar, 3M ESPE,
      Germany).

      At the baseline, all children with parental consent were clinically examined in the
      kindergarten. Disposable dental mirror attached to a handle with an intra-oral LED light and
      a ball-ended probe was used. The status of each tooth was recorded. Children who had at least
      one decayed primary tooth with a cavity into dentine were included into the study. All
      decayed teeth in the children were restored, except those with inadequate access and those
      with signs of pulpal pathology. The decayed teeth in half of the children received topical
      application of a SDF solution (Saforide, Toyo Chemical, Japan), through simple random
      allocation on a child basis using random numbers, around 10 weeks before receiving the
      restoration. The time used for placement of each restoration was recorded to the nearest
      minute.

      The children were examined at 6 and will be examined at 12, 18 and 24 months after placement
      of ART restorations by calibrated examiners who were not involved in the placement of the
      restorations. The same instruments used in the baseline examination were used in the
      follow-up examinations. The status of the restorations and restored teeth were assessed and
      recorded using codes and criteria commonly adopted in previous clinical studies of ART
      restorations (Lo et al., 2007).

      At baseline, information on the children's oral hygiene practice, snacking habit, oral health
      related quality of life, and parental satisfaction with the appearance of their child's teeth
      was collected by a self-completed questionnaire. A validated tool for measuring oral health
      related quality of life of preschool children in Hong Kong, Chinese version of Early
      Childhood Oral Health Impact Scale (ECOHIS), was used (Lee et al., 2009). The same
      measurement tool was used at the 6-month and will be used at 24-month follow-up.

    <description>parent's answer to a question on their satisfaction with the appearance of their child's teeth. The question is &quot;How satisfied are you with the overall appearance of your child's teeth?&quot; The answer option is a 5-point scale with 5 being very satisfied, 4 being satisfied, 3 being neutral, 2 being dissatisfied, and 1 being very dissatisfied.</description>

    <measure>oral health related quality of life of the child as assessed by the Early Childhood Oral Health Impact Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>parents' answers to a series of questions in the Early Childhood Oral Health Impact Scale. This scale contains 13 self-completed questions on various aspects of the impact of child oral health on the daily activities of the child or the family. The answer in each question is on a 5-point scale with 0 being no impact and 4 being great impact. The scale score is the summation of the answer scores to the 13, which can range from 0 to 52. The higher the scale score, the more impacts of oral health on life activities and thus lower quality of life.</description>
