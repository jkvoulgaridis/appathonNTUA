    <textblock>
      This study is planned to measure and compare body composition indexes and growth between
      typically developing children and those with disabilities in South Korea for understanding
      the nutritional and growth status.

      -  Inclusion criteria for typically developing children

             1. typically developing children in 5th and 6th grades of elementary schools

             2. children whose parents checked the agreement form distributed by schools

        -  Inclusion criteria for children with disabilities

             1. children and adolescent who are in special schools

             2. children whose parents checked the agreement form distributed by schools

             3. children who were able to cooperate during the body composition analysis

        -  Exclusion criteria for both groups

             1. those whom do not have written informed consent

             2. who are not able to stay calmly during the body composition analysis
