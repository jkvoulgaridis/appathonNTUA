  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is well known that Chitosan oligosaccharide is low molecular weight and water soluble and
      chitosan oligosaccharide has been shown to reduce blood cholesterol and blood pressure,
      increase immunity, and enhance antitumor properties. the effect of chitosan oligosaccharide
      (GO2KA1) supplementation on glucose control in subjects with normal blood glucose, impaired
      fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomized, double-blinded, controlled, cross-over trial was conducted to verify the
      effects of chitosan oligosaccharide (GO2KA1). forty healthy male and female subjects aged
      20-75 years with normal blood glucose, impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose
      tolerance were recruited. The subjects visited the research site twice over with a seven-day
      interval after an overnight fast at least 12 hr. On the screening visit, the participants
      were the 2-hr oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was conducted. And they were separated
      normal blood glucose, impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance. On the first
      visit, the participants were randomly assigned to consume a test or placebo product [test
      product: chitosan oligosaccharide powder 500mg (GO2KA1); placebo product: white egg powder
      500mg] and ingested the assigned product. On the second visit, the participants consumed the
      other product that they did not eat on the first visit. On both visit day, the 2-hr oral
      sucrose tolerance test (OSTT) was conducted and started at 8:00 in the morning; venous blood
      samples were collected before (0 hr) and after ingestion (0.5, 1 and 2 hr) of the products.
