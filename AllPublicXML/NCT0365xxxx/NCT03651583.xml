      This pilot study hopes to show that after 3 months of Kiko training, Kiko naive patients with
      migraine will have a decrease in the frequency and severity of their migraines.

      3.1 Study Design

      Eligible subjects in this pilot study will be taught a series of Kiko exercises. Subjects who
      meet inclusion and exclusion criteria at the screening visit will be given a diary in which
      they will document their migraine frequency and severity for one month. Once subject diaries
      are complete, subjects will meet for a group lesson to learn the background of Kiko and study
      exercises. A DVD or videotape will be issued for subjects to use during practice at home.
      Subjects will maintain a diary of their migraine headaches, as well as a diary of their
      exercise routines. Subjects will meet weekly to reinforce training and encourage training
      continuation. Diaries will be collected at the end of the first, second, and third months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has any cardiac condition, as determined by the investigator, that would
             preclude safe participation in a low level exercise program.

          2. Uncontrolled hypertension at screening (sitting systolic pressure &gt;160 mmHg, diastolic
             pressure &gt;95 mmHg.)

          3. Subject has had tension-type headaches, &gt;15 days/month in any of the 3 months prior to
             screening.

          4. Subject has more than 8 migraines per month, or more than 16 days of migraine per
             month.

          5. Subject is pregnant or expects to become pregnant during the course of the trial.

          6. Subject has substance or alcohol abuse within the the last year which, in the

             evaluation and interpretation of the study results.

          7. Subject has any concurrent medical or psychological condition that, in the
             investigator's opinion, may affect the interpretation of efficacy or safety data or
             which otherwise contraindicates participation in the trial.

          8. Subject has participated in an investigational drug trial within the previous 4 weeks.

          9. Subject uses pain medication in excess of 40 doses of over the counter medication
             and/or prescription pain medication per month to treat headaches of any type.

         10. Subject is unable to differentiate between migraine and non-migraine headaches.
