  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Urinary tract infections are the second most common community-acquired infections. Even if
      extended spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBLE) cause fewer urinary tract
      infections, their proportion is increasing. New recommendations were published by ANSM in
      2015, with specific recommendations for infections due to ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae.
      In this study, we wanted to evaluate the effectiveness of a recall of the 2015
      recommendations in the form of a table attached to the ECBU report, associated with hygiene
      recommendations.

      Methodology: This prospective, multi-center, non-interventional study was conducted in
      collaboration with the Labazur laboratory over two 2-month periods, one without modification
      of the laboratory's practices, the other with the addition of documents on the CBEU report.
      The primary endpoint was the adequacy of prescriptions to ANSM 2015 recommendations.
