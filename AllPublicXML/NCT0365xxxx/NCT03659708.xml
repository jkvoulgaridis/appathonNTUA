    <textblock>
      The management of venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk in pregnancy still remains a challenge.
      An individual assessment of the VTE risk is crucial for optimal thromboprophylaxis, but there
      is no validated tool to help clinicians stratify the risk in pregnant women and introduce
      prophylactic anticoagulation at the appropriate time. Recommendations mostly based on
      case-control studies and expert opinions do not accurately reflect the physician's need. In
      view of the lack of international recommendations with a high level of evidence regarding
      prophylactic treatment of pregnant women at risk of thrombosis, the use of a risk
      stratification tool that takes all individual risk factors for VTE into consideration and
      which aids decisions over prophylaxis regimens may help. Investigators have previously
      described a VTE risk score (the Lyon-VTE-score), rating patients at increased risk of VTE and
      recommending individually tailored management. A retrospective evaluation of the initial
      score showed favorable outcomes in pregnancies with a high risk of thrombosis. A subsequent
      multicenter prospective study reported promising results using this score and related
      management strategy. The efficacy and safety after 10 years of prospective use of the
      Lyon-VTE-score in daily practice to guide the prescription of antithrombotic prophylaxis
      during pregnancy was recently evaluated and the results showed that the Lyon-VTE-score allows
      a standardized approach with objective criteria and can help non-specialized centers and
      young doctors manage these high-risk pregnancies.

      The results of previous studies provide consistent conclusions on the safety and efficacy of
      the approach of investigators and give background for a medico-economic study to evaluate
      costs and consequences of this procedure. The most recent study (2005) evaluating the cost of
      prophylaxis in pregnant women, evaluated this cost as $1292 for each 6-week cycle of
      treatment. In addition, the use of such a score offers the prospect of personalized medicine,
      which is probably more cost-efficient compared to &quot;inclusive, equal treatment for all&quot;.

      In antepartum, the decision to administer thromboprophylaxis should be considered on an
      individual basis with regard to lowering the absolute risk of thrombosis, the inconvenience
      of daily subcutaneous heparin therapy and the potential risks of bleeding, heparin-induced
      thrombocytopenia and osteoporosis. An individual assessment of the VTE risk is crucial for
      optimal thromboprophylaxis, but there is no validated tool to help clinicians to stratify VTE
      risk in pregnant women and to introduce prophylactic anticoagulation at the right time.

      Most of the recommendations are grade 2C. They are mostly based on case-control studies and
      expert opinions and do not entirely highlight the physicians' need. The originality of this
      approach is the use of a risk stratification tool that takes all individual risk factors for
      VTE into consideration and that aids the decision-making process of antenatal anti-thrombotic
      prophylaxis. This study will personalize care using a score to individually assess the risk
      and propose appropriate prevention.

      The main objective of this study is to conduct a medico-economic study to evaluate the
      efficiency of an innovative strategy integrating the Lyon-VTE-score in the management of
      pregnant patients with venous thromboembolism risk versus standard care.

    <description>300 adult pregnant women with a personal history of VTE and/or known thrombophilia, will be randomly included in this group and their VTE risk during pregnancy will be managed according to the Lyon-VTE score :
The Lyon score classifies patients into 3 risk categories and directs the preventive LMWH prescription:
A score strictly less than 3 indicates a moderate thrombotic risk: the patient does not receive LMWH in ante-partum;
A score between 3 and 5 indicates a high thrombotic risk: a preventive dose LMWH is introduced in the third trimester (from the beginning of the 7th month);
A score greater than or equal to 6 indicates a very high thrombotic risk: LMWH at a preventive dose is prescribed throughout the ante-partum.
All patients receive an elasto-compression prescription and daily physical activity is recommended throughout pregnancy (except obstetric contraindication).
All patients also receive systematic preventive LMWH treatment postpartum for 6 weeks.</description>
