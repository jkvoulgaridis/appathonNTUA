  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tongue cancer requires resection and reconstruction that can leave patients disabled with
      respect to speaking and eating. Impairment of tongue function can have significant impact on
      social interaction and employment. To try and improve speaking and eating in public, the team
      at the University Health Network is going to use a special device that is designed to help
      the patient rehabilitate after tongue cancer treatment.

      The research part of this study is to use a special mouthpiece or mold that is like a partial
      plate for upper dentures that will fit on the roof of the mouth. This mold is embedded with
      62 sensors that will allow patients to visualize their tongue position during speech. With
      the help of a speech therapist, patients can learn different tongue positions important
      speaking and eating. This whole process is called biofeedback. The visualization of the
      tongue gives the patient the flexibility to practice at home to and learn different tongue
      positions important to eating and speaking. In addition, the device will provide the speech
      pathologist with an opportunity for easier and more precise assessment of the patient's
      progress which can reduce the need for visits to the hospital. The investigators expect the
      biofeedback training to improve the patient's speaking and eating.

      The study hypothesis is that the biofeedback device will improve speech intelligibility,
      eating in public, speaking in public, and oral intake scores.

    <textblock>
      Subjects will be enrolled in either arm of the study for duration of 4 months. Patients that
      are randomized into study arm 1 will come to the clinic for Speech Language Pathologist (SLP)
      directed face-to-face rehabilitation for a period of 2 months. The patients will then
      transition to participate in weekly face-to-face Electropalatography (EPG) biofeedback
      training. The EPG biofeedback will be used for 2 months. Patients that are randomized into
      study arm 2 will first undergo a self-directed tongue strengthening program (oral exercises)
      for a period of 2 months and then transition into EPG biofeedback training.

      Although randomization will be used, this is a nonstandard trial because all patients will
      receive biofeedback EPG. Patients from both study arms will receive biofeedback training
      after undergoing an SLP directed face-to-face rehabilitation program versus a self-directed
      tongue strengthening program (oral exercises). The SLP directed face-to-face rehabilitation
      program or self-directed tongue strengthening program will be initiated at least 2 weeks
      post-surgery. If the patient is treated with adjuvant radiation, the patient will take a
      self-directed biofeedback holiday with a target of restarting at least 2 after the completion
      of adjuvant treatment.

      This design was chosen because there is equipoise with respect to the efficacy of the
      intervention and uncertainty with respect to whether the intervention is most valuable
      following an SLP directed face-to-face rehabilitation program versus a self-directed tongue
      strengthening program. The design offers all patients the opportunity to participate in the
      intervention. This approach will also allow us to analyze between subject change and within
      subject change.

      The A.I.D.S assessment has been in place for approximately 50 years. The mean A.I.D.S.
      efficiency score (95%CI) in the current pilot study (n=16) is 0.54 (46.0, 62.3). With 33
      patients in each group, there will be over 80% power to detect a 10% difference in the speech
      efficiency score even under the condition that there may be low (rho&lt;0.1) correlation within
      subject. Higher correlation within subject on the various scores would serve to increase the
      efficiency of the analysis.

      Bivariate comparison will be made between the arms with respect to the primary and secondary
      outcome variables at each time point.

      Linear mixed model will be used to account for multiple measures at multiple time points. The
      first step will be to compare arms with respect to the primary and secondary outcome
      variables. For those tests that are significant a backward selected regression will be
      performed to control for confounders and to look for important effect modifier variables.
      Variables related to rehabilitation participation will be modeled in the backward selected
      regression.

    <measure>Measure of Obliteration using Oral Volume Assessment Tool (OVAT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Administered at 0, 2, and 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Obliteration of the oral cavity is defined as the ability of the tongue volume to obliterate the oral cavity so that there is space between the tongue and the hard and soft palate. Obliteration is measured using the Oral Volume Assessment Tool (OVAT) which is a measure of displacement. This is an important mechanism of bolus propulsion during the oral phase of swallowing.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Measure of Tongue Elevation</measure>
    <time_frame>Administered at 0, 2, and 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Elevation of the tongue is defined as distance the tongue can be moved superiorly above the central mandibular incisors measured in millimeters. The goal is to obtain premaxillary contact.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallow (FEES)</measure>
    <time_frame>Administered time 0, 2, and 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>FEES is an assessment that involves placing a flexible endoscope transnasally to obtain a superior view of the pharynx and larynx. The purpose is to evaluate structure &amp; function of the upper aerodigestive tract. This assessment enables visualization nasopharynx, base of the tongue, oropharynx, hypopharynx, and larynx. FEES is used for assessment of retained secretions and retained food consistencies. It is useful for assessing airway protection as it relates to swallowing function. After assessment, FEES is useful for evaluation of the effectiveness of compensatory techniques (postures, maneuvers, bolus modifications) for improving swallowing safety and efficiency. This is a standard of care assessment but is not routinely performed on all OCSCC patients. The surgeon/SLP will use FEES to look at swallowing function and the effectiveness of rehabilitation.</description>

    <intervention_name>Electropalatography Biofeedback Training</intervention_name>
    <description>The study agent is electropalatography (EPG). The LinguaGraph EPG device is a biofeedback technology that creates a digital visualization of tongue function during speech. The visualization is accomplished by a custom made mouthpiece that fits over the hard palate with 62 sensors that capture tongue position. The information from the sensors in the mouthpiece, as well as the audio output, is processed in an EPG Unit that converts the information from mouthpiece to a visual representation on a computer screen. The visual information with respect to tongue position can be used to provide biofeedback training.The computer can be used in the clinic during a patient visit or it can be seen over the internet with the patient at home and the speech and language pathologist at the clinic.</description>
