    <textblock>
      To determine the analgesic efficacy of CL-108 5 mg by comparison with placebo and the
      anti-emetic efficacy of CL-108 5 mg by comparison with hydrocodone 5 mg/acetaminophen 325 mg.

    <textblock>
      Adult patients with moderate or severe pain after bunionectomy will be randomized to CL-108 5
      mg (hydrocodone 5 mg/acetaminophen 325 mg/ promethazine 12.5 mg), hydrocodone 5 mg/
      acetaminophen 325 mg, or placebo under double-blind conditions. Over 48 hours they will use
      the assigned study medication and assess pain intensity, nausea, and vomiting. Uses of
      supplementary analgesic and antiemetic medications will be documented. Patient responses and
      adverse effects will also be documented during the 5-day outpatient period, too.

    <time_frame>Up to 48 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The SPID48 endpoint is calculated from the PI-NRS values at baseline, every 30 minutes until hour 12, then every hour (when awake) until hour 48 as follows:
Each subsequent Numerical Pain Intensity Rating Scale (PI-NRS) value is subtracted from the baseline PI-NRS value.
Each difference is weighted by the elapsed time from the previous PI-NRS value to the current one The weighed differences are summed to yield the SPID48</description>
