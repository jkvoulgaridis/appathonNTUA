      This is a prospective, open label, dose-escalating, multicenter clinical investigation to
      evaluate the safety and effectiveness of THIODERM STRONG in the correction of nasolabial
      folds.

      The performance is assessed using the 5-point Nasolabial Folds Severity Rating Scale
      (NLF-SRS) at Week 12 compared to baseline.
