  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sympathetic nerve activity can be measured transcutaneously in awake patients by
      computer-based filtering of raw signal obtained via skin leads attached on the chest.
      Electrocardiogram can be removed by applying a high-pass filter setting of 150 Hz.
      Electromyogram can be filtered by applying a high-pass filter setting of 500 Hz or a
      band-pass filter setting of 500-1000 Hz.

      However, it is not known whether the skin sympathetic nerve activity (SKNA) can be measured
      in anesthetized and/or paralyzed patients. Therefore, we planned this pilot study to observe
      whether the SKNA can be obtained in these patients. If the SKNA ca be observed, it will be
      presented in milivolt (uV).

    <description>A few studies reported that skin sympathetic nerve activity (SKNA) signal could be potentially observed by applying a high-pass filter of 500 Hz or a band-pass filter of 500~1000 Hz to electric signal from skin leads attached on the skin of the chest in awake volunteers. However, it is not known if it would be also possible to observe the SKNA signal in anesthetized patients. Also, there is no established method for quantitative or qualitative assessment of the SKNA signal.</description>
