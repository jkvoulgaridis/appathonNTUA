  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if the study drug 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) can help speed
      up the recovery of peripheral nerve injury after prostatectomy. 4-AP is a potassium channel
      blocker used to improve walking in multiple sclerosis patients. Investigators will measure
      the effect that 4-AP may have on the recovery of sexual function and urinary incontinence
      after prostatectomy.
