  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fetal medicine in China is still a new, young discipline, and the development is very rapid.
      After nearly 10 years of development, the clinical diagnosis and treatment guidelines of some
      complicated twin diseases has been established , but they are still needed to be improved.
      Through this study, the investigators expect to achieve better prediction indicators and
      early intrauterine precise diagnosis of complicated twin diseases. Also, better procedures of
      implementing effective intrauterine intervention and assessing the safety and effectiveness
      of intrauterine intervention are anticipated to be established.

      A better guideline for complicated twin diseases are anticipated to be established in China.
      Molecular genetics and imaging technology are applied to evaluate the outcome and prognosis
      of intrauterine intervention for complex twin diseases. 3D printing technology is used to
      assist the preoperative evaluation of fetal intrauterine intervention. Better fetal
      intrauterine intervention technique and prognosis evaluation are expected to be established.
