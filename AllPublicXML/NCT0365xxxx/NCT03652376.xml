      This study investigates the effect of removing eosinophils from peripheral blood (using
      treatment with Benralizumab, which is approved for the treatment of severe eosoniphilic
      asthma) on circulating dendritic cells in patients with severe eosinophilic asthma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phase III clinical trials demonstrated that benralizumab treatment results in a significant
      decrease in exacerbations and a significant increase in lung function and quality of life in
      patients with severe eosinophilic asthma. However, the precise underlying mechanisms leading
      to this clinical benefit of benralizumab treatment are not completely understood. Dendritic
      cells are key regulators of the adaptive and innate immune system. There is evidence that
      eosinophils have a direct influence on the function of dendritic cells. In addition, there
      are multiple indirect interactions between eosinophils and dendritic cells in asthma.
      However, there is currently no information on the impact of benralizumab treatment and a
      complete removal of circulating eosinophils on the number and phenotype of human dendritic
      cells. Benralizumab is chosen for this study because it is the only anti-IL-5 biologic which
      results in a complete removal of eosinophils from peripheral blood.

    <intervention_model_description>Patients with severe eosinophilic asthma (n=20) will be treated with benralizumab 3 times every 4 weeks, and the effect of this treatment on dendritic cell concentrations and dendritic cell characteristics will be investigated 4 weeks after the last benralizumab dose and after a follow-up of 3 months. There will be a separate control group of subjects (not a treatment or placebo arm) without asthma not treated with benralizumab (to study dendritic cell concentrations and dendritic cell characteristics in patients without asthma and without benralizumab treatment).</intervention_model_description>
