      Silesian Registry of Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (SIL-OHCA) which is an initiative of the
      Voivodeship Rescue Service in Katowice in cooperation with the Silesian Center for Heart
      Diseases in Zabrze is a prospective, population-based registry of out-of-hospital cardiac
      arrest (OHCA). The main aim of the SIL-OHCA is to asses the frequency of OHCA in the
      population of Upper Silesia and analyze prognostic factors for long-term survival in patients
      with OHCA.

        The area covered by the registry is a part of Silesian Voivodeship, Poland, which is the
        region of activity of Voivodeship Rescue Service in Katowice. There are 2,700,000
        inhabitants in the area covered by the registry. All cases of out-of-hospital cardiac
        arrest with cardiopulmonary resuscitation started or continued by emergency medical
        services of Voivodeship Rescue Service in Katowice, as well as cases in which resuscitation
        is not attempted will be included.
