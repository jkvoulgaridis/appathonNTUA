  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, Phase 3 study comparing the efficacy and
      safety of bb2121 versus standard regimens in subjects with relapsed and refractory multiple
      myeloma (RRMM).

      The study is anticipated to randomize approximately 381 subjects with RRMM. Approximately 254
      subjects will be randomized to Treatment Arm A and approximately 127 subjects will be
      randomized to Treatment Arm B.
