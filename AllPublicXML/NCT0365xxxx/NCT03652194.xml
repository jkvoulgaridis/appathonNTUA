  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the context of Candida yeast infections, a large number of studies have been published
      over the past two decades specifying the molecular mechanisms of antifungal resistance in
      different Candida species. However, few of these studies have explored how these mechanisms
      influence host immune response to this opportunistic pathogen. Recent advances in
      understanding how the host's immune system responds to Candida have initiated the emergence
      of a new research theme aimed at better understanding Candida's intrinsic and adaptive
      resistance mechanisms to antifungals can modulate &quot;escape to&quot; or &quot;recognition by&quot; the host's
      immune system. This knowledge could lead to (i) a better understanding of the predominance of
      certain Candida species with antifungal resistance in certain patient populations, (ii) a
      better understanding of why high levels of in vitro resistance are not necessarily correlated
      with in vivo therapeutic failure, and (iii) effective immunotherapeutic strategies to control
      Candida resistance to antifungals.

      It is therefore crucial to investigate the impact of Candida's resistance to antifungals on
      the host's innate immune response. Indeed, most antifungal resistance mechanisms have a
      direct or indirect structural modification of the fungal wall. However, it is the composition
      of this wall that is involved in the recognition of Candida by the host cell via the pattern
      recognition receptors (PRRs). We therefore put forward the very probable hypothesis that
      changes in the fungal wall, induced by the appearance of resistance, could alter the
      recognition of Candida by PRRs and thus trigger a different immune response, either
      qualitatively (type of cytokines secreted) or quantitatively (amplitude and duration of the
      immune response). However, even if initial experimental data support the hypothesis of a
      possible link between resistance and a modulation of the innate immune response in digestive
      mucosa (the most frequent starting point for disseminated candidiasis), many questions remain
      regarding (i) the proteins and mechanisms of the modulated immune cascade, (ii) the
      modification of the immune response according to the Candida species in question and (iii)
      the modification of the immune response according to the resistance phenotype in question.
