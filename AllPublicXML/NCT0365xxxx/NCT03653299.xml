  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hemiparesis and/or hemiplegia is one of the most common clinical signs of stroke,
      characterized by partial or complete loss of motor function, resulting in varying degrees of
      impairment and disability. The aim of this study is evaluate the acute effects of application
      of phototherapy to detect if this therapeutic approach may be beneficial in gait and balance
      post-stroke individuals. For such, 10 volunteers, with a history of injury (stroke) between 6
      months to 5 years, with deficit in functional capacity in the gait due spasticity of extensor
      muscles of the affected limb, specifically the Triceps Sural. The evaluation will consist of
      three-dimensional gait analysis, muscle activity during gait, mobility, static and functional
      balance, and mobility of volunteers.

    <textblock>
      This is a clinical, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover and triple-blind study. Ten
      participants with injury history (stroke) will perform the protocol. The intervention will be
      held once a week for 4 weeks. Each week a different dose of phototherapy (Placebo, 10J, 30J
      and 50J) will be applied. The phototherapy, active or placebo, will be applied in 9 different
      points of anterior muscle of the thigh, 6 different points of posterior muscle of the thigh
      and 2 different points of the gastrocnemius muscle, bilaterally, before the tests. Only one
      investigator, that will not participat in any phase of the assessments sessions, will know
      about what program is active or placebo in phototherapy device. Randomisation will occur by a
      simple drawing of lots (A, B, C, or D) in the first visit. The phototherapy unit emitted the
      same sound regardless of the program used, active or placebo. For three-dimensional gait
      assessment and muscle activity will be used a SMART-D system 140® - BTS Engineering with six
      cameras, two Kistler force platforms Platform model 9286BA and FREEEMG® electromyography -
      BTS Engineering wireless system with four channels. In addition, the evaluation will quantify
      the static balance (force platform), the functional balance (Berg Balance Scale) and mobility
      (6 minute walk test and go upand team test).

    <description>The functional assessment will be composed for one test: Berg Balance Scale (BBS). The BBS is a widely used clinical test developed for evaluate of a persons static and dynamic balance abilities, for functional balance tests,is generally considered the gold standard. The scale comprises a test with a set of 14 simple balance related tasks, ranging from standing up from a sitting position, to standing on one foot. The degree of success in achieving each task is given a score of 0 (unable) to 4 (independent), and the final measure is the sum of all of the scores, it test takes 10 - 15 minutes. The interpretation of the results is: ≤20 limited data from subjects, that suggest that the tool might have similar absolute reliability at the low and high ends. Normal values = People aged 69 years without any health conditions likely to affect mobility can be expected to have a BBS score of 56/56. This normal value declines with increasing age, at a rate of 0.75 points per year.</description>

    <description>The functional mobility assessment will be composed for one test: 6-minute walk test (6MWT) - The 6MWT is used as a one-time measure of functional mobility status of patients. It's a practical test that requires a 100-ft hallway but no exercise equipment or advanced training for technicians for the evaluation of functional exercise capacity.</description>
