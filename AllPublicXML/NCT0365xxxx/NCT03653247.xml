  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, multicenter, Phase 1/2 study in approximately eight adults with severe
      Sickle Cell Disease (SCD). The study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of
      autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation using BIVV003.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subject participation in this study will be approximately 136 weeks. Enrolled subjects will
      be asked to participate in a separate long-term follow-up study to monitor the safety and
      efficacy of BIVV003 treatment for a total of 15 years post-transplant.
