  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Electrical activity in the brain known as &quot;gamma&quot; brainwaves help connect and process
      information throughout the brain. These gamma waves are diminished in Alzheimer's disease.
      New research in Alzheimer's disease mouse models shows that exposure to light flickering at
      the rate of 40 flashes per second or 40Hz increased gamma brainwaves and led to clearing of
      beta amyloid plaques in the brain, a key abnormality in Alzheimer's disease. This project
      will test the ability of a novel iPad App (AlzLife https://www.alz.life/) that delivers light
      therapy at 40 Hz combined with cognitive therapy to improve cognition, function, and quality
      of life in Alzheimer's disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      New research suggests that exposure to a light flickering at 40Hz may promote gamma brain
      wave activity through the photic entrainment phenomenon. These waves have the potential to
      activate critical cleaning cells in the brain that could eliminate beta amyloid plaques. The
      most recent research on light therapy for Alzheimer's disease appeared in the journal Nature
      in 2017, entitled &quot;How flashing lights and pink noise might banish Alzheimer's, improve
      memory and more&quot; (the full article can be freely accessed at:
      https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02391-6) and in 2016, entitled &quot;Gamma frequency
      entrainment attenuates amyloid load and modifies microglia&quot; (the article abstract can be
      accessed at: https://www.nature.com/articles/nature20587). Researchers from MIT found that
      shining a strobe light into the eyes of mice with a rodent version of Alzheimer's disease
      encouraged protective cells to phagocytize the harmful proteins that accumulate in the brain.
      The perfect rate of flashes was determined to be 40 per second. Exposure to the flashing
      light for an hour (light therapy) led to a noticeable reduction in beta amyloid levels the
      next day in regions of the neocortex and hippocampus. When done every day for a week, beta
      amyloid levels were greatly reduced.

      In addition, there is a significant body of evidence that computerized brain training
      (cognitive therapy) improves the memory of patients with Alzheimer's and dementia, which
      could help avert some symptoms of cognitive decline.

      The synergistic combination of light and cognitive therapy utilized in AlzLife has the
      potential to improve the brain's function better than either of these therapies alone. This
      project will test the ability of a novel iPad App (&quot;ALZLIFE&quot;) that delivers light therapy at
      40 Hz combined with cognitive therapy to improve cognition, function, and quality of life in
      Alzheimer's disease.

    <description>The cognitive therapy delivered by ALZLIFE consist of cognitive games: Sudoku, Tic-Tac-Toe, Analog clock comparison, etc. The changes in performance score in these cognitive games are used to calculate the participant's Cognitive Index.
Cognitive Index maximum score = 100. The lower score indicates worse performance.</description>

    <measure>Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-activities of daily living (ADCS-ADL)</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The ADCS-ADL assesses the competence of patients with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) in basic and instrumental activities of daily living (ADLs). ADCS-ADL is assessed by an in-app evaluation completed by a caregiver every month. All responses relate to the 4 weeks prior to the time of rating. The six basic ADL items each take an ADL (e.g., eating) and provide descriptions of level of competence, with the rater selecting the most appropriate option (e.g., ate without physical help and used a knife; used a fork or spoon but not a knife; used fingers to eat; was usually fed by someone else). ADCS-ADL maximum score = 30. The lower score indicates worse outcome.</description>
