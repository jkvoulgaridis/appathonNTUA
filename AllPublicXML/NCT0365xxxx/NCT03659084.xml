  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Iron chelation, mostly associated with multiple red blood cell transfusion, is relatively
      common in patients with hematological malignancies receiving allo-HSCT.

      This multicenter prospective observational study is designed to establish the impact of iron
      chelation on relapse after allo-HSCT in patients with acute myeloid leukemia and
      myelodysplastic syndrome. The investigators will compare the results obtained in the
      prospective study to those observed in a historical retrospective cohort of paired patients
      who did not receive chelation. Given our clinical experience and literature results, the
      investigators will evaluate the Exjade chelator. Although not demonstrated, the presence of
      mutations of the HFE gene could play an indirect role on leukemogenesis by promoting
      overload. It is therefore important to evaluate the status in this patient population.

    <description>The patient having given his consent, will begin the Exjade at 10 mg / kg per day if the ferritin level reached 1000 ng / ml at 6 months after allograft, for a minimum duration of three months and up to 6 months. The iron parameters will be evaluated at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months after the beginning of the exjade treatment. The evaluation of the disease will be carried out according to the practices of the center. It is recommended to have a washout period of one week between stopping the ciclosporin and the beginning of treatment by exjade.</description>
