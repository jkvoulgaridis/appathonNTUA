  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate utility and appropriateness of treatment
      interventions taking into account the presumed mechanisms of two main varieties of ulnar
      neuropathy at the elbow (UNE). The investigators hypothesize that in patients with UNE under
      the humeroulnar aponeurosis (HUA) surgical HUA release (simple decompression) is superior to
      conservative treatment. By contrast, in patients with UNE at the retroepicondylar (RTC)
      groove surgical HUA release (simple decompression) should not be superior to conservative
      treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ulnar neuropathy at the elbow (UNE) is the second most common focal neuropathy with annual
      incidence rate of 21 per 100.000. Therefore, in Slovenia UNE each year affects approximately
      420 and in Europe 156.000 patients. In previous publications evidence was presented that
      idiopathic UNE consists of two conditions occurring 2-5 cm apart. In the first condition,
      affecting about 15% of UNE patients, the ulnar nerve is entrapped 2-3 cm distal to the medial
      epicondyle (ME) under the humeroulnar aponeurosis (HUA), i.e., in the cubital tunnel. In the
      second condition, affecting the majority (about 85%) of patients, the lesion is located at
      the ME or up to 4 cm proximally in the retroepicondylar (RTC) groove. As no anatomical
      structure constricting the ulnar nerve is usually found in that segment, the most probable
      cause of UNE at this location is extrinsic ulnar nerve compression against the underlying
      bone. The investigators believe that these two groups of UNE patients need different
      therapeutic approaches: (1) surgical release for ulnar nerve entrapment distal to ME and (2)
      conservative treatment for extrinsic nerve compression in the RTC groove. The efficiency of
      this therapeutic approach was already evaluated and significant clinical improvement was
      found in 80% of UNE patients. However, the design of that study did not enable to obtain an
      indisputable evidence that outcome was a result of treatment approach. It is still possible
      that improvement observed in patient population was a consequence of natural history rather
      than therapy. To resolve this problem a properly designed randomized control trial is needed.
      The investigators believe such trial would prevent numerous unnecessary and delayed
      operations in UNE patients.

    <intervention_model_description>Patients with suspected UNE will be prospectively recruited in a single secondary referral center. First of three blinded examiners will obtain patients' history and perform focused neurological examination. The second examiner will perform electrodiagnostic (EDx) and the third ultrasonographic (US) studies. Patients with UNE under the HUA and in the RTC groove will be randomly distributed in two groups for surgical HUA release and conservative treatment. During surgical intervention the surgeon will cut the HUA with minimal incision technique. All patients (including surgically treated) will be given pictured recommendations with descriptions, which limb positions should be avoided. In order to prevent deterioration in conservatively treated group of patients with UNE at HUA, control neurological examination will be performed every 3 months. At 1 year follow-up we will use identical protocol as at the time of initial diagnostic evaluation.</intervention_model_description>
