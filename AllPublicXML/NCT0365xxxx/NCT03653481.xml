  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see how the prebiotic inulin changes the gut bacteria
      (microbiome) of children and young adults with IBD and determine if this dietary intervention
      can help reduce disease activity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is thought to be due to a combination of
      genetic, environmental and immunological factors. From a clinical stand point, there is great
      interest in determining if manipulation of the gut microbiota may be a viable therapeutic
      strategy in IBD patients. One such strategy involves the use of prebiotic. Prebiotics are
      oligosaccharides that cannot be enzymatically hydrolyzed in the small intestine, however
      serve as substrates for fermentation by commensal bacteria in the colon.

      Investigators propose to evaluate the modulatory effects of the prebiotic inulin on the
      composition and function of the microbiota of children with IBD and determine the efficacy of
      this dietary intervention in reducing disease activity.

          -  Parental/guardian permission (informed consent) and child assent.

          -  Pediatric diagnosis of inflammatory colonic or ileocolonic Crohn's disease (CD),
             ulcerative colitis (UC) or inflammatory bowel disease-unclassified (IBDU), as defined
             by endoscopy, radiology, and clinical findings.

          -  Clinical disease activity index compatible with:

               -  For patients with CD:

                    -  Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) ≤15 or short PCDAI (sPCDAI)
                       ≤17.5 (if unable to complete full PCDAI) or physician global assessment
                       (PGA) compatible with quiescent disease at time of enrollment
