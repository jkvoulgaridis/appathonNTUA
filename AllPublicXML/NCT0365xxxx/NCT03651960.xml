    <textblock>
      The recovery of a balance and gait is a primary objective for geriatric, neurological or
      orthopedic rehabilitation. Since the 80s, many walking robots were proposed.

      Despite encouraging results, the use of robotic equipment for gait training remains limited,
      even if they meet a strong social demand. The reasons for this situation are economic, but
      also related to the non consideration of the context of utilization . It is therefore
      important to involve the users of the innovation in the development process because it is the
      latter that will broadcast. Psychosocial perspective of the acceptability of the technology
      meets this need by including the users' perceptions toward device (s).

      The ROBO-K project aimed at developping a mobile and interactive robot, dedicated to the
      rehabilitation of balance and gait at an early stage. It was intended for patients with
      impaired walking vascular neurological, traumatic or associated with chronic neurological
      disease. The first step for its developement was conducted with the psychosocial approach of
      Technology acceptability which has required specific methods for collecting the views of
      users and analysis of the activity. This process allowed the design and the development of
      robot prototypes.

      The aim of the present study is now to establish the degree of social acceptability of the
      robot and to analyze balance and gait training activity.

      even if they meet a strong social demand. The reasons for this situation are economic, but
      also related to the non consideration of the context of utilization (eg therapeutic practices
      , users' expectations). It is therefore important to involve the users of the innovation in
      the development process because it is the latter that will broadcast. Psychosocial
      perspective of the acceptability of the technology meets this need by including the users'

      robot prototypes. The aim of the present study is now to establish the degree of social
      acceptability of the robot and to analyze balance and gait training activity. The data
      collected will validate the development of assumptions with users (e.g. static or dynamic
      balance exercises, rehabilitation of gait in different paths).

      The intervention consists of 12 45-minute sessions of balance and gait training with a mobile
      and interactive robot prototype for 4 weeks.
