  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are wanting to learn more about early development of the lungs and to help
      them better understand prematurity and the development of a breathing disorder call BPD
      (Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational case study involving up to three MRI visits. The first MRI will be
      complete after the infant's clinical initial evaluation. The second image will be obtained
      approximately 1 month later and the third MRI will be complete prior to discharge. Infants
      will be imaged at various ages, based up their initial evaluation. The investigators will
      collect urine and obtain clinically collected remnant blood around time of MRI,
      tracheal/endotracheal aspirate at time of the MRI when available and BAL samples as
      clinically available. MRI findings will be correlated with laboratory findings and outcomes
      from the medical record, and a research database will be built for the data. The
      investigators will also obtain a one-time MRI visit in non-BPD NICU patients to acquire data
      related to normal vasculature and pulmonary alveolar development.

      Sub-study 1: Inpatient polysomnography Patients with the same inclusion/exclusion criteria as
      reported below will be approached for a brief inpatient polysomnogram. The population will
      include patients with and without BPD. The polysomnography (PSG) will be performed in the
      NICU within 1 week from the MRI that is obtained prior to discharge.
