  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose of the chemotherapy
      drugs nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine when combined with hypofractionated ablative proton
      therapy for the treatment of locally advanced pancreatic cancer. You will receive proton
      therapy once a day (Monday - Friday) for 3 weeks. Participants will also receive chemotherapy
      on each Monday of those three weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a phase I trial to determine the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) and
      the recommended dose for phase II (RP2D) of concurrent nab-paclitaxel + gemcitabine in
      combination with ablative IMPT delivered as a fixed dose of 67.5 Gy in 15 fractions daily
      fractions with 5 fractions per week. In contrast to prior pancreatic cancer studies of
      chemoradiotherapy which utilized photon RT to treat gross disease and elective lymph nodes
      (1,2) the proposed study is hypothesized to reduce toxicity risk by limiting highly conformal
      IMPT to the gross tumor volume. Furthermore, to increase the margin of safety in a manner
      similar to published data from MDACC (3), the high dose region will be limited to areas at
      least 5 mm from nearby GI structures (duodenum, small bowel, stomach, etc.). Regions within
      this area will be treated only to 37.5 Gy in 15 fractions. This dose limitation is also
      important given that paclitaxel, in addition to increasing systemic efficacy, is a known
      radiosensitizer (1).
