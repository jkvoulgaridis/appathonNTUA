  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epidemiological studies have established a link between collisions while driving and cannabis
      use. With the changing legal landscape around cannabis, there is much interest in determining
      per se limits of cannabis while driving. The present study will evaluate driving on a driving
      simulator after smoking placebo or cannabis with 3 different levels of THC. THC is the active
      component in cannabis and blood, urine and oral fluid levels of THC will be correlated with
      driving impairment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will attend the laboratory for 4 separate sessions, separated by about a week.
      In each session, participants will receive one of 3 doses of smoked cannabis or a placebo.
      Participants will not know which dose they are receiving. Participants will complete
      questionnaires, do cognitive tests and drive on a driving simulator before and after smoking
      the cannabis or placebo cigarette. Blood, urine and oral fluid will be collected throughout
      the 7-8 hour session to determine levels of THC and its metabolites. These values will be
      correlated with measures of driving impairment.
