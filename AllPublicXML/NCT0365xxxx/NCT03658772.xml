  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted in adult participants diagnosed with any form of an advanced or
      progressive MSS CRC for which 1st and 2nd line standard therapy (at least one of which
      contained fluorouracil) is no longer effective or is intolerable. This is a phase 1b,
      multi-center, open label study designed to assess safety and tolerability of grapiprant in
      combination with pembrolizumab, to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) with
      pembrolizumab, and to evaluate and characterize the PK of grapiprant alone and in combination
      with pembrolizumab. Disease response, pharmacodynamics, and response biomarkers will also be
      assessed.
