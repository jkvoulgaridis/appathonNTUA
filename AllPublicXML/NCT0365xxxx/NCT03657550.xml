    <textblock>
      This study are (1) to assess the relative bioavailability (BA) of a single oral dose of
      either 5 mg of Levamlodipine Maleate Tablets from CSPC or 10 mg of Amlodipine Besylate Tablet
      (NORVASC®) from Pfizer Inc. under fasting condition in male and female healthy subjects; and
      (2) to evaluate food effect on the PK profile of Levamlodipine Maleate Tablets from CSPC.

      This study consists of 2 parts:

      Part 1 will be a randomized, open-label, single-dose, two-way crossover study to assess the
      relative BA of levamlodipine maleate tablets from CSPC (Test) versus Amlodipine Besylate
      Tablet NORVASC® from Pfizer Inc. (Reference) after a single oral administration under fasted
      conditions in male and female healthy subjects. Approximately 32 healthy subjects will be
      enrolled in the US to obtain 27 completed subjects.

      Part 2 will be a single-arm, open-label, single-dose phase to assess food effect on the PK
      profile of levamlodipine maleate tablets from CSPC. Subjects who have completed Part 1 will
      be rolled over to Part 2 after a wash-out period for at least 14-days since the last dosing.
      Subjects will receive a single oral administration of study drug under a high-fat /
      high-calorie meal that should derive approximately 150, 250 and 500-600 calories from
      protein, carbohydrate and fat, respectively.
