    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate effect of soft tissue mobilization with and with out neural
      mobilization in cervical radiculopathy, half of the subjects will receive treatment of soft
      tissue mobilization along with neural mobilization whereas half of the subjects will receive
      only soft tissue mobilization.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      soft tissue mobilization and neural mobilization both treatments are used to treat cervical
      radiculopathy but they work differently.

      Soft tissue mobilization include traction which decompresses the nerve and stretches the
      surrounding muscles along with help to reduce pain and tingling sensation. whereas hot pack
      helps to increase blood circulation and warm up muscles and isometric exercises provide
      strengthening and build endurance.

      Neural mobilization technique is different for all 3 nerves i.e Radial, ulnar and median.
      neural mobilization technique target the single nerve which is being compressed and showing
      symptoms.

    <intervention_model_description>Subjects will be assigned randomly into two groups: Soft tissue mobilization with neural mobilization and Soft tissue mobilization without Neural mobilization.A coin will be flipped at start of data collection for the first patient to be assigned odd number and included in Soft tissue mobilization with Neural mobilization group. Later on odd and even numbered subjects will be included in specific group.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Soft Tissue Mobilization with Neural mobilization group will be assessed by spurling test and than will involved in treatment protocol i.e Cervical Traction, Hot packs, Post Isometric Relaxation Techniques and Neural mobilization Techniques which involve Median, Radial and Ulnar Nerve Mobilization.
Frequency for neural mobilization is 3 sets of 10 repetitions for each and duration of 15minute. Participant will be scheduled to attend 12 treatment session (3 sessions every week for 4 weeks, 50mints each session)</description>

    <description>Cervical Traction for 15mints 7%of body weight with 7 second hold time and 5 second rest time.
Hot Pack for 10mints
Post isometric relaxation technique. The post-isometric relaxation technique begins by placing the muscle in a stretched position. Then an isometric contraction is exerted against minimal resistance. Relaxation and then gentle stretch follow as the muscle releases. Frequency for PIRs 3sets of 5 repetitions and duration of 10minute.
