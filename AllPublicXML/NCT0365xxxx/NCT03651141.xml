  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of myofascial decompression (cupping)
      and neurodynamic sliding technique for the hamstring on Division I Track and Field athletes
      who complain of hamstring tightness. Research questions will be: how do these techniques
      affect hamstring range of motion and flexibility; isometric strength of the hamstring muscle;
      muscle activation; and rate of force development. The hypotheses of this study are that
      neurodynamic sliding will have an effect on all variables and myofascial decompression will
      only have an effect on range of motion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Predisposing factors to hamstring injury include neural tension and muscle flexibility
      restrictions due to fascial adhesions. The sciatic nerve can produce symptoms of pain,
      decreased range of motion, and increased resting muscle tone when it is overstretched. The
      nerve can be overstretched after a hamstring injury and cause adhesions on the nerve and
      abnormal mechanosensitivity leading to perceived hamstring tightness.The purpose of this
      study is to investigate the effects of myofascial decompression (cupping) and neurodynamic
      sliding technique for the hamstring on Division I Track and Field athletes who complain of
      hamstring tightness. Research questions will be: how do these techniques affect hamstring
      range of motion and flexibility; isometric strength of the hamstring muscle; muscle
      activation; and rate of force development. The hypotheses of this study are that neurodynamic
      sliding will have an effect on all variables and myofascial decompression will only have an
      effect on range of motion.

    <description>Using the 'Active Knee Extension test', subjects are placed supine with both the hip and knee positioned at 90° of flexion and then asked to extend lower leg until point of limitation. A digital inclinometer is used to measure the angle of the knee joint in this position to examine flexibility of the hamstring muscle group.</description>

    <description>The Disablement of the Physically Active Scale (DPAS) paper survey will be used to assess subject perceptions of impairment, limitation, disability and quality of life related to their hamstring discomfort. The scale ranges from 0 (No disability) to 64 (Severe disability) in which the scores will be compared.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 5 minutes after intervention, and within 24 hours of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Lower Extremity Functional Scale is a questionnaire containing 20 questions about a subject's ability to perform everyday tasks. Scores range from 0-4 and represent 'extreme difficulty' or 'unable to perform activity' to 'no difficulty'. The maximum score on the survey is 80 points, with lower total scores indicating a greater perceived disability.</description>

    <description>neurodynamic sliding consists of 2 movements; 1) movement 1 involves sitting on the edge of the treatment table the bringing their neck to their chest along with bending their knee and pointing their ankle to the ground. Movement 2 is performed by facing their head towards the ceiling and straightening their knee while pointing their ankle towards their nose. Subjects will alternate these 2 active movements for 60s and repeated 5 times, with rest period of 15s between sets.</description>

    <description>For the group receiving the cupping treatment, the subject will lay on their stomach and their affected hamstring will be exposed. Cocoa butter will be applied to the hamstring prior to the application of the cups. 5 cups will be placed along the hamstring and calf muscles. Using a handheld suction pump, each cup will be pumped so that skin fills up half of the cup. The cups will stay in place for five minutes and the clinician will instruct the subject to perform 5 repetitions of active quad sets and 5 repetitions of ankle pumps .</description>
