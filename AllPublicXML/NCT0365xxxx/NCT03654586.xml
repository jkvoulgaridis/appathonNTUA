  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine to what degree sugary drink warning
      labels increase consumers' knowledge about the potential health harms of sugary drinks and
      reduce sugary drink intake. The study is designed to answer three additional questions: 1) Do
      some warning labels work better than others? 2) What is the effect of warning labels over
      time? 3) If warning labels influence behavior, is it because they increase knowledge or
      simply provide a salient reminder that some drinks are less healthy? This study will test the
      effect of repeated exposure to warning labels on total calories purchased over time and
      assess whether knowledge or salience better explain label effects.

    <intervention_model_description>There was no answer option for our study design, but factorial is most similar. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of four conditions described below.
Calorie label (control) will display a &quot;Calories per Bottle&quot; label on all beverages, not just sugary drinks. This is modeled after the American Beverage Association's current &quot;Clear on Calories&quot; labels.
Text warning labels will display the following text on sugary beverages: WARNING: drinking beverages with added sugars contributes to obesity, diabetes, and tooth decay
Sugar graphic warning labels will display the same text as &quot;text warning labels&quot; along with graphics depicting the amount of sugar in the beverage
Health graphic warning label will display the same text as &quot;text warning labels&quot; along with graphics depicting the potential negative health consequences of over-consuming sugary drinks.</intervention_model_description>

We will create this outcome by averaging the responses to the following health perception questions prompted with the statement &quot;If my child drank this beverage often it would…&quot; across all non-sugary beverages. The statements end with the following health belief and risk perception language: &quot;cause my child to gain weight,&quot; &quot;increase my child's risk of heart disease,&quot; &quot;increase my child's risk of diabetes,&quot; &quot;increase my child's risk of cancer,&quot; and &quot;help my child live a healthier life.&quot; Responses to questions about weight gain, heart disease, diabetes, and cancer will be reverse coded, so higher scores on the index will indicate a stronger positive health perception of the non-sugary beverages. All variables will be measured on a 5-point Likert scale. The average non-sugary response for each participant will yield a scale ranging 1 (worse outcome) to 5 (better outcome).</description>
