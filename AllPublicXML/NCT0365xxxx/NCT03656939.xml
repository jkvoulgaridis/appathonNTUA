      This observational study based on a population-based EHR database in Yinzhou district of
      Ningbo city in China is to estimate incidence rates of seizures (including febrile seizures),
      urticaria and angioedema, apnea, and fever among Chinese children after receiving Prevenar
      13. In addition, a validation study including validation of International classification of
      diseases, tenth revision (ICD-10) codes or ICD-10 code based algorithm for identifying all
      safety outcomes of interest and a prospective cohort study in a sub-population of the main
      study will be conducted in order to offset the potential biased results from the main study
      because of potential misclassification of the safety outcomes of interest due to miscoding
      and/or undercoding of ICD-10 codes used to identify these safety outcomes in the EHR
      database.

        The main study population consists of eligible children aged 1-24 months receiving at least
        one dose of 13vPnC recorded in Yinzhou EHR database between May 1st, 2017 and July 24th,
        2020 (ie, one week prior to the end of the study).

        For the prospective cohort in a sub-population of the main study, eligible children for the
        main study must receive the first dose of 13vPnC between July 1st, 2018 and July 24th,
        2020. It should be noted that the actual start date for the prospective cohort study is
        pending on the approval of Human Genetic Resources Administration of China (HGRAC)
