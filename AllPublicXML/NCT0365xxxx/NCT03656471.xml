      This study aimed to compare experiences between adult patients receiving clear aligners and
      fixed appliances during the initial stage of orthodontic treatments.

    <textblock>
      Patients receiving either clear aligner treatments were enrolled in this study. During the
      same time period, patients receiving fixed orthodontic treatments well-matched with
      clear-aligner patients by similar ages (difference &lt; 3 years), same gender and similar levels
      of severity of malocclusion [similar Index of Complexity Outcome and Need (ICON) level] were
      enrolled.The two groups were well-matched with ages, gender and levels of malocclusion
      severity. Pain perception, anxiety and quality of life were assessed through visual analogue
      scale (VAS), state-trait anxiety inventory (STAI) and oral health impact profile-14
      (OHIP-14), respectively.

    <description>The chronological changes in pain perception during the fortnight of orthodontic treatment were assessed through visual analogue scale (VAS). Participant is asked to place a line perpendicular to the VAS line.The score is determined by measuring the distance (mm) on the 10-cm line between the &quot;no pain&quot;anchor and the patients' mask,providing a range of scores from 0-100. A higher score indicates greater pain.</description>
