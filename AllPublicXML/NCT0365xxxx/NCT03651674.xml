  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For more severe and treatment-resistant cases in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder,
      electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is often very effective. The purpose of this study is to
      investigate the brain structure and function changes after ECT treatment. The neuroimaging
      marker which may predict the outcome of ECT is also studied in this research.
