  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-randomized, successive cohorts design, multicenter, single dose
      phase I study.

      The primary objectives are:

        -  to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (plasma and urine) profile of P03277 following single
           intravenous injection (0.1 mmol/kg body weight) in patients with mild to severe renal
           impairment and in healthy volunteers with normal renal function used as reference.

        -  to assess dialysability of P03277 following a single intravenous injection (0.1 mmol/kg
           body weight) in patients with end stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A full range design including the different degrees of renal impairment and healthy
      volunteers used as reference has been chosen.

      Enrolment will be successive starting with both healthy volunteers (cohort 1) and patients
      with mild renal impairment (cohort 2), then patients with moderate renal impairment (cohort
      3), then patients with severe renal impairment (cohort 4) to end with patients with end stage
      renal disease (cohort 5). Pharmacokinetics and safety profiles following the confinement
      period will be reviewed per each successive cohort by a Data Monitoring Committee before
      starting recruitment of patients in the next cohort. Cohorts 1 and 2 will be recruited in
      parallel and Data Monitoring Committee review will start after the completion of these first
      two cohorts.
