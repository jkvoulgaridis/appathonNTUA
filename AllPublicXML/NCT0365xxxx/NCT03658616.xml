    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of 1% GPB cream after 4 weeks
      of treatment compared with placebo with a sufficient number of patients to obtain
      statistically significant results, and to assess the long-term safety of 1% GPB cream.

    <description>The Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale (HDSS) is a disease-specific, quick, and easily-understood diagnostic tool that provides a qualitative measure of the severity of the patient's condition based on how it affects daily activities. HDSS is a four item scale. A score of 1 or 2 indicates mild or moderate Hyperhidrosis. A score of 3 or 4 indicates severe Hyperhidrosis.</description>

          -  Diagnosis of severe primary axillary hyperhidrosis with a HDSS score of 3 or 4

          -  At least 50 mg of sweat production in each axilla measured gravimetrically at room
             temperature and at a humidity consistent with the normal climate in that area over a
             period of 5 minutes (patients should have acclimatized to that room for at least 30
             minutes)

             collections as defined in the protocol subjects

          -  Willing and able to provide written informed consent

          -  Hypersensitivity against glycopyrrolate

          -  Secondary hyperhidrosis, for example, hyperhidrosis that is secondary to other
             underlying diseases including hyperthyroidism, lymphoma and malaria, climacteric
             hyperhidrosis.

          -  Previous surgical treatment of hyperhidrosis including sympathectomy, surgical
             debulking of the sweat glands, subcutaneous tissue curettage and ultrasonic surgery.

             anticipated application sites in either axilla.

          -  Any condition or situation that, in the investigator's or sub-investigator's opinion,
             may interfere with the patient's participation in the study;
