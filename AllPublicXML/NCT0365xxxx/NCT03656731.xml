  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BREACE is a prospective randomized controlled trial. The aim is to investigate the effect of
      an exercise-based intervention among older participants with breast cancer treated with
      adjuvant or first-line systemic therapy.

      The hypotheses: That the intervention will maintain or increase physical function levels,
      reduce symptoms and side effects, improve quality of life and psychological wellbeing, and
      prevent weight loss and muscle wasting

    <description>The exercise-based intervention is comprised of:
Supervised and group-based exercise training at the hospital setting two times a week. Each session will last approximately 60 minutes.The program consists of warm-up, exercises for balance and flexibility, progressive resistance training (seven resistance training exercises targeting the large muscle groups), and stretching and relaxation.
Home-based walking with activity tracker assessment. Evaluation and goal-setting in relation to activity (step counts) will be conducted once weekly.
Serving of a protein supplement (protein drink or bar) after each supervised training session.</description>
