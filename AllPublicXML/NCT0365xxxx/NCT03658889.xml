  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to describe medical practices in patients with GCA in terms of
      patient journey, diagnostic methods and specific GCA treatments since diagnosis.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a cross-sectional, non-interventional, national (France), multicentre study,
      conducted on a population of 300 patients with GCA, to describe GCA management and patient
      characteristics.

      The study will be conducted in accordance with the professional code of ethics and the good
      epidemiological practice guidelines developed by the Association of French-Speaking
      Epidemiologists.

      The information will be collected during a single visit to the internist or rheumatologist as
      part of the usual management of the patient with GCA. The physician will not perform any
      additional examinations specific to the study. The physician will inform the patient about
      the study before inclusion and seek her/his non-opposition. A patient information form will
      be given to each patient by the physician. Patients who are eligible to participate in the
      study and who verbally accept automatic processing of their personal data, will be included
      in the study.

      Data will be collected from the medical file and from patient questionnaires on health status
      (SF-36 [36-Item Short Form Survey Instrument], EQ5D [EuroQol-5 Dimensions]) and fatigue
      (FACIT-fatigue). In addition, GCA activity will be evaluated using a global arteritis
      activity Visual Analog Scale (VAS) to be completed by the patient and the physician.

        <title>PRO Scores: FACIT-Fatigue Questionnaire</title>
        <description>Total score of the 13-items Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy - Fatigue (FACIT-Fatigue) questionnaire.
FACIT-Fatigue is an instrument that measures overall fatigue and its effects on the general functioning and daily activities through 13 questions. Each question has 5 levels: not at all, a little bit, somewhat, quite a bit, very much. Lower scores indicate greater fatigue. The total score of FACIT-Fatigue varies from 0 to 52 (score &lt;30 = severe fatigue).</description>
