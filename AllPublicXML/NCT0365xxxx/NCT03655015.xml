      Creation a living biobank of PDOs from Stage I-IV lung cancer patients (n=50). We selected
      enrollment of at least 50 patients so that they can be risk stratified based on lung tumor
      type, staging and we plan to store these PDOs in biobank for future experiments. For each
      patient, tumor specimens will be collected at time of their surgery. No specific therapeutic
      intervention or treatment is provided as part of this study.

        1. Establishment and culture of PDOs from lung cancer tumor specimens. PDOs will be
           biobanked for future experiments.

        2. Lung organoids and CTCs will also be cultured and used to study baseline tumor
           characteristics using histology, immunohistochemistry, atomic force measurements; as
           well as, oncogenic signaling pathways and proteomic profile of lung organoids and CTCs
           derived from lung cancer patients (n&gt;50).

        3. Patient demographic information and data to be collected using a patient survey data
           sheet with treatment and survival history collected at pre-defined time period per the
           protocol schedule.
