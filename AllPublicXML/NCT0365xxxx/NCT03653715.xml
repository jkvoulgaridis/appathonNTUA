  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the distance, intermediate and near visual
      performance of Clerio designed single vision and Clerio designed LIRIC modified bifocal
      lenses (+2.00D add) compared to commercially available single vision and multifocal lenses.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clerio Vision Inc. has licensed a new femtosecond based laser procedure discovered by
      researchers at the University of Rochester known as Laser Induced Refractive Index
      Customization (LIRIC), which allows the alteration of the optical design of a finished soft
      hydrogel contact lens. Clerio Vision Inc. scientists have developed a diffractive multifocal
      optical design using the LIRIC procedure which shows an increase of the depth of focus of the
      contact lens when measured on an optical bench. It is hypothesized that a presbyopic patient
      wearing a soft contact lens of this design will experience an improvement in intermediate and
      near vision over that provided by their distance corrected single vision contact lenses,
      without significantly impacting their distance vision. The purpose of this feasibility study
      is the on-eye evaluation of the performance of the Clerio Vision designed and LIRIC modified
      soft contact lenses. Results from this study will guide future development of these potential
      products.

    <intervention_model_description>This single center study is a device feasibility, two-arm, double-masked (participants and outcomes assessor), repeated measures, cross-sectional design. Each participant is tested with the four (4) study devices (i.e., contact lenses), one (1) test lens and three (3) control lenses, in randomized order. Participants are masked to each lens they wear.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Comparison of Through-Focus High Contrast logMAR Visual Acuity for the Test Bifocal Contact Lens Versus that of the Control Bifocal Contact Lens, the Control Single Vision Contact Lens 1, and the Control Single Vision Contact Lens 2</measure>
    <time_frame>starting from visit 2 (after enrollment) and finishing with visit 3, the exit visit (up to 60 days after visit 2)</time_frame>
    <description>Visual acuity is measured under high contrast conditions (85% contrast relative to the chart background) at object testing distances of 5.3m, 2m, 1m, 67cm, 50cm and 40cm (&quot;through-focus&quot;), recorded in units of logMAR.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Comparison of Through-Focus Low Contrast logMAR Visual Acuity for the Test Bifocal Contact Lens Versus that of the Control Bifocal Contact Lens, the Control Single Vision Contact Lens 1, and the Control Single Vision Contact Lens 2</measure>
    <time_frame>starting from visit 2 (after enrollment) and finishing with visit 3, the exit visit (up to 60 days after visit 2)</time_frame>
    <description>Visual acuity is measured under low contrast conditions (10% contrast relative to the chart background) at object testing distances of 5.3m, 2m, 1m, 67cm, 50cm and 40cm (&quot;through-focus&quot;), recorded in units of logMAR.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Comparison of Visual Quality for the Test Bifocal Contact Lens Versus that of the Control Bifocal Contact Lens, the Control Single Vision Contact Lens 1, and the Control Single Vision Contact Lens 2</measure>
    <time_frame>starting from visit 2 (after enrollment) and finishing with visit 3, the exit visit (up to 60 days after visit 2)</time_frame>
    <description>Visual quality is a subjective rating that a participant chooses using an analog rating chart ranging from 0 to 100. Participants are asked to look at the letters that they can read, not the ones that they can't, and rate how sharp those letters are, with 0 denoting &quot;unacceptable&quot; and 100 denoting &quot;excellent.&quot; They are asked to reduce their score if any halos, glare, or double vision are present.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Comparison of Fitting Performance for the Test Bifocal Contact Lens Versus that of the Control Bifocal Contact Lens, the Control Single Vision Contact Lens 1, and the Control Single Vision Contact Lens 2</measure>
    <time_frame>starting from visit 2 (after enrollment) and finishing with visit 3, the exit visit (up to 60 days after visit 2)</time_frame>
    <description>Fitting performance is measured by visual observation of the contact lens on a participant's eye using a slit lamp biomicroscope and ocular measurement reticle. The position of the lens edge relative to the corneal boundaries both immediately before and immediately after a blink is measured.</description>
