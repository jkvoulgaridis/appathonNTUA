      The main objective of the study is to investigate the effect of probiotic supplementation on
      lactose maldigestion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary endpoint is defined as the difference in breath hydrogen concentration (BHC, ppm) in
      lactase and probiotic groups compared to placebo and non-inferiority in breath hydrogen
      concentration (BHC, ppm) in probiotic group compared to lactase group, measured by the
      incremental area under curve (iAUC) analysis.

      To characterize the benefit of the investigational product (IP) the following secondary
      endpoints will be analyzed:

      Breath test:

        -  Breath hydrogen peak value (ppm) in lactase and probiotic groups compared to placebo

        -  Cumulative breath hydrogen (ppm) in lactase and probiotic groups compared to placebo

      Acute gastrointestinal symptoms (severity or presence/absence to be defined on a Likert
      scale) in lactase and probiotic groups compared to placebo:

        -  Abdominal pain

        -  Flatulence

        -  Bloating

        -  Nausea and vomiting

        -  Bowel movements and diarrhea (if present, stool consistency to be defined on Bristol
           stool scale and number of bowel movements to be recorded)

      Ancillary:

        -  Baseline fasting BHC (ppm)

        -  Breath methane (CH4; ppm)

        -  Breath carbon dioxide (CO2; ppm)

        -  Probiotic identification in feces before each lactose challenge by molecular methods

        -  Gene test to determine lactase deficiency status at V1 (following single nucleotide
           polymorphism (SNP) variants to be screened: -13910*C (Europe, Central Asia, commonly
           used) -13915*T (Saudi-Arabia, Africa), -14010*C (Africa), -13907*C (Africa))
