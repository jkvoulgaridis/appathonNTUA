      The trial aims to demonstrate efficacy of the House Dust Mite SLIT-tablet versus placebo as

      The trial aims to demonstrate efficacy of the HDM SLIT-tablet versus placebo as add-on
      treatment in children and adolescents (5-17 years) with HDM allergic asthma based on
      clinically relevant asthma exacerbations.

      Additionally, the trial will investigate if the treatment has an effect on asthma symptoms
      including nightly awakenings due to asthma, asthma medication use, asthma control, lung
      function, allergic rhinitis and allergic rhinoconjunctivitis.

      Finally, quality of life (QoL) for subjects and caregivers will be measured.

      The trial is a randomised, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled multi-national
      phase III trial conducted in Europe and North America. The treatment period will be
      approximately 2 years. Subjects will receive a written asthma action plan.
