  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral insulin action is important in the regulation of whole body glucose metabolism.
      However, the cerebral insulin action differs between individuals - there is a so called
      cerebral insulin resistance. The influence of central insulin action on peripheral metabolism
      seems at least partially mediated via the autonomous nervous system. A noninvasive method to
      measure autonomic function is the pupillography. The aim of the study is to find out whether
      pupillography can be used to assess central insulin activity. Thus, pupillography will be
      performed in 30 normal weight and 30 overweight subjects before and after application insulin
      intranasally.

    <description>There will be measurements of autonomic nervous system activity by pupillography in order to identify central insulin action. The primary variable is the pupil width change in pupillography before compared to after intranasal insulin/placebo administration in 30 lean subjects. The investigation takes place in a darkened room with low backlight of about 5-10lx. The pupillographic recording is carried out with a commercially available device, F2D2 (Amtech Germany). In this case, the pupil width is recorded for 6 minutes continuously before and after nasal insulin (also 16 strokes of 10 E) or placebo doses with an infrared camera permanently mounted in a video goggle. Additionally, a possible change of the pupillary light reflection to monochromatic light is measured. Evaluation parameters are latency, amplitude and re-dilatation behavior.</description>
