      The study will be conducted in one specialized clinical site in Russia. It is planned to
      randomize 80 healthy male volunteers in this study. After screening period, not exceeding 15
      days, all eligible subjects will be hospitalized to the site and randomized to receive
      RPH-001 or Avastin in 1:1 ratio. After a single-dose of investigational drugs administration
      subjects will remain under the observation in clinical site for 8 days and then will be
      discharged. The out-patient follow up period will include at least 8 scheduled subject's
      visits to the site. The study will consider completed for each subject at Day 100 visit after
      all clinical study procedures completion.
