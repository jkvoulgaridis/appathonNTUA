    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effects of a pain neuroscience education (PNE) and physical exercise
      (PE) program in patients with chronic back pain. Half of participants receive PNE and PE
      program supervised by a physiotherapist and the other half receive usual physiotherapy care
      supported by physiotherapy protocols in primary care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Justification: Chronic musculoskeletal pain (CMP) affects more than 20% of the population,
      its prevalence is increasing, generating suffering and high health expenditure. The current
      knowledge of neurophysiology of pain shows that the painful experience in CMP is not
      necessarily associated with peripheral tissue damage and is due more to an alteration of
      central mechanisms of pain processing and to the dysfunction of endogenous pain inhibitory
      mechanisms. Physical exercise (PE) has been shown to be effective in CMP. Pain neuroscience
      education (PNE) improves the levels of pain catastrophism, Kinesiophobia, quality of life,
      disability and also modifies maladaptive cognitions that favour a painful response.

      Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy of a PNE and PE in patients with chronic back pain
      (CBP). Changes in pain intensity, pain thresholds, Catastrophism, kinesiophobia, disability,
      central sensitization and quality of are measured.

      Material and methods: Multicenter randomized clinical trial (RCT) with 170 patients.
      Intervention group receive 6 sessions of PNE and a 6 weeks PE program (18 sessions) aimed at
      improving functional capacity, neurogenesis and cerebral plasticity. Control group receive
      usual physiotherapy treatment (supported by the current protocols in Primary Care in the
      Health System of Castilla y León). The outcome variables are measured by Visual Analog Scale
      (EVA), Pressure Pain Threshold (PPT), Kinesiophobia Tampa Scale (TKS-11), Central
      Sensitization Questionnaire (CSC), Pain Catastrophism Questionnaire (CCD), disability
      (Roland-Morris), Quality of life (SF-36) and satisfaction (CSQ-8). An initial assessment,
      post-intervention (week 10), at six months and at year is performed. Patients Evaluator and
      Outcomes Assessor are masked.

      Applicability of results: The proposed intervention is simple and reproducible. It can be
      performed in the Primary Care Physiotherapy Units. It requires few resources, and it can
      produce changes in pain intensity, functionality and quality of life of patients with CBP

    <description>Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) V2. Spanish version. The SF-36 is a 36-item scale constructed to survey health status and quality of life. It yields an 8-scale profile of functional health and well-being scores as well as psychometrically-based physical and mental health summary. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale. Higher scores indicate better overall quality of life.</description>

    <description>Visual analog scale (VAS) scale. The VAS is a 100 mm long horizontal line ranging from '0: no pain at all' on one end to '100: worst pain imaginable' on the other end. Participants mark a point along the line that best represents the pain they are experiencing at that moment. A higher score indicates a higher level of pain.</description>
