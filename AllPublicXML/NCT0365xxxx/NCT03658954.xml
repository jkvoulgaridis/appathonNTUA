  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is examining three different components of a mobile sleep intervention:
      web-based sleep hygiene advice, sleep and alcohol diary self-monitoring, and personalized
      sleep and alcohol consumption feedback. The study is designed to find out which of these
      components are most effective for mitigating alcohol use disorders and improving sleep
      quality among young adults. The study has three parts: 1) an intake session; 2) a 2-week
      treatment phase; and 3) three follow-up visits over the next 10 weeks.

      Targeting sleep concerns may be a novel strategy for reducing increased risk of alcohol use
      disorders in young adults. The current study will develop and test a mobile intervention
      addressing sleep concerns in 120 heavy-drinking young adults. All participants will wear
      sleep and alcohol trackers daily. Participants will be randomized to one of three
      interventions. The primary intervention (60 participants) will include web-based sleep
      hygiene advice + sleep/alcohol diary self-monitoring + sleep/alcohol data feedback. The
      comparison interventions will be compared to matched control conditions only including these
      components: (1) web-based sleep hygiene advice (30 participants) or (2) web-based sleep
      hygiene advice + sleep/alcohol diary self-monitoring (30 participants). The primary objective
      is to evaluate sleep intervention component feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary
      efficacy on alcohol outcomes to inform a Stage II randomized trial comparing the final sleep
      intervention with a standard alcohol intervention.
