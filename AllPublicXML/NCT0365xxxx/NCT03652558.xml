      This randomized, placebo controlled, split-mouth clinical study trial evaluates the effects
      of Ozone therapy on clinical and biochemical parameters. Total of 20 participants completed
      the study . Periodontal parameters were evaluated at baseline and 3 months following
      periodontal therapy. All participants were treated non-surgically. Topical gaseous ozone was
      applied into periodontal pockets. Gingival crevicular fluid pentraxin-3 (PTX-3),
      interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (Hs-CRP) were evaluated.

    <textblock>
      Ozone therapy (OT) is very popular in medicine. Especially it use for wound healing and
      antibacterial properties. This randomized, placebo controlled, randomized split-mouth
      clinical study evaluates the effects of ozone therapy on clinical and biochemical parameters.
      Total of 20 participants completed the study (10 males, 10 females). Periodontal parameters,
      including plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), probing depth (PD), percentage of bleeding
      on probing, percentage of pockets deeper than 5 mm and clinical attachment level (CAL), and
      percentage of ≥3 mm clinical attachment level. Periodontal parameters were evaluated at
      baseline and 3 months following periodontal therapy. All participants were treated
      non-surgically. Topical gaseous ozone was applied into periodontal pockets twice a week for 2
      weeks during active periodontal therapy. Gingival crevicular fluid pentraxin-3 (PTX-3),
      interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (Hs-CRP) were evaluated.

    <description>An ozone generator (Ozonytron; Bionix, Munchen, Germany) with an KPX probe (CA Probe; Ozonytron, Bionix, Munchen, Germany) was used for OT. Topical gaseous ozone was applied into the periodontal pocket twice a week for 2 weeks based on the manufacturer's instructions. Ozone applications were at 75% power for 30 seconds (75 µg/ml). Ozone applications were performed by an experienced investigator. Ozone applications in the control side were simulated without starting the ozone generator</description>
