  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Major liver resection is associated with substantial intraoperative blood loss and
      subsequently blood transfusions. Blood transfusion in elective liver surgery is a significant
      factor of perioperative morbidity and mortality, as well as possibly long-term oncologic
      outcome. The purpose of this study is to use whole blood phlebotomy to decrease the central
      venous pressure, resulting in a state of relative hypovolemia. It is hypothesized that this
      intervention will lead to a decrease in blood loss at the time of liver resection and thus
      reduced blood transfusion in major liver surgeries.

    <textblock>
      Major liver resection is associated with significant intraoperative blood loss and blood
      transfusions. Blood transfusion in elective liver surgery is a key determinant of
      perioperative morbidity and mortality, as well as possibly long-term oncologic outcome. Whole
      blood phlebotomy is a simple intervention, whose aim is to decrease the central venous
      pressure yielding a state of relative hypovolemia and thus lead to decreased blood loss and
      subsequently blood transfusion. Small studies, mostly from the liver transplant literature,
      would suggest that phlebotomy with controlled hypovolemia can result in decreased blood loss
      and blood transfusion. Since blood loss is an important issue in liver surgery, and the
      benefits of phlebotomy and controlled hypovolemia are unknown in liver resection patients, a
      rigorously conducted trial in a representative population of patients undergoing liver
      resection is warranted, and feasible. In this proposal, it is hypothesized that by the use of
      hypovolemic phlebotomy, it is possible to decrease blood loss and blood transfusions. To test
      this hypothesis the investigators plan to randomly allocate participants to hypovolemic
      phlebotomy plus standard of care or to standard of care. Participants will be those patients
      undergoing elective major liver resection at The Ottawa Hospital, le Centre Hospitalier de
      l'Université de Montréal, and le Centre Hospitalier de l'Université de Sherbrooke for any
      indication. The primary outcome will be red blood cells transfusion up to 30 days following
      surgery. Secondary outcomes will include intraoperative blood loss, other blood product
      transfusion requirements, perioperative morbidity and mortality, safety, physiologic
      parameters, and feasibility elements. A total of 440 patients will be randomized across the 3
      sites in Ontario and Quebec. The efficacy of phlebotomy in terms of blood loss and
      transfusion prevention will be assessed.

    <description>Intraoperative blood loss is notoriously difficult to measure. It is suggested that calculation of blood loss using preoperative and postoperative hemoglobin levels in most consistently accurate. In order to minimize the risk of bias associated with any one method of intraoperative measurement of blood loss, three methods will be used independently. In the operating room, all blood and fluid aspirated from the abdomen will be measured accurately using graduated suction containers. As well, the amount of irrigation fluid will be carefully monitored and recorded. Finally, the weight of all surgical sponges will be measured. This information will be used by the surgeon and anesthesiologist to independently visually estimate blood loss, as is commonly done in clinical practice. In parallel, intraoperative blood loss will also be calculated based on an equation.</description>

    <description>Perioperative morbidity is assessed using the Dindo-Clavien scale and is defined as any deviation from the normal post-operative course. The scale (1-5) indicates the severity of an adverse event; where 1 is low (i.e. &quot;any deviation from normal postoperative course without the need for intervention&quot;) and 5 means death of the patient (i.e. mortality).</description>

Removed blood will be transfused back to participant at the end of surgery. The phlebotomized whole blood will be transfused back after liver transection regardless of blood loss.</description>
