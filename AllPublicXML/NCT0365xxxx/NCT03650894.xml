  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this protocol is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of an alternative systemic
      combination approach that omits or delays the use of chemotherapy in metastatic disease,
      while improving efficacy and durability of response. The approach combines two potentially
      effective and previously studied strategies: androgen receptor blockade and immune checkpoint
      therapy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II trial to assess the clinical efficacy and safety of nivolumab
      (anti-Programmed Death receptor-1, or anti-PD-1) combined with bicalutamide (Androgen
      Receptor (AR) inhibitor) and ipilimumab (anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4, or
      anit-CTLA4) in patients with advanced breast cancer.

      This study will include adult women with metastatic or locally advanced unresectable Human
      Epidermal Growth Factor (HER2)-negative breast cancer (by National Comprehensive Cancer
      Network (NCCN) criteria). Triple-negative breast cancer tumors will require confirmation of
      AR positivity at screening. Participants will have had no more than one line of previous
      chemotherapy in non-curative setting; subjects with metastatic progression within 1 year
      following completion of curative-intent chemotherapy are eligible if they have not received
      any additional lines of systemic therapy in the non-curative setting.

      Women who meet all of the study inclusion criteria, none of the study exclusion criteria, and
      agree to participate will receive a combination of the following:

        -  Intravenous nivolumab 240mg, every 2 weeks until progression or unacceptable toxicity

        -  Intravenous ipilimumab 1mg/kg, every 6 weeks until progression or unacceptable toxicity

        -  Oral bicalutamide 150mg, daily until progression or unacceptable toxicity

      Participants are to be treated for up to 24 months. Patients who have ongoing response will
      discontinue ipilimumab and nivolumab after 24 months, but at the discretion of the
      investigator may continue bicalutamide, and will continue assessments as per standard of
      care. Any patient who subsequently progresses will have the option to resume treatment upon
      disease progression.

          -  Participants must be willing (if clinically feasible) to provide a fresh tumor biopsy
             (or archived tissue). For archived tissue, a tissue block from the most recent biopsy

             the time of biopsy.

          -  Previous systemic chemotherapy: no greater than one line of previous chemotherapy in
             non-curative setting; subjects with metastatic progression within 1 year following
             completion of curative-intent chemotherapy are eligible if they have not received any
             additional lines of systemic therapy in the non-curative setting.

          -  Participants must have signed and dated an IRB/IEC approved written informed consent
             form in accordance with regulatory and institutional guidelines. This must be obtained

             patient care.

          -  Participants must be willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment
             schedule, laboratory tests, tumor biopsies, and other requirements of the study

          -  Adequate hematologic and liver function (using CTCAE v4). (All baseline laboratory
             requirements will be assessed and should be obtained within 14 days prior to

             bilirubin ≤3 × ULN.

          -  Female and Age ≥18 years. (Men are excluded because of potential confounding effects
             of sex on correlative analyses)

          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy
             test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 24 hours prior to

             for a total of 5 months post-treatment completion.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Active brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases. Participants with brain
             metastases are eligible if these have been treated and there is no magnetic resonance
             imaging (MRI except where contraindicated in which CT scan is acceptable) evidence of
             progression for at least 2 weeks after treatment is complete and within 28 days prior
             to first dose of study drug administration. Cases must be discussed with the lead PI,
             Dr. Page. Brain lesions are not considered measurable disease.

          -  Prior malignancy active within the previous 3 years except for locally curable cancers
             that have been apparently cured, such as basal or squamous cell skin cancer, or
             carcinoma in situ of the cervix. Subjects with prior history of unrelated breast
             cancer not requiring active therapy may be considered for enrollment, but require
             discussion with and approval of PI;

          -  Any serious or uncontrolled medical disorder that, in the opinion of the investigator,
             may increase the risk associated with study participation or study drug
             administration, impair the ability of the participant to receive protocol therapy, or
             interfere with the interpretation of study results.

             vitiligo, type I diabetes mellitus, residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune
             condition only requiring hormone replacement, psoriasis not requiring systemic
             treatment, or conditions not expected to recur in the absence of an external trigger
             are permitted to enroll.

          -  Participants with a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids
             (&gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other immunosuppressive medications within
             14 days of study drug administration. Inhaled or topical steroids and adrenal
             replacement doses &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents are permitted in the absence of
             active autoimmune disease.

          -  Uncontrolled adrenal insufficiency.

             must have resolved to Grade 1 (NCI CTCAE version 4) or baseline before administration
             of study drug. Participants with toxicities attributed to prior anti-cancer therapy
             which are not expected to resolve and result in long lasting sequelae, such as
             peripheral neuropathy grade 2 or less, are permitted to enroll

             acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, unstable angina pectoris, or psychiatric illness/social situations that
             would limit obtaining informed consent or compliance with study requirements.

          -  Participants who have had a history of acute diverticulitis, intra-abdominal abscess,
             GI obstruction and abdominal carcinomatosis which are known risk factors for bowel
             perforation.

          -  Participants with interstitial lung disease that is symptomatic or may interfere with
             the detection or management of suspected drug-related pulmonary toxicity.

             targeting T-cell co-stimulation or checkpoint pathways. Previous treatment with
             anti-PD-1/L1 in the curative setting is allowed if subjects have not received such
             therapy within one year of screening.

          -  Prior treatment with bicalutamide, enzalutamide, or any other androgen receptor
             blocker.
