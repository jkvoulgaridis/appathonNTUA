  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of zolbetuximab plus capecitabine and
      oxaliplatin (CAPOX) compared with placebo plus CAPOX (as first-line treatment) as measured by
      Progression Free Survival (PFS).

      This study will also evaluate efficacy, safety and tolerability of zolbetuximab, as well as
      its effects on quality of life. Pharmacokinetics (PK) of zolbetuximab and the immunogenicity
      profile of zolbetuximab will be evaluated as well.

    <time_frame>up to 16 months</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L is a standardized instrument developed by the EuroQol Group for use as a generic, preference-based measure of health outcomes. The EQ-5D-5L is a 5-item self-reported measure of functioning and wellbeing, which assesses 5 dimensions of health, including mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension comprises 5 levels (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, extreme problems). A unique EQ-5D-5L health state is defined by combining 1 level from each of the 5 dimensions. This questionnaire also records the respondent's self-rated health status on a vertical graduated (0 = the worst health a participant can imagine to 100 = the best health a participant can imagine) visual analogue scale. Responses to the 5 items will also be converted to a weighted health state index (utility score) based on values derived from general population samples.</description>
