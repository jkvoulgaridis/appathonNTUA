      The MMRF CureCloud Research Initiative, a Direct-to-Patient Research effort aimed at
      enrolling 5,000 individuals from whom comprehensive molecular and immune analyses will be
      generated from blood specimens and the resulting data aggregated with the correlating
      clinical information. Blood will be collected from all participants after electronic online
      consenting via a mailed blood kit designed for a mobile phlebotomy appointment. Through the
      consenting process, participants will also be authorizing linkage to their electronic medical
      records information.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      More than ever, there is an urgent need for a deeper understanding of the clinical, molecular
      and immune parameters involved in multiple myeloma disease initiation, progression and
      response to treatment. Such rich information, collected at the population level, is crucial
      to generate the evidence needed to ultimately make Precision Medicine a reality for all
      multiple myeloma patients. To this end the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation (MMRF) is
      launching the MMRF CureCloud Research Initiative, a Direct-to-Patient Research effort aimed
      at enrolling 5,000 individuals from whom comprehensive molecular and immune analyses will be
      generated from blood specimens and the resulting data aggregated with the correlating
      clinical information. Blood will be collected from all participants after electronic online
      consenting via a mailed blood kit designed for a mobile phlebotomy appointment. Through the
      consenting process, participants will also be authorizing linkage to their electronic medical
      records information. An important deliverable of the MMRF CureCloud Research Initiative is a
      curated dataset of integrated genomic, immune and correlating clinical data that will be made
      available to support scientific investigations through the MMRF CureCloud, a cloud-based
      platform with tools and capabilities for the seamless aggregation, integration and analysis
      of large collections of myeloma datasets. Finally, in order to fulfill the vision of the MMRF
      CureCloud Research Initiative to make Precision Medicine a reality for all myeloma patients,
      thoughtful strategies truly making participants active participants in the research will be
      employed.

    <description>Participants will be asked to provide up to a maximum total 40 mL of blood for all of the required sample collection. Peripheral blood will be collected from patients who consent to the protocol. These samples will be obtained at a time scheduled by the participant with the phlebotomy service provider, and will be collected at the participant's home. Patient peripheral blood samples can be obtained at diagnosis or at any time in follow up.</description>

    <ipd_description>Some data collected may be deposited into databases such as dbGAP and GDC. All identifiable information will be removed prior to submission so that the data cannot be linked to the participant in any way. The database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP) and the he Genomic Data Commons (GDC) are databases developed by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to archive and distribute the results of studies that have investigated the interaction of genotype and phenotype. Data submitted from this study to dbGAP and GDC will only be available through controlled access and restricted to cancer research studies. Any researcher requesting access to the data must formally apply and present a research study rationale for why they need access to the data. The data may also be submitted to other future database systems which will have similar access controls as dbGAP and GDC.</ipd_description>
