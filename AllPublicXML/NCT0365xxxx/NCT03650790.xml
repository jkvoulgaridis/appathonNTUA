  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The complement C1q tumor necrosis factor-associated protein-9 (CTRP-9), which is responsible
      for regulating cardiovascular and metabolic functions, increases vascular relaxation by
      pathway dependent on AMPK / endothelial nitric oxide synthesis (eNOS). The aim of this study
      was to investigate CTRP-9 levels in pregnant women with preeclampsia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The most important reason for the development of preeclampsia is the problem of
      trophoblastinvasion and consequent formation and development of placenta is not healthy

      Cytokines are regulatory molecules that have effects on cell functions.Cytokines are
      molecules that also regulate endothelial functions. Placenta formation and widespread
      endothelial damage are under the influence of cytokines.

      Therefore, there may be important links between impairment or imbalance in cytokine release
      and function and the formation of preeclampsia.Nitric oxide (NO) is a biologic enzyme that is
      synthesized by nitric oxide synthase (NOS) from the amino acid of L-arginine and exists in
      all mammals.

      e(NOS) is the three isoforms of NO. It is known that NO is a major vasodilator of pregnancy,
      inhibiting platelet and leukocyte aggregation.There was a decrease in NO levels in
      preeclamptic patients.

      The CqP / TNF Binding Protein (CTRP) family consists of 15 members, and is synthesized in
      many organs outside the body of fat.CTRP9 is predominantly excreted in fat tissue, and levels
      in circulation are reduced in patients with diabetes and obesity.Many studies have shown that
      CTRP9 exerts beneficial effects on metabolic and cardiovascular homeostasis.

      CTRP9 increases vascular relaxation in the AMPK / endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)
      dependent pathway. CTRP9 has also been reported to reduce inflammatory responses in
      endothelial cells via the AMPK-dependent pathway.

      Vasorelaxation due to CTRP9 is endothelium-dependent and NO-mediated. CTRP9, directly acting
      on smooth muscle, is indirectly or indirectly associated with NO production in the vascular
      endothelial layer by stimulating vasorelaxial molecular production by endothelial cells.
