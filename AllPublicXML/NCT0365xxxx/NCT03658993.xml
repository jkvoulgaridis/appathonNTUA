  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this study is that an altered gut microbiota is a contributory factor in
      initiating an inflammatory process in the colonic mucosa leading to collagenous colitis. The
      investigators suggest that treatment with budesonide reduces the inflammation without
      treating the underlying cause. In this trial the investigators will try to modullate gut
      microbiota by adding rifaximin. The aim of this study is to assess if 4 weeks treatment with
      rifaximin as a supplement to a standard course of budesonide against active CC can reduce the
      risk of relapse after treatment cessation.

      Patients with biopsy-verified CC and active disease defined by &gt;3 bowel movements/day or &gt;1
      watery stool measured as a mean for a week. Patients will be invited to participate in the
      study independently of age and disease duration.
