  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that inhibition of angiogenesis and PD-1 will be more effective
      than inhibition of PD-1 alone. The first step in pursuing proof of this hypothesis is to
      establish the safety and feasibility of combining ramucirumab with pembrolizumab, therefore
      the first part of this protocol is a de-escalation phase I trial of the combination of
      ramucirumab + pembrolizumab. The key objective of the phase I trial is to establish the
      safety and the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of ramucirumab for this novel combination
      regimen in patients with recurrent/metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
      (RM-HNSCC). The second step in pursuing proof of this hypothesis is to establish the efficacy
      of ramucirumab (using the RP2D) with pembrolizumab. The second part of this protocol is a
      single arm phase II trial combining ramucirumab + pembrolizumab. The primary objective of the
      phase II trial is to determine the tumor response rates (complete response (CR) and partial
      response (PR)) of the treatment combination given as first line therapy in patients with
      RM-HNSCC.

The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR until the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented.

    <description>Median scores for each item and domain will be reported at each time point.
The general questionnaire, FACT-G, consists of 27 questions in four domains - physical (7), social/family (7), emotional (6), and functional (7). FACT-G is supplemented by a head and neck cancer specific subscale consisting of 11 questions to make up the 38 item FACT-H&amp;N. Scores are calculated separately for each domain, and an unweighted summary score is calculated for the FACT-G and the total FACT H&amp;N. The maximum score of 144 reflects the best possible quality of life
Answers to the questions range from 0=not at all to 4=very much</description>
