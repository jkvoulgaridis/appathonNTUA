  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is aimed to test the efficacy of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)
      combined with a physical activity (PA) program, in 80 individuals affected by Multiple
      Sclerosis (MS). In particular, this study will evaluate the efficacy of tDCS when
      administered simultaneously with PA on walking, functional mobility, and fatigue.

      The subjects enrolled will be randomly assigned to the active group (active tDCS+PA) or the
      sham group (sham tDCS+PA)

    <description>During a sham session, the device is programmed to ramp up to the desired intensity (target 2.5 mA) and ramp down for the initial 60 seconds, with no current delivery during the session, and then againat the end of the session. These brief periods of stimulation serveto mimic the effects of a true stimulation session.</description>
