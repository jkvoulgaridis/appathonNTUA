  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I stage to investigate the safety and tolerability of MG-S-2525 in healthy
      volunteers. The proposed trial consists of 3 study parts to be conducted at Tri-Service
      General Hospital and includes Single Ascending Dose (SAD), Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD) and
      Food Effect parts. This study will enroll up to 16 evaluable subjects in the SAD part, 36
      evaluable subjects in the MAD part and enroll up to 20 evaluable subjects for the Food Effect
      part.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Single ascending dose (SAD), Multiple ascending dose (MAD) and Food Effect Parts:

          1. Healthy male volunteers

          2. Subject's age is no less than 20 years old

          3. Subjects whose body mass index (BMI) at screening is within a range of ≥18.5 kg/m2 and
             &lt;25.0 kg/m2.

             BMI = Body Weight (kg) / [Height (m)]2 Body weight is not less than 50 kg

          4. Subjects who are judged to be in good health by the investigator based upon the
             results of physical examinations, chest X-ray (within 180 days prior to the first dose
             of the study) and routine laboratory tests.

          5. Subjects did not take any of the following medications in the specified durations:

               -  Any systemically-absorbed medication (excluding vitamins, food supplements, and
                  hormone contraceptives for birth control) within 14 days prior to the first dose
                  of the study
