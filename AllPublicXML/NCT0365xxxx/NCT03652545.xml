      This Phase I dose-escalation trial is designed to determine the safety and feasibility of
      rapidly generated tumor multi-antigen associated specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (TAA-T) in
      patients with newly diagnosed diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas DIPGs (Group A) or recurrent,
      progressive, or refractory non-brainstem CNS malignancies (Group B).

      Pediatric and adult patients who have high-risk CNS tumors known to typically have positivity
      for one or more Tumor Antigen Associated (TAA) (WT1, PRAME and/or Survivin) will be eligible.
      TAA-T will all be generated from patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC).

      Group A patients (DIPG): The first TAA-T dose will be infused any time &gt;14 days after
      completion of radiotherapy.

      Group B patients (other recurrent/progressive/refractory CNS tumors): The first TAA-T dose
      will be infused any time &gt;14 days after completing most recent course of conventional
      (non-investigational) therapy for their disease AND after appropriate washout periods as
      detailed in eligibility criteria.

    <textblock>
      This protocol is designed as a phase I dose-escalation study. Three different TAA-T dose
      levels will be evaluated in each treatment group (A and B) (see below) with 2 to 4 patients
      enrolled at each dose level.

      Dose Level 1: 2 x 107 cells/m2 Dose Level 2: 4 x 107 cells/m2 Dose Level 3: 8 x 107 cells/m2

      Two patients will be initially enrolled to the lowest dose level cohort (separately on each
      arm) and followed for 42 days after initial TAA-T for DLT evaluations. The decision on
      whether it is safe to escalate to next dose level or not will be made after at least two
      patients in each dose level have finished their 42-days toxicity follow up after initial
      TAA-T. If the first two patients have not finished their 42 days follow-up, up to 2
      additional incoming patients can be enrolled at the current dose level.

      Ideally, patients should not receive other systemic antineoplastic agents for at least 42
      days after infusion of TAA-T (for purposes of evaluation), although such treatment may be
      added if deemed critical for patient care by the attending physician.

      Each patient will receive at least one TAA-T infusion and may receive a maximum of 8
      subsequent infusions. The first and second infusions will be administered at least 42 days
      apart then additional infusions will be spaced at least 28 days apart from each other. The
      expected volume of each infusion is 1 to 10 ml.

      If patients with disease have a response of stable disease or better by RANO criteria (see
      section 3.2.2.4) at the day 28 evaluation after the second infusion OR if they have clinical
      stability and a clinical assessment of possible pseudoprogression on MRI, they are eligible
      to receive up to 6 additional infusions of TAA-T at 28 day intervals if available. Each
      subsequent infusion will be the same as the enrollment dose level (i.e. no subsequent dose
      escalation). The first and second infusions will be administered at least 42 days apart then
      additional infusions will be spaced at least 28 days apart from each other. Following the
      first infusion, if a patient's TAA-T supply is insufficient for subsequent infusions at the
      enrollment dose level, further treatments may be administered at a lower dose level at the
      treating physician's discretion.

      If patients who are clinically stable are deemed to have likely pseudoprogression at the
      disease evaluation after the second infusion or on subsequent imaging, then these patients
      may still be eligible for infusion if serial imaging and clinical assessments demonstrate
      stability most consistent with pseudoprogression. In these patients, disease assessment after
      the imaging that first raises the concern for pseudoprogression (potential progressive
      disease versus pseudoprogression) must be at least stable when compared with the first scan
      demonstrating pseudoprogression.

             count recovery

             o Investigational agent: 28 days prior to TAA-T infusion. For investigational agents
             that have known adverse events occurring beyond 28 days after administration, this
             period must be extended beyond the time when new adverse events are known to commonly
             occur.

               -  Biologic agents: 7 days prior to TAA-T infusion. For agents that have known
                  adverse events occurring beyond 7 days after administration, this period must be
                  extended beyond the time when new adverse events are known to commonly occur.

               -  Bevacizumab: bevacizumab may be used if clinically indicated in order to control
                  potential pseudoprogression* or inflammation thought to be due to the cellular
                  product. There will not be a standard required washout period for bevacizumab if
                  used for this indication.

                  intervention

          -  Neurologic status: Patients with neurologic deficits must have deficits that are
             stable for a minimum of 7 days prior to TAA-T infusion

               -  Pseudoprogression is a retrospective assessment that some (or all) noted tumor
                  enlargement by radiographic criteria may reflect immune cell infiltration rather
                  than true tumor progression. This diagnosis is commonly accepted to be
                  retrospectively true if, in the context of clinical stability, radiographic
                  progression plateaus when it would have been expected to progress.

          -  Patients with uncontrolled infections

          -  Bulky tumor*** o Group B - patients who have bulky tumor on imaging are not eligible.
             These include the following: Tumor with evidence of uncal herniation or significant
             midline shift Tumor with a significant brainstem component Patients who are deemed to
             have overly bulky tumor by the PI of the study

          -  Patients who received ATG, Campath or other immunosuppressive T cell monoclonal
             antibodies within 28 days of TAA-T cell infusion.

        Pregnancy** or lactating females

        ** Pregnancy assessment on all patients &gt;7 years will be performed. If patient has child
        bearing potential (per PI/Sub-I discretion), then pregnancy testing will be performed.

        *** For subsequent infusions, the most recent disease assessments (as obtained per standard
        of care) will be used to determine eligibility.
