      This phase Ib trial studies the side effects and best dose of IRX-2 when given together with
      cyclophosphamide and nivolumab in treating patients with liver cancer that has come back or
      spread to other parts of the body and does not response to treatment. Biological therapies,
      such as IRX-2, may stimulate or suppress the immune system in different ways and stop tumor
      cells from growing. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide, work in different
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from
      dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such
      as nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the
      ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving IRX-2, cyclophosphamide, and nivolumab may
      work better than the IRX?2 regimen alone in treating patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety profile of combination IRX?2 regimen and nivolumab in
      anti?PD?1/PD?L1 naive patients who have failed or not tolerated at least one line of
      treatment.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the overall response rate of IRX?2 regimen combined with nivolumab using
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 and immune modified RECIST
      criteria.

      II. To evaluate the rate of 6?month progression?free survival in patients treated with
      combination IRX?2 regimen with nivolumab.

      III. To evaluate median progression?free survival and overall survival.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the circulating T cell profiles in patients before and after therapy with the
      combination IRX?2 regimen and nivolumab.

      II. To explore identification of tumor tissue neoantigens through a multiplex proteomic assay
      (MHC?PepSeq) paired with tumor genomic and transcriptomic sequencing.

      III. To explore putative biomarkers (including circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA]
      and immune cell profiles) in peripheral blood to generate hypotheses for response to
      treatment with combination IRX?2 regimen and nivolumab.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of IRX-2.

      Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1, cyclophosphamide IV
      on day 1, and IRX-2 subcutaneously (SC) for 10 days between days 4 and 15. Cycles repeat
      every 28 days for up to 18 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients receive booster IRX-2 SC at 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 months.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 12 weeks.
