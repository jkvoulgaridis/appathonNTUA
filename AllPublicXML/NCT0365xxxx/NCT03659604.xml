  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of the 'SmartLife' intervention on
      reducing sedentary behavior and increasing physical activity among adolescents and to
      investigate the engagement in the exergame. This will be compared in three groups: an
      intervention group that will receive a tailored exergame; an active control condition that
      will receive a non-tailored exergame; and a passive control condition that receives no
      intervention.

      The aim of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of the 'SmartLife' intervention
      with tailored feedback on sedentary behavior and physical activity among adolescents and to
      investigate the engagement in the exergame. One intervention group will receive a version of
      the exergame that tailors feedback. This means tailored feedback will be based on data from a
      sensor which is integrated in a T-shirt and paired to the game. The active control group will
      receive a different version of the game, that does not provide tailored feedback.

      Both groups will be compared to investigate their level of engagement in the game. A passive
      control group will be included that will be asked to continue their daily routines as usual.
      All three groups will be compared to determine the effectiveness of the 'SmartLife'
      intervention on physical activity and sedentary behavior.

    <description>Change in attitude, self-efficacy, personal norm, social norm, social support of sedentary behavior (measured for the context of 1. TV viewing, game-play, and computer use), measured by validated items (questionnaire: correlates of context specific SB, Busschaert, 2015). Items are measured on a 5-point Likert scale (strongly disagree=1 - strongly agree=5). The average for each correlate will be calculated (meaning that sub scales for one correlate (e.g. attitude) will be combined).</description>

    <description>Change in active transportation mode to school, measured by validated items (questionnaire: Flemish physical activity questionnaire, Verstaete et al., 2003), that measures the minutes engaged in different types of transportation to school. An average score for each component (walking, cycling, active transportation, passive transportation) will be calculated. Values will be indicated by minutes per day, whereby higher values will represent a better outcome, after reversing passive transportation.</description>

A scale ranges from 0 to 4, whereby higher values represent a better outcome. The average scores of the subscales represent each component, and a final averaged score for the GEQ questionnaire will be calcualted.</description>
