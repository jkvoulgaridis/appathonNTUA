      Putting 80 patients divided into group S（non-intubated general anesthesia combine with
      Paravertebral blocks、surface spray anesthesia and Vagus block） and group D（non-intubated
      general anesthesia combine with Paravertebral blocks、surface spray anesthesia、Vagus block and
      Phrenic block）randomly,compare the volume of anesthetic and the number of increasing
      anesthetic during operation were compared between the two groups.If the date of group S
      greater than group D，it shows that the effect of anesthetic effect of group D is better than
      group S.

      1. Put 80 patients divided into group S（non-intubated general anesthesia combine with
           Paravertebral blocks、surface spray anesthesia and Vagus block） and group D（non-intubated
           general anesthesia combine with Paravertebral blocks、surface spray anesthesia、Vagus
           block and Phrenic block）randomly.

        2. Compare the volume of anesthetic drugs between the two groups.

        3. If the date of group S greater than group D，it shows that the effect of anesthetic
           effect of group D is better than group S.
