      Patients with suspected GHB poisoning presenting to Oslo Accident and Emergency Outpatient
      Clinic (Oslo Legevakt) or a hospital in Oslo (Oslo University Hospital Ullevål,
      Diakonhjemmet, Lovisenberg) will be included. Oral fluid and blood tests will be analyzed for
      recreational drugs. Clinical course will be charted, as well as treatment in the ambulance,
      emergency outpatient clinic and hospital to find predictors for when hospitalization is
      required.

      In the second part of the study the investigators will analyze urine and blood samples from
      patients presenting to the Oslo Accident and Emergency Outpatient Clinic (Oslo Legevakt) with
      suspected substance poisoning induced by others, for toxic agents.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gammahydroxybutyrate (GHB) causes severe poisoning that requires emergency medical and
      hospital care. In addition, it is used as an anesthetic for planned sexual assault.
      Laboratory analyses will help assess whether today's clinical diagnostics of GHB poisoning
      are precise enough, possibly being a supplement to improve it. Can GHB poisoned patients be
      treated safely by emergency medical services or do these patients need hospitalization?

      In case of substance poisoning induced by others, sampling could identify substances that are
      quickly excreted from the body. Today patients are referred to private laboratories the
      following day, delaying the diagnosis and missing short-term drugs.

      Method: Prospective study. Oral fluid and blood samples will be collected from patients over
      16 years of age where there is a clinical suspicion of GHB poisoning on arrival at Oslo
      Accident and Emergency Outpasient Clinic (Oslo Legevakt) or hospital (OUH Ullevål,
      Lovisenberg and Diakonhjemmet). Blood and urine samples will be collected from patients over
      the age of 16 who present at the Oslo Accident and Emergency Outpasient clinic (Oslo
      Legevakt) with suspected substance poisoning induced by others. In both pasient groups the
      investigators will also register age, gender, clinically suspected toxic agents, vital signs,
      clinical features and treatment.

      The aims of this study are to see if the clinical diagnosis of GHB poisoning is precise
      enough, and whether more patients can be handled at an emergency outpatient level.
      Furthermore, analysis of blood and urine samples from patients who suspect they have been
      poisoned by substances induced by others, will be done to identify toxic agents.

    <time_frame>Clinical factors will be assessed at the initial presentation to emergency health services. Criteria for necessity of hospital admission will be assessed at 12 hours after presentation to hospital emergency department.</time_frame>
    <description>We will do a multiple logistic regression analysis to identify factors associated with necessity of hospital admission. If during the clinical course of the poisoning episode the patient was intubated, had a GCS below 7, an arrhythmia requiring intervention, was admitted to an intensive care intake, or kept in hospital emergency department for more than 12 hours, the patient will be deemed as needing hospital admission as opposed to treatment in an emergency outpatient setting.</description>

    <time_frame>Blood and urine samples will be collected at presentation to emergency health services, if within 48 hours of the suspected ingestion.</time_frame>
    <description>Blood and urine samples will be analyzed, looking for the most commonly used recreational drugs and for the drugs most often used in poisoning inflicted by others.</description>
