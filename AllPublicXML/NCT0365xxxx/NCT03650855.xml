      Finding a way to use Vertebral CT scan will help to predict screw loosing risk in spinal
      fusion for degenerative spine disease. Patients who will undergo at least two spine fusion
      levels for degenerative spine disease will be enrolled in. Before surgery, patients will
      undergo a spinal QCT scan with a calibrated phantom. The calibrated bone density, at
      bone-implant interface, will be assessed using dual energy CT scan immediately after surgery,
      and six months later. The primary outcomes will be the difference between the two values of
      the bone implant interface. The difference between density values will be correlated to the
      pre-op bone density value.

    <textblock>
      Screw loosening is a real problem in degenerative spine surgery because of the morbidity of
      secondary surgery sometimes needed for elderly patients. Today, there is no real possibility
      to know before surgery if cemented screws are needed or not. The use of cemented screws has
      its morbidity. In fact, bone densitometry is not a good exam to predict the bone quality in
      degenerative spine because of the arthritis. T-score in degenerative spine can be
      overestimated. The goal of our study is analyze the bone-implant interface after spine fusion
      using dual-energy CT scan technology which can provide pictures without artifact compared to
      standard CT scan. This is a prospective observational monocentric study. Patients over 18
      years old and have undergone at least two primary spine fusion levels will be enrolled. The
      exclusion criteria are the use of cemented screws, secondary surgery and neurodegenerative
      disease. The primary outcome will be the change in the bone-implant interface at six months
      post-surgery compared to the interface after surgery. The change will be assessed by
      calibrated dual CT scan. The interface bone density will be assessed using calibrated scans,
      and correlate to the true vertebral bone density measured before surgery with a QCT. We hope
      that this study can provide a simple and reproducible help for surgeons to choose between
      uncommented and cemented screws for their spine fusions surgeries.

        Patients will be recruited by their surgeon during the current consultation 3 months before
        the surgery where the decision must support an arthrodesis of at least 2 levels between T3
        and S1. The surgeon checks the inclusion criteria and offers the patient to participate.
        Inclusion will be done during this consultation. Patients will be informed by the surgeon
        of the nature of the study. They are intended to provide information to this effect and a
        certificate of non-opposition to the participation will be.
