  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although mini screw insertion is considered as a simple and non-invasive technique, it's a
      critical procedure which requires precision and accuracy. The placement of mini-screw poses a
      challenge to the orthodontist, particularly if the space available for mini-screws is
      limited.4 The proximity to the vital structures surrounding the proposed mini-screw position
      necessitates the precise knowledge of the anatomy of the insertion area.5 The incidence of
      mini-screw to tooth contact in the placement of inter-radicular region was 27%.6 Although
      failure of mini screw is considered a multi-factorial concern, many studies reported the
      proximity of a mini-screw to tooth structures is a major risk factor for failure, especially
      in the inter-radicular inserted mini-screws. guided insertion was believed to give more
      favorable results. Above all, the recent technology of the scanning and three-dimensional
      printing could pave the way to construct a simple accurate guide. Additionally all previous
      studies assessed the insertion accuracy using CBCT post-operatively, that can't be applied on
      human subjects for ethical reasons. Thus a non-invasive method for assessment of mini-screw
      insertion should be implemented.
