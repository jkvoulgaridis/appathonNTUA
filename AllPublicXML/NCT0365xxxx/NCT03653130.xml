  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot project evaluates the effectiveness of a participatory music program for Veterans
      cared for in the Domiciliary Care for Homeless Veterans (DCHV) Program (Indianapolis, IN) in
      terms of improving quality of life. A secondary goal of this study is to evaluate the effect
      of the participatory music program on community reintegration and healthcare utilization. The
      participatory music program entitled the &quot;Crossroads Orchestra&quot; includes both music education
      and an orchestra experience. The objective of this intervention program is to use an engaging
      music-based education and group orchestra experience to provide participants with an
      avocation that will improve their quality of life and facilitate their reintegration into the
      community. The Crossroads Orchestra pilot project protocol has been grounded on concepts from
      occupational therapy and recreational therapy; specifically, providing participants with a
      meaningful new activity that is enjoyable, that can be provided across a spectrum of skill
      levels (e.g., for participants with no musical training as well as for individuals who are
      proficient strings musicians), and that can provide participants with a new sense of self.

      SPECIFIC AIMS:

      Aim 1: To evaluate the effectiveness of the participatory music program in terms of improving
      quality of life.

      Aim 2: To evaluate the effect of the participatory music program on community reintegration.
      Veteran members of the Crossroads Orchestra program may develop a sense of participating in
      something that &quot;is bigger than oneself.&quot; They may develop a new sense of self, or identify
      with a new role. They may develop a sense of commitment to their stand-partner. These
      positive new perspectives may facilitate their transition from the Domiciliary to the
      community. Semi-structured interviews with participants will be conducted to understand
      participants' experiences to both improve the program and to assess its effects. The Military
      to Civilian Questionnaire (M2C-Q) measure will be used to assess community reintegration.

      Secondary Aim: To evaluate the effect of the participatory music program on healthcare
      utilization. This pilot project is not powered to identify statistically significant
      differences in healthcare utilization but rather is designed to provide preliminary data to
      understand the potential role of a music education and orchestra participation experience for
      improving outcomes among Veteran participants.

      INTERVENTION DESCRIPTION:

      The intervention is a participatory music program where adults engage in music-making as
      members of a strings orchestra. As part of the Crossroads Orchestra, participants will
      receive an instrument (violin, viola, or cello). The intervention sessions will take place
      twice a week at the Domiciliary and once per week at either the Domiciliary or other
      Indianapolis community location. Each session will include: thirty minutes of group music
      instruction by an experienced music educator with skills in adult music education followed by
      thirty minutes of weekly adult ensemble experience. The choice of music pieces will be made
      by the interventionist in consultation with participants (to ensure that the choices
      represent selections that are most engaging for the majority of participants). The
      participants will be given a binder with sheet music and practice logs. The music educator
      will create Youtube videos demonstrating violin, viola, and cello techniques and providing
      helpful tips. Participants will be encouraged to practice and to attend all of the group
      sessions.

    <intervention_model_description>Parallel Interventional Study Model: Intervention participants (N=40) and usual care controls (N=40) will be eligible if they are residents of the Indianapolis VA Domiciliary who are eligible to participate in elective activities at the time of recruitment. Intervention participants will include eligible Veterans who agree to participate in the intervention. Usual Care Controls will include eligible Veterans who agree to complete the interviews and measures, but do not agree to participate in the participatory music program. Records for retrospective chart review (N=160) will be selected from past Domiciliary residents based on case-matching for gender and biological sex factors with intervention participants.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>We will use the M2C-Q measure to assess perceived difficulties reintegrating into community life after leaving the Domiciliary. This is a 16 item scale where each item is scored on a 5-point Likert scale with 0 representing no difficulty and 4 representing extreme difficulty with reintegration.</description>
