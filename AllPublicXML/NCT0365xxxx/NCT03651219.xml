    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of apatinib mesylate tablets and
      chemotherapy drug Irinotecan in treatment of recurrent SCLC stage IIIB&amp;IV patients. It is a
      randomized controlled clinical trial.

    <textblock>
      Apatinib mesylate is a new inhibitor of VEGFR-2 tyrosine kinase targeting the intracellular
      ATPbinding site of the receptor.

      This research needs participants satisfied following criteria:

        1. Aged between 18 and 70；

        2. Locally advanced/metastatic small lung cancer (IIIB/IV) confirmed by pathology with
           measurable lesions；

        3. Patients who was treated by platinum chemotherapy drugs（including sensitive recurrency
           and resistant recurrency）

        4. ECOG：0-2；

        5. the function of primary organs is normal.

        6. Patients voluntarily entered the study and signed informed consent form (ICF).

      The primary goal of this research choose ORR, DCR and adverse effects as main curative effect
      criteria. PFS, OS and QoL as secondary curative effect criteria.
