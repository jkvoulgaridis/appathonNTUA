    <textblock>
      Aortocoronary bypass surgery is one of the most common operations in the western world. The
      goal of the surgeon is to perform a complete revascularization of the coronary arteries with
      the best, available bypass material.

      Aortocoronary bypass surgery can be performed with (on-pump) or without (off-pump) the heart
      lung machine. If the operation is performed without the heart lung machine, the heart is
      continuously beating while the surgeon sews the bypass to the diseased coronary artery. In
      randomized trials, the benefits of the off-pump technique in the hands of experienced
      surgeons in terms of shorter operating times, less transfusions and less pulmonary and renal
      complications were proven. A criticism of the off-pump technique is the reduced number of
      distal anastomoses, which means that fewer coronary arteries may be connected with bypass
      grafts because of the technically sophisticated situation. A worse quality of the connection
      (anastomosis) between coronary artery and bypass is often discussed, leading to a bypass
      occlusion already in the early stage after surgery resulting in more re-interventions on the
      coronary vessels. So-called silent bypass failure without clinical correlation has been
      examined in three relevant studies including both, the on- and the off-pump technique, with
      inhomogenous results. In addition to the technique, other parameters such as the degree of
      narrowing (stenosis) of the diseased coronary artery and collateralization of a closed
      coronary artery may play a role in early occlusion.

      All bypass patients after off-pump surgery receive routinely a computed tomographic
      examination of the heart. With this method, silent bypass occlusions without clinical
      correlation, i.e. cardiac infarction, elevated cardiac laboratory parameters or ECG changes,
      can be detected easily. In case of an occlusion of a relevant bypass, an intervention before
      discharge can be planned and performed.

      We would like to investigate the occlusion rate of this retrospective patient cohort after
      off-pump surgery and the potential risk factors, that may influence on early graft failure.
      We hypothesize, that early graft failure depends not only on the choice of the graft
      material, but also on the local grade of coronary stenosis, the collateralisation of occluded
      coronary vessels and the intraoperative flow results, as well as on the region of the target
      vessel.
