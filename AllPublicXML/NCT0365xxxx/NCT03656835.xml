      This trial studies how well nanochip technology (immuno-tethered lipoplex nanoparticle [ILN]
      biochip) works in monitoring treatment response and in detecting relapse in participants with
      diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Finding genetic markers for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma may
      help identify participants with this disease and help predict the outcome of treatment. It is
      not yet known how well ILN biochip-based testing monitors treatment response or detects
      relapse in participants with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine whether ILN biochip can be used to detect molecular marker(s) to monitor
      treatment response in patients with newly diagnosed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).

      II. Determine whether ILN biochip can promote early detection of disease relapse in patients
      with DLBCL.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants' blood samples undergo ILN biochip testing at diagnosis, before and after every
      course of chemotherapy, every 3 months for 2 years, and at relapse.

    <description>The association of the expression measured by immuno-tethered lipoplex nanoparticle (ILN) biochip and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) will be displayed by scatter plot. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and corresponding area under the curves (AUCs) will be calculated and compared. With these data collected serially over time, patterns will be explored graphically using trace plots showing the trend across treatment for each individual participant.</description>
