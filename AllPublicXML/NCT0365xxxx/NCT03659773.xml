  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a cellular therapy aiming at curing some
      hematological diseases. Upon transplantation, recipients experience a phase of profound
      immune suppression with loss of protective immunity against most infectious agents.
      Revaccination of HSCT recipients against vaccine-preventable infections is an important
      post-transplant intervention for reducing morbi-mortality. The VaccHemInf project aims at
      assessing the efficacy of recommended vaccines in adult recipients of HSCT, through the
      antibody titers reference method and a panel of immune functional assays.

    <measure>proportion of responders defined by the increase in specific antibody titers at 3 months after full block vaccination including tetanus, diphtheria, Pneumococcus, Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib), and hepatitis B virus (HBV).</measure>
    <time_frame>at 3 months after block vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>ELISA methods will be used to measure serum level concentrations of specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to tetanus toxoid, diphtheria toxoid, Hib, pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides and HBV. For pneumococcus, a 4-fold increase in the IgG titer will be considered significant for immunization. For Hib, the values between 0.15-1 μg/mL will be significant for immunization (linearity limit of 9 μg/mL). An IgG titer equal or higher than 0.1 IU/mL for diphtheria and tetanus and higher than 10 mIU/mL for HBV (anti-HBs antibody titer will be considered protective) . An anti-HBs titer higher than 100 IU/mL will be considered to confer long-lasting protection.</description>

    <description>lymphocyte proliferation in response to ex vivo T cell stimulation (% of proliferating cells among CD3+ T-cells) will be evaluated The values measured will be defined as normal or abnormal, depending on whether they are within reference intervals (RI) derived from an independent set of healthy volunteers (REALISM protocol).</description>

    <time_frame>21 days after each vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>local and general reactions will be monitored for 30 min after each vaccination. Recipients will be given a diary card to record occurrence and severity of specific local reactions at the injection site and specific general reactions for 21 days after each vaccine injection.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>ancillary study of cellular and humoral response to one dose of tetravalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks after influenza vaccination.</time_frame>
    <description>Hemagglutination-inhibition assay (HAI) will be used to measure serum level concentrations of specific antibodies to the four influenza strains included in the vaccine.
Immunization will be defined by seroprotective antibody titers ≥ 1:40 and/or seroconversion (4-fold rise in antibody titers).
T-cell responses elicited by IIV will be measured ex vivo by interferon-Gamma ELISpot assay and expressed as number of spot-forming-cells.
T-cell responses will be correlated to influenza antibody production, as measured by hemagglutination-inhibition assay (HAI).
Influenza vaccine response in allo-HSCT recipients will be compared to that observed in Healthy Volunteers.</description>
