  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to pilot test the Let's Get Organized (LGO) Occupational Therapy
      intervention in a Swedish context by exploring possible enhancements in time management
      skills, aspects of executive functioning, and satisfaction with daily occupations in persons
      with time-management difficulties due to neurodevelopmental and/or mental disorders.

      Method:

      A pre-post design with 3 and 12-months follow-up is used.

      The LGO intervention is a manual-based group intervention aiming to enhance time-management,
      targeted to persons with mental or neurodevelopmental disorders. The LGO is conducted as 10
      weekly 1.5-hour group sessions. Two trained group leaders, lead each group of 6-8
      participants. Goal-directed and other learning strategies are used to train effective time
      management habits such as maintaining a calendar and wearing a watch. All group sessions
      follow the same format, and each session has a set theme. Group sessions are structured with
      a slide presentation and a course manual, and information from the group leaders is
      intermixed with discussion among the participants and tasks to complete.

      The primary outcome of the study is self-reported time management measured by the Assessment
      of Time Management Skills (ATMS-S). Secondary outcomes are executive functioning measured
      with the Weekly Calendar Planning Activity (WCPA) and satisfaction with daily occupations,
      which is measured with the interview-administered questionnaire Satisfaction with Daily
      Occupations 13 items (SDO-13).

      Data will be collected before intervention start (pre intervention), after intervention
      completion (post intervention) and 3 and 12 months post intervention completion. The ATMS
      will be collected at all four time points. The WCPA and SDO-13 will be collected pre, post
      and 12 months post intervention.
