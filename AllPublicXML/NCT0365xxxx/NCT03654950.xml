      This is a two-stage study design. The first stage consists of focus groups interviews. Three
      focus groups with 6-8 patients (colorectal cancer patients diagnosed at least one year ago)
      in each group, will be invited. The focus group interviews will be moderated by one
      researcher, but accompanied with a second observing researcher. The participants will be
      identified using the regional Swedish ColoRectal Cancer Registry in Västra Götaland. The
      participants will be contacted by a short letter (appendix) indicating that we will call them
      with more information. The participants will by phone be asked to participate in the study
      and then invited to the focus groups.

      The second phase of the project includes a questionnaire, which will be sent to 200 patients
      from the same population. The questionnaires will be delivered by using the Sunet Survey
      system, which is a system approved by University of Gothenburg. If the participants prefers a
      paper copy, or lack the possibility to reply online, a paper copy will be send via mail
      instead.

      At this moment the investigators have developed a questionnaire, which may be refined due to
      the understating achieved from the focus group interviews.
