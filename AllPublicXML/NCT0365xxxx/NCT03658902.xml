  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Botulism poisoning is a rare but serious illness. Because of it's low incidence, it is not
      well known by physicians. Most studies describing botulism date back to the last century and
      do not take into account recent advances in intensive care.

      The objective of this study is to describe the clinical course, interventions and outcomes of
      patients with severe botulism poisoning requiring a hospitalisation in an intensive care or
      high dependancy unit.
