      P5.fi study - P4 together with a fifth 'P' and '.fi' for population health Finally
      Implemented in Finland - studies the value of returning genetic and metabolomic risk
      information in two diseases (coronary heart disease and type 2 diabetes) and one feature
      (venous thromboembolism). The hypothesis of the study is that 1) combining genetic and
      metabolic risk with traditional risk factors adds value to the personal risk assessment of
      these diseases, 2) such risk information can be provided to individuals using a web based
      user portal in an easily understandable and useful format, and 3) receiving genetic and
      metabolomic risk information has an effect on the health of the study participants.

      The study is a continuation of FinHealth 2017 -study, which involved more than 7,000 Finns
      from around the country. The participants of FinHealth were invited to participate in P5.fi
      -study. The new research utilises information, samples, and measurements obtained in the
      FinHealth Study. Prospective clinical significance of selected genetic and metabolomic risk
      scores will be studied in 30.000 Finnish individuals. The study will analyze the genetic and
      metabolomic profile of the P5.fi participants and develop and test a protocol for returning
      them health related risk information. The impact of the intervention will by followed up by
      questionnaires and national health registers for five years.

        The study population of FinHealth 2017 -study represent the general population of Finland.
        All participants are over 18 years of age and have been selected randomly from the
        population registry. All FinHealth 2017 participants with DNA sample and permission for a
