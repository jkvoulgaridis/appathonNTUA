  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to compare the effects of a 12-week, supervised, site-based group
      yoga intervention on cognitive function, functional fitness, and well-being in middle-aged
      cancer survivors. Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of three exercise conditions: a
      yoga group, an aerobic walking group or a strength training group. All sessions (2-3 times
      per week) will be led by a trained exercise leader for a total of 150 minutes of exercise
      each week for the 12-week intervention.

    <description>Participants will be led through a beginner yoga course taught by a certified yoga instructor. Classes will meet twice a week for 75 minutes each for the duration of 12 weeks. Sessions will focus on yoga postures, breathing, and meditative practices and may utilize mats, blocks, belts, and blankets.</description>

    <description>This 12 week, progressive stretching and toning course will aid participants in building whole body strength and flexibility by utilizing weights, chairs, mats, and various other exercise equipment. Sessions will meet three times a week for 50 minutes and will offer 'easy' and 'hard' modifications taught by an exercise leader.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants will partake in treadmill walking that encourages them to reach a pre-determined heart rate range. Sessions will be conducted three times a week for 50 minutes, and offer participants to self-select a speed and incline to meet their target heart rate zone.</description>
