  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who underwent modified radical mastectomy were enrolled in the study. 200 subjects
      were randomly divided into 4 groups: 7 days postoperative shoulder isotonic training + 4
      weeks postoperative progressive resistance training group, postoperative 7 Isometric training
      for the shoulder joint + progressive resistance training for 3 weeks after surgery group, 3
      days postoperative isotope training + 4 weeks postoperative progressive resistance training
      group, 3 days postoperative shoulder isotonic training + postoperative 3 Weekly progressive
      resistance training group. The effects of interventional rehabilitation at different time
      points on the recovery of shoulder function after breast cancer operation were observed. The
      results of the study will provide evidence-based evidence for the time point of intervention
      in early functional exercise after modified radical mastectomy for breast cancer.
