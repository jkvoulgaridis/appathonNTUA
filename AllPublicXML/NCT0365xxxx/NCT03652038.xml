  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, randomized, double-blinded, placebo controlled study. The study consists
      of 3 parts: Part A is a single ascending dose (SAD) study in healthy subjects, Part B is a
      multiple ascending dose (MAD) study in subjects with stable, mild asthma, and Part C
      (Biomarker) is a multiple dose study in subjects with stable, moderate-to-severe asthma.
