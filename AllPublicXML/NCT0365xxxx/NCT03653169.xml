    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of transcranial magnetic stimulation
      (TMS) on craving in individuals treated with buprenorphine for opioid use disorder. In this
      study, individuals will receive 10 sessions of TMS (twice daily for 5 days). The
      investigators will assess craving, substance use, and mood throughout the study and 1-2 weeks
      post-treatment.

      The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of transcranial magnetic stimulation
      (TMS) on craving in individuals treated with buprenorphine for opioid use disorder.
      Investigators will enroll subjects aged 18-65 years old who are currently in treatment with
      buprenorphine for opioid use disorder. Included subjects will have initiated treatment with
      buprenorphine in the last 3 months, be able to read, write, and understand English, and, if
      female, agree to use contraception. Subjects will be excluded if they have a history of
      bipolar or psychotic illness, current depression, use substances other than opioids, take
      medications that lower seizure threshold or impair neuroplasticity, have chronic pain, have a
      history of seizure or any other uncontrolled medical issue, or have a device or ferromagnetic
      implant in the head or neck. Enrolled subjects will receive 10 (twice daily for 5 days)
      sessions of active TMS (intermittent theta burst stimulation) to the left dorsolateral
      prefrontal cortex (L DLPFC) on consecutive weekdays. Investigators will assess craving,
      substance use, and mood throughout the study and 1-2 weeks post-treatment completion.

    <description>TMS is a form of noninvasive brain stimulation. An external electromagnetic coil is placed on the head, and a large current is passed through an insulated wire coil held flat on the surface of a subject's scalp in a fraction of a millisecond. This pulse of current induces a weak electrical current within the surface brain cortex. Repetitive trains of TMS pulses (repetitive TMS or rTMS) can transiently modulate corticospinal excitability following the rTMS train. When current is delivered at high frequency (10 Hz), it may simultaneously increase the activity of the brain at this site. In this study, individuals will receive 10 treatments with intermittent theta burst stimulation (twice daily for 5 days).</description>
