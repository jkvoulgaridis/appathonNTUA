  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this efficacy study is to evaluate how different web-based resources affect
      parents' and children's sexual health knowledge; attitudes, efficacy, intentions, and
      behaviors about parent-adolescent communication; attitudes about media messages; and media
      message deconstruction skills. Parent consumer satisfaction with the resources will also be
      assessed.

      While the majority of the students will receive sexual education at least once between
      seventh and twelfth grade, the content that they will receive varies greatly. Thus,
      adolescents turn to other sources for information about sex including their parents and the
      media. However, many parents face challenges in being prepared to discuss sex with their
      adolescent child. While over eighty percent of parents are talking with their children ages
      10-18 about issues related to sex, far fewer (60%) discuss more difficult sexual topics such
      as birth control. These findings suggest that there is a need for evidence-based resources
      that teach parents the skills needed to have effective conversations with their adolescent
      children about sexual health topics and media messages that promote early and risky sex.
