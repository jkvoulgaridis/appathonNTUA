  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the current study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of BTI320
      compared to placebo in addition to metformin and/or sulfonylureas on glycemic control over 12
      weeks in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus. This is a randomized, placebo-controlled,
      double-blind, multi-center study with two treatment arms. Study duration will be
      approximately 12 weeks. Participants will ingest 4 g BTI320 or matching placebo approximately
      10 minutes before starting a meal, 3 times per day, at breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Eight
      study visits will be scheduled after the Screening visit: Baseline (day 0), weeks 3, 6, and
      12 (Visits 2, 4, 6, and 8 respectively) for safety and efficacy assessments and Visits 3, 5,
      7 and 9 to remove the Continuous Glucose Monitoring System.

      The objective of the current study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of BTI320
      compared to placebo in addition to metformin and/or sulfonylureas on glycemic control over 12
      weeks in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus. This is a randomized, placebo-controlled,
      double-blind, multi-center study with two treatment arms. Study duration will be
      approximately 12 weeks. Participants will ingest 4 g BTI320 or matching placebo approximately
      10 minutes before starting a meal, 3 times per day, at breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
      Participants will be instructed not to take the Investigational Medicinal Product with other
      drugs at the same time. Additional mealtime medication must be taken after consumption of the
      meal. A nutritionist, dietitian, or study personnel will provide instructions to subjects
      regarding dietary intake and the need to keep a detailed food record in an online calorie
      counter and have it entered into an electronic data capture during the study period. In
      general, subjects will be asked to follow normal meal plans recommended to patients with
      diabetes. Non-compliance will be defined as taking &lt;80% or &gt;120% of Investigational Medicinal
      Product during any outpatient evaluation period (visit to visit). Subjects who are
      non-compliant will be replaced to meet the goal of 60 evaluable subjects. Eight study visits
      will be scheduled after the Screening visit: Baseline (day 0), weeks 3, 6, and 12 (Visits 2,
      4, 6, and 8 respectively) for safety and efficacy assessments and Visits 3, 5, 7 and 9 to
      remove the Continuous Glucose Monitoring System.

             stable and maximally tolerated for at least three months prior to study participation.
             Subjects should be on stable and maximally tolerated doses throughout the study unless
             sulfonylureas require adjustment to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia during the study.

          -  Likely to follow study requirements, in particular, to adhere to maintaining a

             HbA1c results unreliable as an indicator of chronic glucose level; hematocrit (Hct)
             &lt;35% for men and &lt;33% for women.

          -  History of solid organ transplant.

          -  Treatment with systemic glucocorticoids (except for short-term therapy [5 days or
