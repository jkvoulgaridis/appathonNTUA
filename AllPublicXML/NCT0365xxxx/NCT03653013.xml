    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled open label study design (study team will not be blinded) to
      measure whether including targeted neuropsychological consultations as part of pediatric
      diabetes care informs treatment and educational planning, improves glycemic control, and
      improves quality of life. Patients will be randomized 1:1 ratio to Group 1-Control group and
      Group 2-Neuropsychological consultation group.

    <description>Children will be administered a number of neuropsychological tests. Children and parents in Group 2 will also complete a pediatric quality of life scale (PedsQL, Generic Scale and Diabetes Module), diabetes related family conflict scale (DFCS-R) to assess quality of life and family stress at the start of the study, as well as the self-report form of the BRIEF-2 if they are over age 11. Parents will also undergo a brief literacy and numeracy screening using the Wide Range Achievement Test, complete a parent report assessing their children's executive functioning skills at the start of the study (BRIEF-2) and they will fill out the Family Impact Module.</description>
