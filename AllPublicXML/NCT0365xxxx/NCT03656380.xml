  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multi-center, randomized, double blind, parallel-arm, placebo controlled trial to determine
      whether mepolizumab is more effective than placebo for improving symptoms of dysphagia and
      decreasing esophageal eosinophil counts in adults and adolescents with active eosinophilic
      esophagitis after an initial 3 month treatment course, and will also assess the impact of an
      additional 3 months of treatment.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double blind, parallel-arm, placebo controlled trial of
      mepolizumab. After the first 3 month blinded phase, there will be a second 3 month blinded
      phase where all patients receive active medication, but the dose will be lower in the
      subjects initially randomized to the placebo arm.

      In the first arm, subjects will receive mepolizumab 300 mg SQ monthly for 3 months. In the
      second arm, subjects will receive a placebo SQ injection monthly for 3 months. Both groups
      will have the injection administered under direct observation in a Clinical &amp; Translational
      Research Center (CTRC) or other clinic to ensure proper administration and compliance. Each
      visit will also provide an opportunity for symptom questionnaires to be completed and for
      blood samples to be drawn. After 3 months (the time point where the primary outcome is
      assessed), all subjects initially randomized to active treatment will continue with
      mepolizumab dosing 300 mg SQ monthly, and will remain blinded. All subjects initially
      randomized to placebo will receive mepolizumab 100mg SQ monthly, and will remain blinded. Of
      note, no dietary changes, changes in baseline Proton Pump Inhibitor (PPI) medication dose,
      changes in inhaled or intranasal steroid doses, or administration or oral, topical/swallowed,
      or systemic steroids will be allowed during the study period. Subjects will undergo endoscopy
      after the first blinded phase (at 3 months) and after the second blinded phase (after 6
      months).

    <description>Dysphagia will be assessed by the Eosinophilic Esophagitis Symptom Activity Index (EEsAI) which measures dysphagia frequency, dysphagia severity, and food avoidance/modification behaviors. EEsAI scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms. A decrease of ≥ 20 points is felt to be a meaningful clinical response and scores ≤ 20 representing clinical remission.</description>

    <description>Mean change in severity of endoscopic findings as measured by the EoE Endoscopic Reference Score (EREFS). The EREFS, measures features of EoE including esophageal edema, rings, exudate, furrows, and strictures. The instrument grades edema and furrows as absent (0) or present (1); rings as absent (0), mild (1, subtle circumferential ridges), moderate (2, distinct rings) and severe (3, rings that impair passage of a standard adult diagnostic endoscope); exudates as absent (0), mild (1, less than 10% of the esophageal surface area) or severe (2, greater or equal to 10% of the esophageal surface area); and strictures as absent (0) or present (1) with an estimation of the minimal luminal diameter. Higher scores indicate more severe disease (range 0 - 9).</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age 16-75

          2. Diagnosis of EoE as per consensus guidelines (including PPI non-response). PPI
             non-response is defined as &gt;15 EOS/hpf after 8 weeks of high dose administration (40mg
             total per day or higher) of any approved PPI medication.

          3. Active eosinophilia on esophageal biopsy, with a peak count of least 15 EOS/hpf from
             at least one esophageal level.

          4. Biopsies from the stomach and duodenum that have ruled out alternative etiologies in
             all children and in adults with abnormal endoscopic findings or when other gastric or
             small intestinal conditions are clinical possibilities. If these samples have been
             obtained during a previous endoscopic evaluation and in the judgement of the
             site-Investigator the patient has not had a clinically significant change that would
             merit repeat gastric/duodenal biopsies, then prior normal gastric and duodenal
             biopsies are acceptable to exclude alternate etiologies.

          5. Active symptoms of dysphagia with more than 3 episodes of dysphagia over a period of 2
             weeks during the screening period, and an Eosinophilic Esophagitis Symptom Activity
             Index (EEsAI; see below for details) score of ≥ 27 at baseline.

          6. Able to read, comprehend, and sign consent form.

          7. Have maintained a stable diet for 6 weeks prior to enrollment.

          8. Able to maintain a stable diet throughout the duration of the study period.

          9. Female subjects of childbearing potential who have had their first menses agree to use
             a highly effective method of birth control during the study and for 30 days after the
             last dose of study drug. Female subjects with reproductive potential who are using
             systemic contraceptives (e.g., oral contraceptives, injectable contraceptives,
             implantable/insertable hormonal contraceptive products, or transdermal patches) to
             prevent pregnancy must have stable use for ≥28 days prior to screening. See section
             5.3 for additional details.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Esophageal dilation within 8 weeks of the screening endoscopy.

          2. Inability to pass a standard upper endoscope (8-10mm) due to esophageal narrowing or
             stricturing.

          3. Swallowed/topical steroids for EoE within 4 weeks of the screening endoscopy, or
             systemic corticosteroids within 8 weeks of the screening endoscopy.

          4. Not having maintained a stable diet for at least 6 weeks preceding enrollment.

          5. Initiation, discontinuation, or change of dose regimen of PPIs; leukotriene
             inhibitors; or nasal, inhaled, and/or orally administered topical corticosteroids for
             any condition (such as gastroesophageal reflux disease, asthma, or allergic rhinitis)
             within the 8 weeks prior to the qualifying esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD).

          6. Presence of concomitant eosinophilic gastritis (EG), eosinophilic gastroenteritis
             (EGE), eosinophilic colitis (EC), Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, or celiac
             disease.

          7. History of malignancy within 5 years prior to screening, except completely treated in
             situ carcinoma of the cervix and completely treated non-metastatic squamous or basal
             cell carcinoma of the skin.

          8. History of achalasia.

          9. Prior esophageal surgery.

         10. History of bleeding disorder or esophageal varices.

         11. Active parasitic infection or suspicion of an active parasitic infection, which, in
             the opinion of the site-Investigator, has not been previously evaluated or treated.
             Subjects presenting with signs of active parasitic infection or suspicion of active
             parasitic infection as assessed by current diarrhea and/or blood or mucus in stool
             will be referred to their clinical physician for further testing to rule out parasitic
             infection.

         12. Any other active infections judged at the discretion of the site-Investigator.

         13. Any other medical or psychological condition that, in the opinion of the
             site-investigator, may present an unreasonable risk to the study patient as a result
             of his/her participation in this clinical trial, may make patient's participation
             unreliable, or may interfere with study assessments. The specific justification for
             patients excluded under this criterion will be noted in study documents.

         14. Patient or his/her immediate family is a member of the investigational team.

         15. Pregnancy or breastfeeding.

         16. Women of children bearing potential who are not on highly-effective contraception.
