  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alternate day fasting is known to be helpful to control weight and have a positive effect on
      insulin resistance and cardiovascular risk factors. However, there have been no studies on
      weight reduction program combining alternate day fasting with exercise which preserves lean
      mass in Korea. The purpose of this randomized clinical trial is to examine the effects of
      alternate day fasting and exercise on weight reduction, visceral fat, and metabolic
      parameters in overweight or obese adults.

    <description>During the 8-week intervention, participants consumed 25% of their daily recommended energy intake (approximately 500 kcal) on each &quot;fast day&quot; (24 h), and consumed food ad libitum on each &quot;feed day&quot; (24 h). The &quot;fast day&quot; and &quot;feed day&quot; were repeated every other day, and the &quot;fast day&quot; occurred 3 days per week.</description>

    <description>During the 8-week intervention, participants visited the research center gym at least three times per week and received exercise logs. Each exercise session began with 5 minutes of warm-up and ended with 5 minutes of cool-down. Resistance training was performed using weight training machines, barbells, and dumbbells for 40 minutes. Aerobic exercise was performed on motorized treadmills for 20 minutes.</description>
