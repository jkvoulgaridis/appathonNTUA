    <measure>SMOG score</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>For patients with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, efficacy will be assessed using the SMOG score. SMOG score : Bleeding manifestations are grouped into three major domains: skin (S), visible mucosae (M), and organs (O), with gradation of severity (SMOG). Each bleeding manifestation is assessed at the time of examination. Severity is graded from 0 to 3 or 4, with grade 5 for any fatal bleeding.</description>

    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>For patients with Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) and Multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN), efficacy will be assessed using the MRC. MRC (Medical research council) scale for testing muscle : The muscle scale grades muscle power on a scale of 0 to 5 in relation to the maximum expected for that muscle (5= Normal power , 0= No contraction visible or palpable).</description>

    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>For patients with Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) and Multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN), efficacy will be assessed using the ONLS (overall neuropathy limitations score). Score ONLS (Overall Neuropathy Limitation Scale) : The OLNS focuses on upper and lower limb functions, and consists of a checklist for interviewing patients. It is scored from 0 to 5 on the upper limb section and from 0 to 7 on the lower limb section. A score of 0 indicates no limitations (the ceiling of the scale) and a score of 5 or 7 indicates no purposeful movement.</description>
