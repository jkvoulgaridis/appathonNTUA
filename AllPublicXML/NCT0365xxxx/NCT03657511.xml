  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is planned as an evaluation of a low cost, simple smoking cessation intervention.
      There is very little information about the effectiveness of a simple tobacco cessation
      strategy. Therefore, our objective is to obtain estimates of effectiveness that can be used
      to refine existing programs or to develop new ones.

    <description>Women receiving a screening mammogram at KCI downtown and McLaren Macomb, will be given a self-administered questionnaire at check-in.
Women who indicate they are current smokers are eligible for the study. After the screening mammogram is complete, eligible women will be consented. Educational materials will be provided to the participant at that time. The materials provided outline evidence-based approaches to smoking cessation and include contact information for local resources including cessation support groups, Michigan Tobacco Quitline, American Cancer Society's Guide to Quitting Smoking, Quitnet, Smokfree.gov and Become An Ex. The participant will be contacted by telephone approximately 12 weeks later to determine if she is currently smoking or had quit in the last 12 weeks.</description>
