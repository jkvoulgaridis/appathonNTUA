  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gentamicin and vancomycin, widely used in neonatology, are antibiotics with a narrow
      therapeutic index and a risk of nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity. For these drugs, therapeutic
      drug monitoring (TDM) is required, to optimize the efficacy and tolerance of these
      antibiotics.

      In newborns, the TDM of these antibiotics is really available, because of physiological
      features, such as renal elimination and hepatic metabolism which are both very dependent on
      age and maturation. Thus, in newborn, there is a large interindividual variability of
      pharmacokinetic parameters, making the dosage adjustment of antibiotics very difficult.

      Unfortunately, because of a limited blood mass, the TDM of these antibiotics is very rarely
      practiced in these children. The introduction of a Died blood spot (DBS), which uses only a
      single drop of blood (&lt;50 Î¼L) preserved in dried form, thus makes it possible to reduce the
      blood volume taken and avoid the venous intrusion. The dosage needs the use of liquid
      chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MSMS), the only sensitive technique
      to work with such a low blood volume.

      We therefore wish to develop this approach coupling DBS and LC-MSMS, in neonatology, to
      evaluate the concentration of these nephrotoxic antibiotics (gentamicin and vancomycin), as
      TDM. The blood concentrations of the antibiotic, per 100 new-born term or premature (50
      gentamicin, 50 vancomycin), are compared to the physiological state of the child (premature
      or not, intrauterine growth retardation or not), its hemodynamic status (shock or not) and
      its efficacy / toxicity, evaluated by the clinician using a questionnaire.

      The use of this new sampling method, as an alternative to conventional blood sampling, makes
      it possible to better monitor the concentrations of gentamicin and vancomycin in neonatalogy,
      thus reducing the risk of toxicity of these antibiotics.
