  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The late-stage forms of degenerative osteoarthritis (OA) are very debilitating and less
      affordable to therapy. The main objective is to identify early onset symptoms of hand OA
      patients through imaging techniques (such as ultrasound and MRI). Our primary endpoint is to
      specify patients with high risk of radiological profression (X-ray).

    <measure>Impact on quality of life measured by the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) is a measure of quality of life in health. The questionnaire is designed to be completed by the patient himself, without the help of a doctor. We will use an adaptation of the HAQ, the Modified Health Assessment Questionnaire (MHAQ), as in the Kwok et al. Study, with 8 questions about the function of the hand. The score ranges from 0 to 3. The average score reported in osteoarthritis studies is 0.8. It is 0.49 in the global population.</description>

    <measure>The impact on the quality of life measured by the SF-36 questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 questionnaire assesses the quality of life. It is a validated international questionnaire. It consists of 36 items evaluating 8 dimensions. It can be used in health economics studies as a variable in the calculation of a Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) to determine the cost-effectiveness of a health intervention. Fill in the questionnaire: 10 min.</description>

    <measure>The impact on the quality of life measured by the EQ-5D-3L questionnaire (https://euroqol.org)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>This score varies between 0 and 1: 0 represents death, and 1 the best quality of life possible. So, this score indicates the decrease in quality of life compared to an optimal state of health. The more desirable a health state, the higher the score associated with it. Negative scores are possible if the subject perceives a state of health worse than death. The EQ-5D-3L includes the following five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain / discomfort, and anxiety / depression. Each dimension has 3 levels: absence of problems, presence of problems and extreme problems. Questionnaire filling time: 5 min</description>

    <description>It is an international questionnaire validated with 6 items, which assesses the aesthetic impact of osteoarthritis of the hands. The questionnaire includes the function of the overall hand, the activities of daily life, the pain, the work, the appearance of the hands and the satisfaction of the patient with the functionality of his hands. In the ladder pain, a high score indicates more intense pain, while in the rest of the items, a better score reveals better hand functionality. Duplicate filling time: 15 min.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The psychological impact of pain measured by the HAD questionnaire (Hospital Anxiety and Depression)</measure>
