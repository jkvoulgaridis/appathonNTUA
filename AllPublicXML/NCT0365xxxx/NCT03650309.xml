    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, phase I pilot trial designed to evaluate the safety and feasibility of
      deep brain stimulation (DBS) for the treatment of refractory morbid obesity. Patients with
      diagnoses of morbid obesity will be recruited and enrolled. All patients will receive DBS
      targeting two brains areas involved in the pathophysiology of obesity and will be followed
      post-operatively for 12 months.

    <textblock>
      This study will establish 1)the safety of deep brain stimulation (DBS) in a patient
      population with treatment refractory morbid obesity. DBS has been used safely and effectively
      in thousands of patients for numerous disorders. Recent evidence (outlined above) has shown
      that DBS can also be used to manage refractory psychiatric conditions, such as depression and
      obsessive-compulsive disorder, as well as in eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa. Such
      studies indicate that a targeted therapy informed by the neuroanatomic and circuitry
      literature can be effective in altering pathological mood and behaviour. 2) evaluate the
      effectiveness of the procedure, which will be evaluated by the actual weight loss and
      resolution of the core symptoms of morbid obesity, including BMI, as well of, depression,
      self-esteem, and binge eating scores surrounding with loss or weight gain.
