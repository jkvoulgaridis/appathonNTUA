    <textblock>
      Recombinant Programmed death-1(PD-1) humanized monoclonal antibody injection (company code:
      F520) is joint developed by Shandong New Time Pharmaceutical Co., LTD., it is the
      reorganization of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) technology in the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)
      cells express system expressed in a immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) kappa type single resistance to
      predominate. F520 had the different new amino acid sequence and molecular structure compared
      with two marketed PD-1 monoclonal antibody injection and got the approval of China Food and
      Drug Administration (CFDA) for clinical trial.Pharmaceutical research indicated F520 cell
      strain had security source, production process is stable, quality can control, preparation
      stability, has good compatibility with packaging materials, it has the condition of
      industrialization, can prepare investigational medicinal product with safety, effective, and
      controlled quality for clinical research.Pharmacodynamics study show the targets and
      mechanisms of F520is clear, tumor suppression effect is obvious.Toxicology studies show this
      product in high doses with low toxic, and the toxic is reversible, the most common toxicity
      is specific to the drug action mechanism.
