  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a common progressive lung disease which
      causes breathlessness and frequent exacerbations, with patients often requiring
      hospitalisation. Patients with severe COPD commonly become housebound and lose their
      independence. They have a higher symptom burden than those with incurable lung cancer, yet
      are less likely to receive specialist palliative care, or to have been engaged in advance
      care planning (where patients discuss and often document their wishes regarding their future
      care). Hospital admissions become increasingly common towards the end-of-life; therefore,
      hospitalisation is a good opportunity to identify patients at risk of poor outcome. Such
      patients may wish to consider alternatives to admission and avoid intrusive treatments.
      Unfortunately, predicting which patients are likely to die in the near future is challenging
      thus far.

      The first step required to improve provision of palliative care services, and ensure patients
      are given the opportunity to make truly informed decisions about their future care, is
      accurate identification of those most likely to benefit.

      Well-designed clinical (prognostic) tools outperform clinician judgement in most settings.
      The investigators will compare the accuracy of one year mortality prediction of several
      clinical tools in patients who survive a COPD exacerbation requiring admission. This will
      initially be performed using existing data collected during previous research (the 1,593
      patient validation study for the PEARL score - Previous admissions, extended Medical Research
      Council Dyspnoea score, Age, Right and Left heart failure), then confirmed in at least 310
      patients admitted uniquely and consecutively with an exacerbation of COPD. The latter group
      of patients will be invited to participate in a longitudinal follow-up study, assessing
      symptom burden, quality of life, and readmissions over one year.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The PEARL (Previous admissions, Extended Medical Research Council Dyspnoea Score, Age,
      Right-sided heart failure and Left-sided heart failure) score predicts readmission or death
      within 90 days of discharge following an exacerbation of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary
      Disease (ECOPD), and was developed by the lead supervisor's research team. Within the PEARL
      derivation cohort (2 hospitals, 824 patients), they have developed a novel tool to predict
      one year survival. The performance of this novel tool and existing Chronic Obstructive
      Pulmonary Disease (COPD) prognostic tools will be compared in the PEARL validation cohort (6
      hospitals, 1,593 patients). The existing tools are the Body Mass Index, Airflow Obstruction,
      Dyspnoea and Exacerbations (BODEX) index (score range 0-9); PEARL score (score range 0-9);
      COPD Gold Standards Framework Prognostic Indicator Guidance (COPD PIG); Comorbidity,
      Obstruction, Dyspnoea and Exacerbations (CODEX) index (score range 0-10); Age, Dyspnoea and
      Obstruction (ADO) index (score range 0-14); Dyspnoea, Obstruction, Smoking, Exacerbation
      (DOSE) index (score range 0-8), the Supportive and Palliative Care Indicators Tool (SPICT)
      and another tool recently developed by another centre (PubMed reference not yet available).
      COPD-PIG and SPICT are not scored in the same manner and therefore do not have a range.

      Performance of all tools will also be further prospectively assessed in a minimum of 310
      patients. The COPD-PIG is intended to only be scored in patients who the clinician &quot;would not
      be surprised&quot; if they died within one year; the performance of this tool cannot be fully
      assessed retrospectively. Prospective validation will also allow an assessment of the ease of
      data collection; this is not available for the existing PEARL cohort but is a key
      consideration in selection of the final tool to ensure it is appropriate for widespread use
      on hospital wards. Consecutive, unique patients admitted to Northumbria Healthcare NHS
      Foundation Trust and Newcastle Upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust with ECOPD will be
      identified. Demographic and clinical indices, including the components of the nine prognostic
      tools, will be collected. Caldicott and ethics committee approval are in place
      (REC:18/NE/0226). Hospital readmissions, utilisation of other healthcare services such as the
      local palliative care teams and Hospice and survival will be assessed over one year. In
      common with similar studies, this validation study will be non-consenting.

      Patients identified as high-risk by the selected tool who survive beyond one year may still
      warrant palliative care input if their symptom burden is high. The patients enrolled in the
      validation study will be invited to participate in a consenting longitudinal outcomes study,
      aiming for at least 50% participation. Symptom burden and functional status will be assessed
      using the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score
      (HADS), Australian modified Karnofsky Score (AKPS), Extended Medical Research Council
      Dyspnoea (eMRCD) score, and modified Borg scale at baseline, and 1, 3, 6 and 12 months. The
      baseline and 3 month assessments will be conducted via face to face meetings. The additional
      1, 6 and 12 month assessments will be conducted over the phone. This data will be used both
      to calculate the relationship between symptom burden and death, and to identify the
      characteristics of patients who are especially symptomatic.

      The characteristics of the cohort will be summarised using standard descriptive statistics
      appropriate to the level and distribution of the data. Groups will be compared (including by
      mortality outcome) using standard tests of statistical inference (e.g. t-test, Mann-Whitney U
      test, Fishers exact test). The performance of candidate prognostic tools will be compared by
      1) assessing the positive and negative predictive value within the high-risk and low risk
      groups respectively; and 2) Area Under the curve of the Receiver Operating Characteristic
      (AUROC) analysis, with performance compared using the method of DeLong et al. Where data
      imputation is required, this will be done using multiple imputation methods. Statistical
      significance will be set at 5% throughout. The statistical analysis plan will be finalised
      prior to end of recruitment to avoid potential bias.

    <description>This is an exploratory study. The optimal tool to identify patients for advance care planning needs to offer high PPV (i.e. the substantial majority of those identified at high risk of dying should not survive beyond one year) and reasonably high sensitivity (i.e. most deaths within one year should be identified). Ease of completion must also be considered as this will strongly influence engagement.</description>

SGRQ is a validated questionnaire which measures the health status of patients with COPD, with a score ranging from 0 (no impairment) to 100 (worst possible health). Patients in a high mortality risk group identified for advance care planning who do not die are not &quot;false positives&quot; if they have a high symptom burden. The proportion of patients with high symptom burden not identified is also clinically relevant. This and the subsequent secondary outcomes are therefore important in this regard.</description>
