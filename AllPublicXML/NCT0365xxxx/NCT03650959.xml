  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Evidence favours teaching procedural skills to medical students using a proficiency-based
      rather than time-based approach. Basic suturing skills can be taught through faculty-led,
      peer tutor-led, and computer augmented approaches. One method has yet to be identified as
      superior in terms of educational outcomes, resource utilization, and participant
      perspectives.

      Pre-clerkship medical students were randomized to: faculty, peer tutor, or computer augmented
      learning. Participants practiced suturing through their randomized method until they reached
      targeted proficiency defined using hand motion analysis (HMA). Proficiency was defined as a
      score of the average plus a standard deviation of five surgeons' HMA for two of three
      consecutive sutures using appropriate technique.

      The primary outcome was the number of stitches placed to achieve proficiency. The secondary
      outcomes were the number of sutures used, time, and costs incurred. Learning curves were
      constructed. Participants' perceptions were assessed using a follow-up survey.
