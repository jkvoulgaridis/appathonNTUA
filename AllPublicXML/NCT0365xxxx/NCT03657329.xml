  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the accuracy of apnea detection and automated sleep analysis by
      the Dreem dry-EEG headband and deep learning algorithm in comparison to the consensus of 5
      sleep technologists' manual scoring of a gold-standard clinical polysomnogram (PSG) record in
      adults during a physician-referred overnight sleep study due to suspicion of sleep-disordered
      breathing.

      The study will enroll up to 70 adults who are referred to the Stanford Sleep Medicine Center
      by their physician for an overnight polysomnographic sleep study due to suspicion of
      sleep-disordered breathing, with the aim of collecting 60 usable data sets (i.e., eligible
      subjects with high-quality PSG and Dreem recordings). Upon arrival to the clinic, patients
      provide informed consent, are interviewed to determine eligibility, and complete a detailed
      demographic, medical, health, sleep, and lifestyle questionnaire (Alliance Sleep
      Questionnaire; ASQ). After the ASQ, participants are fitted with the PSG and the Dreem
      headband by the sleep technologist. During the PSG sleep study, the Dreem headband records
      EEG, pulse, oxygen saturation (SO2), movement, and respiratory rate. Many participants may
      undergo a split-night study with a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device during
      their participation, as deemed necessary by the clinical staff pursuant to the sleep study.

      The PSG data from the first 30 eligible participants will be manually scored by 5 sleep
      technologists. These manually-scored PSG data files (referred to as the training dataset)
      will be synchronized with Dreem data files from the same night and the synchronized files
      will be used to train Dreem's deep learning algorithms. Following training, the algorithms
      will be deployed to automatically score the final 30 participants' Dreem datasets (testing
      dataset). Finally, PSG records for the second 30 participants will be provided to the sponsor
      and manually scored by 5 sleep technologists. The manual scoring results will be compared to
      the Dreem automatic analysis to determine the accuracy of Dreem's apnea-hypopnea index (AHI)
      severity detection and sleep staging algorithms.
