  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical investigation is intended to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the
      TactiCath™ Contact Force Ablation Catheter, Sensor Enabled™ (TactiCath SE) for use in cardiac
      electrophysiological mapping and for the treatment of drug-refractory, recurrent symptomatic
      persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) when used in conjunction with a compatible radiofrequency
      (RF) generator and three-dimensional mapping system. This clinical investigation will be
      conducted under an investigational device exemption (IDE) and is intended to support market
      approval of the TactiCath SE ablation catheter for the treatment of drug refractory,
      symptomatic persistent atrial fibrillation in the United States.
