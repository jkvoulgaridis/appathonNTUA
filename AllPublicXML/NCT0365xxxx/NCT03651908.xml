    <textblock>
      Various regenerative procedures used for the treatment of intabony defects.The Aim of this
      study is to compare the treatment outcome of bioactive silica graft with platelet rich fibrin
      Vs bioactive silica graft in the treatment of intrabony defects in patients with diabetes
      mellitus.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Platelet rich fibrin has emerged as one of the promising regenerative material.It is a second
      generation platelet concentrate and is defined as an autologous leucocyte-and platelet-rich
      fibrin biomaterial.Platelet-rich fibrin membrane consists of a fibrin 3-D polymerized matrix
      in a specific structure ,with the incorporation of almost all the platelets and more than
      half of leucocytes along with growth factors.It enhance the stabilization and
      revascularization of the flaps and grafts.

      Bioactive silica graft (Novabone dental putty )is being used for regenerative procedures is a
      premixed composite of bioactive calcium -phospho-silicate particulate which is composed
      solely of elements that exist naturally in normal bone (ca,p,na,si,o) and an absorbable
      binder which is a combination of polyethylene glycol and glycerine.Treatment of intrabony
      defects with bioactive silica graft has led to clinically and statistically significant
      probing depth reduction ,relative attachment level gain and radiographic osseous defect fill.

    <intervention_model_description>In this study the patients are divided into two test groups-group A, group B. Each patient will be given careful instructions on proper oral hygiene measures. Under local anesthesia full-mouth supragingival and subgingival scaling and root planning procedure will be performed. After therapy, a periodontal evaluation will be done and the selected sites will be divided into group A and group B.
The Group A subjects will be treated with conventional flap surgery using Bioactive silica graft with PRF as a graft.
Group B will be treated with conventional flap surgery +bioactive silica graft alone in intrabony defects.</intervention_model_description>
