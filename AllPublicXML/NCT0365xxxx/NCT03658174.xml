  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autonomic nervous system dysfunction is known to be associated with an increased risk of
      heart rhythm abnormalities and sudden cardiac death (SCD) in patients with chronic heart
      failure - a condition affecting millions of people worldwide. The nitric oxide pathway has
      been identified as being involved in mediating the effects of the autonomic nervous system on
      the heart. Recent studies have shown that dietary nitrates can increase the availability of
      nitric oxide in the body.

      This study hopes to find out if dietary nitrate supplementation can help to improve cardiac
      and autonomic function in patients with heart failure and autonomic dysfunction and reduce
      the risk of arrhythmias.

      20 participants enrolled at the University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust will be invited
      to take a beetroot juice supplement, which naturally contains a high concentration of
      nitrates, and a nitrate-free (placebo) beetroot supplement. In a double blind way,
      participants will be randomised to the order in which they receive the 2 treatments with
      crossover of the treatments. There will be a washout period between the two treatments.

      In order to assess cardiac and autonomic function, and risk of heart rhythm abnormalities,
      tests will be carried out before and after each treatment period

      Hypotheses:

        -  Nitrate supplementation reverses the autonomic dysfunction seen in Chronic Heart Failure
           (CHF)

        -  Markers of prognostic significance for predicting SCD, including QT variability index
           and cardiac restitution properties (R2I2, PERS), are normalised by nitrate
           supplementation in patients with CHF.

        -  Nitrate supplementation results in functional improvement in CHF patients.
