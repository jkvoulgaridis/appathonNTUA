  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Following the implementation of SPECT V/Q imaging for PE diagnosis, the investigators
      previously conducted an observational study over the period 2011-2013 that showed the safety
      of a diagnostic management based on SPECT V/Q to rule out PE. However, PE prevalence was high
      (28%), which may seem a bit high as compared with other recent studies. The hypothesis was
      that the use of SPECT V/Q may be responsible for an overdiagnosis of PE, especially at the
      implementation phase of the test. The aim of this study was to perform a time trend analysis
      of the evolution over the years of PE diagnosis with SPECT V/Q.
