      Portal flow pulsatility detected by Doppler ultrasound is an echographic marker of
      cardiogenic portal hypertension from right ventricular failure and is associated with adverse
      outcomes based on previous studies performed at the Montreal Heart Institute. This
      multicenter prospective cohort study aims to determine if portal flow pulsatility after
      cardiopulmonary bypass separation is associated with a longer requirement of life support
      after cardiac surgery.

      Hypothesis: Portal flow pulsatility detected by Doppler ultrasound during cardiac surgery is
      an echographic marker of cardiogenic portal hypertension from right ventricular failure and
      is associated with adverse clinical outcomes.

      Background: Peri-operative right ventricular failure is associated with a high mortality
      rate. In this context, organ perfusion is hampered by both the reduction of cardiac output
      and venous congestion from the elevation of central venous pressure. The clinician's
      objective is to appreciate the hemodynamic impact on end-organs in an effort to adjust the
      therapy accordingly since the ultimate goal is to optimize their perfusion. Based on this
      rationale, organ specific blood flow assessment using Doppler ultrasound could be used to
      personalize management. In order to non-invasively assess the presence of cardiogenic portal
      hypertension, Doppler ultrasound can be used to detect portal flow pulsatility, an abnormal
      variation in the velocity of blood flow within the main portal vein. In two single-center
      cohort studies, the presence of portal flow pulsatility after cardiac surgery was
      independently associated with post-operative complications such as major bleeding, acute
      kidney injury (AKI) and delirium as well as increased length of intensive care unit (ICU)
      stay.

      Specific Objectives: This multi-center cohort study aim to determine whether the association
      between portal flow pulsatility and organ dysfunction seen in previous studies is present
      across multiple cardiac surgery centers.
