    <textblock>
      This phase I/II studies the side effects and best dose of regorafenib when given together
      with pembrolizumab in treating participants with colorectal cancer that has spread to other
      places in the body. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as regorafenib, work in different ways
      to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from
      dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab,
      may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving regorafenib and
      pembrolizumab may work better at treating colorectal cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess safety of the combination and identification of the recommended dose (RD) for
      combination therapy. (Phase I) II. To evaluate preliminary efficacy and tolerability of the
      combination RD of regorafenib and pembrolizumab. (Phase II)

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. The associations between biomarkers and clinical outcome will be investigated.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of regorafenib followed by a phase II
      study.

      Participants receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 and
      regorafenib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-14. Courses repeat every 21 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up periodically.

                  permitted. Infrequent bleeding or elevations in PT-INR have been reported in some
                  subjects taking warfarin while on regorafenib therapy. Therefore, subjects taking
                  concomitant warfarin should be monitored regularly for changes in PT, PT-INR or
                  clinical bleeding episodes

          -  Live vaccines administered &lt; 30 days before the initiation of treatment with the
             investigational drug and during the trial period. Examples of live vaccines are as
             follows (however, the list is not exhaustive): measles, mumps, rubella, chicken
             pox/herpes zoster, yellow fever, rabies, BCG for tuberculosis, and typhoid vaccines.
             Inoculation with inactive vaccines (e.g., seasonal influenza vaccines) is permitted;
             however, the intranasal administration of attenuated influenza vaccines (e.g.,
             Flu-Mist) is prohibited

          -  Systemic glucocorticoids for purposes other than treating symptoms caused by notable
             events with a suspected immunological etiology. Upon deliberation with the trial
             coordinating committee, the use of corticosteroids may be permitted according to the
             physiological dose required to alleviate symptoms (e.g., to control symptoms of acute
             asthma)
