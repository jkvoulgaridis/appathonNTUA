  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sarcopenia is a geriatric syndrome of decreased muscle volume with muscular function decline.
      There is more tendency for sarcopenic elderly to be frail, disabled, or have cardiovascular
      disease. Compared to those who are not sarcopenic, they also had worse prognosis in response
      to treatment for definite diseases, and spend more medical cost.

      Exercise appears to have an important role in management of sarcopenia. In the current study,
      the investigators provide an exercise program, including resistance/balance training for the
      elderly with sarcopenia or frailty in long-term care institution, and evaluate the effect.
