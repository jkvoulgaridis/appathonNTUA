  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MiST is a British Lung Foundation funded, University of Leicester Study, a multi-arm
      stratified therapy based clinical trial for patients with relapsed mesothelioma.

      The goal of MiST is to enable acceleration of novel, effective personalised therapy as a
      basis for improving survival outcomes for patients with mesothelioma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stage 1 - molecular pre-screening:

      The MiST Master protocol describes the identification of patients, biomarker testing and
      analysis. Patients with relapsed mesothelioma will be offered to consent for molecular panel
      testing of their diagnostic tumour block for predictive biomarkers. The results of this
      assessment will be used to classify patients into one of several possible molecularly defined
      treatment arms. Patients will therefore be offered a specific study treatment determined by
      their molecular profile. Patients, who exhibit positive testing in more than one biomarker,
      will potentially be eligible to subsequently be treated on a different treatment protocol
      upon disease progression or treatment failure.

      Stage 2 - Treatment:

      The MiST treatment protocol will be specific to the treatment allocated to the patient -
      based on the results of their biomarker testing in stage 1.

      Specific agent(s) will be detailed separately in each of the separate treatment protocols.

      Stage 3 - Molecular Profiling :

      In order to understand the genomic basis of drug response in the MiST trial, archival tumour
      tissue from all patients enrolled will be interrogated using molecular inversion probe- based
      microarray analysis of the somatic copy number aberrations. Optional re-biopsy of patients
      who progress on treatment, followed confirmed radiological response, will be offered, to
      investigate genomic interrogation of tumours at the time of acquired resistance. For arms 3
      and 4, immune checkpoint, transcriptomic and gut microbiome correlative studies are planned.

Investigators expect patients to participate in the study for a maximum of 6 months of Treatment and 6 months of follow-up, however cannot guarantee that some patients may participate over 12 months.</description>
