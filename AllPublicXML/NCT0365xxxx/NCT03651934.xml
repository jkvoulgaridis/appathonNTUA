  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research plan is divided into two parts. The first part is the correlation study .It is
      planned to include women who prepare for pregnancy or in the early stages of pregnancy to
      carry out the detection of 25 loci SNP of 21 genes of 9 nutrients, to predict the nutritional
      abnormalities of 9 nutrients, and to determine the nutritional status of 9 nutrients, and
      then verify the correlation between nutrient metabolism related gene SNP and nutrient
      nutrition status .The second part selects iron and selenium which are commonly lacking in
      Chinese women of childbearing age. A intervention study is designed for these two nutrients.
      According to the SNP grouping of related gene loci, observe the effect of nutrition
      intervention and explore the nutrition intervention strategies of different SNP individuals.

    <description>The intervention was divided into two stages, the first stage lasted for 4 weeks, and the dosage used was the dietary nutrient recommendation amount, namely the dietary recommendation amount standard for early pregnancy (iron 20mg/d), and the middle stage of pregnancy (iron 24mg/d). The second stage lasts for 4 weeks. For subjects in iron deficiency, the maximum tolerable amount (iron 42mg/d) is used for intervention. For those with good nutritional status, the dietary recommendation amount is maintained.</description>
