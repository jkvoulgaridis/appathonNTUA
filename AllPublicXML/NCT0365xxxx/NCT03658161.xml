  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with cancer suffer many devastating side effects; one that is understudied but vital
      to quality of life is the effect of cancer and its treatments on patients' sexual functioning
      and satisfaction. The long-term goal of this work is to improve the care of patients with
      cancer who are experiencing difficulties with sexual function and satisfaction. As a
      necessary first step, providers must be skilled in eliciting patients' concerns about sexual
      health and addressing them appropriately. However, prior studies have found that (1) oncology
      providers are reluctant to discuss sexual issues with their patients, (2) patients report
      that needed conversations about their sexual concerns do not occur, and (3) patients want to
      discuss sexual health with their provider. Thus, the goal of the present study is to develop
      and test a brief intervention to improve oncology provider's skills in addressing patients'
      concerns regarding sexual function—the Communicating about Sexual Concerns and Dysfunction
      Effectively (CASCADE) Program.

      To aid in development of the intervention, focus groups will be held and target 9 distinct
      populations of cancer survivors: 1) Breast; 2) Gynecologic; 3) Prostate; 4) males with
      gastrointestinal malignancies; 5) females with gastrointestinal malignancies; 6) males with
      brain tumors; 7) females with brain tumors; 8) LGBTQ individuals who identify as male; 9)
      LGBTQ individuals who identify as female. Maximum accrual for this phase will be 90 patients
      for 9 focus groups, or a maximum of 10 patients per group. Groups will last approximately 75
      minutes and be audio recorded. Participants will also complete self-report measures which as
      about their sexual functioning, emotional wellbeing, physical functioning and utilization of
      services offered through the Duke Cancer Institute.

      The intervention will then be pilot tested with up to 10 providers to assess feasibility and
      acceptability of the protocol. Specifically, the coaching intervention will include two
      parts: 1) initial coaching session with one of the study PIs, Dr. Kathryn Pollak; and 2)
      follow-up appointment with Dr. Pollak to check in on use of the intervention strategies.
      Providers will also complete self-report assessments prior to initiating CASCADE and upon
      completion of CASCADE. Clinic staff will let patients know that the clinic is participating
      in a research study about how to improve communication between patients and providers and
      provide patients of participating providers with an anonymous survey to complete following
      their clinic visit. The paper surveys will be given to all patients of the participating
      provider being seen in the clinic approximately 5 days prior to the coaching intervention
      session and 5 days following the intervention (e.g., second session with Dr. Pollak).

      Descriptive statistics (e.g., means, standard deviations) will be used to characterize the
      experience of patients participating in focus groups with regard to their sexual functioning,
      emotional distress (i.e., symptoms of anxiety and depression), and physical functioning.
      Qualitative methods will also be used to analyze the focus groups.

      Feasibility of CASCADE will be assessed by examining providers' accrual, attrition, and
      adherence. To determine acceptability, providers will be asked how useful the intervention
      was, whether the intervention will change their clinical practice, and whether they would
      recommend the program to a colleague. Simple t-tests will be used to examine changes in
      outcomes of interest (e.g., confidence, barriers, etc.) from pre- to post-intervention. Basic
      descriptive statistics (e.g., means, standard deviations) will be used to characterize
      patients' experiences during the interaction.

    <measure>PROMIS Sexual Function and Satisfaction v2 - brief profile (Sex-SF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Focus group participants will complete this measure at the time of the focus group; up to 2 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Sexual Function and Satisfaction scale asks participants to provide information about their sexual functioning and satisfaction over the last 30 days. Separate versions of the measure will be used for males and females to address gender-specific differences in sexual functioning (e.g., pain and discomfort in the clitoris or labia vs. ability to maintain an erection). The male version of the questionnaire consists of 10 items while the female version of the questionnaire consists of 14 items. Items are assessed using a 5 point scale.</description>

    <measure>PROMIS four-item Anxiety Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Focus group participants will complete this measure at the time of the focus group; up to 2 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) four-item Anxiety Scale is a self-report measure of anxiety. The measures assesses fear (I felt fearful), anxious misery (i.e., My worries overwhelm me), and hyperarousal (i.e., I found it hard to focus on anything other than my anxiety), and arousal-related somatic symptoms (i.e., I felt uneasy) over the last seven days. Each item is rated on a 5 point scale ranging from 1 &quot;never&quot; to 5 &quot;always.&quot; Items are summed and converted to standardized T-scores with higher scores indicative of more symptoms of anxiety. The PROMIS Anxiety Scale has been shown to have good internal reliability and convergent validity with other well validated measures of anxiety.</description>

    <measure>PROMIS four-item Depression Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Focus group participants will complete this measure at the time of the focus group; up to 2 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) four-item Depression Scale is a self-report measure of depressive symptoms. The measures assesses presence of depressed mood (i.e., I felt depressed, I felt hopeless, I felt helpless), as well as their self-view (e.g., I felt worthless) over the last seven days. Somatic symptoms of depression are not included in the measure as they frequently overlap with comorbid physical health concerns among medical populations. Each item is rated on a 5 point scale ranging from 1 &quot;never&quot; to 5 &quot;always.&quot; Items are summed and converted to standardized T-scores with higher scores indicative of more depressive symptoms. The PROMIS Depression Scale has been shown to have good internal reliability and convergent validity with other well validated measures of depression.</description>

    <measure>PROMIS four-item Physical Function scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Focus group participants will complete this measure at the time of the focus group; up to 2 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) four-item Physical Function scale is a self-report measure of physical functioning. The measure assesses self-reported capability of physical activities including instrumental activities (e.g., &quot;Are you able to run errands and shop)&quot; and mobility (e.g. &quot;Are you able to go up and down stairs at a normal pace&quot;). Each item is rated on a t point scale ranging from 1 &quot;Unable to do&quot; to 5 &quot;Without any difficulty.&quot; Items are summed and converted to standardized T-scores, with higher scores are indicative of better physical functioning.</description>

    <measure>Psychosocial services use, preferences, and perceived barriers/facilitators questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Focus group participants will complete this measure at the time of the focus group; up to 2 hours</time_frame>
    <description>A psychosocial services use, preferences, and perceived barriers/facilitators questionnaire will be completed by patients and partners/caregivers at each assessment. Participants will be asked to indicate (yes/no) whether they have utilized a list of available psychosocial services. Next, participants will indicate with yes/no to whether they have sought services for or would like services related a list of common concerns. Participants will complete a 10-item list of barriers to seeking services. Participants will state whether or not each has served as a barrier to seeking services. Finally, participants' preferences for various delivery methods will be assess. The final two questions are open ended and ask participants to list any other services they would be interested in pursuing that were not included on the list and to provide information about what might increase their use of services.</description>
