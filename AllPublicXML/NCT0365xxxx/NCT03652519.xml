  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Regular physical activity is known to reduce the risk for some neurodegenerative disorders
      and their symptoms. Several studies have shown positive effects of therapeutic exercise
      interventions on motor- and cognitive function as well as psychosocial benefits in persons
      with multiple sclerosis (MS). To improve exercise recommendations, it is necessary to learn
      more about the underlying biological mechanisms. A reduction of inflammatory stress through
      physical exercise has been suspected as one key mechanism, mediating the positive effects of
      exercise in the context of MS (being a &quot;classical&quot; neuro-inflammatory disease). This
      randomized controlled trial aims to investigate the influence of two different rehabilitative
      endurance exercise programs (3x/week moderate vs. vigorous endurance exercise) on (1)
      (anti-)inflammatory immune signalling and (2) various aspects of participation.

    <description>Cognitive Performance is assessed with the BICAMS This test battery involves three tests to assess the main cognitive domains vulnerable to MS: information processing speed, verbal and visual memory. The battery includes the Symbol Digit modalities Test (SDMT), Californian Verbal Learning Test-II (CVLT-II) and the Brief Visuospatial Memory Test revised (BVMT-R). Processing speed is the most relevant test and is assessed by the SDMT where the patients have 90s to voice numbers as rapidly as possible that were associated with target symbols within a grid printed at the top of a Stimulus page. The final score is the correct number of substitutions in 90 s, and scores ranges between 0 and 110. Higher scores indicating better cognition.</description>

    <description>Participants of the HIIT group will exercise three times per week over a period of three weeks (inpatient rehabilitation) on a cycle ergometer. Exercise intensity will be regulated and heart rate controlled based on the achieved maximum heart rate (HRmax) assessed during the initial Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing. Each exercise session will last 30 minutes and will be started and finalized with three minutes at low intensity (50% HRmax, warm-up / cool-down). During each exercise session, participants of the HIIT group will perform 5x one-and-a-half Minute high-intensive exercise bouts at 95-100% of their HRmax followed by active breaks of unloaded pedalling over 2 minutes with the aim to achieve 60% HRmax.</description>

Each exercise session will last 30 minutes and will be started and finalized with three minutes at low intensity (50% HRmax, warm-up / cool-down). During each exercise session, participants of the ST group will exercise 30 minutes continuously at 65% of HRmax.

    <description>Treatment in both arms consists of specific of aerobic exercise training modalities. Exercise has become an efficient strategy within rehabilitative programs and is part of a goal-orientated multidisciplinary approach to improve disability and participation in persons with MS.
