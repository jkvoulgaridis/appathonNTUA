  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most prevalent cause of mobility impairment and disability in the
      elderly. Indications at early stages of OA include decreased organisation of the collagen
      matrix, loss of proteoglycans and increased hydration. Late-stage joint disease can be
      diagnosed with X-ray, CT, and conventional MRI, but there are no validated methods to image
      early changes in cartilage microstructure, which are direly needed in early phase clinical
      development. Newly developed therapies and evaluation techniques are required at earlier
      stages of disease to offset the growing numbers and costs of end-stage disease.

      MRI can probe soft-tissue with physical measurements that are not available through other
      methods. Quantitative MRI signal relaxation properties are particularly promising for
      assessing early changes in the cartilage composition. These relaxation properties are
      sensitive to water content and cartilage macromolecular structure.

      Mechanical joint-loading and exercise affects quantitative MRI through cartilage compression
      and nonuniform deformation. A study measuring MRI relaxation times and using static
      joint-loading weights has shown differences between OA and healthy subjects. Cartilage
      volume, which is expected to be related to these relaxation times, recovers within an hour
      after exercise in healthy runners, with the menisci lagging in their volume recovery rate.
      Previous exercise studies have not measured post-exercise cartilage recovery using
      compositional techniques, such as physiologically-sensitive T1œÅ and T2, nor probed
      compositional responses with OA subjects.

      The investigators will examine a single knee of an initial 18 participants with MR.
      Participants will be drawn from two groups: (1) 12 participants aged 40-60 years old with
      clinical and x-ray features of OA and (2) 6 control subjects (matched to cases for age, sex
      and body mass index in a 1:2 ratio) who do not have clinical features of OA.

      Participants will undergo an initial (baseline) MR examination, followed by repeat MR
      examinations at approximately 1 month and 1 year following the baseline examination.

      This will allow the investigators to explore the possibility of mechanical joint-loading and
      exercise to differentiate early stage OA from healthy subjects and assess both the
      reliability of the MR measurements and the expected progression in the MR measurements in OA
      subjects in the absence of any disease-modifying intervention.

        Group 1 will consist of 12 patients aged 40-60 who have presented to the Orthopaedic clinic
        with a painful knee, and have mild/moderate OA on plain radiographs (Kellgren- Lawrence
        grade 2-3). Group 2 will consist of 5 healthy volunteer controls, matched (1:2 ratio) to
        cases for age, sex and body mass index who do not have knee pain.
