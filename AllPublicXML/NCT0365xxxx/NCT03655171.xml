  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a pilot study, mainly to explore the potential application value of specific
      pattern movement after video-based quantitative methods in the early recognition and
      assessment of Parkinson's disease. According to UPDRS III, a series of motion indicators
      related to the characteristics of the disease were determined and quantitatively analysed.
      Motor function scores were given by the senior physicians and the AI video analysis team
      separately to evaluate the accuracy of the scores of AI video analysis compared with that of
      senior specialists' team of movement disorders.

      In this study, participants are asked to perform video-recorded UPDRS-III test, and the
      unmarked motion feature identification and quantitative analysis based on the video were
      conducted.

      The investigators have collected standardized motor function videos of patients with
      Parkinson's disease from outpatient clinics and follow-up since August 2017. Based on the
      UPDRS III motor function test, the investigators screened five pattern actions that are both
      disease-characteristic and easy to visualize, including finger tapping, hand movements,
      pronation-supination movements of hands and gait test. With the assistance of the artificial
      intelligence team, the characteristic value quantification (frequency, distance, angle, etc.)
      of the above pattern actions has been initially implemented. Considering that the
      characteristic values of the pattern action under the identification of video are all
      continuous variables and cannot be directly compared with the discrete UPDRS rating scale,
      the investigators initially explored the construction of deep learning algorithm based on
      UPDRS rating in the previous work to verify the effectiveness of video analysis in motor
      function evaluation.

      In this study, the investigators plan to include patients with Parkinson's disease with
      different disease severity and analyse the consistency between UPDRS scores evaluated by
      specialists of movement disorders and video quantification score. The results of this study
      will hopefully lay a good foundation for launching a large-scale, multi-centre clinical trial
      in the future.

    <description>The patient will perform the motor test in Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS III) under the guidance of a movement disorder specialist and recorded by a high-speed camera. The subject's motor function score will be automatically generated in the video sample and compared to a doctor-based scoring score.
According to the different pattern actions, the scale is divided into 11 score subscales, each of which is ranged from 0-4 points according to the degree of involvement of the action execution, higher scores represent a worse motor function. The scores of each subscale are summed with the highest score is 44 points.
This technology has the potential to be a novel approach to clinical diagnosis and disease assessment. As a pilot study, the sample size is not sufficient to conclude the reliability and effectiveness of the technology. The results of this study will be useful for future sample size estimation of large-scale, multi-centre preclinical trials.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The primary criteria for diagnosis are idiopathic Parkinson's disease, defined as
             bradykinesia with resting tremor or muscular rigidity according to MDS-PD diagnosis
             criteria (2015). The examination of major symptoms needs to be performed by the
             methods described in the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Definite cerebellar abnormalities, such as cerebellar gait, limb ataxia, or
             cerebellar eye movement abnormalities (such as sustained staring induced nystagmus,
             giant square wave beats, and distant hypertonia).

          -  2. Downward vertical suprachiasmatic gaze palsy, or selective downward vertical
             scanning is slowing down.

          -  3. Within five years of onset, the disease was diagnosed as a likely frontotemporal
             dementia or primary progressive aphasia (according to revised diagnostic criteria for
             frontotemporal dementia published in 2011).

          -  4. With more than three years after the onset of the disease, Parkinson's disease
             symptoms are still limited to the lower limbs.

          -  5. They have been treated with dopamine receptor blockers or dopamine depletion agents
             and the dosage and duration of administration are consistent with the diagnosis of
             drug-induced Parkinson's disease.

          -  6. Although the condition is at least moderately severe, there is no discernible
             effect on high-dose levodopa therapy.

          -  7. Definite cortical hypoesthesia (such as loss of skin writing and body recognition
             when the primary sensory function pattern is complete), definite motor aphasia of body
             concept, or progressive aphasia.

          -  8. Functional neuroimaging study of the presynaptic dopaminergic system shows normal
             results.

          -  9. There is evidence of Parkinson's disease or other diseases suspected to be related
             to the patient's symptoms, or professional physicians identify they may be other
             syndromes rather than Parkinson's disease based on a complete diagnostic assessment.
