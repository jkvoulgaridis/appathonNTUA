  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine the bioequivalence of two azilsartan formulations
      after administration of single doses to healthy subjects under fasted and fed conditions.
      These data were to be evaluated statistically to determine if the products meet
      bioequivalence criteria.

             sexual partner (e.g., vasectomy) during the whole study period. Men willing to use an
             appropriate method of contraception (such as condom with spermicide or use by partner
             of oral, implantable or injectable contraceptives, IUD, diaphragm, with spermicides)
             or abstinence or will have a sterile sexual partner during the whole study period;

          5. Subjects understand the nature, significance, possible benefits, inconveniences and
             potential risks before participating in this trial, understood the trial process, and
