    <textblock>
      This study follows subjects who have agreed with their dentist that their failing teeth or
      missing teeth all need replacing. This study follows their standard routine care with some
      additional assessments. The dental treatment option that replaces a whole arch or both arches
      (upper and lower jaws) of the mouth is call &quot;Teeth in a Day&quot; and information on the use of
      the JUVORA™ Dental Disc during this treatment is what is being collected as part of this
      study along with subjects follow-up care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over the last decade full-arch metal implant-supported prosthetics have been used as a
      replacement for missing teeth in edentulous (toothless) patients. The standard has been a
      titanium metal base. Due to its potential shock-absorbing properties and patients' demands
      for metal-free restorations, there is rising enthusiasm surrounding the use of High
      Performance Polymers (HPPs) such as the polyaryletherketone (PAEKs) as metal alternatives for
      such cases. The JUVORA™ Dental Disc is made from PEEK-OPTIMA™ polymer (Invibio Biomaterial
      Solutions) which allows efficient fabrication of reliable non-metal dentures by using CAD/CAM
      technology to manufacture precise, custom-fit prostheses. The JUVORA™ Dental Disc is
      indicated for the manufacture of: full-arch implant-supported dentures and implant bars; full
      and partial removable dentures and overdentures; crowns and 3-unit bridges.

      This study aims to evaluate the short- and long-term clinical performance and patient
      satisfaction of the JUVORA™ full-arch implant-supported prostheses.

      Two subjects will be included in a run-in phase and 10 subjects will be included in the main
      study.

      The subjects will be followed-up at 6 weeks, 6 months, 12 months and for as long as willing
      yearly after the implant of the definitive prosthesis (artificial teeth).
