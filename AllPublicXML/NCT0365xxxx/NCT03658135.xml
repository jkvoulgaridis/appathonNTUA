      A Phase 1b, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Parallel Cohort Safety,

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1b randomized, double-blind, safety, and tolerability clinical trial of an
      investigational drug, called BIIB092 in patients with four different primary tauopathy
      syndromes: amyloid PET (-) corticobasal syndrome (CBS), nonfluent variant primary progressive
      aphasia (nfvPPA), symptomatic patients with autosomal dominant genetic forms of
      frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTD) due to the presence of a mutation in the
      microtubule-associated protein tau gene (sMAPT), and traumatic encephalopathy syndromes
      (TES). Primary tauopathies are neurodegenerative brain disorders in which tau is the only
      protein that accumulates at autopsy. While Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common
      tauopathy, it is considered a secondary tauopathy, because tau protein accumulates along with
      another pathogenic protein, amyloid beta. Primary tauopathies are rare diseases for which
      there is no treatment or cure. The purpose of the this study is to characterize the safety
      and tolerability profile of intravenous BIIB092 in four primary tauopathies.

      A basket design will be used for a parallel evaluation of BIIB092 in four heterogenous
      clinicopathological syndromes that share a common molecular target (tau).

    <intervention_model_description>This is a phase 1b, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel cohort study of the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and preliminary efficacy of BIIB092 in patients with 4 different primary tauopathy syndromes: CBS, nfvPPA, sMAPT, and TES.
A basket trial design will be used for a parallel evaluation of BIIB092 in four heterogeneous clinicopathological syndromes that share a common molecular target (tau). There will be four cohorts of approximately 8 participants each, one for each specific primary tauopathy syndrome listed above (for a total of approximately 32 participants). For each diagnostic cohort, eligible participants will be randomized 3:1 to active or placebo (i.e., 6 participants receiving BIIB092 and 2 participants receiving placebo). All eligible participants will be administered study drug (BIIB092 or placebo) as an 1-hour intravenous (IV) infusion q4w for 20 weeks (for a total of 6 infusions).</intervention_model_description>

               2. Able to walk at least 10 steps with minimal assistance (stabilization of one arm
                  or use of cane/walker);

               3. MRI at Screening is consistent with the underlying neurodegenerative disease of
                  the respective diagnostic cohort (i.e., CBS, nfvPPA, sMAPT, or TES), with no
                  large strokes or severe white matter disease;

               4. Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE) at Screening is between 20 and 30 (inclusive);

               5. Amyloid beta (Aβ) positron emission tomography (PET) scan (florbetapir or
                  equivalent) at Screening is not consistent with underlying Alzheimer's disease
                  (AD).

                  Previous Aβ PET scan negativity (assessed by a certified neuro radiologist) or
                  previous AD CSF biomarker (Aβ)/tau level) negativity may be used instead of
                  performing an Aβ PET scan at Screening at the PI's discretion;

               6. The following medications are allowed, but must be stable for 2 months prior to

                  Screening:

                    1. FDA-approved AD medications

                    2. FDA-approved Parkinson's disease medications;

               7. Other medications (except those listed under exclusion criteria) are allowed as
                  long as the dose is stable for 30 days prior to Screening;

               8. Has a reliable study partner who agrees to accompany the participant to visits,
                  and spends at least 5 hours per week with the participant;

               9. Agrees to 3 lumbar punctures;

              10. Signed and dated written informed consent obtained from the participant and the
                  participant's study partner in accordance with local IRB regulations;

              11. Women of childbearing potential (WCBP) must agree to abstain from sex or use an
                  adequate method of contraception for the duration of the Screening period, the
                  study drug treatment period, and for 155 days after the last dose of study drug;

              12. Males must agree to abstain from sex with WCBP or use an adequate method of
                  contraception for the duration of the study drug treatment period and for 215
                  days after the last dose of study drug.

                  For CBS Only

              13. Meets 2013 consensus criteria for possible or probable corticobasal degeneration
                  (CBD), CBS subtype (Armstrong et al. 2013).

                  For nfvPPA Only

              14. Meets 2011 consensus criteria for nfvPPA (Gorno-Tempini et al. 2011). Patients
                  meeting 2013 Armstrong criteria for CBS-nfvPPA or 2017 Movement Disorder Society
                  (MDS) criteria for progressive supranuclear palsy and speech/language disorders
                  (PSP-SL) (Höglinger et al. 2017) would be assigned to this cohort since both of
                  these definitions were derived from the 2011 Gorno-Tempini criteria.

                  For sMAPT Only

              15. Has known frontotemporal lobar degeneration- (FTLD-) causative MAPT mutation
                  confirmed in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certified
                  laboratory (Ghetti et al. 2015);

              16. CDR-FTLD (Knopman et al. 2008) sum of boxes score ≥ 1.0. Sum of boxes is used
                  instead of the global Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR) because the global CDR
                  does not take into account FTLD specific measures;

              17. Has any clinical phenotype of sMAPT.

                  For TES Only

              18. Meets 2016 criteria for probable TES (Reams et al. 2016);

              19. At least 5 years or greater between symptom onset and 1st known traumatic brain
                  injury/concussive episode.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The exclusion criteria are listed below and are the same for each diagnostic cohort.
        Participants meeting any of the following exclusion criteria will be excluded from
        randomization to study drug (active or placebo) treatment.

          1. A diagnosis of probable AD (McKhann et al. 2011) or progressive supranuclear palsy-
             Richardson's syndrome (PSP-RS) (Höglinger et al. 2017). Since variants of progressive
             supranuclear palsy (PSP) are known to cause nfvPPA and CBS, a diagnosis of PSP-SL or
             progressive supranuclear palsy-corticobasal syndrome (PSP- CBS) would not be
             exclusionary;

          2. Any other medical condition other than CBS, nfvPPA, sMAPT or TES that could account
             for cognitive or motor deficits (e.g., active seizure disorder, stroke, vascular
             dementia, substance abuse or alcoholism);

          3. History of a prominent and sustained response to levodopa therapy in the opinion of
             the PI;

          4. History of significant cardiovascular, hematologic, renal, or hepatic disease (or
             laboratory evidence thereof);

          5. History of major psychiatric illness or untreated depression that in the opinion of
             the PI would pose a safety risk or interfere with the appropriate interpretation of
             study data;

          6. Neutrophil count &lt;1,500/mm3, platelets &lt;100,000/mm3, serum creatinine &gt;1.5 x upper
             limit of normal (ULN), total bilirubin &gt;1.5 x ULN, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt;3 x
             ULN, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &gt;3 x ULN, or International Normalized Ratio
             (INR) &gt;1.2 at Screening evaluations;

          7. Evidence of any clinically significant findings on Screening or baseline evaluations
             which, in the opinion of the PI would pose a safety risk or interfere with appropriate
             interpretation of study data;

          8. Current or recent history (within four weeks prior to Screening) of a clinically
             significant bacterial, fungal, or mycobacterial infection;

          9. Current clinically significant viral infection;

         10. Major surgery within four weeks prior to Screening;

         11. Any contraindication for MRI or unable to tolerate MRI scan at Screening;

         12. Any contraindication to or unable to tolerate lumbar puncture at Screening, including
             use of anti-coagulant medications such as warfarin. Daily administration of 81 mg
             aspirin will be allowed as long as the dose is stable for 30 days prior to Screening;

         13. Participants who, in the opinion of the PI, are unable or unlikely to comply with the
             dosing schedule or study evaluations;

         14. Prior treatment with BIIB092;

         15. Treatment with another investigational drug within 30 days or 5 half-lives of drug
             before Screening, whichever is longer. Treatment with investigational drugs other than
             BIIB092 while on study will not be allowed;

         16. Treatment with systemic corticosteroids within 30 days or 5 half-lives of drug before
             Screening, whichever is longer. Treatment with systemic corticosteroids while on study
             will not be allowed;

         17. Known hypersensitivity to the inactive ingredients in the study drug (BIIB092 or
             placebo);

         18. Known to be pregnant or lactating; or positive pregnancy test at Screening or Baseline
             (Day 1);

         19. Cancer within 5 years of Screening, except for basal cell carcinoma;

         20. History of serum or plasma progranulin level less than one standard deviation below
             the normal participant mean for the laboratory performing the assay;

         21. History or evidence at Screening of known disease-associated mutations in GRN, TBK1,
             C9ORF72, TARBP, CHMPB2, or VCP genes (FTLD causative gene mutations not associated
             with underlying tau pathology).
