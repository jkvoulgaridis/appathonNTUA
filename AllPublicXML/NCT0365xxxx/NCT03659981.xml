  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study is an opportunity to assess grey matter damage at the earliest phase of
      Multiple Sclerosis (MS) allowing to a better understanding of its origins and its impact and
      disease severity. This study is a preliminary longitudinal study to precisely depict the
      kinetic of grey matter damage and the links with disease aggravation. Thirty MS patients
      without time and spatial dissemination criteria (only one symptomatic MRI lesion detected)
      but with oligoclonal bands detected on cerebro spinal fluid analysis will be included for a
      monocentric transversal MRI study at 7T to assess grey matter injury. Clinical and
      neuropsychological assessments will be performed in the population the same day of a
      multi-parametric MRI. A longitudinal clinical and MRI follow up will be performed during 2
      years.
