    <textblock>
      Orthodontic treatment is a long treatment that requires the cooperation of the patient. If
      the duration of treatment becomes greater than expected the patient 's participation is
      reduced. Beside that, the prolonged orthodontic treatment increases the risc of caries,
      periodontal problems and resorption. There were developed many different techniques that can
      shorten the treatment time until nowadays. Especially periodontal surgical assisted
      orthodontic treatment , has gained special interest among orthodontists due to its beneficial
      results. For this reason, the micro-osteoperforation method's effect will be evaluated in one
      of the most important phases of the treatment such as the leveling phase aiming the
      shortening of treatment time.

      Forty patients with maxillary and mandibular arch discrepancy and have not under gone
      orthodontic treatment before will be included in this research. After the patients will be
      informed about the study they will be requested to sign the consent form. As the first phase
      of the study the appointment for orthodontic records will be given to the patient. At the
      beginning of the treatment routine orthodontic records (photographs, dental models and
      radiographs) will be taken and the gingival pocket measurements will be made. In the
      beginning and at the and of the treatment long cone periapical radiographs will be taken in
      each patient in order to estimate the anterior lower root dimensions.

      The forty patients will be randomly divided in two groups. In the first group, 3 or 4
      micro-osteoperforations will be made in the parts of the gingiva nearby the discrepancy by
      perforating the keratinized or non-keratinized mucosa and reaching the alveolar bone under
      local anesthesia. In the further appointments the traditional aligning procedures will be
      used and controls will be made every 7-9 days. In the other group 20 patients will be treated
      in the traditional way and controls will be made each month. Every patient will be requested
      to answer questions related to treatment comfort and other problems like pain during the
      first week after each activation. In the pain scoring 'no pain- not resistable pain'
      information will be given a score from 0-to 10 as established by the visual analog scale
      method.

      The records will be repeated after the leveling phase. The measurements made on dental casts
      will give results about tooth movement rate. Linear and angular measurements will be made in
      radiographs and gingival thickness will be evaluated. The results taken from the two groups
      will be compared in base of tooth movement rate, gingival thickness, pain and patient
      comfort.
