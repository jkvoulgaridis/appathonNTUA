  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of the virtual reality based neurologic
      examination teaching tool(VRNET) for medical students. VRNET is a new teaching tool for
      neurologic examinations by offering different neurologic signs of the face, with which
      medical students can experience more realistic patients.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Neurologic physical exam(NPE) score</measure>
    <time_frame>after 2 weeks clinical clerkship rotation.</time_frame>
    <description>NPE score is consist of 6 neurologic examination parts; cranial nerve, motor, sensory, cerebellar function, gait. Each part has 1 points, so NPE score ranges from 0 to 6. NPE score of students is evaluated by neurologist viewing video clips which recorded during the last day of 2 weeks clerkship rotation.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Satisfaction of students for VRNET</measure>
    <time_frame>after 2 weeks clinical clerkship rotation.</time_frame>
    <description>Satisfaction of VRNET are evaluated by students' answer to the question below with Likert scale (0 to 5) after completion examination of standard patient.
&quot;I am satisfied with VRNET for neurologic examination training. 0 (not at all)---1----2----3-----4-----5 (very helpful)&quot;</description>

    <measure>Reality of VRNET by students</measure>
    <time_frame>after 2 weeks clinical clerkship rotation.</time_frame>
    <description>Reality of VRNET are evaluated by students' answer to the question below with Likert scale (0 to 5) after completion examination of standard patient.
&quot;VRNET is very realistic. 0 (not at all)---1----2----3-----4-----5 (very realistic)&quot;</description>

    <measure>Evaluation of students by standardized patients</measure>
    <time_frame>after 2 weeks clinical clerkship rotation.</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation of students by standard patients is also using Likert scale (0 to 5) based on the pre-made check lists.
&quot;How do you feel as a standard patient that the student did good job?&quot; 0 (not at all)---1----2----3-----4-----5 (very competent)</description>

    <description>In group of standard patients with VRNET, the medical students examine the standard patient of neurologic deficits. When they examine, they get some information of neurologic signs via the VRNET which presents neurologic deficits directly by alternating facial expressions. The students should interpret that signs to have a diagnosis.</description>
