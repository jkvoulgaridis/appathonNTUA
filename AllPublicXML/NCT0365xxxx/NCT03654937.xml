  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Seasonal influenza vaccination was used to assess whether induction of immunity as well as
      the rate of side effects is influenced by the timing of the last training session before
      vaccination. Healthy athletes were vaccinated with the tetravalent influenza vaccine and
      blood samples were collected before, 1, 2 and 26 weeks after vaccination. The athletes were
      randomly assigned to vaccination within 2 hours after the last training session (&quot;2h&quot;) vs.
      vaccination after a resting period of at least 26 hours (&quot;26h&quot;). All participants documented
      side effects and training restrictions. Influenza-specific T-cells were quantified after
      stimulation with the vaccine based on intracellular cytokine staining. Antibodies were
      quantified by ELISA and neutralisation assay.
