      Assessement of a new approach of an ultrasound guided brachial plexus blockade between the
      infraclavicular and axillary area.

    <textblock>
      After an assessement of this new approach of ultrasounded-guided brachial plexus blockade in
      cadavers, the aim of this human study was to asssess the validity of this method in humans.
      The probe will be disposed on the shoulder, and the brachial plexus will be seeked below the
      deltoid, lateral to the major pectoralis muscle and in the vicinity of the brachial artery.
      At this area, an ultrasounded guided needle was inserted with an in-plane direction towards
      the brachial artery and local anesthetics was disposed all around the artery, without
      puncturing the differents nerves. Regional blockade will be evaluated by measuring onset and
      duation time for sensitive and motor blockade, effectiveness of this blockade, patient's
      confort during the procedure, ease of the procedure for practitionner, quality of ultrasound
      image's interpretation before and after injection.
