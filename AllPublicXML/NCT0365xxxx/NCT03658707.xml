  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine the validity and reliability of the Turkish version of
      the Functional Shoulder Score in Turkish patients with subacromial impingement syndrome
      (SIS).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The original form of the Functional Shoulder Score will be translated into Turkish by two
      Turkish mother tongue translators who also speak English in advanced level. Then these
      translations will be combined into one translation and translated back to English. The
      pre-final version will be composed and tested on a group of patients with SIS. If necessary,
      readjustments will be made, and the validity of the final version will be investigated in 116
      patients with SIS. Additionally, for the test-retest reliability, 59 patients will fill out
      the questionnaire again after 3-7 days.
