  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the amount of energy that the heart will deliver to the central
      circulation and the efficiency of that energy transfer, in patients undergoing a coronary
      artery bypass graft operation. Measurements will be taken just after induction of anaesthesia
      and repeated just after the end of the operation. The total energy delivered by the heart
      will be calculated by multiplying a pressure curve from the artery in the hand with the
      instantaneous ultrasound recorded cardiac output flow curve. The energy responsible for the
      acceleration of the blood volume, known as oscillatory power will also be calculated. The
      energy transfer will be calculated using a mathematical model based upon other ultrasound and
      blood pressure recorded variables. We would like to see if any alteration in energy delivered
      is in part due to impairment in energy transfer or alteration of fraction of oscillatory
      power rather than a change in total energy production. We would also like to study if there
      are changes in the oscillatory power after cardiac bypass surgery. The patients will be
      sampled sequentially into the study. We are not aware of any such studies undertaken in
      humans previously.
