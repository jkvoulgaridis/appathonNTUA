  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present clinical trial will be conducted in order to compare the bioavailability of
      rivastigmine and to assess bioequivalence at steady-state of the Test product RID-TDS 9.5
      mg/24 h (Luye Pharma AG, Germany) and the marketed Reference product Exelon® 9.5 mg/24 h
      transdermales Pflaster (Novartis Pharma GmbH, Germany) after multiple patch application. Each
      of both treatments will last for 11 days with a washout period of 14 days between the
      treatments.
