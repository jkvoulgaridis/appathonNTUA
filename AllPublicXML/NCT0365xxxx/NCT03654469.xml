    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a major public health problem and is expected
      to become the 3rd leading cause of death globally by 2020.

      The main risk factor is tobacco. Tobacco poisoning is found in 80 to 90% of patients with
      COPD. However, non-smoking COPD is also described, with increasing prevalence figures,
      particularly related to occupational exposure, especially among farmers.

      A prospective screening study based on questionnaires and electronic mini-spirometry (Néo-6®)
      that includes a representative sample of dairy farmers from the departments of Morbihan and
      Île-et-Vilaine in Brittany.

      The dairy farmers had an occupational medicine appointment and, if they demonstrated at least
      one marker of possible bronchial obstruction (chronic cough, chronic bronchitis, dyspnoea,
      wheezing, spirometry), they were referred to a pulmonologist.
