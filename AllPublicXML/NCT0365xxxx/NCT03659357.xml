      Purpose: To compare the accuracies of computed tomographic (CT) enterography and magnetic
      resonance (MR) enterography for the detection and radiomics characterization of small-bowel
      tumors (including gastrointestinal stromal tumors, adenomas and lymphomas, etc); Hypothesis:
      MR enterography was noninferior to CT enterography for the diagnosis and evaluation of small
      bowel tumors in generally well-distended small bowel.

      The investigators will conduct a 36-month clinical trial, the specific process is as follows:

        1. Incorporate patients with the above criteria, communicate with the participants to make
           informed consent and sign informed consent;

        2. It is recommended that the attending physician issue the corresponding MRE checklist and
           the CTE checklist and make an appointment to check the same day to remind the patient to
           perform the corresponding bowel preparation work in advance, and perform renal function
           tests within 3 days before the examination;

        3. The enrolled patients were measured for height and weight, and the BMI was calculated.
           CTE and MRE were performed according to the results of balanced randomization. The MRE
           was performed on a 3.0T MRI scanner; the CTE examination was performed on a 320-row CT
           scanner, and the iodine-containing contrast agent was administered according to the
           patient's height and weight and GFR;

        4. Both examinations require an empty stomach preparation (more than 4 hours), and oral
           (1500ml) 2.5% mannitol aqueous solution before the examination to ensure intestinal
           filling, subcutaneous indwelling needle preparation, in order to save patient
           examination time, so the two examinations are completed within 6 hours, before the
           second inspection, you need to add 150-300ml of 2.5% mannitol aqueous solution;

        5. The images obtained were evaluated by two imaging physicians for lesions, numbers, size
           changes, density/signal values, and peripheral tissue lesions obtained by the two
           methods;

        6. After the patient has obtained a definitive diagnosis according to the routine medical
           procedure, the above imaging diagnosis results are compared with the confirmed diagnosis
           results.

        consecutive patients who were suspected of having small bowel tumors on the basis of
