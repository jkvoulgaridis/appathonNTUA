  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preterm birth refers to a delivery that occurs before 37 weeks of gestation. Identification
      of those who will eventually deliver in the preterm period is very important. However, few
      interventions have been proven to prolong pregnancy in women at risk such as cervicovaginal
      fetal fibronectin (fFN) level or transvaginal cervical length measurements. In a
      meta-analysis comparing fetal breathing with cervicovaginal fetal fibronectin (fFN) level or
      transvaginal cervical length measurements, absence of fetal breathing was superior to other
      methods for prediction of preterm birth in 48 hours or 7 days. In this study, the
      investigators hypothesized that if a fetus holds its breath in case of preterm birth, then
      there may be specific fetal breathing patterns during preterm labor, which may be detected by
      ultrasonography

    <textblock>
      Preterm birth refers to a delivery that occurs before 37 weeks of gestation and it is the
      leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. 33% of prenatal hospital admissions are
      due to preterm labor but almost 50% of patients receiving tocolytics in order to prevent
      birth deliver in the term period. Therefore, identification of those who will eventually
      deliver in the preterm period is very important. Ideally, identification of modifiable and
      nonmodifiable risk factors for preterm birth in will lead to interventions that help prevent
      this complication. However, few interventions have been proven to prolong pregnancy in women
      at risk such as cervicovaginal fetal fibronectin (fFN) level or transvaginal cervical length
      measurements. Another method for preterm birth prediction is presence of fetal breathing. In
      a meta-analysis comparing fetal breathing with cervicovaginal fetal fibronectin (fFN) level
      or transvaginal cervical length measurements, absence of fetal breathing was superior to
      other methods for prediction of preterm birth in 48 hours or 7 days. In this study, the
      investigators hypothesized that if a fetus holds its breath in case of preterm birth, then
      there may be specific fetal breathing patterns during preterm labor, which may be detected by
      ultrasonography
