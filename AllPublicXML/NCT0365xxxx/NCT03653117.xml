  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: With age a large group of men experience lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) due
      to benign prostatic obstruction (BPO). Standard treatment is a transurethral resection of the
      prostate or laser vaporization. As these techniques enter the prostate via the urethra, are
      invasive and require general or spinal anaesthesia. Transperineal laser ablation (TPLA) is a
      minimal invasive procedure, that can be performed under local anaesthesia.

      Objective: The primary objective of this study is to prove feasibility and safety of TPLA for
      LUTS due to BPO in healthy men.

      Secondary objectives: The secondary objectives are to determine functional voiding, erectile
      outcomes and changes on imaging.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is set up as a prospective, single centre, interventional pilot study.

      Eligible patients are diagnosed with LUTS due to BPO at the outpatient clinic of the
      department of Urology at the Academic Medical Center (AMC) and have an indication for
      surgical treatment. The investigators aim to include 20 patients.

      Eligible patients will be informed about this study by the urologist in the outpatient
      clinic. Information about the study will be provided both orally and in written form.

      The TPLA procedure is performed with the Echolaser X4 system. The system uses a diode laser
      source that operates at the 1064nm wavelength. The maximum energy delivered is 10 watts per
      laser source. The system works with the concept of thermoablation, resulting in coagulative
      necrosis of tissue. Two to four fibers are introduced in the prostate under untrasound
      vision. Ablation will be performed with 3 watts power per fibre and a total of 1200 - 1800 J
      will be delivered per fibre in 400 - 600 s.

      Follow-up will exist of four visits following surgery at 4 weeks, three, six and 12 months.
      The visits imply medical history, adverse event registration, physical examination (on
      indication) and uroflowmetry. Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are used to measure
      functional outcomes. Used PROMs are the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS),
      International Index of Erectile Function 15 (IIEF-15), Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and
      hematuria grading scale (HGS). In addition to this, imaging will exist of a contrast enhanced
      ultrasound (CEUS) at four weeks and 12 months.
