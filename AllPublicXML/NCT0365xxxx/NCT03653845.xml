  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary aldosteronism (PA) is one of the most common causes of endocrine and resistant
      hypertension. Current studies have shown that the activation of the
      renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and the increased sympathetic nerve activity in
      the central or local tissue are the key mechanisms of high blood pressure and its organ
      damages.

      The classical method for diagnosis of primary aldosteronism depends on the detection of
      peripheral venous blood aldosterone level, which is incapable of accurate positioning
      diagnosis. On the other hand, the current guidelines recommend that surgery and aldosterone
      receptor inhibitors were the only treatment for primary aldosteronism. However, only about
      35% of aldosterone tumors and a small part of unilateral adrenal hyperplasia can be treated
      by surgery. More than 60% of idiopathic aldosteronism and bilateral adrenal hyperplasia need
      long-term drug therapy. However, long-term aldosterone inhibitor treatment may also cause
      hyperkalemia, male breast hyperplasia, female hirsutism and other adverse reactions.

      Therefore, the investigators proposed that endovascular chemical partial ablation of the
      adrenal gland can lower the aldosterone level, reduce the blood pressure and recover the
      potassium metabolism balance. In order to confirm the above effects, the investigators
      conduct an open, prospective, positive controlled study in patients with primary
      aldosteronism patients (including aldosterone, idiopathic aldosteronism and adrenal
      hyperplasia). The effects on blood pressure, blood electrolytes, adrenal hormones, metabolic
      indexes, target organ damages were observed to explore the efficacy and safety of the
      endovascular ablation of the adrenal gland in the treatment of primary aldosteronism.
