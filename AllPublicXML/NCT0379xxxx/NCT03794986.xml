  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will conduct a randomized comparative effectiveness trial of peer-facilitated,
      online, 6-week group Motivational Interviewing (MI) vs. Motivational Interviewing (MI) with a
      trauma-informed Sexual and Gender Minority (SGM) affirmative care approach.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Through workshops and ongoing supervision/consultation, researchers will train MaleSurvivor
      peer leaders to competently deliver both versions of MI and conduct a randomized controlled
      trial comparing the two versions of MI to enhance treatment engagement in SGM male survivors
      with mental health problems. All SGM male survivors who meet inclusion criteria, including
      significant emotional distress, will complete pre-test measures and be randomized to 6-week
      MI delivered by peers in online groups or 6-week MI with trauma-informed, SGM affirmative
      care delivered by peers in online groups. Randomization will be counterbalanced by treatment
      status: treatment naive versus treatment-experienced (prior treatment but not within the past
      60 days).

    <description>This is a 20-item questionnaire that asks about experience and frequency of depressive symptoms over the past week. Possible range of scores is 0-60, with the higher scores indicating the presence of more symptomatology. A score of 16 or higher identifies those individuals who are at risk for major depression (which is equivalent to endorsing at least 6 out of 20 symptoms for depression. Researchers will be looking for scores to reduce to below 16, indicating a lack of criteria being met for major depressive disorder.</description>

    <description>PTSD Checklist for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) , DSM-5 (PCL-5; Weathers et al., 2013) is a 20-item instrument that corresponds to the current psychiatric diagnostic criteria for PTSD. Participants respond on a Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely). A provisional PTSD diagnosis can be made by treating each item rated as 2 (moderately) or higher as a symptom endorsed, then following the DSM-5 diagnostic rule which requires at least: 1 Criterion B item (Intrusion symptoms; questions 1-5), 1 Criterion C item (Avoidance symptoms; questions 6-7), 2 Criterion D items (Alternations in cognitions and mood; questions 8-14), 2 Criterion E items (Alterations in arousal and reactivity; questions 15-20). A PCL-5 cut-point of 33 appears to be a reasonable value to use for provisional PTSD diagnosis. Severity can be determined adding scores of each item together to determine a total score. The range is 0-80.</description>

    <description>Inventory of Psychosocial Functioning (IPF-B; Rodriguez, Holowka, &amp; Marx, 2012) is a brief 7-item scale that assesses functional impairment or quality of life related to trauma and PTSD. Questions assess for impairment in romantic relationships, family relationships, work, friendships and socializing, parenting, academic pursuits, and self-care. Higher scores indicate greater functional impairment. Respondents answer each item by using a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (&quot;never&quot;) to 7 (&quot;always&quot;).
