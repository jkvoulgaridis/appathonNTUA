    <textblock>
      In patients in progression after oxaliplatin and irinotecan, the study FOLFIRINOX 3 proposes
      to evaluate the interest of modifying the standard pattern of administration of the molecule
      of irinotecan in order to make it more efficient. In combination with other chemotherapy
      drugs (5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, folinic acid and bevacizumab), irinotecan will be
      administered at the beginning and end of each cycle of chemotherapy, whereas it is normally
      administered at one time in the regimen. standard of treatment.

      The hypothesis of this study is an increase in the objective response rate at 2 months of 10
      to 30% with a scheme by FOLFIRINOX3 - bevacizumab compared to an optimal treatment to date by
      FOLFIRINOX-bevacizumab.

      Primary objective

        -  Main objective of phase I: To evaluate the acute toxicity of treatment with FOLFIRINOX 3
           - bevacizumab

        -  Main objective of phase II: To evaluate the efficacy of treatment with FOLFIRINOX 3 -
           bevacizumab in terms of objective response according to the RECIST criteria.

      Secondary objectives

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of treatment with FOLFIRINOX 3 - bevacizumab in terms of
           objective response according to the criteria of CHOI, progression-free survival (PFS)
           and overall survival (OS)

        -  To evaluate the late toxicity of treatment with FOLFIRINOX 3 - bevacizumab

        -  Evaluate the quality of life

    <description>In phase 1, the goal is to define the DLT (maximum tolerated dose). 3 levels of doses will be evaluated with a different dose of irinotecan in each level.
Level -1: Bevacizumab + Oxaliplatine + Acide folinique + Irinotecan: 60mg / m2
Level 0: Bevacizumab + Oxaliplatine + Acide folinique +Irinotecan: 70mg / m2
Level 1: Bevacizumab + Oxaliplatine + Acide folinique +Irinotecan: 90mg / m2
The inclusion of patients will start at level 0. Dose-limiting toxicities will be identified during the first 2 cycles.</description>
