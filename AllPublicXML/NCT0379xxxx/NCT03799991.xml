  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nearly 2 out of 3 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) experience problems with balance and
      mobility, which places such patients at increased risk of falling. The vestibular (inner ear
      balance) system plays an important role in balance stability, and vestibular therapy (VT) is
      well-known to improve balance function in healthy older adults. In this study, the
      investigators will conduct a first-in-kind randomized clinical trial to evaluate whether
      vestibular therapy improves reduces falls in patients with AD, in whom this treatment has
      never been studied.

    <description>The active control regimen consists of eye movement exercises (e.g. smooth pursuit eye movements) and also general conditioning exercises (e.g. range of motion exercises, lifting light weights with the arms and legs). This regimen is &quot;vestibular neutral&quot; in that head movements which specifically challenge the vestibular system are avoided.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of AD based on the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer Association 2011
             criteria that is mild-moderate (CDR=0.5-2).

          -  Age ≥ 60 years.

          -  Vestibular loss defined as bilaterally impaired vestibular responses (semicircular
             canal or otolith responses).

          -  Able to participate in study procedures including vestibular physiologic testing,
             balance and gait assessment, neurocognitive testing, and VT or active control.

          -  Able to give informed consent, as further detailed in the Human Subjects section. The
             investigators anticipate that individuals who are too impaired to provide informed
             consent would also not be able to effectively participate in VT or active control.

          -  Presence of a caregiver, defined as an individual who spends at least 10 hours per
             week with the patient. The caregiver must be able to participate in study procedures,
             specifically the text-messaging system. Both the VT and active control involve 8 weeks
             of once weekly visits and daily home exercises, and the investigators believe a
             caregiver would increase the likelihood of successful completion of either therapy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of severe AD (CDR≥3).

          -  Diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment or diagnosis of non-AD dementia, for example
             Parkinson's disease dementia, Dementia with Lewy Bodies, vascular dementia,
             fronto-temporal dementia, and primary progressive aphasia.

          -  Deemed unable to participate in study procedures and VT or active control, (e.g.
             patients with significant medical comorbidities, excessive agitation, or use of
             mobility aids such as a cane or walker.)

          -  Use of daily vestibular suppressant medications, specifically anti-histamines and
             benzodiazepines, as this can alter the response to VT.

          -  Lack of availability to participate in 8 weeks of VT or active control.
