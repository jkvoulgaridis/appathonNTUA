  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot randomised control trial to assess the safety, compliance, and acceptability
      of delivering a 6-week programme of remote ischaemic conditioning (RIC) to stroke patients
      suffering with fatigue, and study feasibility. A minimum of 34 patients who have suffered an
      ischeamic or haemorrhagic stroke and who suffer from fatigue, will be recruited and
      randomised to receive a 6-week programme of either RIC or a sham intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 75% of stroke patients suffer from fatigue, the effect of which can be physical,
      cognitive or emotional, and presents a large barrier to progressing rehabilitation.

      Remote ischaemic conditioning (RIC) is a procedure whereby ischaemia is induced to a limb for
      short periods of time by inflating pressure cuffs around arms or legs to above systolic
      pressures (mmHg). This procedure is performed for periods that avoid physical injury to the
      limbs, but induce neurohormonal, systemic or vascular changes in the body. Such changes often
      result in improved collateralisation of blood supply to various areas of the body, as well as
      improved efficiencies of cellular metabolism. This may enhance the physical abilities of
      patients undergoing rehabilitation after stroke, particularly when aiming to improve
      endurance and fatigue.

    <measure>Mean change from baseline in minutes of activity per day measured by the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ) measures physical activity levels from 3 domains: Activity at work, Travel to and from places, Recreational activities, as well as sedentary behaviour, in 16 questions, P1-P16. To analyse GPAQ data, metabolic equivalents (METs) are used to express the intensity of physical activities. MET is the ratio of a person's working relative to resting metabolic rate. Higher MET values indicate more intense activity. MET values are applied to time variables according to the intensity of the activity, 4 METS for time spent in moderate activities and 8 METS for vigorous activities. Mean/median time of physical activity on average per day is calculated by summing MET scores for all domains to calculate average activity per week, and dividing this score by 7 (p1t3+p4t6+p7t9+p10t12+p13t15)/7). The questionnaire will be completed at baseline and after 6 week intervention.</description>

    <measure>Mean change from baseline in health related quality of life as measured by participant scores on EQ5D questionnaire.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Health Related Quality of Life will be measured by the EQ5D questionnaire at baseline and after 6 week intervention. The descriptive system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. The EQ VAS records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale. This can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome that reflects the patient's own judgement. The scores on these five dimensions can be presented as a health profile or can be converted to a single summary index number (utility) reflecting preferability compared to other health profiles.</description>
