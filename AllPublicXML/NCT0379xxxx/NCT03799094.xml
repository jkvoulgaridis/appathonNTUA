  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial was to explore whether intravenous vitamin C can prolong resistance time of
      Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor(TKI) on lung adenocarcinoma patients with Epidermal Growth Factor
      Receptor(EGFR) mutations, and can benefit NSCLC patients.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The effects of vitamin C in combination with tyrosine kinase inhibitor on tumor size, tumor
      markers, inflammatory factor levels, quality of life, duration of resistance,
      progression-free survival, and overall survival time were evaluated.

      This trial is a low risk treatment, and has developed the appropriate safety measures and
      contingency plans to ensure patients' safety in the whole process.

      Patients will be followed up after the end of the trial, and follow-up observations will be
      performed every month during the first year. Followed every 3 months in the second year for 3
      years.
