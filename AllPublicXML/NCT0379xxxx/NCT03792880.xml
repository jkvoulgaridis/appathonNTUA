  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial compares the usual follow-up to a program of telematic control and
      self-management in a group of patients with severe obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome
      (OSAHS), few symptoms and treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). The
      objective of the intervention is to achieve a CPAP compliance of ≥4 hours per day in at least
      90% of the subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low CPAP compliance in OSAHS could mean that its possible cardiovascular benefits are not
      achieved. Telemedicine can be an effective tool to increase CPAP compliance with low cost.

      The researchers propose to carry out a randomized study about patients with severe OSAHS and
      few symptoms, who are expected to have low CPAP compliance.

      The main objective is to evaluate if a telematic control and self-management program can
      increase the compliance with CPAP treatment compared to conventional follow-up, getting at
      least 90% of patients to use CPAP ≥ 4 hours per day.

      Sixty patients from the Pneumology departments of two hospitals, diagnosed with severe OSAHS
      and with few symptoms (Epworth Sleepiness Scale ≤10) will be randomized to two follow-up
      groups, telematic and conventional, for 6 months. Patients in the intervention group
      (telematic monitoring) will collect variables related to symptoms of sleep apnea and side
      effects of CPAP treatment, using their own smartphone or a tablet provided during the study
      if they prefer. Other variables as the hours per day of CPAP use, leaks and residual
      apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) will be transmitted daily and automatically from latest generation
      CPAP. All information will be processed and each variable will generate alarms and
      instructions for each patient, allowing the self-management and an early solution of the
      possible problems related to the treatment. Alarms may also be generated in the database if
      the professional intervention is necessary.

      In addition, before starting CPAP treatment and after six months of treatment, patients will
      be monitored during a week with a watch-like device. Variables related to circadian rhythm
      will be collected and analyzed to know the effect of CPAP treatment in both groups (control
      and intervention groups).

    <measure>Efficacy of the treatment according to the change in sleepiness</measure>
    <time_frame>Six months</time_frame>
    <description>To compare the efficacy of the treatment using the change of the Epworth Sleepiness Scale score in both arms and between them.
This scale is a self-administered questionnaire and patients must rate their usual chances of dozing off or falling asleep while engaged in eight different daily activities. The possible answers for each situation and their scores are: 0 = would never doze; 1 = slight chance of dozing; 2 = moderate chance of dozing; 3= high chance of dozing. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale score is the sum of these 8 items scores and it can be interpreted as follows: 0-5 = lower normal daytime sleepiness; 6-10 = higher normal daytime sleepiness; 11-12 = mild excessive daytime sleepiness; 13-15 = moderate excessive daytime sleepiness; 16-24 = severe excessive daytime sleepiness.</description>

    <time_frame>Six months</time_frame>
    <description>To compare the change of quality of life before and after the follow-up in both arms and between them, using the change in the EuroQol-5 dimensions-3 levels questionnaire. This is a standardised measure of health status that comprises a descriptive system and a visual analogue scale. The first comprises 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 3 levels: 1 = no problems; 2 = some or moderate problems; 3 = extreme problems. The health state is defined by combining one level from each dimension (5 digit code). This descriptive system is converted into a single index value facilitating comparisons and the calculation of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The visual analogue scale records the respondent's self-rated health on a 20 centimeters vertical, visual analogue scale with endpoints labeled as: 100 = the best health you can imagine and 0. = the worst health you can imagine.</description>

EuroQol-5 dimensions-3 levels descriptive system is a standardised measure of health status that comprises 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 3 levels: 1 = no problems; 2 = some or moderate problems; 3 = extreme problems. The respondent have to indicate his/her health state according to the most appropiate statement in each dimension. The health state is defined by combining one level from each of the 5 dimensions (5 digit code) and then, this descriptive system is converted into a single index value facilitating comparisons and the calculation of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs).</description>

Patients can download this application on their own smartphone but, if they prefer, they can be provided with a tablet during the study with this application installed.
A set of variables will be collected using an automatic and wireless transmission from latest generation CPAP to control the CPAP compliance and tolerance.
