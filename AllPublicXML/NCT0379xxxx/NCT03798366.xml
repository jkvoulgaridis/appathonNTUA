    <textblock>
      The main purpose of the study is to see if GLPG1690 helps (together with the standard of care
      treatment) in the treatment of the skin and other areas affected by systemic sclerosis.

      Another aim is to find out how safe/well tolerated GLPG1690 will be and whether there are any
      side effects. The study will also look at other things, including whether the study drug
      affects disease progression and also if it changes any aspect of the quality of life.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Able and willing to comply with the protocol requirements and to sign the informed
             consent form (ICF) as approved by the Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)/Institutional
             Review Board (IRB), prior to any screening evaluations.

          -  Male and female subjects ≥18 years at the time of consent who meet the American
             College of Rheumatology (ACR)/EULAR 2013 diagnostic criteria for systemic sclerosis
             with diffuse cutaneous involvement (according to LeRoy's criteria) and ≤5 years since
             the onset of the first systemic sclerosis manifestation other than Raynaud's
             phenomenon.

          -  mRSS &gt;10 at screening.

          -  Active disease at screening, as defined by: Worsening of skin thickening (≥2 mRSS
             points) as assessed by mRSS measured at screening versus a previous mRSS assessment
             made within 6 months prior to screening, or new areas of skin involvement within 6
             months prior to screening as documented by physician note, or new-onset systemic
             sclerosis with symptoms or signs other than Raynaud's phenomenon within 2 years prior
             to screening, or ≥1 tendon friction rub (palpated in the finger flexors or extensors,
             wrist flexors or extensors, olecranon bursa, shoulders, knees, anterior or posterior
             ankles with active motion).

          -  Subject must be able and willing to comply with restrictions on prior and concomitant
             medication as described in the protocol

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at
             screening and a negative urine pregnancy test at the baseline visit.

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential or male subjects with female partners of
             childbearing potential must be willing to comply with the contraceptive methods
             described in the protocol prior to the first dose of the investigational medicinal
             product (IMP), during the clinical study, and for at least 90 days after the last dose
             of the IMP for male subjects and 30 days after the last dose of the IMP for female
             subjects.

          -  A body mass index (BMI) between 18-35 kg/m2, inclusive, at screening.

             history, physical examination, vital signs, 12-lead ECG, and fasting clinical
             laboratory safety tests. Clinical laboratory safety test results must be within the
             reference ranges or test results that are outside the reference ranges need to be
             considered non-clinically significant in the opinion of the investigator.

             hepatitis A at least 3 months prior to screening can be screened.

          -  History of malignancy within the past 5 years (except for carcinoma in situ of the
             uterine cervix, basal cell carcinoma of the skin that has been treated with no
             evidence of recurrence, prostate cancer medically managed through active surveillance
             or watchful waiting, and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin if fully resected and
             ductal carcinoma in situ).

             ECG at screening of either rhythm or conduction, QT interval corrected for heart rate
             using Fridericia's formula (QTcF) &gt;450 ms, or a known long QT syndrome.

          -  Unstable cardiovascular, pulmonary, or other disease (other than systemic
             sclerosis-related), in the opinion of the investigator, within 6 months prior to the

             hospitalization or systemic treatment within 4 weeks prior to the baseline visit).

          -  Abnormal liver function test (LFT) at screening, defined as aspartate aminotransferase
             (AST), and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and/or bilirubin, and/or alkaline
             phosphatase &gt;2x upper limit of normal (ULN). Retesting is allowed once.
