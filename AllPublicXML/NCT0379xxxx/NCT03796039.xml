  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is currently unknown if reducing sitting time, an activity that is highly prevalent in
      frail older adults living in long term care (LTC) facilities, is associated with an
      improvement in physical capacity such as walking speed. Simple tasks such as walking speed is
      associated with important outcomes for residents in LTC such as autonomy and hospitalization.
      The investigators hypothesize that standing an additional 100 minutes per week for 5 months
      will result in a clinically meaningful improvement in walking speed (0.1m/sec) in LTC
      residents compared to residents receiving a sitting social activity.

      LTC facilities from Moncton and Fredericton will be recruited, with half of the LTC
      facilities randomized as the intervention and half as the control group. The investigators
      are aiming to enrol half of the LTC in Fredericton and half in Moncton. A total of 88
      residents (44 in the control group, 44 in the intervention group) will be enrolled in the
      program.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Resident at one of the selected LTC facilities;

          -  Able to provide consent or have a power of attorney agree on behalf of a resident to
             participate in the study;

          -  Able to walk for ten meters, with or without a walking aid; The main outcome is
             walking speed performed for a distance of 10 meters. Therefore, we want everyone who
             participates in the study to be able to complete the test at baseline. This way we can
             answer the main research question, while adhering to our sample size calculation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  If Identified by staff at the facility as too high risk for falling by participating
             in the intervention.
