    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of combination therapy with
      pembrolizumab (MK-3475) and lenvatinib (E7080/MK-7902) in participants with triple negative
      breast cancer (TNBC), ovarian cancer, gastric cancer, colorectal cancer (CRC), glioblastoma
      (GBM), or biliary tract cancers (BTC). Participants will be enrolled into initial
      tumor-specific cohorts which will be expanded if adequate efficacy is determined.
