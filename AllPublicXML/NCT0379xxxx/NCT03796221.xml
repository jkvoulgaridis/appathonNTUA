  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if educational videos about how to help children develop
      healthy behaviors, paired with treatment in a pediatric obesity clinic, can increase
      caregiver confidence and improve child behaviors and weight. Caregivers of children between
      the ages of 4 and 11 years old who are new patients to a pediatric obesity clinic will be
      invited to take part in the study. All families will receive the standard treatment provided
      in the pediatric obesity clinic. Half of the caregivers will be assigned to also watch a few
      educational videos every month for 3 months in between clinic visits.
