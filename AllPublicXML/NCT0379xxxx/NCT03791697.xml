  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled trial that will evaluate whether telephone two-week postoperative
      follow up visits are an acceptable and safe alternative to traditional face-to-face-clinic
      two-week postoperative visits.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a two group, parallel randomized non-inferiority clinical trial at one institution
      evaluating telephone postoperative visits as non-inferior in patient satisfaction, patient
      preference, and patient safety, when compared with clinic postoperative visits. This protocol
      was written in accordance with CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials)
      guidelines 2011.

    <intervention_model_description>Eligible patients will be randomized to Arm1 or Arm2 (Telephone follow up or clinic follow up). Permuted block randomization with randomly varying block sizes will be used. Generation of allocation sequences will be performed using a random-number table.
The allocation sequence will be generated by our statistician who is neither responsible for patient recruitment or outcome assessment. Sequentially numbered opaque sealed envelopes will be used for concealment of treatment allocation.
It is not possible to mask clinical staff or participants, as they will be aware of the follow-up care that is being delivered over the telephone or in clinic. As such this is not a blinded study.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The patient randomized into the telephone follow up group, will be contacted, at the pre-scheduled date and time, by the urogynecology clinic nurse. The nurse will utilize a scripted series of postoperative questions, which are consistent with questions asked during our standard postoperative clinic visits.
Vital signs and physical examination will be deferred for the patients in the telephone follow up group.
Any patient responses that are not consistent with a usual postoperative course will be escalated to an in person visit. However, these patients will remain in the group, to which they were originally randomized, for research analysis purposes.</description>

    <description>For the patient randomized into the clinic group, the clinic visit will entail questions about common postoperative complications (including fever, nausea/vomiting, pain, urinary symptoms, constipation, etc.). As per usual, vital signs and a focused physical examination will be completed at the clinic visit. All clinic visits will be performed by an FPRMS fellow and/or attending physician</description>
