  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, Phase 2 Long-Term, Open Label Extension (OLE) Study to assess the
      safety and tolerability of PB1046 at an optimally titrated dose. This is a Long-Term, Open
      label Extension (OLE) Study for subjects with (PAH), having participated in double-blind
      Study PB1046-PT-CL-0004. The study will include adult subjects previously diagnosed with
      symptomatic PAH, who are receiving background clinician-directed therapy for PAH.

      During this period, subjects will continue to be followed for safety and tolerability, as
      well as for periodic efficacy, quality of life data and immunogenicity. The study will
      continue per the schedule of events until such time when PB1046 is able to be
      self-administered, becomes commercially available to the subjects in a particular country or
      region, or the sponsor terminates the study due to lack of efficacy, safety or other reasons.

      Subjects entering this study will enter from the double-blind Study PB1046-PT-CL-0004. The
      starting dose level of PB1046 for all subjects in this parent study was a sub-therapeutic or
      minimally effective dose (MED) of 0.2 mg/kg, administered by SC injection.

      Subjects were randomized into the MED) Group or a dose-titration group. In the dose-titration
      group, individual subjects were titrated up to their maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in a
      blinded fashion, with the objective of titrating subjects up to a dose of at least 1.2 mg/kg
      or higher in the MTD Group, while subjects in the MED Group remained at the MED level of 0.2
      mg/kg, and underwent &quot;sham dose-titration&quot; to maintain the blind.

      Subjects entering the 0006 trial prior to implementation of this protocol amendment will
      remain blinded until such time that open label dosing will not unblind the 0004 study.

             90 days, or a planned surgical procedure during the study period; which would impact
             participation in PB1046-PT-CL-0006.

          -  Other new medical or psychiatric conditions which, in the opinion of the Investigator,
             would place the subject at increased risk, would preclude obtaining voluntary consent,
             or would confound the objectives of the study;

          -  Known hypersensitivity to study drug or any of the excipients of the drug formulation.
