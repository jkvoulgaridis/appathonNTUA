  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates if the application of resistive capacitive monopolar radiofrequency
      therapy associated with physiotherapeutic techniques and pain education provides benefits
      with respect to physiotherapy and pain education techniques alone in the management of
      patients with chronic pelvic pain.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is evident that physiotherapeutic techniques and pain education are a first-line treatment
      for patients suffering from chronic pelvic pain. But there is no scientific evidence that
      resistive capacitive monopolar radiofrequency can be another treatment option for these
      patients, although at the clinical level there is evidence of its beneficial effects.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Efficacy of resistive capacitive monopolar radiofrequency in the modification of the perception of pain</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The objective is to assess if there is a change in the perception of pain intensity according to VAS (Visual Analog Scale). Compare baseline and at the end of the intervention.
The Visual Analog Scale is a validated questionnaire that scores between 0 and 10 the perception of pain that the patient has. In a line of 10 cm the patient will mark his intensity of the pain taking into account that 0 means &quot;I have no pain&quot; and 10 means &quot;I have an unbearable pain&quot;.
The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) suitably collects the pain intensity perceived by the patient and allows to assess the severity of the disease, as well as the improvement obtained with the treatment.</description>

    <time_frame>baseline, 5 and 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Asess the perceived quality of life of patients in the study according to the SF-12 questionnaire.
The Short-Form 12 Health Survey was designed in 1994 with the aim that, through the self-completion of a brief questionnaire, the perception of physical and mental quality of life could be objectified in a simpler way than the original questionnaire SF -36. This simple questionnaire of 12 items representing the 8 dimensions of health was originally developed in English. It is a questionnaire that has proven to be valid and reliable to be used in clinical practice as an instrument to assess the quality of life. The 8 dimensions are the physical function (2 items), physical role (2 items), body pain (1 item), general health (1 item), vitality (1 item), social function (1 item), emotional role (2) items) and mental health (2 items). The result is two variables (physical and mental) that value quality in these two aspects.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assess kinesiophobia</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 5 and 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Asess the kinesiophobia suffered by patients in the study according to the TSK-11 (Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia) questionnaire.
The Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia (TSK-11), validated in Spanish, adequately captures the patient's movement capacity taking into account the perceived pain intensity in 11 questions. It is a tool that allows assessing the severity of the disease, as well as the improvement that is obtained with the treatment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assess catastrophism</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 5 and 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Asess the catastrophism suffered by patients in the study according to the Catastrophism scale.
The Catastrophism Scale, also validated in Spanish, allows us to assess the catastrophic intensity of the disease, a more psychological aspect, but also very relevant in this chronic and disabling pathology. It is a tool that allows assessing the severity of the disease, as well as the improvement that is obtained with the treatment. It is a questionnaire of 20 questions.</description>

    <description>Application of the technique in the intervention group (activated resistive capacitive monopolar radiofrequency therapy): The intervention group will receive the treatment with activated resistive capacitive monopolar radiofrequency system, with the resistive electrode at the minimum intensity, together with the techniques of conventional physiotherapy treatment (trigger point treatment and myofascial techniques according to the location of pain) and pain education.
The patient will be stretched on the stretcher and the session will last 45 minutes, once a week, for 10 sessions. Ass baseline, after half therapy and after 10 weeks therapy.</description>
