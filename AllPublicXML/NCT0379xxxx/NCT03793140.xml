          -  Measurable disease as defined RECIL criteria (2017) or isolated bone marrow
             involvement.

          -  Patients must have fully recovered from the acute, non-hematological, non-infectious
             toxicities of any prior treatment with anti-cancer drugs, radiotherapy or other
             anti-cancer modalities. Patients with persistent, non-hematologic, non-infectious
             toxicities from prior treatment must have documented resolution to ≤ Grade 2.

          -  Patients must have, or be willing and eligible to undergo placement of, a working
             central venous access device

          -  Venous access available (e.g., portacath, PICC line or equivalent).

          -  Laboratory values obtained ≤ 2 weeks prior to enrollment must demonstrate adequate
             hepatic function, renal function, and coagulation as defined below:

               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST/SGOT) ≤ 5x upper normal limit (ULN)

               -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT/SGPT) ≤ 5x ULN

               -  Total bilirubin ≤1.5x ULN (unless related to hemolysis or Gilbert's syndrome, or
                  involvement by lymphoma; if involvement by lymphoma: total bilirubin &lt;/= 3.0 x
                  ULN)

               -  Creatinine clearance &gt;=40cc min either by 24-hour creatinine clearance or
                  calculated from the modified Cockcroft-Gault equation (with the use of ideal body
                  mass [IBM] instead of mass): CRCL =(140−Age) × IBM (kg) × [0.85 if female]/[(72 •
                  serum creatinine (mg/dL)]

               -  International Normalized Ratio (INR) must be &lt;1.5. Due to the occurrence of
                  thrombocytopenia, patients should not enter with coagulopathy. Patients on
                  anticoagulants should be on short-acting therapy (e.g. low molecular weight
                  heparin) rather than oral anticoagulants.

               -  Albumin ≥2.0 g/dL (or ≥20 g/L)

          -  Women of child-bearing potential (i.e., women who are pre-menopausal or not surgically
             sterile) must use accepted contraceptive methods (abstinence, intrauterine device
             [IUD], oral contraceptive or double barrier device) during the study and must have a
             negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 2 weeks prior to treatment initiation.

          -  Females must agree to abstain from breastfeeding during study participation

          -  Fertile men must practice effective contraceptive methods during the study unless
             documentation of infertility exists.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients that have received a chemotherapy regimen with stem cell support in the
             previous 2 months.

          -  Any medical condition that is clinically unstable despite present therapy (i.e.
             uncontrolled infection).

          -  Platelets &lt; 50,000/mm3 unless attributable to marrow based (either Burkitt lymphoma or
             DHL/THL.) Note: Patients with leukemia/lymphoma in the marrow 25,000-50,000 will be
             assessed for grade 4 thrombocytopenia unless they have platelet recovery above grade
             3. Patients entering with platelets &lt;25,000 will only be assessed for thrombocytopenia
             related to drug if they recover to grade 3 or higher.

          -  Serious medical illness, such as significant cardiac disease (e.g. symptomatic
             congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, coronary artery disease,
             myocardial infarction within the past 3 months, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia,
             pericardial disease or New York Heart Association Class III or IV), or severe
             debilitating pulmonary disease, that would potentially increase patient's risk for
             toxicity.

          -  Patients with active central nervous system (CNS) parenchymal disease. Patients with
             leptomeningeal disease are allowed as long as the CSF has cleared for more than 4
             weeks and the patient is receiving maintenance intrathecal/intra Ommaya therapy.

          -  Any active uncontrolled bleeding or bleeding diathesis (e.g., active peptic ulcer
             disease).

          -  Any condition or abnormality which may, in the opinion of the investigator, compromise
             his or her safety.

          -  HIV patients with any of the following: a) uncontrolled HIV infection defined as an
             HIV viral load &gt; 100K copies/mL, b) a documented opportunistic infection within the
             last 90 days, c) concurrent HIV therapy with zidovudine or any strong CYP3A4 inhibitor
             (e.g. ritonavir or cobicistat) within 7 days of study drug due to potential drug-drug
             interaction.

          -  Patients who have received radiotherapy, surgery, treatment with cytotoxic agents,
             treatment with biologic agents, immunotherapy , or any other anti-cancer therapy for
             any kind for cancer, or any other investigational agent for any indication, within the
             past 2 weeks prior to initiation of CPI-613 treatment with the exclusion of radiation
             to one area (e.g. whole brain or involved nodal site) that does not interfere with
             response assessment in other sites. A course of steroids (up to 14 days total) prior
             to study initiation is acceptable.

          -  Psychiatric illness or social situation that would limit the patient's ability to
             tolerate and/or comply with study requirements.

          -  Prior allogeneic stem cell transplant within 2 months of study start

               1. Patients with active graft-versus-host-disease are not eligible

               2. Patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy for prevention of graft-versus-host
                  disease are not eligible
