    <textblock>
      The aim of the PreLiFe RCT is to assess the effects of a new mobile preconception lifestyle
      programme (PreLiFE-programme) for couples undergoing IVF. Couples about to start IVF will be
      randomized between an attention control programme or the PreLiFe-programme for 12 months or
      until an ongoing pregnancy is confirmed by ultrasound.This study will examine whether the
      PreLiFe-programme results in a higher cumulative ongoing pregnancy rate within 12 months as
      compared to an attention control programme. Secondary outcomes include changes in diet,
      physical activity, personal wellbeing, body mass index, waist circumference, quality of life
      and other reproductive outcomes including clinical pregnancy and time to pregnancy.
      Additionally, the partners' support and the feasibility of the PreLiFe-programme will be
      evaluated.

  <detailed_description>

      Introduction: Infertility and in vitro fertilization (IVF; with or without intracytoplasmic
      sperm injection, ICSI) result in considerate emotional and financial burden. Increasing
      evidence suggests that lifestyle factors, including diet, physical activity and personal
      wellbeing, are associated with IVF-success rates. So far, IVF is not routinely combined with
      a lifestyle programme. The PreLiFe randomized controlled trial (RCT) will assess the effects
      of a new mobile preconception lifestyle programme (PreLiFe-programme) in couples undergoing
      IVF.

      Methods and analysis: A multicentre RCT will include heterosexual couples about to start IVF
      (with or without ICSI) in Belgian fertility clinics. IVF-Couples will be randomized between
      an attention control programme or the PreLiFe-programme for 12 months or until an ongoing
      pregnancy is confirmed by ultrasound. The attention control programme includes a mobile
      application with treatment information (i.e. appointments and medication instructions) in
      addition to standard care. The PreLiFe-programme includes a mobile application with the same
      treatment information in combination with a lifestyle programme. This new lifestyle programme
      includes tailored advice on diet and physical activity and mindfulness exercises in
      combination with text messages and telephone interaction with a lifestyle coach. The primary
      outcome of this RCT is the cumulative ongoing pregnancy rate within 12 months after
      randomisation. Secondary outcomes include changes in diet, physical activity, personal
      wellbeing, body mass index, waist circumference and quality of life measured with
      self-reported questionnaires and physical assessments and changes in other reproductive
      outcomes including clinical pregnancy and time to pregnancy. Additionally, the partners'
      support and the feasibility (use and acceptability) of the PreLiFe-programme will be
      evaluated using self-reported questionnaires and app-based tracking. Analysis will be
      according to intention to treat.

      Ethics and dissemination: This study has been approved by the Medical Ethical Committee of
      the Leuven University Hospital (Belgium) and of the other recruiting clinics. The findings of
      this RCT will be disseminated through presentations at international scientific meetings and
      peer-reviewed publications.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Cumulative ongoing pregnancy rate (COPR) within 12 months after randomisation</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Ongoing pregnancy is defined as a viable intrauterine pregnancy of at least 12 weeks duration confirmed on ultrasound scan. All pregnancies (Spontaneous and IVF pregnancies) conceived within these 12 months are followed up until the 12 weeks ultrasound scan. IVF-discontinuation is described as couples undergoing IVF who do not return for a further IVF cycle in our fertility centres after the failure of a previous cycle. Ongoing pregnancy within 12 months after randomisation is counted as a positive event, whereas IVF discontinuation and absence of pregnancy are counted as a negative event. Differences in COPR will be evaluated between the intervention and attention control group.</description>

    <measure>Changes in diet assessed with a Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months after randomisation</time_frame>
    <description>A validated food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) is used to evaluate changes in dietary pattern and diet quality over time and to evaluate differences in the dietary pattern and diet quality between the intervention and attention control group. The FFQ consists of a finite list of foods and beverages with response categories to indicate usual frequency and portion size of consumption over the last month. Diet quality is calculated from the FFQ by assessing quality, balance and variety of foods and beverages consumed (score 0-100 with the higher the better diet quality). Diet quality is an index to reflect compliance with the Belgian Food Based Dietary Guidelines.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in physical activity assessed with the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months after randomisation</time_frame>
    <description>The International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form (IPAQ-SF) is used to evaluate changes in physical activity over time and to evaluate differences in physical activity between the intervention and attention control group. The IPAQ-SF assesses the duration (in minutes) and frequency (in days) of walking, moderate-intensity activities, vigorous-intensity activities and sedentary activity (sitting) based on metabolic equivalent (MET) values. Self-reported physical activity is classified as low, moderate or high physically active based on the global recommendations on physical activity for health of the World Health Organisation. The IPAQ-SF is a reliable and validated instrument for monitoring physical activity in population health surveillance systems.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in symptoms of emotional distress, anxiety and depression (personal wellbeing) assessed with the Depression, anxiety and stress scale (DASS-21)</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months after randomisation</time_frame>
    <description>The Depression, anxiety and stress scale (DASS-21) is used to evaluate changes in personal wellbeing over time and to evaluate differences in personal wellbeing between the intervention and attention control group. Self-reported symptoms of stress, anxiety and depression (together emotional distress) are measured with this validated scale (score 0-126 with the lower, the higher personal wellbeing).</description>

    <description>The standard care serving as control for this intervention is fertility treatment i.e. IVF with or without ICSI according to local protocols for infertility patients. This implies no guidance on lifestyle. However, to have attention control the control group will receive an attention control programme. The attention control programme includes a mobile application (app) with treatment information including medication instructions, reminders of injection of human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) and time of fertility treatment appointments for 12 months or until an ongoing pregnancy is confirmed by ultrasound.</description>
