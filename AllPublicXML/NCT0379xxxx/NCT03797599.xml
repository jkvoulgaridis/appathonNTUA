    <textblock>
      This study aims to examine whether greater length of mindfulness practice results in more
      beneficial outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will randomise participants to one of three groups: (1) four sessions of medium
      length mindfulness practice (lasting 20 mins) and 5 mins of an audio book; (2) four sessions
      of brief mindfulness practice (lasting 5 mins) and 20 mins of an audio book; and (3) a
      control group who just receive 4 sessions of audio book (lasting 25 mins). In the mindfulness
      arms, in each session, the participants will receive the audio book prior to the mindfulness
      practice. Mindfulness levels, and depression, anxiety and stress will be measured by
      self-report at baseline, session by session, and at post-intervention.

    <measure>Change from baseline at post-intervention (week 3) on the Five Factor Mindfulness Questionnaire -15 item version (FFMQ-15)</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-intervention (3 weeks after baseline).</time_frame>
    <description>The Five Factor Mindfulness Questionnaire -15 item version is a self-report measure of mindfulness, producing a total score between 15 and 75, with higher scores indicating greater levels of mindfulness. (Note that the observe subscale will be excluded from the calculation of the total score, as recommended in https://doi.org/10.1002/jclp.21865 and http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/pas0000263 producing a total score between 12 and 60).</description>

    <time_frame>Post-intervention (3 weeks after baseline).</time_frame>
    <description>The Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale - 21 is a self-report measure of depression, anxiety and stress, producing a total score between 0 and 63, with higher scores indicating greater symptomatology.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, session 2 (week 1), session 3 and 4 (week 2), and post-intervention (week 3).</time_frame>
    <description>The FFMQ-15 (described above) will be administered at the start of the first session (baseline), immediately after sessions 2 (week 1), 3 (week 2) and 4 (week 2), and at post-intervention (week 3), to examine patterns in changes in mindfulness over the course of the study.</description>

    <measure>Session 1 Toronto Mindfulness Scale (TMS).</measure>
    <time_frame>Session 1 (week 1).</time_frame>
    <description>The TMS is a 13-item self-report measure of state mindfulness that produces scores for curiosity and decentering. The curiosity score ranges from 0 to 24, the decentering score from 0 to 28, and the total score from 0 to 52, with higher scores indicating greater curiosity, decentering and overall state mindfulness respectively.</description>
