    <textblock>
      Raised intracranial pressure (ICP) is a common and life threatening condition especially in
      patients with traumatic brain injury.There are many methods for monitoring the increased
      (ICP) either invasive or non- invasive ,but the gold standard is invasive method. Optic nerve
      sheath ultrasonography provides a very promising bedside tool for detection of increased ICP.
      This study will monitor the dynamic changes of intracranial pressure by optic nerve sheath
      diameter (ONSD) in response to mannitol osmotherapy

      Traumatic brain injury is the main cause of increased intracranial pressure (ICP) in the
      intensive care .

      There are multiple methods for monitoring the raised ICP either invasive or non-invasive.The
      gold standard is the invasive devices because it is more accurate and reliable .However ,it
      requires a surgical intervention which has many hazards such as (infection
      ,hemorrhage,malfunction ).

      Optic nerve sheath ultrasonography is a promising bedside tool for detection of increased
      ICP. The optic nerve is surrounded by cerebro-spinal fluid ,thus if the circulation of
      cerebro-spinal fluid not blocked ,an increase in ICP will be transmitted through the
      subarachnoid space around the optic nerve within the nerve sheath especially the retro-bulbar
      segment.

      The study will be conducted to monitor the dynamic changes of intracranial pressure by optic
      nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) in response to mannitol osmotherapy as a primary outcome and
      secondary to evaluate the efficacy of ONSD in assessing the severity of the disease
