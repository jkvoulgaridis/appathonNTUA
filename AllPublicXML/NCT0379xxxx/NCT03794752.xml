      This study will be a prospective, non-randomized study of low-vision individuals diagnosed
      with either age-related macular degeneration (AMD) or diabetic macular edema with ETDRS
      visual acuity from 20/60 to 20/400 in both eyes from the University of Texas - Southwestern
      (UTSW) Medical Center at Dallas. Specifically, the primary objective of this testing is to
      establish the benefits of a wide field-of-view (FOV) monocular head-mounted visual
      enhancement device display (HMD), aiding the most degraded eye, as compared to best corrected
      visual acuity with glasses. It should be noted that in this approach, the HMD incorporates a
      camera, mounted coaxially with the visual axis of the eye with worse vision, and also
      image-enhancing or correction algorithms. Following review and execution of the informed
      consent, each subject will undergo an examination of their eyes, including: 1) ETDRS
      Best-corrected distance visual acuity; 2) Best-corrected near visual acuity; 3) Tests based
      on questions 5,6,7 and 11 of the National Eye Institute 25-item visual function questionnaire
      (NEI VFQ-25).

      A single visit, prospective, non-randomized study of low vision individuals diagnosed with
      Age Related Macular Degeneration or Diabetic macular edema research project is designed to
      last about 1.5 hours. All testing will be used for research purposes. There will be an 1)
      Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study visual acuity test, 2) near vision test, 3)
      Testing based on questions 5,6,7, and 11 of the National Eye Institute 25 item visual
      function questionnaire, (NEI VFQ-25) which includes a speed reading test, identifying
      objects, physically taking them and returning the items to correct original placement, once
      with glasses only, once with the head mounted visual device placed over the worst eye
      visually. There will also be an video tracks showing a conversation between 2 individuals -
      Subjects will be queried about the facial expressions of the actors during the conversation.
      The device is a wide field of view (FOV) monocular head-mounted visual enhancement device
      (HMD). The HMD has a camera mounted coaxially with the visual axis of the worse vision eye,
      and also image enhancing or correction algorithms. There are breaks planned between testing
      on the visual function exam portion of the NEI-25.

    <measure>Change in score measured on a rating scale to assess difficulty with visual function from baseline compared with and without the head-mounted electronic visual enhancement device</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The rating scale &quot;National Eye Institute Visual Functioning Questionnaire (NEI VFQ-25) version 2000&quot; is used measure patient responses. Questions regarding how much difficulty subjects experience doing day-to-day activities are asked and responses are rated on a 1-6 scale, whereby 1 being no difficulty at all, 2 is a little difficulty, 3 is moderate difficulty, 4 is extreme difficulty, 5 is stopped doing this activity because of your eyesight and 6 is stopped doing this activity for other reasons or not interested in doing this activity. An increase in the scale responses from a lower to higher number from baseline compared with and without the head-mounted device indicates a worse outcome whereas a decrease in the scale responses from a higher to a lower number from baseline compared with and without the head-mounted device indicate a better response. Individual responses to each question are reported and taken into consideration for data analysis while measuring the outcome.</description>

    <description>Head-Mounted Visual Enhancement Device developed by Evergaze Technology LLC has designed a head mounted electronic visual enhancement device that is compact and similar to glasses. It will be powered by a battery pack connected to the device. The electronic display will be affixed over only one of the user's eyes. The vision through the unobstructed eye will aid with the subject's balance and spatial orientation.</description>

The vision through the unobstructed eye will aid with the subject's balance and spatial orientation. The prototype display and camera will be connected to a battery pack/control box that will allow the user to quickly select one of 3 modes. Each mode will represent a combination of parameters (brightness of the display, focus lock, color/black &amp; white, contrast, magnification) designed to optimize the image for different activities (e.g. reading, walking, computer use).</description>
