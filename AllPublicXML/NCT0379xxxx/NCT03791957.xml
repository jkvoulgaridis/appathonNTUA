      AIM:

      To evaluate the association of the levels of blood haemoglobin to the distribution and
      severity of gingival melanin pigmentation at 3 different periodontal health status

      SAMPLE SIZE ESTIMATION

        -  Done using GPower v.3.1.9.2

        -  Total sample size = 60 (20 each in 3 groups)

        -  Effect size = 40%

        -  Power = 80%

        -  α-error = 5%

      SAMPLING:

        -  Simple random sampling

        -  Subjects to be recruited from out patient pool of KLE Society's Institute of Dental
           Sciences, Bangalore

        -  Subjects to be categorised into 3 groups (20 subjects each)

             1. Group A - Healthy periodontium

             2. Group B - Gingivitis

             3. Group C - Periodontitis

      PARAMETERS ASSESSED

        -  Blood Haemoglobin Concentration (in %gm/dL)

        -  Hedin Melanin Index Score 0: No pigmentation Score 1: one or two solitary unit(s) of
           pigmentation in papillary gingiva without formation of a continuous ribbon between
           solitary units Score 2: More than three units of pigmentation in papillary gingiva
           without the formation of a continuous ribbons of pigmentation Score 3: One or more short
           continuous ribbons of pigmentation Score 4: One continuous ribbon including the entire
           area between canines

      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

        -  SPSS for Windows Version 22.0 to be used

        -  Descriptive statistics: It includes expression of study parameters in terms of Mean &amp; SD
           for continuous variables, whereas in terms of frequency and proportions for categorical
           variables.

        -  Inferential Statistics:

      Chi Square Test will be used to compare the pigmentation index between 03 groups. And
      similarly, gender wise comparison of hemoglobin concentration will be done using the same
      test.

      One-way ANOVA test followed by Tukey's HSD post hoc Analysis will be used to compare the mean
      hemoglobin levels based on the pigmentation index scores in each group.

      The level of significance [P-Value] was set at P&lt;0.05
