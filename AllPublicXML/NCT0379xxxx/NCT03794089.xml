  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anxiety is common among primary care patients, but is undertreated. The purpose of this study
      is to evaluate whether a brief anxiety treatment designed for VA primary care is more
      effective at reducing anxiety symptoms in Veterans compared to usual care. The investigators
      will also examine whether Veterans like the brief treatment and whether the treatment can be
      feasibly delivered in primary care. Forty-eight adult Veteran primary care patients from the
      Syracuse VAMC who are experiencing anxiety symptoms will be recruited and randomly assigned
      to receive the brief anxiety treatment or usual care. The brief treatment consists of up to
      six 30-minute sessions with a cognitive-behavioral skills focus. The investigators will
      compare anxiety symptom severity between the two groups at baseline and at post-assessment 16
      weeks later.

      Background/Rationale: Many Veteran primary care patients experience impairing symptoms of
      anxiety, but rates of treatment are low. Primary Care-Mental Health Integration (PC-MHI), in
      which mental health clinicians provide brief treatment in the primary care setting, can
      bridge the gap between demand for, and availability of, anxiety treatment. However, brief
      anxiety interventions suitable for use in the PC-MHI setting are needed. Developing an
      effective brief PC-MHI intervention for anxiety would address a gap in VA treatment options
      and facilitate high quality healthcare that improves treatment engagement, clinical outcomes,
      and patient experience. To ensure maximum reach, this intervention should accommodate a
      variety of subthreshold and diagnostic anxiety presentations, as well as comorbid depression.

      Objectives: The overall goal of this research program is to develop, refine, and evaluate a
      brief anxiety intervention that will be acceptable to Veterans and feasible for PC-MHI
      providers. The primary aim of the current study is to conduct a pilot randomized controlled
      trial to evaluate feasibility, acceptability, potential implementation barriers and
      facilitators, and effectiveness of the intervention compared to usual care.

      Methods: This will be a pilot hybrid type I effectiveness-implementation randomized
      controlled trial (N = 48). The primary goal is to evaluate feasibility, acceptability, and
      effectiveness of the intervention in reducing anxiety symptom severity compared to usual
      care. The secondary goal is to collect preliminary data on implementation barriers and
      facilitators that may affect future real-world uptake.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 Change</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline &amp; Post-Assessment (at 16 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome of anxiety symptom severity will be measured by the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) self-report questionnaire, a validated measure that is widely used in VA primary care. Participants rate how much they have been bothered by each of 7 anxiety symptoms over the last 2 weeks on a Likert scale from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day). Scores are summed to create a total score indicating severity of anxiety symptoms (minimal, mild, moderate, severe). The total score is sensitive to change from treatment across the anxiety disorders. The GAD-7 has demonstrated reliability and validity and is a good screening tool for multiple anxiety disorders.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Health Questionnaire-9 Change</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline &amp; Post-Assessment (at 16 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary outcome of depressive symptom severity will be measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) self-report questionnaire, a validated measure that is widely used in VA primary care. Participants rate how often they have been bothered by each of 9 symptoms over the last 2 weeks on a Likert scale from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day). Scores are summed to create a total score indicating severity of depressive symptoms (minimal, mild, moderate, moderately severe, severe). The total score is sensitive to change from treatment. The PHQ-9 has demonstrated reliability and validity.</description>

    <measure>Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 Change</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks, &amp; Post-Assessment (at 16 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary outcome of depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms will be measured with the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21), which consists of three 7-item subscales: depression, anxiety, and stress. Participants indicate how much each of 21 items applies to them over the past week on a scale from 0 (did not apply to me at all) to 3 (applied to me very much, or most of the time). This measure has good psychometric properties in both clinical and non-clinical samples. This measure reliably distinguishes between symptoms of anxiety (panic/worry), stress (tension/agitation), and depression (low mood/anhedonia) which are highly comorbid. At 4, 8, and 12 weeks this measure will be obtained by telephone.</description>

    <measure>Overall Anxiety Severity and Impairment Scale Change</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks, &amp; Post-Assessment (at 16 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Functional impairment from anxiety symptoms will be measured using the Overall Anxiety Severity and Impairment Scale (OASIS), which measures symptom severity and functional impairment across anxiety disorders and subthreshold symptoms. The 5-item scale demonstrates reliability ( = .84 in primary care sample) and validity in primary care patients. Participants indicate the frequency and intensity of anxiety, level of avoidance, and interference with activities and social functioning on a Likert scale from 0 to 4. At 4, 8, and 12 weeks this measure will be obtained by telephone.</description>

    <measure>Overall Depression Severity and Impairment Scale Change</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks, &amp; Post-Assessment (at 16 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Functional impairment from depressive symptoms will be measured using the Overall Depression Severity and Impairment Scale (ODSIS), which measures symptom severity and functional impairment across depressive disorders and subthreshold symptoms. Adapted from the OASIS to apply to depression, the 5-item scale demonstrates reliability ( = .92 in community sample of adults) and validity. Participants indicate the frequency and intensity of depressive symptoms, difficulty engaging in activities, and interference with work/school/home activities and social functioning on a Likert scale from 0 to 4. At 4, 8, and 12 weeks this measure will be obtained by telephone.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire-Short Form Change</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline &amp; Post-Assessment (at 16 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life will be measured using the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire-Short Form (Q-LES-Q-SF), which measures overall enjoyment and satisfaction with various aspects of life. The 16-item scale is reliable ( = .86) and valid. Participants rate satisfaction with each domain on a Likert scale from 1 to 5.</description>
