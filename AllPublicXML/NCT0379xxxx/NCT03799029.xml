      This study examines the impact of cognitive training among participants with ADHD in
      Switzerland
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of the experimental study is to investigate cognitive functioning, behavioral
      and neural levels in ADHD, both before and after cognitive training where there has been the
      addition of motivation elements. Near and far transfers effects of this new program are
      evaluated. For far transfers, ambulatory assessment is used to improve ecological validity.
      Neural activity has rarely been examined in cognitive training with ADHD participants, and
      that is why this study also includes FMRI measures. Long-term effects, defined as three and
      six months following the completion of cognitive training, are also investigated. This study
      focuses on children, adolescents and adults with ADHD. Indeed, cognitive training effects
      have been rarely studied over the lifespan.

    <time_frame>Change between two time points from baseline T1 to six week later T2 after cognitive training is assessed. Follow up is assessed at 3 months T3 and 6 months T4</time_frame>
    <description>The Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scales (CAARS) higher values represent worse outcome The Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scales (CAARS) is used to assess ADHD symptoms among adults (Conners et al., 1999) depending on the DSM-IV-TR (APA, 2000). This short version includes 26 items and 4 possible ratings from from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much). This scale comprises four factors: (1) inattention, memory problems, (2) hyperactivity, restlessness, (3) impulsivity, emotional lability, (4) problems with self-concept and one ADHD index. score are summed. Range 0 to 100.</description>

    <description>Subjects will perform a reward under stress task adapted from the spatial delayed response task from (Glahn et al., 2002) measure reward (Martin-Soelch, C., et al.,2009: Gaillac et al., 2016). Reaction time is calculated.
The sensitivity to Punishment and Sensitivity to Reward questionnaire for Children, adolescents (SPSRQ-C) (Colder and O'Connor 2004) and adults (SPSRQ, Torrubia, Ávila, Moltó, &amp; Caseras, 2001) are used. These questionnaires are based on Gray's reinforcement sensitivity theory of personality (1981, 1987, 2000). Reward task higher values represent a better outcome. Score range 0 to 110.</description>
