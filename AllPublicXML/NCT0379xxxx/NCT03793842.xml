  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Doctors follow a standard ventilator management strategy when making adjustments to the
      breathing machine to optimize the amount of oxygen into the lungs. The purpose of this study
      is to assess whether the EIT (electrical impedance tomography) device can be an additional
      useful tool for ventilator management and identifying the ideal positive end-expiratory
      pressure (PEEP).
