    <textblock>
      AINV18P1 is a Phase 1 study where palbociclib will be administrated in combination with a
      standard re-induction platform in pediatric relapsed Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) and
      lymphoblastic lymphoma (LL). LL patients are included because the patient population is rare
      and these patients are most commonly treated with ALL regimens. The proposed palbociclib
      starting dose for this study will be 50 mg/m^2/day for 21 days.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of
      palbociclib administered in combination with re-induction chemotherapy in pediatric patients
      with relapsed B- or T-lineage ALL/LL.

      II. To define and describe the toxicities of palbociclib administered on this schedule.

      III. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of palbociclib in pediatric patients with relapsed
      B- or T-lineage ALL/LL.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To preliminarily define the antitumor activity of palbociclib in combination with
      chemotherapy for children with relapsed ALL/LL within the confines of a Phase 1 study.

      II. To assess the biologic activity of palbociclib in this patient population.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive Palbociclib PO (or via NG-tube) once daily on Days 1-21; Intrathecal
      cytarabine (IT ARAC) on Day 1, Doxorubicin IV push or infusion over 1-15 min on Day 4;
      Prednisone or prednisolone PO on days 4-31; Vincristine IV push or mini-bag per institutional
      policy on Days 4, 11, 18, and 25; and Pegaspargase IV over 1-2 hours on Days 5, and 18. If
      CNS3 leukemia is present, patients receive Intrathecal Triple Therapy (ITT) on days 4, 11,18,
      and 25. If CNS1 or 2 disease status, patients receive Methotrexate (IT MTX) on Days 18 and
      32. Patients known to be CNS3 at study entry may receive ITT on Day 1 rather than IT ARAC.
      Treatment will be given for one cycle, 32 days, in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

                  wheelchair, will be considered ambulatory for the purpose of assessing the
                  performance score.

          -  Patients must have fully recovered from the acute toxic effects of all prior
             anti-cancer therapy and must meet the following minimum duration from prior
             anti-cancer directed therapy prior to enrollment. If after the required timeframe, the
             numerical eligibility criteria are met, e.g., blood count criteria, the patient is
             considered to have recovered adequately.

               1. Cytotoxic chemotherapy or other anti-cancer agents known to be myelosuppressive.
                  See DVL homepage for commercial and Phase 1 investigational agent
                  classifications. For agents not listed, the duration of this interval must be
                  discussed with the study chair and the study-assigned Research Coordinator prior
                  to enrollment.

                    -  A waiting period prior to enrollment is not required for patients receiving

                                 to initiation of systemic chemotherapy per AINV18P1 counts as
                                 protocol therapy and not prior anti-cancer therapy. Intrathecal
                                 chemotherapy given &gt; 72 hours prior does not count as protocol
                                 therapy.

          -  Adequate Liver Function Defined as:

               -  bilirubin (sum of conjugated + unconjugated) &lt;= 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN)
                  for age

               -  SGPT (ALT) &lt;= 225 U/L unless disease-related. For the purpose of this study, the
                  ULN for SGPT is 45 U/L.

               -  Serum albumin &gt;= 2 g/dL.

          -  Adequate Cardiac Function Defined As:

               -  Shortening fraction of &gt;= 27% by echocardiogram, or

               -  Ejection fraction of &gt;= 50% by gated radionuclide study.

          -  All patients and/or their parents or legally authorized representatives must sign a
             written informed consent. Assent, when appropriate, will be obtained according to
             institutional guidelines.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding women will not be entered on this study due to risks of
             fetal and teratogenic adverse events as seen in animal/human studies. Based on the
             mechanism of action, palbociclib may be expected to cause fetal harm if used during
             pregnancy. Pregnancy tests must be obtained in girls who are post-menarche. Males or
             females of reproductive potential may not participate unless they have agreed to use
             an effective contraceptive method for the duration of study therapy. Women of
             reproductive potential should use effective contraception during treatment and for at
             least 3 weeks after the last dose of palbociclib. Males with female partners of
             reproductive potential should use effective contraception during treatment and for 3
             months after the last dose of palbociclib. Animal data suggests that palbociclib may
             affect male fertility.

          -  Prednisone or methylprednisolone for ≤ 120 hours (5 days) may be administered for
             cytoreduction up to 24 hours prior to the start of protocol therapy and as treatment
             for allergic reactions or for physiologic replacement/stress dosing of hydrocortisone
             for documented adrenal insufficiency. Corticosteroids are not allowed for other
             indications. If used to modify immune adverse events related to prior therapy, ≥ 14
             days must have elapsed since last dose of corticosteroid.

          -  Patients who are currently receiving another investigational drug.

          -  Patients who are currently receiving other anti-cancer agents are not eligible [except
             patients receiving hydroxyurea, which may be continued until 24 hours prior to start
             of protocol therapy].

          -  Patients who are currently receiving drugs that are strong inhibitors and/or inducers
             of CYP3A4 or sensitive CYP3A4 substrates and CYP3A4 substrates with a narrow
             therapeutic range are not eligible. Strong inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4 are
             prohibited from 14 days prior to enrollment to the end of the study.

          -  Patients who are receiving cyclosporine, tacrolimus or other agents to prevent
             graft-versus-host disease post bone marrow transplant.

          -  Patients must be able to swallow intact capsules or liquid. Patients that are unable
             to swallow oral medications may receive palbociclib through an NG tube. G tube
             administration is not allowed.

          -  Patients who have an uncontrolled infection defined as below:

               -  Fever above 38.2°C within 48 hours of study enrollment with clinical signs of
                  infection. Fever that is determined to be due to tumor burden is allowed if
                  patients have documented negative blood cultures for at least 48 hours prior to
                  enrollment and no concurrent signs or symptoms of active infection or hemodynamic
                  instability.

               -  A positive fungal culture within 30 days of study enrollment or active therapy
                  for presumed invasive fungal infection.

               -  Patients may be receiving IV or oral antibiotics to complete a course of therapy
                  for a prior documented infection as long as cultures have been negative for at
                  least 48 hours and signs or symptoms of active infection have resolved. For
                  patients with c. difficile diarrhea, at least 72 hours of antibacterial therapy
                  must have elapsed and stools must have normalized to baseline.

               -  Active viral or protozoal infection requiring IV treatment.

          -  Patients known to have one of the following concomitant genetic syndromes: Down
             syndrome, Bloom syndrome, ataxia-telangiectasia, Fanconi anemia, Kostmann syndrome,
             Shwachmann syndrome or any other known bone marrow failure syndrome.

          -  Patients who in the opinion of the investigator may not be able to comply with the
             safety monitoring requirements of the study.
