  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, and Efficacy of VCN-01 in
      Combination With Durvalumab (MEDI4736) in Subjects With Recurrent/Metastatic Squamous Cell
      Carcinoma of the Head and Neck.

      VCN-01 is a genetically modified oncolytic adenovirus characterized by the presence of four
      independent genetic modifications on the backbone of the wild-type HAd5 adenovirus genome,
      encoding human PH20, that confer tumor selectivity and anti-tumor activity.

      Durvalumab is a human monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the immunoglobulin G (IgG) 1 kappa
      subclass that inhibits binding of PD-L1.

      The proposed mechanism of action (MOA) for durvalumab is interference in the interaction of
      PD-L1 with PD-1 and CD80 (B7.1). Blockade of PD-L1/PD-1 and PD-L1/CD80 interactions releases
      the inhibition of immune responses, including those that may result in tumor elimination.

      -  Research Hypothesis The presence of VCN-01 into the tumor after systemic administration
           will help to overcome the observed resistance to durvalumab and other PD1/PD-L1
           checkpoint inhibitors.

        -  Primary objectives To evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single intravenous
           injection of VCN-01 combined with durvalumab in two administration regimens (concomitant
           or durvalumab starting two weeks later &quot;sequential schedule&quot;), and to determine the
           recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of the combination.

        -  Study design This is a phase I trial, multicenter, open label, and dose escalation
           study. Patients will be entered at each dose level, according to a planned dose
           escalation schedule. Absence of unacceptable toxicity at the previous dose is required
           for entering a patient in the subsequent level.

        -  Number of Centers: up to 3

        -  Number of Patients: 15-20 patients

        -  Study Population: Patients with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck
           who have progressed during or after treatment with immune-checkpoint inhibitors.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a phase I trial, multicenter, open label, and dose escalation study. Patients will be entered at each dose level, according to a planned dose escalation schedule. Absence of unacceptable toxicity at the previous dose is required for entering a patient in the subsequent level.
The investigational treatment will be a single i.v. VCN-01 dose combined with concomitant i.v. durvalumab (MEDI4736) 1500 mg Q4W (Arm I) or durvalumab starting two weeks after VCN-01 administration, &quot;sequential schedule&quot; (Arm II). Patient recruitment in Arm I and Arm II will be performed in parallel based on slot availability. Only one single dose of VCN-01 will be administered to each patient during the trial. Durvalumab will be administered Q4W until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or another discontinuation criterion.</intervention_model_description>

          9. Has an active or prior documented autoimmune or inflammatory disorder (including but
             not limited to inflammatory bowel disease [e.g., colitis or Crohn's disease],
             diverticulitis [with the exception of diverticulosis], systemic lupus erythematosus,
             Sarcoidosis syndrome, or Wegener syndrome [granulomatosis with polyangiitis, Graves'
             disease, rheumatoid arthritis, hypophysitis, uveitis, etc]). (See section 4.2 for
             details and exceptions.)

         10. Any concurrent chemotherapy, IP, biologic, or hormonal therapy for cancer treatment.

             Concurrent use of hormonal therapy for non-cancer-related conditions (e.g., hormone
             replacement therapy) is acceptable.

         11. Radiotherapy treatment to more than 30% of the bone marrow or with a wide field of
             radiation within 4 weeks of the first dose of study drug.

         12. Major surgical procedure (as defined by the Investigator) within 28 days prior to the
             first dose of IP. Note: Local surgery of isolated lesions for palliative intent or
             other minor procedures are acceptable.

         13. History of allogenic organ transplantation.

         14. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness, including but not limited to, uncontrolled ongoing
             or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension,
             unstable angina pectoris, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, interstitial lung disease,
             serious chronic gastrointestinal conditions associated with diarrhea, or psychiatric
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirement,
             substantially increase risk of incurring AEs or compromise the ability of the patient
             to give written informed consent. Exception: patients who are finalizing their
             antibiotic treatment (for example 3 days left of a total of 7 or 10) for a respiratory
             tract infection are allowed to be included.

         15. History of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis

         16. Has untreated central nervous system (CNS) metastases identified either on the
             baseline brain imaging obtained during the screening period or identified prior to
             signing the ICF. Patients whose brain metastases have been treated may participate
             provided they show radiographic stability (defined as 2 brain images, both of which
             are obtained after treatment to the brain metastases. These imaging scans should both
             be obtained at least four weeks apart and show no evidence of intracranial
             progression). In addition, any neurologic symptoms that developed either as a result
             of the brain metastases or their treatment must have resolved or be stable either,
             without the use of steroids, or with stable doses of anticonvulsants and/or steroids.
             Steroid dose must be ≤10mg/day of prednisone or its equivalent (and anticonvulsants)
             for at least 14 days prior to the start of treatment.

         17. Has a history of primary immunodeficiency

         18. Active infection including tuberculosis (clinical evaluation that includes clinical
             history, physical examination and radiographic findings, and TB testing in line with
             local practice), hepatitis B (positive HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) result), hepatitis
             C (positive HCV RNA), or human immunodeficiency virus (positive HIV 1/2 antibodies).
             Patients with a past or resolved HBV infection (defined as the presence of hepatitis B
             core antibody [HBcAb] and absence of HBsAg) are eligible. HBV DNA must be obtained in
             these patients prior to treatment. HBV carriers of those patients requiring antiviral
             therapy treatment of hepatitis B virus or Hepatitis C are not eligible to participate.
             Patients positive for hepatitis C (HCV) antibody are eligible only if polymerase chain
             reaction is negative for HCV RNA. Patients with past or resolved tuberculosis are
             eligible.

         19. Receipt of live attenuated vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of IP. Note:
             Patients, if enrolled, should not receive live vaccine whilst receiving IP and up to
             30 days after the last dose of IP.

         20. Female patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding or male or female patients of
             reproductive potential who are not willing to employ effective birth control
             (according to the HMA CTFG guidelance) from screening to 90 days after the last dose
             of durvalumab.

         21. Known allergy or hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs or any of the study drug
             excipients.

         22. Viral syndrome diagnosed during the two weeks before inclusion

         23. Patients receiving full-dose anticoagulant/antiplatelet therapy.

         24. Patients with Li Fraumeni syndrome or with previous known retinoblastoma protein
             pathway germinal deficiency.

         25. Judgment by the investigator that the patient is unsuitable to participate in the
             study and the patient is unlikely to comply with study procedures, restrictions and
             requirements.
