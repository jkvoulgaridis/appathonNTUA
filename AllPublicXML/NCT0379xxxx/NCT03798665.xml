  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, multicenter, non-interventional registration studies were used in this project .
      Eight hundreds patients with solid tumors who met the inclusion criteria in six hospitals in
      Sichuan Province, Sichuan Province, were selected from the first chemotherapy cycle using
      PEG-rhG-CSF (can be any chemotherapy cycle of the patient), and each subsequent chemotherapy
      cycle was recorded. The use of PEG-rhG-CSF and related patient outcomes until the end of
      chemotherapy. Analyze the clinical practice of using PEG-rhG-CSF in the real world.
