  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The first goal of this project is to validate the superiority of semi-permanent marks used in
      conjunction with specialized light-based surface imaging (SIGRT) in an effort to phase out
      the use of permanent tattoos for the investigator's patients. The secondary goal of this
      project is to validate the superiority of specialized light-based surface imaging for daily
      radiation set-up compared to standard-of-care imaging methods using ionizing radiation, such
      as weekly port films or cone-beam CT (CBCT) scans during a radiation therapy course for
      breast cancer.

    <textblock>
      This study uses surface imaging for breast patients to standardize or normalize planning
      position &amp; minimize variability of port films thus reducing systematic error. The primary
      objective of this study is to demonstrate the superiority of using surface imaging to combine
      an ideally gated treatment planning CT and verification images timed to the breathing cycle,
      quantified as the total within-subject variation of the measured location relative to current
      methods of radiation delivery not using this approach. The secondary objective is to
      demonstrate the superiority of specialized light-based surface imaging for daily radiation
      set-up without tattoos compared to standard-of-care methods with regard to the total
      within-subject variation of the measured location determined by weekly port films during a
      course of radiation for breast cancer.

    <description>Distance measured (centimeters) from the planned position of radiotherapy to the actual position of radiotherapy on weekly port films. Port films are x-rays of the treatment field which are done to ensure that the patient and the radiation machine are properly aligned to each other. Weekly port films will be obtained for the duration of radiation treatment, which will be from three to five weeks in length.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age â‰¥ 18 years

          -  Biologically female

          -  Ability to provide informed written consent in either English or Spanish

          -  Surgical pathology and staging scans must demonstrate Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)
             or invasive breast cancer, Stages 0, 1, 2, and 3

          -  Patient will undergo adjuvant radiation therapy as a part of multimodality breast
             cancer treatment with plans for tangent field radiation treatment with or without
             loco-regional lymph node targeting, based on the clinical judgement of the treating
             physician

          -  Willingness to maintain temporary skin markings for a part of their of radiation
             therapy duration

          -  Absence of any conditions that may affect ability to have either tattoos or skin
             markings, as discussed in Exclusion Criteria

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &lt; 18 years

          -  Biologically non-female

          -  Inability or unwillingness of subject to give written informed consent

          -  Patients found at presentation to have very locally-advanced cancer (e.g. inflammatory
             breast cancer) or metastatic breast cancer (Stage 4)

          -  Patients that will be treated with a deep-inspiration breath hold technique (typically
             younger patients being treated for left-sided tumors)

          -  Current pregnancy, as this is a contraindication to receiving radiation therapy

          -  History of prior radiotherapy to the chest wall or torso

          -  Known allergy / sensitivity to standard medical marking tattoo ink (by design

          -  Active drug or alcohol use or dependence evidenced by patient record and/or
             self-report that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with adherence
