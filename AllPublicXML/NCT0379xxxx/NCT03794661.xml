    <textblock>
      The objective of this clinical investigation is to characterize the clinical performance of
      Abbott's Clinician Programmer Electrode Screening Mode tool (InformityTM tool) in programming
      InfinityTM deep brain stimulation (DBS) systems for patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) or
      essential tremor (ET).

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, non-randomized, single-arm, multi-center, post-market clinical
      investigation designed to evaluate Abbott's Informity tool for Infinity DBS systems.

      This clinical investigation will be conducted at up to 5 centers in the United States.

      40 patients will be enrolled in the study. Of these subjects, 20 will have PD and 20 will
      have ET. All patients will have received Infinity DBS systems prior to enrolling in the
      study.

      Subjects participating in this clinical investigation will be followed for 6 months. The
      expected duration of enrollment is 6 months. The total duration of the clinical investigation
      is expected to be 18 months. The primary and secondary endpoints will be evaluated when all
      40 subjects have completed their 3 and 6 month follow-up visits

    <time_frame>Change from Baseline at Day 21</time_frame>
    <description>Change in therapeutic window size at the initial programming visit compared to baseline. The therapeutic window measures the difference between the stimulation amplitude that generates side effects and the stimulation amplitude that generates therapeutic benefit.</description>

    <time_frame>Change from Baseline at Day 21</time_frame>
    <description>Change in therapeutic electrical energy delivered (TEED) at the initial programming visit compared to baseline. TEED measures the total energy delivered by the deep brain stimulation system over an arbitrary period of time, and is determined by the programmed stimulation parameters and measured system impedance.</description>

    <description>Change in Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part III at 1 month and 3 month follow-up visits compared to baseline. UPDRS III scores range from 0 to 56, and lower scores indicate less severe motor symptoms.</description>

    <description>Change in Fahn-Tolosa-Marin tremor rating scale at 1 month and 3 month follow-up visits compared to baseline. Fahn-Tolosa-Marin tremor rating scale scores are expressed as a percentage of the total score possible (range of 0% to 100%), and lower scores indicate less severe motor symptoms.</description>

    <description>Change in Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ)-39 at 1 month and 3 month follow-up visits compared to baseline. PDQ-39 scores range from 0 to 100, and lower scores reflect a better quality of life.</description>

    <description>Change in Quality of Life in Essential Tremor (QUEST) at 1 month and 3 month follow-up visits compared to baseline. QUEST has five sub-scales (physical/activities of daily living, psychosocial, communication, hobbies/leisure, and work/finances), with each sub-score expressed as a percentage of the total score possible for that sub-scale (range of 0% to 100%). A summary index is calculated as the mean of the sub-scores. Lower scores reflect less dissatisfaction or disability due to essential tremor.</description>
