    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the side effects and best dose of ipilimumab, nivolumab, and
      radiation therapy and how well they work in treating patients with advanced human
      papillomavirus (HPV) positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. Immunotherapy with
      monoclonal antibodies, such as ipilimumab and nivolumab, may help the body's immune system
      attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.
      Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving
      ipilimumab, nivolumab, and radiation therapy may work better in treating patients with HPV
      positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety, tolerability and feasibility of ipilimumab and nivolumab when
      administered concurrently with reduced-field radiotherapy (intensity-modulated radiation
      therapy [IMRT]).

      II. To evaluate the clinical complete response rate to ipilimumab, nivolumab and IMRT with
      reduced field at six months as indicated by fluorodeoxyglucose - positron emission
      tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) post completion of radiation therapy (RT).

      III. To evaluate the 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate of subjects with
      low-intermediate volume, local-regionally advanced, human papilloma virus (HPV)-positive
      squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) treated with ipilimumab, nivolumab and
      reduced-field IMRT.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate overall response rate to six weeks of induction immunotherapy (IO).

      II. To evaluate the frequency of pharyngeal dysphasia as measured by Dynamic Imaging (Dynamic
      Imaging Grade of Swallowing Toxicity [DIGEST]) grade on modified barium swallow (MBS) and
      patient-reported symptoms (MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory [MDADI]) at 6 month, 1 and 2 years
      after radiotherapy ([IMRT].

      III. To measure acute and chronic toxicities per Patient-Reported Outcomes Common Terminology
      Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE PRO).

      IV. To measure acute toxicity profiles at the end of radiation therapy and IO and at 6
      months.

      V. To measure late toxicity profiles at 1 and 2 years. VI. To determine local and regional
      control at 6 and 12 months. VII. To determine patterns of failure (local-regional relapse vs.
      distant) at 1 and 2 years.

      VIII. To determine overall survival (OS) at 1 and 2 years.

      CORRELATIVE OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate associations between total mutational load, interferon (INF) gamma score, T
      cell clonality at diagnosis with clinical response to induction, combination CTLA-4 PD-1
      checkpoint blockade.

      II. To evaluate changes in the tumor immune microenvironment (CD8 + INF gamma score, T cell
      clonality, in tumor biopsy specimens pre and post induction immunotherapy (IO).

      III. To evaluate dynamic changes in and clearance of oral HPV and cell-free deoxyribonucleic
      acid (cfDNA) viral load during therapy and to investigate associations with PFS and OS.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate changes in peripheral blood lymphocyte phenotypes and serum cytokine profiles
      before and after induction IO.

      II. To evaluate changes in the T cell receptor repertoire in tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte
      (TIL) and the peripheral blood in tumor biopsy specimens pre and post induction IO.

      III. To determine the negative and positive predictive values (NPV and PPV) of FDG-PET/CT
      12-14 weeks after end of RT for 1 year and 2 year PFS and OS.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1, 15, and 29 and
      ipilimumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every for 6 weeks for 2 cycles in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning on day 1 of cycle 2,
      patients also undergo IMRT 5 days a week (Monday-Friday) for 6 weeks in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2 weeks, every 3 months for
      2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.

          -  Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy
