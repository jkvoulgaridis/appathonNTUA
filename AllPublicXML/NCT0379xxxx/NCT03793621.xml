  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this trial is to investigate the safety and tolerability of BI 730357
      in Japanese healthy male subjects following oral administration of single rising doses.

      Secondary objectives are the explorations of the pharmacokinetic(s) (PK), including dose
      proportionality as well as investigation of linearity of BI 730357 after single dose
      administration.
