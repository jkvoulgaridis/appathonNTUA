  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) remains one of the currently
      available curative therapies for acute leukemia (AL). Leukemia relapse is one of the mainly
      causes of transplant failure. We reported previously that patients with high-risk molecular
      biomarkers who still have detectable minimal residual disease(MRD) pre-HSCT were at very high
      risk of relapse, with cumulative relapse rate of 50-80%. Decitabine has been demonstrated
      efficacy in the treatment of patients with recurrent or refractory leukemia and
      myelodysplastiv syndrome. It was reported that the combination of decitabine, with busufan
      and cyclophosphamide as a preparative regimen for allo-HSCT using HLA-matching donors was
      safe and effective. In this prospective, single-arm clinical trial, we aimed to examine the
      efficacy of combining decitabine with modified busulfan and cyclophosphamide (mBU/CY) as a
      preparative regimen for allo-HSCT in patients with very high-risk AL and detectable MRD
      pre-HSCT.

      Patients enrolled in this study would receive decitabine 200mg·m-2·d-1 on day -12 and -11
      pre-HSCT. The conditioning therapy for human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-mismatched HSCT patients
      was modified BU/CY plus ATG (thymoglobulin; Sang Stat, France) consisting of cytarabine
      (Ara-C 4 g·m-2·d-1) intravenously on days -10 to -9, busulfan (BU 3.2 mg·kg-1·d-1)
      intravenously on days -8 to -6, cyclophosphamide (CY 1.8 g·m-2·d-1), intravenously on days -5
      to -4, semustine (Me-CCNU, 250 mg·m-2), orally once on day -3, and ATG (2.5 mg·kg-1·d-1)
      intravenously on days -5 to -2. In matched sibling transplantations, patients received
      hydroxycarbamide (80 mg·kg-1) orally on day -10 and a lower dose of Ara-C (2 g·m-2·d-1) on
      day -9, but otherwise an identical regimen to the HLA-mismatched patients without ATG.

      BM samples from patients were obtained to assess leukemia status after HSCT. The time points
      that we monitored BM samples included at time of allo-HSCT; 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 4.5
      months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months after allo-HSCT; and every 6 months thereafter to
      the defined endpoints or for at least until 5 years after transplantation.
