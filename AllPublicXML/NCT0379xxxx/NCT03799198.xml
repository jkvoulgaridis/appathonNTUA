  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers are doing this study to compare the effects of drugs approved for long-term
      weight loss combined with an employer-based weight management program with the effects of the
      weight management program without drugs for weight loss. If participants agree to be in this
      study, they will join the Cleveland Clinic Integrated Medical Weight Management Program
      (WMP). Participants will be assigned by chance (like flipping a coin) to one of two treatment
      groups: A) Group 1: Cleveland Clinic Integrated Medical WMP + medication for long-term weight
      loss. B) Group 2: Cleveland Clinic Integrated Medical WMP without medication for weight loss.
      Participants have an equal chance of being in either of the treatment groups. The total study
      duration for the individual participants will be approximately one year.
