      This study investigates immunological and clinical markers in threatened preterm birth aiming
      to create a prediction model for preterm birth.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preterm birth is the main cause of neonatal mortality and morbidity and despite a lot of
      effort the mechanisms leading to preterm birth are poorly understood. In threatened preterm
      birth it is difficult to identify the true high risk cases ultimately leading to preterm
      birth. These women are often overtreated.

      In this study blood samples are taken from women with threatened preterm birth and from women
      with normal pregnancies before and during labor.

      Differences in clinical characteristics and immunological markers between the groups are
      studied in order to design a prediction model for preterm birth.
