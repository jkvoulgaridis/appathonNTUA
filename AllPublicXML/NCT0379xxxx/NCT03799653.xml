      The Nurse Cohort Study Xiamen (NCSX) is an open-ended prospective cohort study with very
      broad research aims. The primary objectives of the NCSX is planned to examine genetic,
      epigenetic, biological, psychological, social, lifestyle and other environmental factors of
      nurses in relation to incidence and progression of the common chronic diseases, such as
      hypertension, ischemic heart disease, stroke, diabetes, chronic kidney disease and some
      cancers, which are emerging with economic development in Xiamen, China. Specifically, we
      intend to test whether empirically driven hypothesis and emerging risk factors mainly
      developed in response to observations in economically developed Western societies apply in a
      population living in a rapid changing lifestyle in China now.

      Objectives: To establish a cohort of about 10,000 registered nurses (aged 20 or over) in
      Xiamen, China; to describe the baseline major risk factors; to analyze their
      interrelationships; and to examine the risks of incidence and progression of major chronic
      diseases, such as hypertension, stroke, CKD and cancers, and all-cause and cause-specific
      mortality by different levels of the risk factors after about 5 years follow-up.

      Design: A prospective cohort study. Setting: 7 public hospitals in Xiamen, China.
      Participants: About 10,000 registered nurses (aged 20 or over) who work in public hospitals
      in Xiamen, China.

      Main outcome: Incidences of common chronic diseases, such as CVD, diabetes, chronic kidney
      disease, and cancers; progression of these diseases; all cause and specific-cause mortality.

      Hypothesis: Relative risks of major risk factors. Results of the study should have strong
      impact on prevention and control of these diseases and promoting nurses'health in the local
      population.
