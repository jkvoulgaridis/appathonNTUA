  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed project is a randomized controlled trial of a new home-based palliative care
      program for adults with advanced dementia and their caregivers within the Mount Sinai Health
      System. Potential subjects will be identified from Mount Sinai records or referred by a Mount
      Sinai healthcare provider. Patients will only be approached after authorization by their
      Mount Sinai physician. Participants who consent to enrollment will be randomized to receive
      the intervention (home-based palliative care program) or usual care (with their nominated
      Mount Sinai physician). Patients will be enrolled in the study for 6 months.

      Effectiveness of the intervention will be determined through assessment of patient and
      caregiver reported outcomes and abstraction of data from medical records and administrative
      claims. Impact on the following parameters will be measured: (i) Patient symptoms, quality of
      life, satisfaction with care, documentation of advanced directives, receipt of care
      consistent with preferences (ii) Caregiver burden, satisfaction with care, and depression
      (iii) Healthcare utilization and costs of care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this randomized controlled trial is to study the impact of a new home based
      palliative care program on patients' symptoms, quality of life, satisfaction with care,
      completion of advance care planning documentation and receipt of care consistent with
      preferences. In addition, the study will examine the impact of this model of care on patient
      healthcare utilization, including hospitalization, emergency department utilization, and
      hospice use prior to death. The trial will also include patients' caregivers, in order to
      examine the impact of the intervention on caregiver burden and prevalence of depression.

      Patients randomized to the intervention will be scheduled for an intake visit. This visit
      will be undertaken by the team's registered nurse and/or social worker, together with a
      community health worker, and other team members (advanced practice nurse, MD), depending on
      patients' needs. Visits will combine a combination of video-teleconferencing technology and
      in person visits. Following this visit, and in conjunction with the nurse practitioner and/or
      MD, a care plan will be developed to address areas of clinical need highlighted during the
      intake visit.

      Patients in the intervention arm will receive ongoing monitoring and input (telephone-based,
      video-based, and in-person) from members of the clinical team, dependent on their identified
      needs. Patients' cases will be discussed at the weekly IDT meeting, as appropriate to the
      level of clinical need. Patients and caregivers will be provided with access to a 24 hour
      telephone line, staffed by a Mount Sinai based physician, which acts as an advice line out of
      hours. These physicians will be able to provide advice to patients and caregivers.
