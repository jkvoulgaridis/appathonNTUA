  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most drugs used in general anesthesia work on various receptors in the human brain, causing
      unconsciousness, loss of memory, and loss of reflection of the autonomic nervous system.
      After the anesthesia, baseline physiological function will be attained by administration of
      some reversal drugs or as the time goes by. In this process, various side effects may occur.

      Emergence delirium (ED) is a representative behavioral disturbance after general anesthesia
      in children and that can cause several problems during the recovery period. Previous EEG
      studies reported that this phenomenon is related to hyperexcitation of the brain, and
      occurrence of epileptiform discharges during anesthesia induction may indicate an increased
      vulnerability for the development of a functional brain disorder in these children.

      However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no studies concern evaluating quantitative
      EEG parameters for prediction of this postoperative negative behavior in children.

    <measure>Occurrence of Emergence delirium</measure>
    <time_frame>During 60 minutes after PACU admission</time_frame>
    <description>On arrival at post-anesthesia care unit (PACU), patients are checked post-anesthesia emergence delirium (PAED). The PAED scale is a validated observational measure of 5 aspects of child behavior (caregiver eye contact, purposeful movement, evidence of awareness of surroundings, restlessness, and inconsolability). Ratings are summed to produce a total score ranging from 0 to 20; greater scores indicate greater severity.
If the PAED score is greater than 12, investigators define emergence delirium.</description>

    <measure>Relative power of each brain waves</measure>
    <time_frame>From the cessation of sevoflurane inhalation to the extubation of airway devices such as tracheal tubes or laryngeal mask airway</time_frame>
    <description>Original frontal EEG segments are attained via 2 channel bispectral index monitoring (BIS VISTAâ„¢, Aspect Medical Systems, Inc. MA, USA) during the anesthesia period. The EEG is then segmented into 4 s epochs and fast Fourier transform (FFT) analysis is performed for each of these segments. FFT of all these selected EEG segments are computed in the following frequency bands:
Delta: 1-4 Hz Theta: 4-8 Hz Alpha: 8-13 Hz Beta: 13-30 Hz
And then, the relative power of each frequency bands to the total power of the sum is calculated.</description>

    <measure>modified Yale preoperative anxiety score (mYPAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>before anesthesia induction (about 30 min before the surgery)</time_frame>
    <description>mYPAS is the assessment tool for measure the anxiety before induction. Higher score indicates higher anxiety.</description>

    <measure>PAED score during PACU stay</measure>
    <time_frame>During 60 min after PACU admission</time_frame>
    <description>On arrival at post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) and every 10 min from then, patients were checked PAED. The PAED scale is a validated observational measure of 5 aspects of child behavior (caregiver eye contact, purposeful movement, evidence of awareness of surroundings, restlessness, and inconsolability). Ratings are summed to produce a total score ranging from 0 to 20; greater scores indicate greater severity.</description>

    <description>On arrival and 10, 20, and 30 min after PACU admission, patients were checked Watcha scale as following 4-point scale
calm
crying, but can be consoled
Crying, cannot be consoled
Agitated and thrashing around
Higher score indicates higher agitation.</description>
