    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well strength training works in improving quality of life in patients
      with multiple myeloma. Weekly physical activity may improve bone recovery, reduce pain, and
      increase quality of life in patients with multiple myeloma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the feasibility of a 6 month, twice weekly supervised strength training in
      patients with multiple myeloma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the adherence rate of patients during a 6 month intervention program.

      II. To assess the eligibility and recruitment rate for the trial among patients with multiple
      myeloma.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Comparison of disease activity parameters, physical activity level, clinical symptoms,
      medication, psycho-oncological parameters before, during and after intervention.

      II. Determine factors that may influence a persons willingness to participate in the trial
      III. Investigate &quot;immune fitness&quot; by frequencies and function of immune cell subsets in
      peripheral blood

      OUTLINE: Patients complete strength training over 1 hour twice weekly for 6 months.

      After completion of study, patients are followed for up to 6 months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 - 1

          -  Have a diagnosis of multiple myeloma

          -  Show no signs of comorbidities, myeloma symptoms, or treatment side effects that would
             put them in danger when participating in the study according to the physician?s
             discretion

          -  Are able to understand and follow assessment and training procedures

          -  Participant or legal representative must understand the investigational nature of this
             study and sign an Independent Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board approved
             written informed consent form prior to receiving any study related procedure

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Current and symptomatic pathological fracture(s) or severely advanced instability of
             the musculo-skeletal system

          -  Acute bone instability as assessed by whole body low-dose computed tomography and
             evaluated by an experienced neuro- and spine surgeon

          -  Major comorbidities that would cause danger to the patient when participating in the
             study. Examples are cardiac or pulmonary and infectious diseases that would have a
             risk of progression if the patient took part in the study

          -  Unwilling or unable to follow protocol requirements

          -  Any condition which in the investigator?s opinion deems the participant an unsuitable
             candidate to take part in study intervention (comorbidities, myeloma symptoms,
             treatment side effects)
