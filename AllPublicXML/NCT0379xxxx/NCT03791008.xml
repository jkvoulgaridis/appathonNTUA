  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective is to assess the acceptability and feasibility of offering personalized
      breast cancer (BC) screening.

      The specific objectives are: 1) To design an information system; 2) To evaluate the barriers
      and facilitators of the coordination of health care services and the screening program; 3) To
      develop a proof of concept of personalized screening; and 4) To evaluate cost-effectiveness.

      Methodology:

        1. Prototype information system with basal and longitudinal variables relevant to a
           personalized screening system;

        2. Qualitative study with focus groups and survey. The attitude and acceptability on a
           sample of 210 health professionals will be assessed;

        3. Prospective observational study, for proof of concept. Participants will be
           professionals working in Primary Care, Population Breast Screening Program, or Hospital
           Breast Unit. It will include 385 women, aged 40-50 from the city of Lleida. Various
           indicators of acceptability and feasibility will be assessed in women and health
           professionals;

        4. Probabilistic analytical models will be used to evaluate cost-effectiveness.

      The present protocol addresses the specific objective number 3, the proof of concept of
      personalised screening.

      Expected results: The investigators expect to provide valuable and necessary information for
      the design of personalized screening.

    <measure>Attitude towards personalised breast cancer screening (by participant women)</measure>
    <time_frame>2-4 weeks after being informed of the individual breast cancer risk</time_frame>
    <description>Attitude scale with three items, one about the frequency of screening exams (ranges from 1 to 5). The other two items ask if participants are satisfied of being invited more/less frequently, in case that they have a higher/lower risk of breast cancer than the average women. They also range from 1 to 5. Total scores can range from 3 to 15. Higher scores indicate more positive attitudes. A positive attitude is defined as a total score greater or equal to 12.

    <description>Categorical variable with five categories: definitely will, likely to, unsure, not likely to, definitely will not. The absolute and relative frequencies of the five categories will be obtained. In addition, the variable will be dichotomized as intending to participate (definitely or likely) or not.

    <measure>Screening attitudes scale</measure>
    <time_frame>2-4 weeks after being informed of the individual breast cancer risk</time_frame>
    <description>General attitudes scale towards screening mammography. It will be measured using five items adapted from Hersch et al. (2015). Each item ranges from 1 to 5. Total scores can range from 5 to 25. A positive attitude is defined as a total score greater or equal to 20. Higher scores indicate more positive attitudes. Adapted from Hersch et al. (2015)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Attitude towards the measure of breast cancer risk</measure>
    <time_frame>2-4 weeks after being informed of the individual breast cancer risk</time_frame>
    <description>One categorical variable with four categories. It asks if the measure of breast cancer risk will do more harm than good, more good than harm, it depends, do not know. The absolute and relative frequencies of the four categories will be obtained. Following the Sekhon et al. review (2017)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Emotional impact of the measure of breast cancer risk</measure>
    <time_frame>2-4 weeks after being informed of the individual breast cancer risk</time_frame>
    <description>Three categorical variables with five categories, ranging from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (5). First variable: The information about the individual risk of breast cancer provides calmness. Second variable: Receiving information about risks produces anxiety. Third variable: The information about the individual risk of breast cancer makes me worry. The scores of the three items will not be added as a scale, they will be reported separately. Adapted from Hersch et al. (2015)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Preference with regard to the current screening, biennial between 50 and 69 years</measure>
    <time_frame>2-4 weeks after being informed of the individual breast cancer risk</time_frame>
    <description>Categorical variable with three categories. It asks what type of screening the participants would choose (personalized risk-based or &quot;one-size-fits-all&quot;)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Knowledge of the benefits and harms of breast cancer screening</measure>
    <time_frame>2-4 weeks after being informed of the individual breast cancer risk</time_frame>
    <description>Eleven conceptual knowledge questions (Yes/No) and four numerical knowledge questions with categories on the effect of screening. A total of 22 marks could be obtained, 11 coming from the questions on conceptual knowledge and 11 coming from the questions on numerical knowledge that measured absolute and relative values of the screening outcomes. The threshold to define adequate knowledge is to score at least 50% of the available marks, including at least one numerical mark, on all the three screening outcome subscales that refer to mortality reduction, overdiagnosis, and false positives.
