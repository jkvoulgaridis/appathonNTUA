  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The status of axillary lymph node (ALN) is an important reference indicator for breast cancer
      surgery and systemic treatment, which is also an important prognostic indicator for breast
      cancer. Therefore, it is extremely important for surgeons to accurately determine whether
      axillary lymph nodes have metastasis and the number of metastatic lymph nodes. The value of
      ultrasound diagnosing the status of axillary lymph nodes was controversial in recent
      publications. Therefore, there is a high need to prove the accuracy and precision of
      ultrasound for axillary lymph node metastasis in breast cancer patients. The aim of this
      study is to assess the usefulness of ultrasound in the diagnosis of axillary lymph node
      status in breast cancer patients by gathering in vivo and vitro ultrasonographic parameters
      to build a clinical useful categorization system

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To facilitate the non-invasive assessment of lymph node status preoperatively, we use
      ultrasound to detect lymph node metastasis. We designed this study to obtain in vivo and
      vitro ultrasound features and parameters. Before surgery, the detailed ultrasound features
      are collected during routine ultrasound examination. After the completion of the axillary
      surgery, fresh lymph node specimens are collected for in vitro ultrasound evaluation one by
      one in a specially-designed detection system. Statistical models are built to categorize the
      probability of metastasis of lymph node according to a proposed categorization system similar
      as BI-RADS(Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System), which is named NI-RADS (Node Imaging
      Reporting and Data System).
