  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of an oral solution of
      CDX-6114 when administered as a single dose in healthy volunteers
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a second Phase 1, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in approximately 24 healthy
      volunteers who are 18 to 55 years old. Three cohorts are planned each consisting of 8
      subjects; the cohorts as planned are 7.5, 15.0 and 22.5 g of CDX-6114 (or matching placebo)
      in oral solution. Increasing doses of CDX-6114 will be assessed sequentially un til the final
      dose is evaluated or any of the stopping criteria are reached. Subjects will each receive
      either a single dose of CDX-6114 or matching placebo, with food, and will then be followed
      for a total of 22 days (3 weeks).
