      This is a Phase I Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and
      Preliminary Efficacy of Oral Dosing of CM082 tablets in Chinese Patients With Advanced
      Malignant Solid Tumors

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center、open-label and non-controlled Phase 1 study which will be conducted
      in two parts: part A is the dose-escalation phase; part B is dose-expansion phase. The
      dose-escalation phase is guided by pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety, according to the
      standard 3+3 dose-escalation schema. CM082 tablets are taken orally with a starting dose of
      200 mg and a subsequent dose of 400, 600 and 800 mg. The way of administration is as follows:
      QD or BID. The primary objective of this study is to determine the maximum tolerable dose
      (MTD)、characteristics of dose-limited toxicity (DLT) and pharmacokinetics (PK). Secondary
      objectives include safety、tolerability and preliminary efficacy
