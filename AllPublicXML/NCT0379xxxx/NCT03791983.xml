      This study integrates traditional Chinese medicine syndromes and pulse diagnosis, and uses
      laser vibration overlay and functional cerebral angiography to understand the efficacy of
      scalp acupuncture against Parkinson's Disease.

      Traditional Chinese medicine does not have the term &quot; Parkinson's disease&quot;. According to the
      symptoms of the disease, it is closer to the &quot;Liver wind&quot;, &quot;Vibration&quot; and &quot;Chatter&quot; in
      Chinese medicine. Scalp needle stimulation can increase the content of dopamine in the brain
      and improve mitochondrial function and reduce the death of substantia nigra.

      This study integrates TCM syndromes and pulse diagnosis, and uses laser vibration overlay and
      functional brain image to understand the effect of scalp acupuncture on Parkinson's disease.
      The project will be carried out in two phases: the first phase is the pilot study, and 200
      patients with limb shakes were collected from the neurology clinic. After the laser vibration
      overlay test, 20 patients with mild tremors and diagnosed as Parkinson's disease were
      selected. , treated by Wen's scalp acupuncture. In the second phase, 80 Parkinson patients
      were enrolled, randomized to the treatment group and the control group, and the changes in
      TCM syndrome, pulse diagnosis and Parkinson scale were compared before and after treatment,
      and the fMRI and vibration overlay ratios were evaluated after scalp acupuncture.

    <measure>Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>2 Months</time_frame>
    <description>A comprehensive assessment of both motor and non-motor symptoms associated with Parkinson's. The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale is made up of 42 items. These items are divided into six sections which are separately &quot;evaluation of mentation, behavior, and mood&quot;, &quot;self-evaluation of the activities of daily life&quot;, &quot;clinician-scored monitored motor evaluation&quot;, &quot;complications of therapy&quot;, &quot;Hoehn and Yahr staging of severity of Parkinson's disease&quot; and &quot;Schwab and England ADL scale&quot;.The evaluation score for the first item to the 39th item is 0 to 4 points. The evaluation score for the 40th to the 42th item is 0 to 1 points.The higher score meand the worse condition. The sum of all the items'score is the score of the scale. Highr Rating Scales'scores indicate severe symptoms.</description>

    <measure>PET/MRI</measure>
    <time_frame>2 Months</time_frame>
    <description>PET/MRI combines time-of-flight PET with 3-Tesla MRI for exceptional image quality, more conclusive diagnosis, and lower radiation in a single exam. The powerful combination of molecular, functional and anatomic information provides essential data for critical treatment decisions.</description>
