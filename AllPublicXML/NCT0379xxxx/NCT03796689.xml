    <textblock>
      The PCORnet Blood Pressure Home Monitoring (BP HOME) Study is a patient-level randomized
      controlled trial that will compare the effectiveness of home blood pressure monitoring (HPBM)
      with versus without a linked Smartphone application (&quot;app&quot;) for helping patients with
      uncontrolled hypertension achieve a reduction in systolic blood pressure. The trial will be
      conducted within the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network (PCORnet), which
      supports a research network that enables distributed querying of EHR data in a common data
      model. It will also use the Eureka Research Platform, an online research platform hosted by
      UCSF that supports eConsent, online surveys, and data collection from devices such as HBPMs.
      Data from these two data sources will be used together to accomplish the study aims. Given
      that HBPM is the guideline-recommended standard of care (without specification of Smartphone
      linkage), the HPBM devices and the app are all commercially available and currently in use,
      and that clinicians, with input from patients, will maintain full control of how BP is
      clinically managed, we believe participation in the project poses minimal risk to
      participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We have designed a patient-level randomized controlled trial that will compare the
      effectiveness of Smartphone-linked versus standard HBPM for helping patients with
      uncontrolled hypertension achieve a reduction in their Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP), and
      patient satisfaction with the device. We aim to enroll 2000 patients who will be randomized
      in a 1:1 ratio to receive a Smartphone-linked or standard HBPM. We will use data from the
      electronic health record (EHR), an online patient portal, and the home BP monitor (in the
      Smartphone-linked arm) to collect outcome data for a period of at least 6 months (for the
      primary outcome), and up to 18 months (for secondary outcomes, depending on enrollment date).
      The primary BP control outcome will be reduction in SBP, by clinic measurements, at 6 months.
      The primary patient satisfaction outcome will be the Net Promoter Score derived from
      self-reported likelihood of recommending the device to a friend, at 6 months.

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Reduction is defined by the absolute difference between the SBP measured at the most recent outpatient clinical encounter at the time of enrollment, and the SBP measured at the most recent outpatient clinical encounter 6 months after enrollment. If more than 1 measurement is recorded during a single clinical encounter, the lower/lowest will be used.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Net Promoter Score</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>This score is assessed by asking a single question about likelihood of recommending the device to a friend, with options from 1-10 (10 being extremely likely). As per published methods, persons indicating 9 or 10 are considered &quot;Promoters&quot;; persons indicating 7 or 8 are &quot;Passives&quot;; and persons indicating 1-6 are &quot;Detractors&quot;. The score is calculated by taking the percent of Promoters and subtracting the percent of Detractors, yielding a score for each group ranging from -100 to 100.</description>

    <description>Participants in the Smartphone-linked arm of the study will receive an Omron 786N Home Blood Pressure Monitor (HBPM) that can be linked to the Omron Connect app via Bluetooth. They will also receive instructions about how to use their device and download the app and will be provided with publically available guidelines for HBPM. Participants will be instructed to use their device and app to take readings which they can track over time and share with their provider using the app.</description>
