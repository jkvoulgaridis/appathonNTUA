  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Frailty is the clinically recognizable medical condition, also called syndrome or phenotype,
      that is, the result of processes leading to an increased vulnerability for serious
      deteriorations in health and the diminished ability to cope with physical stressors.
      Recently, frailty has emerged as a significant risk factor for adverse postoperative
      outcomes. It is related to declines in energy, strength, and function as well as to an
      increased inflammatory state, including elevated levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6), C-reactive
      protein (CRP), and anelevated white blood cell count . Frailty, as defined Frailty, as
      defined in the landmark paper by Fried, included at least three of five of the following
      criteria: unintentional loss of weight, low physical activity, low energy, low grip strength,
      and a slowed walking speed. Since then, various frailty scoring lists have been designed to
      optimize the predictive value. One of these is the Edmonton Frail Scale (EFS), an instrument
      that can be assessed quickly, using only a simple questionnaire which usually does not
      require more than five minutes to be completed and which covers most domains of functioning,
      making it easy and fast to get a reliable impression of the degree of frailty.The aim of this
      study was to determine which factors,with emphasis on frailty, significantly influence
      postoperative outcome after elective noncardiac surgery as measured by the Comprehensive
      Complication Index (CCI).
