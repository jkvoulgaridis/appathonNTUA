  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral palsy(CP) consisted of a group of developmental disability in the field of motor
      function and is one of the major problems of pediatric neurology and at the present time
      there is no standard curative medical or surgical treatment for it .Stem cell therapy is one
      of a new and hopeful therapeutic methods of therapy for CP .This double blind study designed
      for the evaluation of safety and therapeutic effects of intrathecal hematopoietic and
      mesenchymal stem cells derived from allogenic umbilical cord in change and probable
      improvement of developmental functions of spastic CP participants between 4-14 years old and
      comparing with control group of CP participants without cell therapy . 108 cases recruited
      and randomly divided to 3 groups of 36 cases : hematopoietic stem cells derived from
      allogenic umbilical cord , Mesenchymal cells derived from allogenic umbilical cord and
      control group without injection and appearance simulating lumbar puncture without awareness
      of the patients and evaluators . Developmental functions and spasticity evaluated before
      intervention and will be done 1 , 3 , 6 and 12 months after injection . During this period
      neuro rehabilitation will be continued . Brain neuroimaging were done at the recruitment time
      and will be repeated after 12 months .

      CP is characterized by aberrant control of movement or posture of a patient , appearing early
      in life , and not the result of a recognized progressive or degenerative brain disease . CP
      is an umbrella term and represents a group of conditions (not a single disorder) , has a
      broad range of expression with a static condition originally within the developing central
      nervous system . CP Is a disturbance of movement and or posture . At the present time there
      is no standard medical or surgical treatment for it .Stem cell therapy is a new and promising
      treatment .

      150 cases of diparetic and quadiparetic spastic CP between 4-14 years old selected among the
      patients referred to the pediatric neurology outpatient department of Children's Medical
      Center Hospital (CMC) affiliated to Tehran University of Medical Sciences and had our
      inclusion criteria. HLA analysis were done for these patients and 36 cases of class 6 matched
      cases enrolled to the hematopoietic stem cells derived from allogenic umbilical cord (MNC)
      because of necessity of Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) matching in this type of cells and 72
      cases among the remaining patients randomly divided to Mesenchymal stem cells derived from
      allogenic umbilical cord (MSC) and control group . Therefore 108 cases enrolled in 3 divided
      group of 36 patients .

      Patients admitted to CMC hospital and intrathecal injection were done with sedation . Only
      one injection of stem cell was done for each patient . In the control group after insertion
      of the needle into the skin with an appearance of lumbar puncture simulation , no injection
      were done without the awareness of the patients or their parents. All of the patients
      admitted for one day and discharged the next day . As we wrote in the consent form for
      ethical consideration we are committed to perform stem cell injection for control
      participants free of charge after 12 months of the follow up . All of the participants will
      be referred for neurorehabilitation with a identical protocol .Both parents and clinical
      evaluators are not aware of the 3 divided groups and our study is double blind .Outcome
      measures will be evaluated 1, 3, 6. and 12 months after intervention .

      Standard brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) with Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS)
      and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) were done before injection as baseline and will be
      repeated after 12 months of clinical follow up . This study designed for the evaluation of
      therapeutic effects of intrathecal MNC and MSC derived from allogenic umbilical cord in
      change and probable improvement of developmental functions of spastic CP patients between
      4-14 years old in comparison with control group .Different scoring systems such as Gross
      Motor Functional Classification System (GMFCS) , Gross Motor Function Measure Score (GMFM66)
      , Manual Ability Classification System (MACS) , Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory
      (PEDI) , CP QOL , Life Habits Questionnaire and Modified Ashworth scale for spasticity were
      done at baseline and then will be repeated in follow ups until 12 months of final evaluation
      .

      Acute side effects and probable long term side effects will be reported and noted on our
      preformed questioners .

    <description>The Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) for cerebral palsy is based on self-initiated movement, with emphasis on sitting, transfers, and mobility. When defining a five-level classification system, our primary criterion has been that the distinctions between levels must be meaningful in daily life. Distinctions are based on functional limitations, the need for hand-held mobility devices (such as walkers, crutches, or canes) or wheeled mobility, and to a much lesser extent, quality of movement.
LEVEL I - Walks without Limitations LEVEL II - Walks with Limitations LEVEL III - Walks Using a Hand-Held Mobility Device LEVEL IV - Self-Mobility with Limitations; May Use Powered Mobility LEVEL V - Transported in a Manual Wheelchair We enrolled the patients with GMFCS more than class II and evaluate for change of this scale during the follow up period . Lower scores demonstrate better gross motor function of children .</description>

    <description>The Manual Ability Classification System (MACS)describes how children with cerebral palsy (CP)use their hands to handle objects in daily activities.
MACS describes five levels. The levels are based on the children's self-initiated ability to handle objects and their need for assistance or adaptation to perform manual activities in everyday life.
Handle objects easily and successfully
Handles most objects but with somewhat reduced quality and/or speed of achievement
Handle objects with difficulty; needs help to prepare and/or modify activities
Handles a limited selection of easily managed objects in adapted situations
Does not handle objects and has severely limited ability to perform even simple actions Level I include children with minor limitations, while children with severe functional limitations will usually be found at levels IV and V.

The items can be scored 0 or 1. 0 = unable or limited in capability to perform item in most situations 1 = capable of performing item in most situations, or item has been previously mastered and functional skills have progressed beyond this level.

    <measure>Change from baseline Diffuse Tensor Imaging (DTI) fiber count of periventricular white matter</measure>
    <time_frame>&quot;month&quot; 12</time_frame>
    <description>DTI is a modiﬁcation of the MRI technique that is sensitive to the Brownian motion of water molecules in biological tissues and is a new clinical method that can demonstrate the orientation and integrity of white matter ﬁbers . Periventricular white matter injury is a major form of brain injury observed in CP . Signiﬁcant reduction in DTI ﬁber count on the periventricular or other regions of cerebral white matter injury involving corticospinal tract , corticobulbar tract and superior thalamic radiation expected as baseline . Increase in DTI ﬁber count would be expected due to Stem Cell therapy and will be followed 12 months after injection .</description>
