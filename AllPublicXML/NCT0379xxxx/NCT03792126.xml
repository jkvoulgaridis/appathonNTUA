  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial will compare an Implicit Learning Approach (ILA) to usual care, during the
      rehabilitation of mobility post stroke.

      It is a multicentre, assessor blind, cluster randomised controlled pilot trial, with embedded
      feasibility study. It also includes a nested qualitative evaluation, designed to explore the
      views of participants and therapists.

    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measure of functional mobility in people with stroke.
Ordinal scale, measured through direct observation of function.
Score range from 0-40, with a higher score indicating better functional mobility status.</description>

    <description>Measure of postural control in people with stroke, from lying, sitting and standing postures.
Ordinal scale, measured through direct observation of function.
Score range from 0-36, with a higher score indicating better postural control.</description>

    <description>All mobility focussed rehabilitation sessions will utilise the Implicit Learning Approach (ILA), as usual care. This includes rehabilitation (delivered by a physiotherapist, occupational therapist or therapy assistant) that focusses on sitting, sit to stand, standing, stepping, transfers and walking. The content of therapy will be based on the treatment guidelines and intervention manual - and primarily involves changing the quantity and focus of attention of instructions and feedback.
As this is a clinically grounded, pragmatic trial, therapists will have freedom to tailor the specific content of each treatment session to patient need, whilst remaining true to the ILA.</description>
