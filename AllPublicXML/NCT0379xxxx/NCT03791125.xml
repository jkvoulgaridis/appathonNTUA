  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Salvianolic acid A has a variety of pharmacological effects, such as: anti-oxidation,
      scavenging oxygen free radicals, anti-fibrosis, anti-myocardial ischemia, anti-coagulation,
      anti-thrombosis, anti-tumor, etc. Professor Du Guanhua, at Institue of Materia Medica,
      Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, first discovered that salvianolic acid A can alleviate
      diabetic complications and improve patients' quality of life. With the support of major
      national science and technology projects, the preclinical research work of salvianolic acid A
      was completed, and the application was approved by the State Food and Drug Administration
      (Clinical Approval No.: 2016L06293). Peking University First Hospital was used as the
      research unit. This study is the first human clinical trial of the drug. The project leader
      of this study is Professor Cui Yimin from Peking University First Hospital. The sponsor of
      this project is Shandong Huizhi Pharmaceutical Technology Co., Ltd.
