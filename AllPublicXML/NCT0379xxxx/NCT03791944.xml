      The main purpose of the study was to verify that 3DV+TPS is non-inferior compared to existing
      imported TPS and superior to existing domestic TPS. A total of 100 patients were enrolled.
      The primary endpoint of the study was the objective response rate (ORR), and the secondary
      endpoint was the local control rate and the incidence of treatment-related side effects.
