  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Considering the high prevalence of childhood obesity worldwide, effective interventions are
      needed . Parental involvement in interventions and the use of web-based modalities appear to
      be promising approaches. The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of an innovative
      family and Web-based nutrition intervention called &quot;Family Nutriathlon&quot; on consumption of
      vegetables and fruit and dairy products and/or alternatives and on diet quality among
      children and their parents.

    <textblock>
      Forty-three families, with at least one child with a BMI &gt;85th percentile, participated in
      either the intervention (n=24) or control group (n=19) over an 8-week period. Families in the
      intervention (Family Nutriathlon) will participated in a nutrition challenge that aimed to
      increase their consumption and variety of fruits and vegetables and dairy products by
      recording their daily intakes using a Web-based platform. Families in the control group
      received recommendations based on general nutrition guidelines. Three follow-ups with a
      dietitian once every two weeks via Skype to assess progress were scheduled. A three-day food
      record was completed at baseline (week 0), immediately after (week 8) and 6 months after the
      intervention. A two-way repeated measures analysis of variance was used to assess changes in
      consumption of fruits and vegetables and dairy products, diet quality and dietary intakes
      between groups and over time.
