  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      XCELSIOR is a non-interventional data registry. Information about treatments, treatment
      decisions and rationale, and patient outcomes including safety and effectiveness of
      anti-cancer therapy and associated supportive care will be collected for analysis.

      XCELSIOR is patient-centric study for the registration of cancer patients, operations of a
      virtual tumor board, insight capture in clinical decision making, and collection of
      longitudinal, observational data in a cancer registry. Patient intake into XCELSIOR will
      occur through the Cancer Commons Web portal. This includes consent to participate in the data
      registry, including the collection and review of medical information by a Virtual Tumor
      Board, generation of patient-specific treatment options with supporting rationale, access to
      treatment access support services, and inclusion into a registry study that includes safety
      and efficacy outcomes tracking. Patients will be treated and tracked in their original
      treatment setting and the data generated will form part of a systematic framework combining
      expert judgment with artificial intelligence to maximize information gain and improve
      treatment option set development for individual cancer patients.
