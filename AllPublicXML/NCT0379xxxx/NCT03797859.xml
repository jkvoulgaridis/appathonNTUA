  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transnasal Humidified Rapid-Insufflation Ventilatory Exchange (THRIVE) denotes the use of
      high-flow humidified nasal oxygen system (for example OptiflowÂ®) as an alternative
      ventilation modality for an anesthetized patient without spontaneous respiration. This method
      requires only basic airway management manoeuvres to keep the airway open and provides both
      stable longterm oxygenation as well as apneic ventialtion.

      We plan to evaluate this methods physiological performance under standardized conditions of
      airway management by frequent, repeated arterial blood gas analyses.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      THRIVE is previously shown feasible as sole mode of ventilation in selected patients during
      general anaesthesia for minor laryngeal surgery for a limited time up to 30 minutes, where
      direct laryngoscopy was required and applied throughout the procedure. A stable oxygenation
      and a degree of ventilation was observed. However, a slowly developed respiratory acidosis
      was also observed over time.

      Existing physiologic studies on high flow humidified nasal oxygen suggest that closed mouth
      breathing enhance the effects of the high flows of oxygen levels applied by increasing the
      airway pressures and thereby enhance gas exchange in the lungs. Currently, it is unclear
      whether the efficiency of THRIVE depends on the particular circumstances of airway
      management. Physiologic characterization of THRIVE performance under standardized conditions
      of airway management and under close monitoring by systematic analysis of blood gas dynamics
      over time during general anesthesia is needed.

      We plan to study the blood gas dynamics during THRIVE apnea ventilation during general
      anesthesia, where the airway is managed only by jaw-thrust for up to 60 minutes. The patients
      will be closely monitored by repetitive arterial blood gasses to evaluate blood gas dynamics
      and development of respiratory acidosis. Desaturation or respiratory acidosis with pH under
      7.15 and/or PaCO2-rise &gt; 12 kPa will lead to cessation of THRIVE.
