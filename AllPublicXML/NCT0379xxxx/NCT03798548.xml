      Adult patients scheduled to undergo TAVR were randomized to receive brief bedside cognitive
      behavioral therapy for depression/anxiety or treatment as usual.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression and anxiety are common symptoms in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and
      associated with increased cardiac morbidity and decreased functional status. Cognitive
      behavioral therapy (CBT) has been shown to be an effective intervention to treat these
      symptoms after cardiac surgery, but has not yet been studied in patients undergoing less
      invasive cardiac procedures such as Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR). This study
      will examine the effect of CBT on symptoms of anxiety and depression in patients undergoing
      TAVR.

      The CBT protocol was loosely structured on the Managing Depression and Anxiety using
      Education and Skills (MADES) protocol described in Dao and colleagues (2011). The current
      intervention was designed to address the needs of individuals who may develop anxiety or
      depression symptoms post-TAVR. The CBT intervention consisted of four 30 to 60-minute bedside
      treatment sessions with a trained clinician while the participant was hospitalized for TAVR.

      Main outcome measures were self-reported symptoms of depression and anxiety as measured by
      the Beck Depression Inventory-II and State Trait Anxiety Inventory Form Y1. Secondary
      outcomes included health related quality of life and hospital length of stay.

    <measure>Change from Baseline Score on Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II)</measure>
    <time_frame>An average of 3 days post TAVR Procedure, 1-Month Follow Up</time_frame>
    <description>21-item self-report questionnaire with good reliability and validity in assessing symptoms of depression. Total score range 0-63 with higher scores indicating a worse outcome. Total BDI-II scores are interpreted as follows, 0-13: minimal, 14-19: mild, 20-28: moderate, 29-63: severe. In this study, a score of 14 or greater, and 20 or greater, were used define subpopulations with significant symptoms of depression on the BDI-II.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline Score on State Trait Anxiety Inventory Form YI (STAI-YI)</measure>
    <time_frame>An average of 3 days post TAVR Procedure, 1-Month Follow Up</time_frame>
    <description>20-item self-report questionnaire with good internal consistency and construct validity in assessing symptoms of anxiety. Total score range 20-80 with higher scores indicating a worse outcome. The recommended cutoff score for clinically significant anxiety is 39 but a recent validity study of anxiety disorders in cardiac patients found ≥ 40 as an optimal cutoff score for screening the presence of an anxiety disorder. In this study, a score of 40 or greater, and 46 or greater, were used to define subpopulations with significant symptoms of anxiety on the STAI-Y1.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline Score on Minnesota Living With Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>1-Month Follow Up</time_frame>
    <description>21-item self-report questionnaire designed to measure the effects of heart failure and treatments for heart failure on and individual's quality of life. Total score range 0-105. The total score is considered a measurement of heart failure severity as indicated by its adverse effect on the respondent's life over the past month. In this study, the MLHFQ total score was used as a continuous measure of heart failure related quality of life. Higher scores indicate a worse outcome.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline Score on 12-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF12v2)</measure>
    <time_frame>1-Month Follow Up</time_frame>
    <description>An abbreviated version of the 36-item Short Form Health Survey, which is a well-established measure assessing dimensions of mental and physical health. In this study, PCS and MCS summary scores were used as continuous measures of health-related quality of life. Scoring procedures involve computer-based scoring algorithms to calculate two summary scores, the physical component summary score (PCS) and mental component summary score (MCS), on a scale from 0 to 100 with a mean of 50 ± 10 that is normally distributed according to the adult U.S. population. Higher scores indicate a better outcome.</description>
