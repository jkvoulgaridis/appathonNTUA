  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart rate (HR) is not routinely assessed during newborn resuscitations in low- and
      lower-middle income countries (LMICs). Many non-breathing newborns classified as fresh
      stillbirths have a heartbeat and are live born. The effect of a low-cost monitor for
      measuring HR on the problem of misclassification of stillbirths in LMICs is unknown.

      Knowledge of HR during newborn resuscitation might also result in timely administration of
      appropriate interventions, and improvement in outcomes. Helping Babies Breathe (HBB), a
      resuscitation algorithm developed by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), is widely
      accepted as the standard of care for newborn resuscitation in low-resource settings. In
      keeping with the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) recommendations
      that HR be measured during newborn resuscitation, HBB calls for HR assessment after 1 minute
      of positive-pressure ventilation with good chest movement (or sooner if there is a helper who
      can palpate/auscultate heart rate). However, given the frequent reality of a single provider
      attending deliveries in LMICs, as well as the currently available methods for assessing HR
      (i.e. palpitation or auscultation), assessment of HR is challenging to perform without
      delaying or stopping the provision of other life-saving interventions such as bag and mask
      ventilation. The effect of low-cost, continuous HR monitoring to guide resuscitation in these
      settings is unknown.

      NeoBeat is a low-cost, battery-operated device designed by Laerdal Global Health for the
      measurement of newborn HR. The device can be placed rapidly on a newborn by a single
      provider, and within 5 seconds, displays HR digitally. A preliminary trial of NeoBeat in 349
      non-breathing newborns in Tanzania detected a HR in 67% of newborns classified as
      stillbirths, suggesting up to two thirds of fresh stillbirths may be misclassified in similar
      settings.

      This trial will evaluate: 1) the effectiveness of HBB in combination with NeoBeat for vital
      status detection on reduction of reported stillbirths, and 2) the effectiveness of HR-guided
      HBB on effective breathing at 3 minutes.

      The primary hypothesis is that implementation of HBB with measurement of HR using NeoBeat
      will decrease the reported total stillbirth rate by 15% compared to standard care. The
      secondary hypothesis is that implementation of HR-guided HBB will increase the proportion of
      newborns not breathing well at birth who are effectively breathing at 3 minutes by 50%
      compared to HBB with NeoBeat.
