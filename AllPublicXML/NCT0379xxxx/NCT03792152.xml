  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical randomized trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      rivaroxaban compared with warfarin in dissolving the LAA thrombus in patients with atrial
      fibrillation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Left atrial appendage (LAA) thrombosis is a common complication of atrial fibrillation and
      will significantly increase the incidence of stroke in patients. Warfarin is a classical oral
      anticoagulant which can dissolve thrombus, but its clinical use has many limitations and it
      requires strict monitoring of coagulation. Recently, some studies have shown that NOAC
      (dabigatran / rivaroxaban) can dissolve left atrial appendage thrombosis. The application of
      rivaroxaban in the X-TRA study dissolved 41.5% of LAA thrombus after 6 weeks, indicating its
      potential clinical application prospects. Whether rivaroxaban is not inferior to warfarin for
      rapid dissolution of LAA thrombus, there is no prospective randomized controlled trial.
