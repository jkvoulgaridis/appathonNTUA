  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to assess the tolerability of peanut protein in
      pediatric patients (6-17 years old) treated with dupilumab monotherapy, in which tolerability
      is defined as the proportion of patients who safely pass a double-blind placebo-controlled
      food challenge (DBPCFC) at week 24.

      The secondary objectives are:

        -  To determine whether dupilumab treatment improves peanut tolerability, defined as a
           change in the cumulative tolerated dose (log transformed) of peanut protein during a
           DBPCFC

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of dupilumab treatment in peanut allergic
           patients

        -  To evaluate the effects of dupilumab treatment on the levels of peanut-specific
           Immunoglobulin E (IgE)

        -  To evaluate the treatment effect of dupilumab on the average wheal size after a titrated
           skin prick test (SPT), as measured by area under curve (AUC) of the average wheal size
           induced by peanut extract at different concentrations

        -  To assess the incidence of treatment-emergent anti-drug antibodies (ADA) to dupilumab in
           patients over time

             screening DBPCFC conducted in accordance with Practical Issues in Allergology, Joint
             United States/European Union Initiative (PRACTALL) guidelines. And not experiencing
