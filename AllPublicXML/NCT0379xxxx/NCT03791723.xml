    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical randomized trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      Sacubitril/Valsartan compared with ARB in improving cardiac remodeling in patients With
      Enlarged Left Atrium Diameter and Persistent AF.

    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation is one of the most common arrhythmia around the word. Prolonged atrial
      fibrillation may lead to structural changes in the heart such as atrial enlargement, which is
      an important risk factor for heart failure. Sacubitril/Valsartan is a new drug for the
      treatment of heart failure, previous studies have shown that it has a good effect in
      improving cardiac function. For patients with persistent atrial fibrillation and enlarged
      left atrial, the effect of reversing cardiac remodeling after catheter ablation is unclear.
      Some studies have described its positive effects in improving cardiac remodeling, but there
      is still no large-scale randomized controlled trial to further confirm. The investigators
      hypothesized that Sacubitril/Valsartan can reverse cardiac remodeling in patients with
      persistent atrial fibrillation and enlarged left atrium compared with ARB after catheter
      ablation.
