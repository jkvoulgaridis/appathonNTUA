    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and feasibility of preoperative immune checkpoint therapy
      with concurrent chemoradiotherapy in patients with locally advanced esophageal squamous cell
      carcinoma. And this study will provide valuable information for further clinical trials of
      preoperative pembrolizumab and other immune checkpoint therapy in esophageal cancer
      treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Esophageal cancer ranks the eighth most common cancer (the fifth most common cancer in
      China), while ESCC is the most common subtype in Asia (more than 90 % in china). Radical
      resection is thought to be the mainstay of esophageal cancer treatment and preoperative CRT
      is well applied in treating locally advanced esophageal cancer. In a multicohort, phase IB
      study, pembrolizumab was used in 23 unresectable esophageal cancer patients. In this clinical
      trial, the incidence of grade 3 treatment-related adverse events was 39 % without the
      appearance of grade 4 and higher-grade adverse event, while the overall response rate reached
      30 %. The safety of immune checkpoint therapy for unresected esophageal cancers using
      nivolumab, a different PD-1 monoclonal antibody, has also been confirmed by high quality
      clinical trials.

      This study will evaluate the safety and feasibility of preoperative immune checkpoint therapy
      using pembrolizumab with concurrent chemoradiotherapy in patients with locally advanced
      esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. And this study will provide valuable information for
      further clinical trials of preoperative pembrolizumab and other immune checkpoint therapy in
      esophageal cancer.
