  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2 study to evaluate humanized CD19 redirected autologous T cells (or huCART19
      cells) with CD19 expressing relapsed and refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. This
      study is targeting pediatric and young adult patients aged 1-29 years with CD19+ B cell
      malignancies in newly diagnosed B-ALL patients predicted to have an exceedingly poor outcome
      with conventional chemotherapy, in high-risk first relapse, or and in second or greater
      relapse in this phase 2 trial. In addition, a second cohort will test the efficacy of
      huCART19 in patients with poor response to prior B cell directed engineered cell therapy.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Relapsed or refractory B-cell ALL:

          -  Cohort A: Patients with newly diagnosed VHR B-ALL or high-risk relapse of B-ALL who
             meet one of the following criteria:

               -  Newly diagnosed NCI HR B-ALL with induction failure: M3 marrow (&gt;25% blasts) at
                  end of induction OR

               -  First marrow relapse of B-ALL at &lt; 36 months from diagnosis OR

               -  2nd or greater relapse OR

               -  Any relapse after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and ≥
                  4 months from stem cell transplant (SCT) at enrollment OR

               -  Refractory disease defined as having not achieved a minimal residual disease
                  (MRD)_-negative and/or cerebral spinal fluid (CSF)-negative complete response
                  (CR) after ≥ 2 chemotherapy regimens/cycles of frontline therapy or 1 cycle of
                  reinduction therapy for patients in first relapse OR

               -  Ineligible for allogeneic stem cell transplant

          -  Cohort B: Patients previously treated with B cell directed engineered cell therapy who
             meet one of the following criteria:

               -  partial response or no response to prior cell therapy

               -  CD19+ relapse after prior cell therapy

               -  demonstrated early (≤6 months from infusion) B cell recovery suggesting loss of
                  engineered cells

          -  Patients with prior or current history of CNS3 disease will be eligible if central
             nervous system (CNS) disease is responsive to therapy

          -  Documentation of CD19 tumor expression in bone marrow, peripheral blood, CSF, or tumor
             tissue by flow cytometry at relapse

          -  Adequate organ function

          -  Age 1-29 years

          -  Adequate performance status

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Active hepatitis B or active hepatitis C.

          -  HIV Infection.

          -  Active acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) requiring systemic therapy.

          -  Concurrent use of systemic steroids at the time of cell infusion or cell collection,
             or a condition, in the treating physician's opinion, that is likely to require steroid
             therapy during collection or after infusion. Steroids for disease treatment at times
             other than cell collection or at the time of infusion are permitted. Use of
             physiologic replacement hydrocortisone or inhaled steroids is permitted as well.

          -  CNS3 disease that is progressive on therapy, or with CNS parenchymal lesions that
             might increase the risk of CNS toxicity.

          -  Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women.

          -  Uncontrolled active infection.
