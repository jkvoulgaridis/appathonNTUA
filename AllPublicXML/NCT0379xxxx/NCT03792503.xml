    <textblock>
      In order to further improve the therapeutic efficacy of advanced no-squamous non-small cell
      lung cancer patients, improve the life cycle, this study will take the standard after
      treatment pemetrexed combined other anti-angiogenesis drugs to maintain as the direction, so
      as to provide more over the evidence for the treatment of advanced NSCLC.

    <textblock>
      In patients with advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer, patients receiving
      pemetrexed and platinum-based chemotherapy after 4 cycles of non-progressive evaluation were
      treated with pemetrexed plus apatinib. Until the disease progresses, there are intolerable
      side effects or the patient requests to withdraw from the study. It is planned to include 20
      subjects.

      Dosing regimen： Apatinib 500mg po qd (If there is a 3-4 degree toxic side reaction after 14
      days of administration, the dose can be lowered to 250mg qd); Pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 d1×q3w;
      Until the patient progresses, the toxicity is intolerable, the patient withdraws his
      knowledge, or the investigator judges that the medication must be discontinued.

    <description>Investigators will assess treatment response according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1（RECIST1.1）.DCR includes CR, PR, SD.Complete remission (CR): All target lesions disappeared completely except for nodular disease. All target nodules must be reduced to normal size (short axis &lt;10 mm). All target lesions must be evaluated.Partial Remission (PR): The sum of the diameters of all measurable target lesions is ≥30% below baseline. The sum of the target nodules uses a short diameter, and the sum of all other target lesions uses the longest diameter. All target lesions must be evaluated.Stable disease (SD): The extent of target lesion reduction did not reach PR, and the degree of increase did not reach PD level. Between the two, the minimum value of the sum of diameters could be used as a reference.</description>

    <description>HRQoL will be evaluated based on the patient's response to the FACT-L questionnaire. The FACT-L questionnaire was validated to assess the quality of life of patients with lung cancer. The 36-item questionnaire consists of four aspects: physical status, functional status, emotional status, and social/family status. The answer consists of &quot;none&quot; to &quot;very&quot; different levels of choice. The FACT-L questionnaire has a total score of 0 to 136 points. Higher scores indicate poor patient quality of life.</description>
