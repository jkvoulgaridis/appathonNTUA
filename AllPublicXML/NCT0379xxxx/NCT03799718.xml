      A multidose open-label study with autologous Mesenchymal Stromal Stem Cells Secreting

    <textblock>
      An open-label study with a single treatment arm involving 20 participants with progressive MS
      at multiple investigational study sites. After providing informed consent, participants
      meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomized and approximately 4 weeks
      later will undergo a bone-marrow aspiration (BMA). Each participants will receive three
      Intrathecal cell transplantations within 16 weeks and will be followed for 12 weeks for
      safety and efficacy.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Males and females ages 18 to 65 years old, inclusive, at the Screening Visit.

          2. Clinical diagnosis of Progressive MS (Primary and Secondary) based on the 2017 revised
             MacDonald Criteria and confirmation by the Investigator that the disease has entered
             the progressive stage for at least 6 months prior to enrollment.

          3. No evidence of clinical MS relapse or high dose pulse corticosteroid treatment within
             6 months prior to screening

          4. Disability status at screening with an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)
             3.0-6.5, inclusive.

          5. Able to walk 25 feet in 60 seconds or less.

          6. Stable dose of non-excluded MS Disease Modifying Therapy for at least 6 months prior
             to Screening Visit (Visit 1).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior stem cell therapy of any kind.

          2. Active participation in any other MS interventional study or use of unapproved MS
             investigational therapy within 90 days prior to the Screening Visit (Visit 1).

          3. Inability to lie flat for the duration of intrathecal cell transplantation and/or bone
             marrow biopsy, or inability to tolerate study procedures for any other reason.

          4. History of clinically significant autoimmune disease (excluding thyroid disease) that
             may confound study results, myelodysplastic or myeloproliferative disorder, leukemia
             or lymphoma, whole body irradiation, hip fracture, or severe scoliosis.

          5. Any unstable clinically significant medical condition other than multiple sclerosis
             (e.g., within six months of Screening Visit (Visit 1), had myocardial infarction,
             angina pectoris, and/or congestive heart failure), treatment with anticoagulants that,
             in the opinion of the investigator, would compromise the safety of participants.

          6. Any history of malignancy within the previous 5 years, except for non-melanoma
             localized skin cancers (with no evidence of metastasis, significant invasion, or
             reoccurrence within three years of Screening Visit (Visit 1)).

          7. Serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) value &gt;3.0
             times the upper normal limit.

          8. Serum creatinine value &gt;2.0 times the upper normal limit.

          9. Positive test for Hepatitis B (HBV; surface antigen (HBsAg) and antibodies to core
             antigen (IgG and IgM anti-HBc)), Hepatitis C (HCV), or human immunodeficiency virus
             (HIV) 1 and 2.

         10. Current use of immunosuppressant medication or use of such medication within 6 months
             of study enrollment (aside from Rituximab or other approved B-cell immunotherapy).
             Alemtuzumab (Lemtrada), Cladribine (NDA submitted), Natalizumab (Tysabri), S1P
             modulators (Gilenya) are excluded for safety reasons due to the known risk of systemic
             autoimmune disease, malignancy, opportunistic infections, and cardiovascular toxicity
             associated with these therapies, as well as theoretical effects on MSC-NTF cell homing
             and migration, that may be associated with Natalizumab and/or S1P modulators
             (Gilenya).

         11. Any history of acquired or inherited immune deficiency syndrome.

         12. Any history of either substance abuse within the past year, or unstable psychiatric
             disease according to the Investigator's judgment.

         13. Pregnant women or women currently breastfeeding.

         14. Subjects for whom MRI is contraindicated (i.e., have a pacemaker or other metallic
             implanted device, or are unable to remain in the machine for period of time needed to
             acquire a scan.
