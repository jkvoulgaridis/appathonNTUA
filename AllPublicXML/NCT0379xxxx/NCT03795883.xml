    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to test the thrombotic potential of various heart chambers including
      left atrium, left atrial appendage, right atrium and peripheral veins. Blood samples will be
      taken from the different chambers in 50 patients admitted for standard pulmonary vein
      ablation and compared to patients without atrial fibrillation admitted for left sided supra
      ventricular tachycardia or mitral clip. Thrombin generation parameters will be assessed by
      the calibrated automated thrombogram.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia, there is a strong correlation between
      atrial fibrillation and embolic stroke. In order to lower the risk for embolic stroke
      anticoagulation is recommended for patients with CHADS-VASC score equal or above 2. The
      mechanism for thrombus formation in the left atrium is thought to be caused by various
      factors 1. blood stasis due to the loss of atrial kick 2. endothelial dysfunction 3. blood
      hemostatic alteration leading to procoagulant state.

      Previous studies demonstrated increased thrombin generation in the left atrium in patients
      with atrial fibrillation, when compared to other heart chambers and when compared to control
      group in patients with structurally normal heart.

      In recent years calibrated automated thrombogram (CAT) is considered a good indicator for
      total thrombotic activity in hypercoagulable states.

      In the current study the investigators aim to test the thrombotic potential of various heart
      chambers including left atrium, left atrial appendage, right atrium and peripheral veins.
      Blood samples will be taken from the different chambers in 50 patients admitted for standard
      pulmonary vein ablation without changing the course of the procedure. Thrombin generation
      parameters will be assessed by the calibrated automated thrombogram. A control group composed
      of 50 patients admitted for standard left sided supra ventricular tachycardia ablation or
      patients admitted to mitral clip procedure without the presence of atrial fibrillation.

      In addition demographic data,CHADS-VASC score, atrial fibrillation burden, echocardiographic
      and cardiac CT parameters will be collected.
