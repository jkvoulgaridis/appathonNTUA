  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The anticipated objectives of this study are: 1) to understand the pathogenesis and molecular
      typing of breast cancer patients in China (mainly HER2 overexpression, triple negative and
      hormone receptor-positive patients) by detecting DNA and RNA in tumor tissue (fresh tissue or
      paraffin section), and to compare the similarities and differences between the western
      population and Chinese population; 2) plasma samples of patients with HER2 overexpression ,
      hormone receptor-positive and triple negative (ER, PR, HER2 expression negative) were
      sequenced for ctDNA and ctRNA, to find out whether there are genes or gene sets related to
      therapeutic effect; 3) to study the specific changes of liquid molecular detection results
      according to the previous research results, and establish mathematical models to predict and
      monitor the effects of targeted therapy and endocrine therapy; 4) to compare liquid biopsy
      and imaging and clinical features in monitoring clinical therapeutic effect, and to elaborate
      the advantages and disadvantages of liquid biopsy and conventional imaging; 5) to provide
      molecular detection basis for follow-up clinical research and screening for targets of new
      drugs.
