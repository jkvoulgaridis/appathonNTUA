      This study will assess differences in inflammatory proteins, lipoprotein composition,
      cholesterol efflux and HDL-proteome in moderate-to-severe pediatric psoriasis who at baseline
      begin systemically administered therapy vs: a) healthy controls; and b) patients with milder
      psoriasis.

        The investigators plan to recruit approximately 120 subjects total. Subjects will be
        divided into 4 groups: i) patients to be treated only topically (n=30); ii) patients with
        moderate-to-severe psoriasis who begin systemic treatment (n=30; ~15 DMARDs and 15
        biologics); iii) age-, sex- and BMI percentile-matched controls (n=30); iv) patients being
        treated with isotretinoin for acne (n=30).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Children ages 6-17 years of all races/ethnicities with plaque and/or extensive guttate
             psoriasis for at least 6 months and on topical or systemic therapy

          -  Patients in the systemic group can be starting a medication for the first time OR
             transitioning from another systemic if unresponsive and on that previous treatment for
             â‰¤ 3 months.

          -  Patients may concurrently have psoriatic arthritis if initiation of a systemic
             medication is warranted by skin severity.

          -  Children ages 6-17 years of all races/ethnicities with acne being treated with
             isotretinoin

          -  Children ages 6-17 years of all races/ethnicities without plaque or guttate psoriasis
             and history of severe acne or treatment with isotretinoin as controls.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients less than 6 years of age or 18 years and older

          -  Patients with congenital heart disease, prior cardiac catheterizations/surgeries, or
             on cardiac medications in the past two years other than for hypertension (eg, calcium
             channel-blockers, beta-blockers and vasotropic medications).

          -  Patients who have other systemic inflammatory diseases (including atopic dermatitis,
             severe acne, inflammatory bowel disease, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, connective
             tissue diseases and/or other autoimmune diseases).

          -  Patients who have active infection or malignancy or have suffered from infection
             requiring oral or parenteral antibiotic in past 2 weeks.

          -  Patients and parents/caregivers unable to give written informed consent.
