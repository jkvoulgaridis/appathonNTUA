    <textblock>
      Cross-sectional analysis about effectiveness and safety of continuous subcutaneous insulin
      infusion compared to multiple dose insulin injections in T1DM adult patients in routine
      clinical practice.

      All clinical variables are gathered from four EMR softwares (Mambrino XXI, Carelink Pro®,
      Emminens eConecta® and FreeStyle Libre®).

      Data analysis is conducted using SPSS (Chicago, IL) statistics software. Results are
      presented as mean ± SD values or percentages. A paired Student's t-test or a Wilcoxon
      signed-rank test were used for the analysis of differences. Comparisons between proportions
      were analyzed using a chi-squared test. A P value &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically
      significant.

      The protocol was approved by the reference Castilla-La Mancha Public Health Institute Ethic
      Committee. All participants provided written informed consent.
