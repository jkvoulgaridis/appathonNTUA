  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Conduct a cross-sectional analysis of the nutritional status of individuals with PKU treated
      with pegvaliase for one or more years or who have followed an unrestricted diet for 6 or more
      months while on pegvaliase treatment. We will evaluate laboratory markers of nutritional
      status, including markers of protein and micronutrient nutriture. In addition, a three-day
      food record and food frequency questionnaire will be obtained to assess protein intake and
      overall diet quality.

    <description>&quot;The Healthy Eating Index-2015 (HEI-2015) is… used to assess how well a set of foods aligns with the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. The HEI-2015 includes 13 components that can be summed to a maximum total score of 100 points. The components capture… adequacy components and… moderation components. For the adequacy components, higher scores reflect higher intakes that meet or exceed the standards. For the moderation components, higher scores reflect lower intakes because lower intakes are more desirable. A higher total score indicates a diet that aligns better with the Dietary Guidelines.&quot; - https://www.cnpp.usda.gov/sites/default/files/healthy_eating_index/HEI2015-ScoresForAmericans.pdf
Adequacy components include total fruits, whole fruits, total vegetables, greens and beans, whole grains, dairy, total protein foods, seafood and plant proteins, fatty acids. Moderation components include refined grains, sodium, added sugars, and saturated fats.</description>
