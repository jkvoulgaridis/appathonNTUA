      This study investigates the potential curative properties of gamma delta T-cells obtained
      from a blood-related donor of an AML patient.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, safety and efficacy, escalating dose, single arm study on 9 adult
      subjects (3 cohorts) and 3+3 design will be used. HLA typed patients and potential
      blood-related donors will be screened for comorbidities. Suitably matched or haploidentical
      family donors will be selected according to protocol specified criteria and institutional
      guidelines of participating site.

    <description>Quality of life determined by European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire 'C30' which comprises 30 items (i.e. single questions), 24 of which are aggregated into nine multi-item scales, that is, five functioning scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional and social), three symptom scales (fatigue, pain and nausea/vomiting) and one global health status scale. All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level. Thus a high score for a functional scale represents a high / healthy level of functioning, a high score for the global health status / QoL represents a high QoL, but a high score for a symptom scale / item represents a high level of symptomatology / problems.</description>
