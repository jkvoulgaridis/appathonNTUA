    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine two approaches for improving long-term weight loss
      success. All participants will receive a 12-week, in-person standard behavioral weight loss
      program followed by either 12 weeks of yoga instruction or 12 weeks of cooking/dietary
      education instruction (determined via randomization procedures). Assessments of weight,
      physical activity, dietary behaviors, and psychosocial factors will occur at baseline, 3, 6,
      and 12 months.
