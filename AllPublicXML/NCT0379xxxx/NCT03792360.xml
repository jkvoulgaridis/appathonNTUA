  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Determine safety and feasibility of using institutionally prepared autologous, uncultured SVF
      on patients with aerodigestive fistulae secondary to malignancy, trauma or surgery.

  <detailed_description>

      The primary aim of this pilot study is to evaluate the feasibility, time, cost, safety,
      limitations, and efficacy of the use of institutionally processed SVF for management and
      closure of aero-digestive fistulae. This pilot study would help identify design issues and
      the potential success of fistulae closure by the means of autologous SVF administration
      before a full-scale trial is performed.

      A secondary aim is the closure of aero-digestive fistulae along with characteristics such as
      size, etiology, recurrence, localization, and the association of these factors withoutcome
      after SVF administration. The SVF quantification, characterization and differentiation in
      vitro will be described.

      This process will help identify the type of fistulae that are susceptible to closure with
      human cell therapy.

    <description>The stromal vascular fraction (SVF), isolated when fresh lipoaspirates are enzymatically digested with a collagenase, contains a heterogeneous cellular and extracellular milieu. SVF is an aqueous fraction, consisting of endothelial cells and their precursors, macrophages, smooth muscle cells, lymphocytes, pericytes, pre-adipocytes and actual AMSCs.</description>
