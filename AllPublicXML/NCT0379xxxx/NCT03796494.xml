  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, single-blind, split-mouth clinical trial to evaluate the performance of
      peri-implant tissues (bone and soft tissues) in conventionally loaded Galimplant implants,
      using a classic multi-position, anti-rotational abutment, comparing it to the new
      multi-abutment aesthetic slim anti-rotational placed both at the time of the implant surgery.
      To this end, 80 Galimplant implants with a diameter of 4 mm and 10 mm in length will be
      placed in areas of mature scarred post-extraction bone. Patients be divided into 2 study
      groups, group C: straight pillar; Group T: Slim pillar. The bone and clinical radiological
      stability of the peri-implant tissues will be evaluated at 6 weeks post-surgery and at 6-12
      months post-prosthetic loading.

    <description>Randomly and following the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the implants will be placed with the normal preparation protocol. Investigators will evaluate the immediate post-surgical stability of implants and peri-implant tissues through the Ostell system, based on the resonance frequency analysis (RFA). The implant stability quotient (ISQ) is the value on a scale that indicates the level of stability and osseointegration in dental implants. The scale ranges from 1 to 100, with higher values indicating greater stability. The acceptable stability range lies between 55-85 ISQ</description>

    <description>Randomly and following the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the implants will be placed with the normal preparation protocol. We will load the crowns 8 weeks after implant surgery. Investigators will evaluate the stability at different moments, 8 weeks, 6 months and 12 months. The implant stability quotient (ISQ) is the value on a scale that indicates the level of stability and osseointegration in dental implants. The scale ranges from 1 to 100, with higher values indicating greater stability. The acceptable stability range lies between 55-85 ISQ. ISQ values are obtained using resonance frequency analysis (RFA).</description>

    <description>At the moment of placing the implant, clinical variables will be evaluated: depth of probing (distance from the peri-implant margin to the most depth of the peri-implant sulcus). This will be the basal measure of the implant stability and peri-implant tissue levels. Investigators will calculate the difference between the basal measure and the future measurements.</description>

    <description>After the implantation, we´ll load the temporary 8 weeks after the implantation. Investigators will evaluate the bone level stability at 6 weeks in both groups, through a dental X-ray radiography. The bone stability will be measured as a difference between de basal bone level and the actual one in mm.</description>

    <description>After the implantation, we´ll load the definitive prostheses in 8 weeks. Investigators will evaluate the peri-implant tissue stability by measuring the probing depth or just in case, the recession of the gingival margin. The stability will be given by the differences between both measures, basal and actual in mm.</description>
