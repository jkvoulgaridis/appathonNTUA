  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, with the progress in the treatment field, Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer(NSCLC)
      has become the most successful cancer species in precision medicine. Patients with positive
      driving genes such as EGFR, ALK, ROS1, BRAF and so on have clearly targeted drugs, which
      bring survival benefits to patients.However, about 50% of patients still lack a clear driving
      gene target, which has become the focus of current research.In the field of wild-type NSCLC
      with negative driver genes, the classic first-line treatment regimen is the two-drug regimen
      containing platinum.The study by Kimura T in the first-line treatment of 54 wild-type
      advanced NSCLC patients with carboplatin and pemetrexed showed that the ORR, mPFS and mOS of
      patients with wild-type non-squamous NSCLC treated with carboplatin permetrexine were 35.8%,
      5.4 months and 12.7 months respectively.

      Anlotinib is a multi-target receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor in domestic research and
      development.In the phase Ⅲ study, patients who failed at least two kinds of systemic
      chemotherapy (third line or beyond) or drug intolerance were treated with anlotinib or
      placebo, the anlotinib group PFS and OS were 5.37 months and 9.46 months, the placebo group
      PFS and OS were 1.4 months and 6.37 months.

      The efficacy and safety of Anlotinib combined with Pemetrexed and Carboplatin followed by
      maintenance therapy with Anlotinib plus Pemetrexed as the first-line treatment in patients
      with advanced nonsquamous NSCLC deserve further exploration.

      This is a multicentre single arm clinical trial conducted in China.The purpose of this study
      is to evaluate and observe Anlotinib (12mg,QD, PO d1-14, 21 days per cycle) combined with
      Pemetrexed(500mg/m2,IV,d15-21,21 days per cycle)and Carboplatin(AUC5,IV,d15-21,21 days per
      cycle,4 cycles) as the first-line treatment in patients with advanced nonsquamous NSCLC
      .After four cycles of induction,patients continued to receive Anlotinib and Pemetrexed.As the
      report,The median PFS of advanced NSCLC treated by Pemetrexed and Carboplatin was 6 months.We
      expect the median PFS of Anlotinib combined with Pemetrexed and Carboplatin as the first-line
      treatment in patients with advanced nonsquamous NSCLC was 10 months.Using PASS15, we
      calculated the sample size of this study was 34(α=0.05、β=0.2), according to 20% censoring,the
      expected sample size is 43.
