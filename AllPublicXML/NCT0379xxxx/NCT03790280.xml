  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High Frequency Oscillation (HFO) on ElectroCorticoGraphy (ECoG) has been identified as a new
      biomarker for epileptogenic tissue. The purpose of this study is to see if epilepsy surgery
      guided by the combination of HFO on ECoG and standard clinical practice can result in a
      greater likelihood of seizure freedom, versus standard clinical practice alone, without HFOs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intra-operative electrocorticography (ECoG), based on interictal spike and spike patterns, is
      performed to optimize delineation of the epileptogenic tissue in the operating room during
      epilepsy surgery. Similarly, extra-operative electrocorticography is often recorded over days
      to weeks with intracranial grids and depth electrodes, when the epileptogenic zone is not
      clearly localized with non-invasive studies and/or with intra-operative ECoG. Surgical
      resection following extra-operative ECoG is then &quot;tailored' by the seizure onset zone as the
      gold standard.

      High frequency oscillations have been identified as a more precise biomarker for
      epileptogenic tissue. The aim of this double-blind randomized surgical trial is to determine
      if HFO- tailored surgery combining HFOs and current standard of care, compared to current
      standard of care alone, will lead to a better seizure outcome.

    <masking_description>A double-blinded randomized control trial including children with refractory focal epilepsy who undergo surgery with intra- or extra-operative electrocorticography. Surgery is tailored by HFOs and standard ECoG interpretation (spikes on intra-operative ECoG or seizure onset on extra-operative ECoG) (arm 1), or tailored by standard ECoG alone (arm 2).
Informed consent will be obtained 1 to 7 days to up to 3 months prior to the day of surgery. Prior to surgery, the subject will be randomized into the cohort arms in a 1:1 ratio.
Blinding of the clinical neurophysiologists and neurosurgeons for treatment allocation is not feasible because of the character of the intervention. Therefore, this is a double-blinded trial as subjects will be blinded to the cohort arm to minimize bias of the follow-up results. The treating neurologist will also be blinded.</masking_description>
