  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nasal obstruction is a common complaint for the patient presenting to the Otolaryngologist
      and/or the Facial Plastic surgeon. There are numerous potential causes of nasal obstruction,
      with more easily addressed pathologies such as posterior septal deviation and inferior
      turbinate hypertrophy often being over-diagnosed. Nasal valve obstruction, particularly
      dynamic nasal sidewall collapse, is of significant interest to the rhinoplasty surgeon.
      Traditionally, collapse of the nasal sidewall has been addressed via structural cartilage
      grafting, with alar batten grafting being the most commonly used method to provide support to
      the weak nasal sidewall. Recently, an absorbable nasal implant, comprised of a polylactic
      acid copolymer, has been advocated for supporting the nasal sidewall and relieving nasal
      obstruction. There are several proposed advantages of the implant over traditional operative
      techniques, namely the ease of endonasal insertion, which can be performed in the outpatient
      clinic setting. Preliminary investigations demonstrate subjective improvement in nasal
      obstruction with use of the implant, however, there has been no direct comparison with
      traditional techniques utilizing cartilage grafting.

      This study is being done at both UVa and in Oregon. This prospective study will randomize
      patients with nasal obstruction and documented dynamic nasal sidewall collapse into one of
      two groups undergoing treatment with either endonasal batten grafting or the absorbable
      Latera nasal valve implant. Preoperative and postoperative nasal obstruction will be assessed
      with a validated survey for nasal obstructive symptoms, the Nasal Obstruction Symptom
      Evaluation (NOSE) score. The mean preoperative and postoperative NOSE score between the
      groups will be compared at 1, 6, 12, and 24 months post-operatively to compare the efficacy
      of both techniques. Subjects will be blinded to the surgical intervention they receive.

    <description>The LATERA (Spirox Inc., Menlo Park, CA) device, an absorbable nasal implant comprised of a 70:30 blend of poly(L-lactide) and poly(D-lactide), is designed to provide support to the upper and lower lateral cartilages, thereby correcting nasal wall collapse. The implant was first used in the US and cleared by the FDA in 2016. It is designed as a ribbed cylindrical structure with a forked distal end. The implant is delivered endonasally, with a 16-gauge catheter, lateral to the upper and lower lateral cartilages and over the ascending process of the maxilla. The forked end rests on the ascending process of the maxilla and the flexible implant provides support the nasal sidewall soft tissue and cartilage. This non-toxic, biocompatible co-polymer has an extensive use in a variety of medical devices including suture materials and implants. In vivo studies demonstrate the copolymer to reliably decompose over an 18-24 month period.</description>
