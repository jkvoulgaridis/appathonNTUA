  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      XELOX as first-line treatment regimen has limited efficacy against patients with metastatic
      colorectal cancer (mCRC). Peritoneal metastasis is one of the most lethal factor for mCRC.
      Intraperitoneal chemotherapy has became a widely accepted strategy in the treatment of
      peritoneal dissemination. We hypothesized that combined multi-channel administration, such as
      intraperitoneal chemotherapy, oral chemotherapy, and intravenous chemotherapy, can produce
      better results than XELOX for first-line treatment for mCRC patients.
