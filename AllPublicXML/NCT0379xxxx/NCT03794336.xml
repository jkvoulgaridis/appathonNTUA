      Primary Objectives:

        -  To assess efficacy in terms of change from baseline in Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) at the end
           of study between the two drugs.

        -  To assess tolerability in terms of overall Gastrointestinal (GI) tolerability for
           Alogliptin compared with acarbose during the whole treatment period.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To assess efficacy in terms of the percentage of patients achieving HbA1c&lt;7%.

        -  To assess efficacy in terms of percentage of patients achieving HbA1c&lt;7% without GI
           effects.

        -  To assess change from baseline in Fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2-h Post plasma glucose
           (2-h PPG), β-cell function (HOMA-β), lipids and body weight.

        -  To assess safety in terms of occurrence of hypoglycemia events.

        -  To assess safety in terms of other adverse events.

        -  To assess patient adherence and tolerability.
