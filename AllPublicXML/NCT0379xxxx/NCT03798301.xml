  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present trial will consist of the treatment of 20 pediatric and adult Hematopoietic Stem
      Cell Transplantation (HSCT) recipients or immunocompromised participants diagnosed with
      opportunistic Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections with virus-specific, antigen-selected T-cells.
      CMV-specific T-cells will be isolated from donor leukapheresis products using the CliniMACSÂ®
      Prodigy. Prior studies on transfer of CMV specific T-cells have been shown to be safe and
      efficacious in the treatment of CMV infections.

      The main trial objective is to evaluate the feasibility and safety of CMV-specific T-cell
      transfer in adult and pediatric participants suffering from CMV infections or reactivation
      following HSCT or due to other immunocompromised states (e.g.; primary immunodeficiency,
      cytotoxic therapy).

      Participants will be followed for one year.

        available) of peripheral mononuclear cells or does not meet all donor eligibility criteria
        (including donor selection criteria based on University of Wisconsin - Madison Standard
        Operating Procedures for the selection of allogeneic donors), alternative related donors
        will be selected, with preference for those who have full HLA matching in 6/6 loci over
        those with partial HLA matching (â¥ 3/6 HLA loci). See Appendix 1 and 2 for patient and
        donor screening procedures.

          1. All donors must be â¥ 18 years old, available, CMV IgG positive, eligible and capable
             of undergoing a single standard 2 blood volume leukapheresis. If original HSCT donor
             is not available, CMV IgG negative or ineligible, a CMV IgG positive fully matched or
             haploidentical family donor will be used.

          2. Related donors must be at least partially HLA compatible, matching with recipient in
             at least 3/6 HLA loci (HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-DRB1 will be considered for this).

          3. Donors must be CMV IgG seropositive.

          4. Donors must show CMV T-cell activation after incubation with MACS GMP PepTivator
             Peptide Pools of CMV pp65 before undergoing leukapheresis.

          5. Donor must meet the criteria for donor selection defined in the Standard Operating
             Procedures of the University of Wisconsin Hospitals and Clinics Stem Cell Transplant
             Program and in FACT standards.
