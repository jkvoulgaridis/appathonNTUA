  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is the fourth most important cause of death
      worldwide and is one of the commonest non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in Nepal. The presence
      of risk factors like indoor and outdoor air pollution, the high prevalence of smoking and
      lack of general awareness of COPD makes it a serious public health concern. However, no
      attempt has been made in Nepal to estimate its burden and address the disease at the
      community level. This community-based cluster randomized controlled study aims to fulfil that
      gap through mobilization of Female Community Health Workers (FCHVs) who will be trained to
      perform a certain set of health promotion activities aimed at prevention of the disease and
      its progression. Baseline and follow-up surveys will be conducted to compare the intervention
      and control groups. This study has the potential to generate evidence in helping address NCDs
      in Nepal and also other similar resource-limited countries.
