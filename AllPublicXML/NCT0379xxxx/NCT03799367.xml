  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parents commonly find giving medicines to babies, using oral syringes or spoons, difficult
      and emotionally stressful. In developing countries, additional stress arises due to hygiene
      difficulties and the lack of clean water. To overcome these challenges and encourage
      breastfeeding, we have developed the concept of a Therapeutic Nipple Shield, a delivery
      system that makes it possible to give medicine and nutrients to babies during breastfeeding.
      It consists of a silicone nipple shield that allows the release of medicine/nutrients into
      human milk during the feed. Presentations of a prototype to parents and staff at the Rosie
      Hospital was very positive, and encouraged this clinical study. This study aims to give a
      vitamin B12 supplement to babies during breastfeeding. The supplement will be placed into a
      nipple shield, both of which are commercially available, and the mother will breastfeed her
      baby as usual. Before and after the feed, we will 1) collect a small blood sample from the
      baby to see whether the vitamin levels in the infant have increased, 2) ask the mother to
      participate in two short interviews about her expectations and experiences using the
      Therapeutic Nipple Shield.

    <description>This study aims to give a vitamin B12 supplement to babies during breastfeeding. 30 mother-infant pairs will be recruited. The supplement will be placed into a nipple shield, both of which are commercially available, and the mother will breastfeed her baby as usual. Before and after the feed, we will 1) collect a small blood sample from the baby to see whether the vitamin levels in the infant have increased, 2) ask the mother to participate in two short interviews about her expectations and experiences using the Therapeutic Nipple Shield.</description>
