  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It remains controversial whether paracervical block should be performed as a powerful
      strategy for pain relief in total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH), because convincing
      conclusions are difficult to draw because of the heterogeneous and contradictory nature of
      the literature. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of paracervical
      blocks using with 0.5% bupivacaine prior to TLHs for benign gynecologic conditions on
      postoperative pain relief.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative pain management is an important component of patient care and satisfaction
      after surgery. Although contemporary changes such as a shift to minimally invasive approaches
      and an introduction of the enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) program have resulted in
      improved outcomes, a large number of patients undergoing surgery have still inadequate pain
      control. Paracervical block is a single-injection of anesthetic around the cervix at a depth
      of about 1 cm, diffusing anesthetic into the second to fourth sacral nerve roots passing
      through Frankenh√§user plexus. Moreover, recent randomized trials demonstrated that patients
      who underwent vaginal hysterectomy and received a paracervical block had lower postoperative
      pain in the first 3-6 hours compared with placebo.

      However, it remains controversial whether paracervical block should be performed as a
      powerful strategy for pain relief in total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH), because
      convincing conclusions are difficult to draw because of the heterogeneous and contradictory
      nature of the literature. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of
      paracervical blocks using with 0.5% bupivacaine prior to TLHs for benign gynecologic
      conditions on postoperative pain relief.
