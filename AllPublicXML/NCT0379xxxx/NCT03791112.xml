  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was an open-label Phase I study. The primary objective of the study was to assess
      safety, tolerability, efficacy, and pharmacokinetic characteristics of BPI-16350 in different
      dose groups.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was divided into two sections: dose escalation section and expanded enrollment
      section.

      In dose escalation section, BPI-16350 were administered orally once daily (QD) to patients
      with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors in different dose levels.The study was
      designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of single dose and
      multiple doses of BPI-16350.

      In expanded enrollment section, based on the results of dose escalation section, BPI-16350
      were administered orally to patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors, to
      further evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of BPI-16350.
