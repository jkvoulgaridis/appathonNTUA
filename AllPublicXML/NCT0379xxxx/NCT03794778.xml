  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, multicenter, open, controlled Post-Marketing Study. 396 patients who
      were histopathology or exfoliated cell pathology of pleural and ascites confirmed with
      epithelial ovarian cancer/fallopian tube/peritoneal cancer were enrolled in this study. The
      subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the two treatment groups at a 1: 1 ratio, and
      the stratification factors included: chemotherapy type (adjuvant chemotherapy/neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy), residual disease after surgery (&gt;1cm, &lt;1cm, no primary surgery), stage (Ic,
      II, III or IV), pathological typing, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (0
      to 1 or 2), BRCA1/2 gene mutation.

      Subjects will receive one of two treatment regimens:

      Group A: intravenous infusion of liposomal doxorubicin 30 mg/m2, d1; carboplatin AUC 5 (dosed
      according to the Calvert formula, with creatinine clearance estimated according to the
      Cockcroftformula), intravenous infusion, d1; once every 21days, 3~6 cycles for early stage
      patients and 6 cycles for late stage.

      Group B: intravenous infusion of paclitaxel 175 mg/m2, d1; carboplatin AUC 5, intravenous
      infusion, d1; once every 21days, 3~6 cycles for early stage patients and 6 cycles for late
      stage. Treatment was initially administered for three cycles, and patients with stable or
      responding disease continued treatment for further a three cycles.

      The main purpose is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of liposomal doxorubicin plus
      carboplatin in the first-line treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer. The primary endpoint is
      progression free survival (PFS), the secondary endpoints include overall survival (OS),
      objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR):CR+PR+SD, the incidence and
      severity of adverse reactions and health-related quality of life (HQL) assessment.
