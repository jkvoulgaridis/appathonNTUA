  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep related disorders are common in primary care practice. Sleep wear related data has not
      been utilized to improve sleep related communication between patients and providers. The
      study team is conducting a randomized study to improve physical-patient communication
      regarding sleep through a novel intervention based upon sleep wear and the SleeplifeÂ® app.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Based on a National US survey in 2012, 69% adults track at least one health indicator using
      either a tracking device or some other means. The main health indicators tracked were diet,
      weight, and exercise. Although not as extensive as the above health indicators, certain
      studies also looked at sleep indicators through the trackers to support validity of their
      use. Based on the study team's literature review, none of the studies looked at an
      intervention designed to utilize data-trackers-based data to improve physician-patient
      communication regarding sleep.

      Commercially available and inexpensive exercise, fitness and sleep trackers are broadly
      available and consumer use is growing rapidly. Industry analysts estimate that over 30
      million Americans have access to their sleep tracking data (e.g. Fitbit. Jawbone). Physicians
      seldom use patient-generated (i.e. subjective) sleep data (e.g. sleep diaries) and have been
      slow to integrate objective sleep data collected from commercial sleep trackers. Two
      commercial sleep trackers have been validated by independent testing. The National Sleep
      Foundation (NSF) has led recent efforts to establish normative data (i.e. appropriate ranges)
      for sleep duration and sleep quality. NSF, together with the Consumer Electronics Association
      (now Consumer Technology Association), has established a work-group involving over 40 sleep
      tracking technology companies which is working to standardize sleep tracking data collection
      and reporting. Finally, NSF has developed a tool (&quot;SleepLife&quot;) that translates data retrieved
      from all commercially available sleep trackers into a personal sleep tracking record. This
      product has been tested rigorously for two years and publicly released in January 2016. These
      developments present the timely opportunity to test a new paradigm for patient and physician
      communication using objective patient data (sleep).

      The study team will utilize a combination of observational and interventional study designs
      to achieve study objectives.

    <description>For patient-physician communications from the physicians' end, the team will collect all scores, ranging from 1 to 5, for all the &quot;Communication&quot; questions in the &quot;Physician Satisfaction/Communication&quot; questionnaire. The scores will be summed up as the total communication score from physician, and the total score will be treated as continuous response variable. Then a binary variable indicating whether the physician is in the intervention (=1) or control (=0) arm will be treated as the main explanatory variable, a continuous variable regarding the time where the measurements are recorded, and the set of general demographic variables (age, race, gender, etc) will be used as covariates. We will use linear regression model, and select relevant variables using Bayesian information criterion (BIC) in a step-wise manner. The SleepLife app will be pulling time-to-sleep (TST), amount of time in minutes to sleep, number of awakenings greater than 5 minutes, and sleep efficiency.</description>
