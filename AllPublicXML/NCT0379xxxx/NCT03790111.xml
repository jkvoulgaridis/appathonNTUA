  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A Phase 2, multicenter, open-label, 2-stage study to assess the safety, tolerability, and
      efficacy of XERMELO in combination with first-line (1L) therapy (cisplatin [cis] plus
      gemcitabine [gem]) in patients with unresectable, locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic
      biliary tract cancer (intrahepatic or extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, gallbladder cancer),
      who are naïve to tumor-directed therapy in the locally advanced or metastatic setting, and
      for which treatment with 1L therapy (defined as a combination of cis/gem) is planned.
