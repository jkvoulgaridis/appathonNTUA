      This study aims to evaluate the effect of bone marrow concentration on bone healing and
      spinal fusion by comparing clinical and imaging outcomes between patients receiving
      transforaminal lumbar intebody fusion with local bone graft and with intraoperative bone
      marrow concentration and those receiving transforaminal lumbar intebody fusion with local
      bone graft only.

    <textblock>
      Spinal arthrodesis has become the mainstay of treatment for severe spinal deformity, spinal
      instability, spondylolisthesis, and symptomatic degenerative disease. Its primary goal is to
      develop an osseous bridge between adjacent motion segments to prevent motion, relieve pain,
      and facilitate neurological recovery. One of the arthrodesis method is transforaminal lumbar
      intebody fusion. After removal of the problematic disc, iliac crest bone graft was harvested
      and impacted into the space with cage to facilitate fusion. However, patients are exposed to
      additional risk of harvesting site, such as pain, infection, wound healing problem or
      hematomas. Local bone graft harvested from decompression is one of the alternative solutions
      to avoid these complications. However, the effect of local boen graft is inferior to iliac
      crest bone graft because iliac crest bone graft contains three important ingredients for
      successful fusion: osteoconductive scaffold, osteoinductive factors, and the ability to
      osteogenesis. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are pluripotent cells that can differentiate into
      multiple mesenchymal tissues, including tenocytes, chondrocytes and osteoblasts, as well as
      being a source of multiple growth factors to establish an environment conducive to soft and
      hard tissue regeneration. As bone marrow concentration has high concentration of mesenchymal
      stem cells, some studies have shown that autologous bone marrow concentration can improve
      bone healing. In this study, we will add bone marrow concentration into local bone graft
      during transforaminal lumbar intebody fusion and evaluate the effect of bone marrow
      concentration on bone healing and spinal fusion.
