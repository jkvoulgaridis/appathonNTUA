  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will compare two physician behaviors for managing pain in patients with
      IBD: proactive vs. reactive. Both the proactive and reactive behavior/strategies are standard
      of care at the institution in which the study will be performed. The PROACTIVE strategy is an
      IBD-specific analgesic orderset (built into our EMR and approved by the institution's
      Pharmacy and Therapeutics committee), the REACTIVE strategy is a traditional &quot;reactive&quot;
      analgesic prescribing (prescribing medications only when patients have pain). The PROACTIVE
      IBD-specific analgesic orderset consists of medications which have evidence for use in
      IBD-related pain. This orderset is an educational guide, it does not force any order. The
      reactive prescribing habits could contain an array of pain medications depending on what the
      provider wants to prescribe.

      Aims:

      Aim 1: To assess whether there is a difference in pain scores or functional activity among
      hospitalized patients with IBD between reactive vs proactive physician behaviors.

      Aim 2: To assess whether there is a difference in inpatient opioid-prescribing between
      reactive vs proactive physician behaviors.

      Aim 3: To assess whether there is a difference in health care utilization, including
      length-of-stay and 30-day readmission, between reactive vs proactive physician behaviors.

    <textblock>
      Prospective, investigator-blinded, single-institution randomized-control trial . Consecutive
      adult patients with IBD (Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis) admitted to the hospital will
      be screened for eligibility, and eligible patients will be approached and consented to
      participate. Subjects will be randomized to receive the P.A.I.N.-Sparing bundle or usual
      care. Patient randomization will be stratified by provider to avoid bias, using a web-based
      in-house system (RANDI3). Subjects will also be provided with a fitness tracker (Fitbit(R))
      to measure functional status during their hospital stay.

    <description>Proactive Analgesic Inpatient Narcotic-Sparing:
Pain management in patients in the proactive physician-behavior group will be based on the IBD Pain orderset in our EMR. This orderset is already in use and standard-of-care at Cedars. The orderset uses pain medications, which have evidence for use in IBD. The orderset is simply a guide to clinicians and does not force any doctor or patient to be in a &quot;protocol&quot;.</description>

    <description>Pain management in patients in the reactive group (control group) will follow traditional prescribing habits. As different providers vary in the way they treat pain, analgesic medication prescribing in the control group will be inherently variable in nature. The control group does not constitute a lack of treatment or placebo; rather, pain management in the control group will not be proactive as in the intervention group.</description>
