      To verify the efficacy and safety of endostatin in the treatment of SRILI（symptomatic
      radiation-induced lung injury） and fibrosis. The results of this study are expected to be a
      new clinical strategy for the treatment of radiation pneumonia and fibrosis.

    <textblock>
      Radiotherapy is an important treatment of lung cancer, symptomatic radiation-induced lung
      injury (SRILR) is the most common complications. In view of the important role of endostatin
      in inhibiting angiogenesis and pro-inflammatory factors, Combined with randomized controlled
      clinical study and small sample clinical exploration, the investigators concluded that
      endostatin is a new clinical technique for the treatment of radiation pneumonia（RP） and
      radiation fibrosis（RF）, which can reduce the recurrence rate of RP. In order to verify the
      efficacy and safety of endostatin in the treatment of SRILI and fibrosis, the investigators
      intend to use a prospective, randomized, multicenter clinical trial to classify unresectable
      phase III-IV Non-small cell lung cancer（NSCLC） patients with SRILI above grade 2 into the
      control group (standard SRILI treatment) and observation group (Endostar® plus standard
      treatment) on a 1:1 randomized basis. The results of this study are expected to be a new
      clinical strategy for the treatment of radiation pneumonia and fibrosis.

    <description>Patients in the observation group were treated with routine radiation pneumonia and Endostar.
Patients in the control group were treated with current routine radiation pneumonia. Chest CT were assessed for recrudescence rate of RP at week 12. The calculation method is: number of relapse cases / total number of treatment groups × 100%; RP is classified according to CTCAE4.0, patients with grade 2 or higher are improved after treatment, and those who are assessed to be grade 2 or higher are considered recrudescence). Results are expressed as a percentage.</description>

Endostar usage: continuous intravenous pumping of Endostar(14 doses each time) over 5 days. At week 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 36, 52, lung functional and blood oxygen saturation was measured, chest CT and the St. George Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) were assessed for quality of life at week 12, 24, 52 and before treatment; collecting the related observation indexes of patients; primary endpoint; recrudescence rate of RP; secondary endpoints; remission rate of RP and incidence rate of RF; incidence rate of RF; number of acute exacerbations and quality of life.</description>
