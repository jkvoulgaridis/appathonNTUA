  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PIRAMIDE study design will test the hypothesis that simultaneous interactions between DNA
      methylation and microRNAs may hit T2D candidate genes and predict the development of
      T2D-related cardiovascular complications.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical Diagnosis of Type 2 Diabetes. In according to current guidelines, diabetes is
             diagnosed by evidence of impairing fast glucose (IFG) &gt; 7.0 mmol/L (&gt;125 mg/dl), post
             prandial glycemia &gt; 11.1 mmol/L (&gt;200 mg/dl), and evidence of glycated hemoglobin
             (HbA1c) &gt; 6.6%. Clinical and demographic characteristics of study population will be
             avaiable from datasets generated by physicians.

          -  Clinical Diagnosis of macrovascular dysfunction.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        • Patients with known history of cancer, malignancy disorders, active infections, and
        chronic or immune-mediated diseases.
