    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is a Phase I, first-in-human. The study is designed to evaluate the
      safety, tolerability, PK, PD and immunogenicity of BGB149 after single IV doses in healthy
      male and female subjects. Multiple dose levels will be explored.

             drug dose in a clinical study within 3 months or 5 half-lives, prior to dosing in this
             study, whichever is longer.

          -  Employees of the Sponsor or the contract research organisation (CRO), with direct
             involvement in the proposed study or other studies under the direction of the

          -  Subjects who are unlikely to comply with the protocol requirements, instructions and
             study related restrictions; e.g., uncooperative attitude, inability to return for
             follow-up visits and improbability of completing the clinical study. Vulnerable
             subjects defined as individuals whose willingness to volunteer in a clinical study may
             be unduly influenced by the expectation, whether justified or not, of benefits
             associated with participation, or of a retaliatory response from senior members of a
             hierarchy in case of refusal to participate (e.g., persons in detention, minors and
