  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of a non-invasive communication
      aid for BPAP/CPAP masks. This study also looks to determine the potential impact of the
      device on patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and the individuals that interact with
      the device.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) is a crucial tool used to treat respiratory
      distress and failure, especially when patients have acute worsening (also called
      exacerbations) of emphysema or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This study will
      randomize patients who use Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) to a control
      (non-functioning) and intervention (functioning) device to determine how well speech can be
      understood while wearing the device.

    <description>Data will be collected using audio recording - accuracy of single word selection (spoken by patient -&gt; selected by partner). The communicator will be attached to the BPAP/CPAP mask. A list of single words will be provided to the patient. Each single word may be read aloud by patient up to two times. The partner must then select the read word out of a list of twelve possible words.</description>

    <description>Data will be collected using audio recording - accuracy of sentence selection (spoken by patient -&gt; transcribed by partner). The communicator will be attached to the BPAP/CPAP mask. A list of 5-word through 15-word sentences will be provided to the patient. Each sentence may be read aloud by patient up to two times. The partner must transcribe each sentence on a standardized form.</description>

    <measure>Speech transmission index (STI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Mask on with communicator on (20 min)</time_frame>
    <description>STI is a numeric representation measure of communication channel characteristics whose value varies from 0 = bad to 1 = excellent.On this scale, an STI of at least 0.5 is desirable for most applications.</description>

    <time_frame>Mask off (20 min), mask on with communicator off (20 min) [as compared to mask off], mask on with communicator on (20 min) [as compared to mask off and mask on communicator off]</time_frame>
    <description>Respondents will specify their level of agreement or disagreement on a symmetric seven-level agree-disagree scale for the following statements: 1) I can communicate with my partner clearly; 2)I felt understood when I read single words; 3) I felt understood when I read short (5-9 word) sentences; 4) I felt understood when I read long (10-15 word) sentences. The scale range captures the intensity form &quot;strongly disagree&quot; to &quot;strongly agree&quot;.After the questionnaire is completed, responses will be summed to create a score.</description>

    <description>The F2S Communication System is a communication aid for use with a noninvasive ventilation (NIV) mask covering at least the mouth. It is a two-component system consisting of (1) a disposable, single patient use patch and signal cable and (2) a reusable communicator with power cable.The non-invasive aid for patients receiving BPAP/CPAP therapy delivers communication between the patient and medical personnel.</description>
