  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Writer's cramp is a focal dystonia characterized by abnormal movements and postures during
      writing. Limited finger independence during writing manifests as difficulty suppressing
      unwanted activations of neighbouring non task-relevant fingers. Patients with Writer's cramp
      also have difficulty in fine control of grip force.

      The investigators have recently developed the Finger Force Manipulandum which quantifies the
      forces applied by each fingers in different tasks. This method is sensitive for detection and
      quantification of small unwanted contractions in non-active ('stationary') fingers. Different
      tasks have been developed to assess abilities such as finger individuation but also fine
      finger force control, finger movement regularity and speed.

      The aim of this study is to assess if developed tasks allow to precisely characterize
      writer's cramp condition in terms of abilities aforementioned.

      To do so, performance of 20 writer's cramp patients in the developed task will be compared
      with performance of 20 control participants (matched in age, sex and writing hand) in the
      same tasks.
