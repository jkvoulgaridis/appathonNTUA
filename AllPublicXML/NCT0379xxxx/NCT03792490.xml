  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and
      therapeutic options are limited. The rho kinase (ROCK) inhibitor Fasudil was shown to be
      neuroprotective, induced axonal regeneration and improved survival and behavioral outcome in
      models of ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases. The aim of this phase IIa, multi-center
      and double-blind study is to analyze the safety, tolerability and efficacy of fasudil in two
      different doses compared to placebo in approximately 16 trial sites in Germany, France and
      Switzerland. Intravenous application of fasudil will be performed in 80 patients and placebo
      in 40 patients two times daily for 20 treatment days. The hypothesis is that fasudil is safe
      and well-tolerated and its application will significantly improve the clinical outcome in
      patients with ALS.
