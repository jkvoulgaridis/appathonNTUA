  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to explore the effect of feedback counseling using professional
      continuous glucose monitoring on glycemic control, self-efficacy, and self-management
      behaviors among middle aged and older adults with poor controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus.
      This study also explores the difference on timing of feedback after continuous glucose
      monitoring exam.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After scheduled routine professional continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) exam, participants
      in both the intervention and control group receive ordinary education and regimen adjustment
      as indicated based on CGM results. For participants in the intervention group, they will also
      receive CGM counseling immediately on the day of CGM sensor removal. For participants in the
      control group, they will receive CGM counseling on the day of routine 3 months outpatient
      visit.

      Qualitative data are collected through in-depth interview: User expectation, acceptability
      and satisfaction of CGM are also explored during in-depth interview with a semi-structured
      questionnaire.

      Quantitative data were collected through validated questionnaires, including evaluation of
      depression by a short form of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale Revised
      (CES-D-R), emotional stress by Problem Areas in Diabetes Scale (PAID), self efficacy by
      Stanford Self-Efficacy for Diabetes (SES), at pretest and 3 months after CGM counseling.

      Anthropometric Measurements. Body height, body weight, body mass index, and blood pressure
      were recorded at pre-test and post-test interview.

      Blood Tests. Routine biochemistry, fasting plasma glucose, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) are
      collected within 2 weeks of pretest and posttest day.
