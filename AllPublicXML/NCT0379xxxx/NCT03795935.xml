  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) uses electrical pulses sent through a lead (insulated wire) to
      help stop unwanted symptoms in a variety of brain diseases, including the tremor seen in
      patients with Essential Tremor (ET). The current standard lead allows this stimulation to
      spread out uniformly in all directions. As these diseases progress, however, the amount of
      electrical stimulation required to stop the symptom usually increases. This may become
      problematic because the increased electrical stimulation required for advanced symptoms may
      spread outside the desired targeted area, and effect other parts of the brain and causing
      unwanted side effects. A new type of DBS lead has been developed which can steer, or focus,
      the electrical stimulation in a given direction toward the desired target area and away from
      areas that would cause side effects. We would like to quantify the benefit seen in patients
      who have been switched from the traditional lead to this new directional lead.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients implanted with a DBS may experience unwanted side effects such as motor
      contractures, paresthesia, or dysarthria. This occurs when the electrical field of the
      stimulation spreads out beyond the targeted area. This is especially common in patients whose
      disease has progressed, and must use increasingly higher currents in order to regain control
      of their tremor. Unfortunately, because the electrical field affects neurons in a symmetrical
      sphere around the DBS, it is often impossible to reach the additional desired neuronal
      elements without simultaneously affecting equidistant brain regions responsible for side
      effects. For many of our advanced patients, this means choosing between a debilitating tremor
      or disabling side effects.The directional lead is a FDA and Health Canada approved DBS lead
      which features radially segmented electrodes which can selectively steer the electrical field
      in a predefined direction, orthogonal to the lead trajectory. This will allow DBS clinicians
      to steer current towards desired structural areas, while avoiding locations, which produce
      negative side effects.

    <description>Patients who were previously implanted with a traditional DBS lead and have subsequently developed stimulation induced side effects will gain significantly more tremor control without side effects when re-implanted with a directional DBS lead. We expect these patients' quality of life will improve. These patients typically will have had significant tremor relief (greater than 75% reduction from preoperative tremor rating scale) without side effects at their one year post operative follow-up. With the expected disease progression they will have had to increase their DBS stimulation to the degree that their DBS now causes side effects in order to block their tremor</description>
