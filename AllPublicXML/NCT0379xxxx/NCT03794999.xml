  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, observational, exposure cohort study of pregnancy and infant outcomes
      in women with asthma exposed to benralizumab anytime during pregnancy, or within 8 weeks
      prior to the first day of the last menstrual period (LMP).

      The objective of the study is to monitor planned or unplanned pregnancies to evaluate
      potential teratogenic effect (birth defect) when exposed to benralizumab compared to two
      unexposed comparator groups.

      The primary outcome is major structural birth defects (abnormalities in development of
      structures of the body) and the secondary outcomes are preterm delivery (premature baby),
      small for gestational age infants (small for weight, length, and/or head circumference),
      spontaneous abortion (miscarriage), stillbirth (baby born without signs of life), elective
      termination (voluntary abortion) and small for age postnatal growth to one year of age (small
      for weight, length and/or head circumference). The birth prevalence or incidence of outcomes
      in women exposed to benralizumab, and their infants, will be compared to those observed in
      two unexposed comparator groups: a disease-matched comparison group of women who have not
      used benralizumab during pregnancy or within 8 weeks of their last menstrual period (LMP),
      but who have used other anti-asthmatic medications (treated disease comparison group), and a
      comparison group of healthy women who do not have a diagnosis of asthma, have not had
      exposure to a known human teratogen (substance that causes birth defect), and have not taken
      benralizumab in pregnancy (healthy comparison group).
