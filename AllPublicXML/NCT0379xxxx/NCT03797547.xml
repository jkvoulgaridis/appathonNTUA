  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi centre, single arm, prospective observational phase 4 study in naive or
      pretreated patients with myopic neovascularization. The patients will be treated with
      intravitreal injections of Aflibercept following a real life protocol.

      This sudy aims to evaluate the visual acuity during a 36 months period of time.
