      This study evaluates the safety and therapeutic effects of single-dose human umbilical cord
      blood mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) on the adult patients with moderate/severe Rheumatoid
      Arthritis accompany with anemia or/and Interstitial pulmonary disease. Half of participants
      will receive UC-MSCs and keep the present medication,while the other half will receive a
      placebo and keep the present medication.
