      Garlic extract as herbal compound has potent antibacterial properties and can be used safely
      as an irrigant for pulpectomy procedure of primary molars root canals with high clinical and
      radiographic outcomes

      Aim: This study indented to assess the clinical and radiographic assessment of garlic extract
      as an intracanal irrigant for pulpectomy of primary molars.

      Methodology: 91 child with 100 teeth submitted into this study were equally categorized into
      the test group (group 1) which irrigated with garlic extract and control group (group 2) that
      received sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl). Then, each group has been subjected to further
      specification according to the tooth preoperative clinical and radiographic features into has
      been into 2 subgroups. Clinical and radiographic success rates were checked at 3, 6 and 12
      months. Fisher's exact test for binary variable was used for data analysis with p-value ≤
      0.05.

    <description>Experimental group treated with garlic extract
A 100 gram of garlic cloves has been cleaned, peeled and dried. Ethanol of 70% concentration was added for 60 seconds. The cloves were placed in a laminar airflow chamber for evaporation of residual ethanol. Using a sterile mortar and pestle, cloves were homogenized aseptically and filtered through a double layer paper. The fully concentrated extracted was diluted to the concentration of 25% with distilled water</description>
