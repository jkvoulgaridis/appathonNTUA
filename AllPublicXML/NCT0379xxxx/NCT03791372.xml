      To study the clinical efficacy and safety of autologous umbilical cord blood transfusion in
      the treatment of cerebral palsy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 clinical trial that constitutes two time points cohorts with participants
      who will receive intravenous autologous umbilical cord blood and 0.9% sodium chloride
      respectively. The timing of treatment is any time after the diagnosis of cerebral palsy. The
      investigator will proceed the groups during the same period.

        1. Demographic Data and Baseline Characteristics of the Studied Group were collected:

             -  Basic patient's information survey

             -  Medical history

             -  Physical examination

             -  Basic blood test result

             -  Children's developmental disorders evaluation before the treatment

             -  Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Diffusion Tensor Imaging (MRI-DTI) before the
                treatment

             -  Neurocognitive function test before the treatment

        2. Assessment of clinical condition in the course by measurement of blood pressure, heart
           and respiratory rates, temperature and adverse events was recorded.

        3. Autologous cord blood doses is 20-30ml (total Mononuclear cells＞1*10^7/kg)，the infusion
           speed is 1ml/min, and with same volume of 0.9% sodium chloride as placebo.

        4. The follow-up: clinical test until 30th month in 3 month gaps.

    <time_frame>up to 30 months after therapy at a 3-month interval</time_frame>
    <description>GMFCS is used to assess the gross motor function of the children who were diagnosised as cerebral palsy.The results of GMFCS are divided into five levels. Grade I represents the best outcome while grade Ⅴ represents the worst.</description>

    <measure>The Change of Gesell Developmental Scale(GDS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>every 3-month after therapy until 30 months</time_frame>
    <description>The GDS is used to measure the gross motor,fine action,adaptability，language and individual-society function of the children whose age ranges from 1-month to 6-year-old. The score less than 75 for each subscale represent the worse outcome and more than 75 represent the better.</description>
