  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this research is to measure the short- and mid-term effects of an
      empowerment program focused on serostatus disclosure management for women living with HIV
      (WLHIV) in Mali on the &quot;burden of secrecy&quot;.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Serostatus disclosure is a critical issue for persons living with HIV (PLHIV). Studies
      identified numerous benefits associated with disclosure, but various negative consequences
      have also been documented. Gender inequality must be taken into account regarding the
      disclosure issue, in particular in Mali, where women are economically dependent and have a
      low decision-making power. Moreover, in Mali, since 2006, PLHIV have a legal obligation to
      disclose their serostatus to their spouse and sexual partner(s) &quot; as soon as possible, or
      within 6 weeks &quot; after the diagnosis. Although this law is not enforced, it highlights the
      sensitive nature of the serostatus disclosure issue and raise concerns among PLHIV and other
      stakeholders.

      To support women living with HIV (WLHIV), an empowerment program (Gundo-So) was implemented
      by ARCAD-SIDA in Mali, in collaboration with several partners. This program aims to empower
      WLHIV, so that they can make informed decision about disclosing or keeping their serostatus
      secret in their various life contexts, and that they can identify strategies to disclose or
      to keep the secret, as well as to manage potential negative reactions. Gundo-So (&quot;The room of
      confidences&quot;) was adapted from a program established in quebec and has been implemented in
      Mali.

      The objective of this research is to measure the short- and mid-term effects of an
      empowerment program focused on serostatus disclosure management for women living with HIV
      (WLHIV) in Mali on the &quot;burden of secrecy&quot;.

      The evaluation of the effects of the Gundo-So program will be helpful to assess the relevance
      of a national or subregional extension of the program, or even an adaptation to other target
      populations (e.g. heterosexual men and men who have sex with men living with HIV).
