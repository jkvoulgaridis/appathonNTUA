    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to investigate the effects of therapeutic exercise and
      nutrition intervention for sarcopenia and risk of falls in patients with major chronic
      diseases. The outcomes will be analyzed regarding muscle strength, quality, and volume, etc.,
      balance and gait, bone density, body composition, fall and quality of life after the
      intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main common chronic diseases in the elderly such as stroke, osteoporosis, chronic kidney
      disease and cancer, have been regarded as the fall high-risk patients. These patients are
      considered to be at risk for sarcopenia due to decreased exercise, nutritional status, and
      other reasons. Sarcopenia can be diagnosed and intervened effectively to delay the vicious
      cycle of health. Past studies have pointed out that in addition to drug intervention,
      treatment for sarcopenia must be accompanied by appropriate exercise and nutritional
      intervention (such as protein supplements, vitamin D) in order to achieve the best prevention
      and treatment.
