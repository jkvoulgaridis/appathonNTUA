  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an open-label, randomized, cross-over design with two single-dose treatment
      periods and a washout of at least 3~5 days in between each treatment visit. The study period
      consists of 3 visits to the study centre: Visit 1 (enrolment), Visit 2 (first single-dose
      treatment), Visit 3 (second single-dose treatment).

      Target subject population is healthy subjects aged 18-45 years. Following an overnight fast
      of at least 10 hours, a single dose of 90mg salvianolic acid A will be administered on 3
      separate occasions (fasting, before meal, and after meal) in a randomized crossover fashion
      with different food restrictions.
