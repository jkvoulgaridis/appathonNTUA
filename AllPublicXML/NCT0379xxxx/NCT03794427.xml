  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hip fracture is a potentially devastating event, and serious surgical and medical
      complications occur frequently especially for elderly patients. Delirium is one of the common
      complications after hip surgery. Controversy exists regarding the possible impact of type of
      anesthesia (nerve block versus spinal) upon acute and long-term cognitive decline.

      The primary objective is to assess the association between type of anesthesia (nerve block
      vs. spinal anesthesia) and risk of cognitive decline (CD). The secondary objective is to
      compare intra-operative hemodynamic changes, use of vasopressor drugs, and use of
      post-operative analgesics with respect to the type of anesthesia.

      Prospective, double blind randomized clinical trial of hip fracture patients who will be
      assessed for CD pre- and postoperatively, using the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE). The
      presence of CD will be determined at follow-up evaluation up to three months after surgery.

      Prospective, double blind randomized clinical trial of hip fracture patients who will be
      assessed for CD pre- and postoperatively, using the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE). The
      presence of CD will be determined at follow-up evaluation up to three months after surgery.
      Patients undergoing hip surgery will be randomized into two groups. Group 1 will receive
      unilateral lumbosacral nerve block (sciatic nerve block and paravertebral block at levels
      L3-L4 and L4-L5) as well as placebo injection (1 ml normal saline) at the spinal anesthesia
      level (L3-L4 or L4-L5). The sciatic nerve will be injected by 20 ml of the anesthetic mixture
      whereas levels L3-L4 and L4-L5 will be injected by a total of 20 ml of the anesthetic mixture
      without exceeding the maximum injected volume of 1 ml/kg. Group 2 will receive spinal
      anesthesia (3 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine) in addition to placebo injection at the sciatic, L3-L4
      and L4-L5 levels.
