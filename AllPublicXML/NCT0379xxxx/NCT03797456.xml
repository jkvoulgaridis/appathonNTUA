  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The phase II clinical study is to investigate the safety, tolerability, efficacy and
      pharmacokinetics of ICP-022.

      Safety, tolerability evaluation, and anti-tumor effects of ICP-022 in Chinese patients with
      R/R MZL will be evaluated in approximately 80 subjects. Pharmacokinetics of ICP-022 will be
      evaluated in approximately 20 subjects.
