      Investigating the effect of multimodal pain treatment after hernia repair
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, non-blinded study comparing the effects of multimodal pain management
      (ibuprofen, tylenol, and narcotics/oxycodone as needed) for relief of post-operative pain in
      patients who undergo hernia repair. Patients who present for elective hernia surgery will be
      randomized in a 1:1 fashion by pre-operative pain score into a multimodal pain treatment
      group or conventional opiod treatment group for post-operative pain management. They will be
      followed up after their surgery to evaluate their pain scores and narcotic use.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Post operative pain scores at rest and during movement</measure>
    <time_frame>1-14 days after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be called on post operative days 1-3 and asked to rate their pain while at rest and during movement using the following scales:
On a scale of 1-10, with 1=no pain and 10= the worst pain, what has been your average pain level since surgery during REST? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
On a scale of 1-10, with 1=no pain and 10= the worst pain, what has been your average pain level since surgery during MOVEMENT (such as walking across the room)? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
Patients will also be asked the same two pain scales (pain at rest and during movement) at the first post-operative appointment, which will occur within 14 days of their surgery.
The scores for pain at rest and during movement will not be summed or averaged together, so that the maximum score on each scale is 10 (worst pain), and the minimum score is 1 (no pain). Scores will not be summed across days. Lower scores are considered a better outcome, and higher scores are considered a worse outcome.</description>
