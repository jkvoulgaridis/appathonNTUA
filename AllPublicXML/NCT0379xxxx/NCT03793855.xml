  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adherence to a healthy dietary pattern is part of the self-care of patients with type 2
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and may contribute substantially to therapeutic target goals as
      well as to a better quality of life. However, not all nutritional recommendations aimed at
      these patients are easily applicable in clinical practice. The primary objective of the study
      is to evaluate the effectiveness of a nutritional strategy for glycemic control in patients
      with T2DM users of a Public Health System after 1 year of follow-up. As secondary objectives,
      we will evaluate the impact of the proposed strategy on self-care and on the quality of life
      of the patients. In this randomized multicenter open-label randomized trial, 370 patients &gt;30
      years old with T2DM, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) ≥7% and who have not received or received
      nutritional counseling for at least 06 months will be enrolled. Patients allocated to the
      control group will receive individualized dietary prescription according to the guidelines of
      the Brazilian Society of Diabetes. Nutritional counseling in the intervention group will be
      performed based on the quality of the diet, the Food Guide for the Brazilian Population and
      concepts of mindfulness and mindful eating; all dietary guidance will be based on feasible
      goals built together (patient and nutritionist), and no diet will be prescribed for
      intervention group. In both groups, patients will receive glymeters for residential
      self-monitoring of glycemic levels. On-site follow-up visits will be carried out at 30, 60,
      90, 180, 270 and 360 days (final consultation). At 120, 150, 210, 240, 300 and 330 days,
      participants in the intervention group will receive motivational messages via e-mail or SMS
      (for these patients, consultations of 30 and 270 days will be group meetings). Laboratory
      tests (lipid and glycemic profile, serum creatinine, serum sodium, urinary sodium, serum
      potassium, urinary potassium and albuminuria) will be performed at baseline, 180 and 360
      days; anthropometric indexes and blood pressure will be also evaluated.
