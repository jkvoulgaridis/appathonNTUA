  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of age and fitness level on the
      physiological response to an acute bout of resistance or aerobic exercise.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Young and middle-aged to older adults who are physically active or not physically active will
      participate in two moderate to vigorous intensity exercise bouts: aerobic exercise and
      resistance training exercise. Blood will be collected to assess immune function and
      metabolism.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  &quot;Young&quot; Adults: ages 18-30

          -  &quot;Older&quot; Adults: ages 55-75 and if a female postmenopausal

          -  Participants classified as &quot;trained&quot; must participate in at least 30 minutes of
             moderate to vigorous intensity cardiovascular activity at least 3 days per week and
             engage in resistance training for all of the major muscle groups approximately 2 days
             / week. They must have upheld this activity for the past 3 months

          -  Participants classified as &quot;untrained&quot; must be participating in less than 30 minutes
             of moderate to vigorous intensity cardiovascular activity and less than 2 days of
             resistance training per week for at least the last 3 months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have any contraindications to moderate to vigorous exercise

          -  Range of motion restrictions that would prevent them from participating in aerobic or
             resistance training with proper form (they must be ambulatory)

          -  aking medications (prescription or over the counter) known to influence immune
             function, including daily NSAID's, beta blockers, statins, bisphosphonates, or
             steroids.

          -  Have known cardiovascular, respiratory, metabolic, or renal disease, with the
             exception of controlled hypertension (as defined by resting BP below 140/90) and/or
             controlled asthma (self-reported).

          -  Be pregnant

          -  Be unable to complete all visits (i.e. must not be planning to leave the Houston area
             long-term before concluding their participation in the study which will span several
             weeks)

          -  Fall outside of a BMI range of (18.5 - 30)

          -  Consume alcohol or recreational drugs for 24h prior to visits

          -  Older women cannot be pre-menopausal (must have not had a menses for at least 12
             months)

          -  Unable to speak or read English

          -  Participants must not have scheduling conflicts that would prevent them from reporting
             to the laboratory of integrated physiology 4 times over the course of the study
