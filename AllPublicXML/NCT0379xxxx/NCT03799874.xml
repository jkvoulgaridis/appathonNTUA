  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a multi-center, prospective, randomized, partially double-blind,
      placebo-controlled Phase II clinical trial of inhaled CO (iCO) for the treatment of ARDS. The
      trial will be conducted at 5 tertiary care medical centers including Weill Cornell
      Medicine/NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH), Massachusetts
      General Hospital (MGH), Duke University Hospital, and the Durham Veterans Administration
      Medical Center.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of inhaled
      carbon monoxide (iCO) for the treatment of ARDS and to examine the biologic readouts of low
      dose iCO therapy in patients with ARDS

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a devastating disease affecting military,
      veteran, and civilian populations. ARDS is a syndrome of severe acute lung inflammation and
      hypoxemic respiratory failure with an incidence of 180,000 cases annually in the United
      States. Despite recent advances in critical care management and lung protective ventilation
      strategies, ARDS morbidity and mortality remain unacceptably high. The lack of specific
      effective therapies for ARDS indicates a need for new treatments that target novel pathways.
      Carbon monoxide (CO) represents a novel therapeutic modality in ARDS based on data obtained
      in experimental models of ARDS over the past decade.

      CO has been shown to be protective in experimental models of acute lung injury (ALI) and
      sepsis. Furthermore, multiple human studies have demonstrated that experimental
      administration of several different concentrations of CO is well tolerated and that low dose
      inhaled CO can be safely administered to subjects in a controlled research environment. The
      investigators have previously conducted a Phase I trial of low dose iCO in ARDS which
      demonstrated that precise administration of low dose iCO (100 and 200 ppm) is feasible,
      well-tolerated, and safe in patients with sepsis-induced ARDS.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of low dose inhaled carbon
      monoxide (iCO) therapy in mechanically ventilated patients with ARDS.

    <measure>Primary Efficacy Outcome: Lung injury score (LIS) on days 1 through 5 and day 7</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Lung Injury Score (LIS) is a composite 4-point scoring system including the PaO2/FiO2, PEEP, quasi-static respiratory compliance, and the extent of infiltrates on the chest X-ray. Each of the four components is categorized from 0 to 4, where a higher number is worse. The total Lung Injury Score is obtained by dividing the aggregate sum by the number of components used. Previous randomized clinical trials in ARDS have shown that a decreased LIS correlates with improvement in lung physiology as well as important clinical outcomes including mortality and ventilator-free days (VFDs).</description>

    <description>Organ failure will be assessed using the SOFA score. SOFA scores will be assessed daily on days 1-5, and thereafter on days 7, 14, and 28, as the SOFA score has been shown to be a reliable prognostic indicator of outcomes in critically ill patients. To calculate the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, each of the six components (Respiratory, Coagulation, Liver, Cardiovascular, Central Nervous System, Renal) is categorized from 0-4, where a higher number is worse. The SOFA score (0-24) will be calculated by summing all six components.</description>
