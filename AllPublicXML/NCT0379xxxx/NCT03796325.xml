  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is an epidemic disease that continues to increase causing morbidity and mortality to
      those who suffer. Obese patients suffer, frequently, from a depressive state, anger, and
      emotional disturbances. It cannot be recognized and depression causes obesity affecting
      eating habits or obesity causes depression based on physical, social and occupational
      limitations. Many times we see that obese patients are discriminated in every sense of daily
      life increasing their depressive state. The best treatment for obesity is bariatric surgery
      that causes a sufficient weight loss to correct sleep apnea, diabetes, hypertension, and many
      other co-morbidity. The study is based on elucidating the effect of sleeve gastrectomy in
      obese patients suffering from depression

      The patients were classified as suffering from a depressive state before the bariatric
      surgery and followed until 3 years after surgery, the data was collected by personal
