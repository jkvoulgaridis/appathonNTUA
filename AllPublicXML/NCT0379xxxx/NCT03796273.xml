    <textblock>
      This trial studies the side effects and how well ketoconazole works before surgery in
      treating patients with glioma that has come back or breast cancer that has spread to the
      brain. Ketoconazole is an antifungal drug that may be able to block a protein, tGLI1 and may
      help to treat brain tumors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if ketoconazole alters the tGLI1 activation signature (tGAS) which is
      consisted of eight validated tGLI1 regulated genes (CD24, CD44, VEGF-A, VEGF-C, VEGFR2, TEM7,
      OCT-4. and heparanase) in tGLI1 expressing brain biospecimens.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if pre-treatment with ketoconazole, an inhibitor of the tGLI1 pathway in
      tissue culture and animal models, reduces circulating tGLI1 associated exosomal miRNA
      expression (miR1290 and miR1246) in brain tumor patients.

      II. To describe the safety of ketoconazole when administered peri-operatively to patients
      with primary and secondary brain tumors.

      III. To measure the blood brain penetrance of ketoconazole in serum relative to enhancing
      brain tissue.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To measure blood brain penetration of ketoconazole in serum relative to cerebrospinal
      fluid (CSF) and serum relative to non-enhancing brain tissue (exploratory recurrent glioma
      patients only).

      II. To compare tGLI1 expression and pathway modulation with ketoconazole pre-treatment in
      patients with recurrent gliomas relative to breast cancer brain metastases (BCBM).

      III. To determine the overall survival and toxicity outcomes for patients that continue
      ketoconazole after surgery, at the discretion of the treating physician.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive ketoconazole orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-4 before standard
      surgery in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients undergo standard surgery.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.

    <description>The primary outcome of this study is modulation of the tGLI1 pathway as assessed by the tGLI1 activation signature 8 (t-GAS 8) [29, 40]. t-GAS 8 consists of eight validated tGLI1 regulated genes (CD24, CD44, VEGF-A, VEGF-C, VEGFR2, TEM7, OCT-4. and heparanase) and is measured using qPCR in patients whose brain tissue expresses tGLI1 (by IHC). The distribution of the tGAS will be examined and transformed to approximate the conditional normality assumption if necessary. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) methods will be used to determine the effects of different factors of interest (e.g., treatment or tumor type) on the outcomes measured.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>tGLI1 pathway activation</measure>

    <description>tGLI1 pathway activation will be compared between treatment groups using ANOVA as described for the analysis of primary objective.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of adverse events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 30 days after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The safety of ketoconazole will be defined by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v) 4.0 criteria and determined by adverse event proportions. The adverse event proportions will be compared between treatment groups using chi-squared tests. If feasible, a logistic regression model will be used to detect whether the adverse event proportion is higher in the treatment group after adjusting for the tumor type.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must have a history of:

               -  Histologically confirmed primary breast cancer including primary invasive and
                  metastatic breast cancers with imaging findings consistent with brain metastasis.
                  In the event that a patient presents with an initial diagnosis of metastatic
                  breast cancer with imaging findings of a new brain metastases and unequivocal
                  imaging findings of a primary breast cancer, consideration for study enrollment
                  requires approval from the study chair (primary cohort)

        OR

          -  Histologically confirmed primary glioma including astrocytoma or oligodendroglioma of
             any World Health Organization grade with imaging findings consistent with recurrent or
             progressive disease (exploratory cohort). Patients with ependymoma will not be
             included.

               -  Subjects must be undergoing surgical resection for clinical purposes with
                  anticipated resection of at least 300 mg of tissue.

               -  Patients with any prior number of radiation (including brain radiation),
                  chemotherapy, or surgical interventions will be eligible for this protocol.

               -  The effects of ketoconazole on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this
                  reason, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate
                  contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to
                  study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become
                  pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should
                  inform her treating physician immediately.

               -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign an Institutional Review Board
                  (IRB)-approved informed consent document (either directly or via a legally
                  authorized representative).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with contraindication to ketoconazole including:

               -  Prior allergic reaction or intolerance of ketoconazole

               -  Known active hepatitis

               -  QTc prolongation (based on electrocardiography [EKG] obtained within 21 days of
                  enrollment, with a threshold of &gt;450 ms in males and &gt;470 ms in female)

               -  Known liver cirrhosis will be excluded from enrollment

               -  Positive serum pregnancy test within 21 days of enrollment

          -  Subjects currently taking medications that are included in the contraindicated
             concurrent medications section of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved
             indications for ketoconazole will be required to complete a seven day wash out period
             prior to consideration for enrollment.

          -  Subjects for whom collection of blood, or tissue samples is unsafe or clinically
             inadvisable.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because ketoconazole is a Class B agent
             with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother with ketoconazole, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the
             mother is treated with ketoconazole.
