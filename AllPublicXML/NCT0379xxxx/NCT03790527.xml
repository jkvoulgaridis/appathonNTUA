      The purpose of this study is to use the modification training of cognitive bias to ameliorate
      the severity and symptoms of Internet gaming disorders(IGD); the neural mechanisms of
      cognitive bias modification and its effect during cued-induced craving task in subjects with
      IGD will be investigated as well. This project will be conducted in Beijing, China.

    <description>Cognitive bias outside fMRI measured by AAT task takes the response times[[Push_game_pic-Pull_game_pic]-[Push_object_pic - Pull_object_pic])] as the index. The response times (cognitive bias scores) will be calculated under Repeated Measurement Anova by using SPSS software.</description>

    <time_frame>30-45 minutes after training</time_frame>
    <description>Using seed-based and network level functional connectivity analysis, as well as graph theory analysis , functional connectivity in brain under eight minutes resting state will be detected and compared between CBM training group and sham group</description>

    <measure>task-based fMRI brain activation</measure>
    <time_frame>45-60 minutes after training</time_frame>
    <description>The active of the brain regions in mPFC and VS during AAT task changes after CBM training compared with the sham. There should be an decrease in ventral striatum and amygdala during the cue-induced task. These task-based fMRI data will be contrasted using SPM.</description>

    <measure>Correlation analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>30- 60 minutes after training</time_frame>
    <description>The correlation between functional network organization in brain across resting state ( task-based fMRI) and cognitive bias scores will be explored.</description>

    <description>participants have to complete the picture assessment task ; Approach-avoidance Task(AAT) and cue-induced task in the fMRI；data on game-craving level, game hours, the ability of self-control and emotion regulation are also collected.
Half of the participants will be random-assigned into the CBM training group; Each participant will do these task twice( e.g. Before training and after training)</description>

    <description>participants will be random-assigned into one of training groups. Participants in the modification group will receive modified training of 400 trials for six sessions during six days, the same as the sham group.The difference between these two groups is the proportion of push/pull trials. The sequence of the interventions will be counterbalanced across participants, and the callback will be conduct after one week.</description>
