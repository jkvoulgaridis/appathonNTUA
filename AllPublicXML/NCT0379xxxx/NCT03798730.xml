  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate whether protein fortification of foods and beverages causes
      mouthdrying and mucoadhesion and whether this is influenced by age and saliva flow.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      1. To investigate, by using protein fortified foods and beverages, whether mucoadhesion to
           the oral cavity is greater for older adults compared to younger adults and determine
           whether it is related to salivary flow rate.

        2. To determine whether protein fortification of foods and beverages causes mouthdrying and
           whether perception and acceptance are influenced by age and individual differences in
           saliva flow.

      These aims will be investigated using two different models: a liquid model using whey protein
      and a solid model using protein fortified biscuits and cakes.

    <intervention_model_description>This study involves both a crossover design where each participant tastes both the control product (not fortified) and the protein fortified product with an appropriate break between the two sessions. It is also both a within and between groups design as the responses from the older participants will be compared to the younger participants. The study will be conducted single blind as it not feasible to blind the researcher. Each participant will attend 3 study visits and all foods will be presented with random blinding codes.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Dental status and mouth behaviour categorisation via a questionnaire. Category data (ie participants check boxes that apply). The dental status questionnaire is adapted from the WHO oral health questionnaire, it indicates where a participant has poor dental status. The mouth behaviour questionnaire is a validated questionnaire (JMBM, trademarked), we are investigating whether it relates to perception of protein fortified foods.</description>
