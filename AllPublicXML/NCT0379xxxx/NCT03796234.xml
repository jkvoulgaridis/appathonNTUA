    <textblock>
      A multidisciplinary program based on physiotherapy and diet education will be carried out for
      3 months in patients with coronary artery disease with percutaneous coronary intervention.
      Educational lectures on nutrition and high intensity interval training will be developed in
      old patients with chronic heart disease. A control group will not develop any program.
      Effectiveness on anthropometric parameters, eating habits, physical activity, quality of
      life, anxiety and depression will be assessed at baseline and at 3 months.

      A multidisciplinary program based on high intensity interval training and diet education will
      be carried out for 3 months for patients with coronary artery disease with percutaneous
      coronary intervention. Three educational lectures on nutrition and a 3-month high intensity
      interval training will be developed in old patients with chronic heart disease. A control
      group will not develop any program. Effectiveness on anthropometric parameters, eating
      habits, physical activity, quality of life, anxiety and depression will be assessed at
      baseline and at 3 months.

    <description>Test of adherence to the mediterranean diet, which consists of 14 questions related to the Mediterranean diet. Depending on the answer of the question it can be obtained 1 point or 0 points, being the value of each item 0 or 1. If the sum of the points is 9 or higher the subject has a good adhesion to the mediterranean diet. If it is less than 9 points is considered bad adhesion. The range can vary between 0 points (minimum adhesion) and 14 points (maximum adhesion) (PREDIMED, 2017).</description>

    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Food consumption frequency questionnaire: registers the number of times/week or the number of times/month a series of foods is consumed, so that information about the foods the individual consumes most frequently during the week can be obtained. The list of foods that are part of the questionnaire is made up of those most common among the population, with a total of 45 items (yoghurts, fish, fruits, etc.). It also includes a table called Table of Weight of the Item Ration (PRI), in which the weight of the ration of each item is collected to facilitate the completion of the questionnaire (Trinidad et al., 2008).</description>

    <description>International physical activity questionnaire: it has 9 items and provides information on the time spent while walking, in activities of low, moderate and vigorous intensity and in sedentary activities. Based on the estimated METS consumed, the IPAQ divides the subjects into three levels or categories: Low, moderate and high physical activity.
The score of the different types of activity is expressed in METS-minutes per week.</description>

    <measure>Health related quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Short-form 36: the questionnaire is composed of 36 questions that value both positive and negative health status. It was developed from an extensive battery of questionnaires employed at WHO, which included 40 concepts related to health. The questionnaire contains 8 scales, which represent the concepts of health most frequently used in the main health questionnaires. The 36 items of the instrument cover the following scales: Physical function, Physical role, Body pain, General health, Vitality, Social function, Emotional role, Mental health. The scores of each of the 8 dimensions of the SF-36 oscillate between 0 and 100. A result of 100 indicates optimal health and 0 would reflect a very poor state of health.</description>

    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Hospital anxiety and depression questionnaire: the questionnaire includes 14 questions regarding the depressant and anxious symptoms of the patient. Two subsets of 7 items each, on Likert scale 0-3. For anxiety HAD-A sum of odd items (1,3,5,7,9,11,13), for depression HAD-D sum of even items (2,4,6,8,10,12,14 ), with a score range in each subscale of 0-21. A higher score means greater anxiety and depression. For both subscales, scores higher than eleven would indicate &quot;case&quot; and greater than eight would be considered &quot;probable case&quot;. The internal consistency for the Spanish population is HAD-A α = .83 and HAD-D α = .87 (Vallejo, Rivera, Esteve-Vives and RodríguezMuñoz, 2012).</description>
