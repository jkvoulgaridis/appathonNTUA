  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a great interest in improving cognitive performance, including memory and attention.
      Improved attention is desirable for a large group of people because it is linked to improved
      performance . Students and professionals can benefit from improved attention and thus
      performance in academic and other work environments. In addition, cognitive functioning also
      plays an important role in sports. Various cognitive skills, including attention, reaction
      time and motor function, have shown that they can influence sport performance. A completely
      natural supplement with aronia melanocarpa (and guarana) extract could be a promising way to
      naturally improve cognitive performance.

      There is a great interest in improving cognitive performance, including memory and attention.
      Improved attention is desirable for a large group of people because it is linked to improved
      performance. Students and professionals can benefit from improved attention and thus
      performance in academic and other work environments. In addition, cognitive functioning also
      plays an important role in sports. Various cognitive skills, including attention, reaction
      time and motor function, have shown that they can influence sport performance. A completely
      natural supplement with aronia melanocarpa (and guarana) extract could be a promising way to
      naturally improve cognitive performance. The product in this study is aronia melanocarpa and
      a combination of aronia melanocarpa and guarana extract, both of which contain polyphenols. A
      limited number of clinical studies have already been carried out to see the effect of both
      products and simular products on cognitive functioning. However, these studies have often
      been done in older study populations, over a longer period of time and with one of the two
      (or simular) products. In this study, in healthy adolescents (ages between the 18-35 and with
      a BMI between 18.5 and 30), the investigators want to test the acute and short term (8 days)
      effect of aronia melanocarpa and the combination of guarana and aronia extract on cognitive
      functioning. The investigators will also test the effect of supplementation on the
      particpant's mood and the the Monoamine oxidase B level in the blood as well as the blood
      pressure. The study product is aronia malanocarpa and a combination of aronia malanocarpa
      extract and a guarana extract . Studies with the individual supplements (aronia malanocarpa
      and guarana) have shown positive indications with regard to cognitive functioning, but this
      has not been tested in healthy young adults and more importantly the combination of the two
      supplements has not yet been tested.
