  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      the study evaluates the role of autologous fat grafting and the usage of nanofat in the
      treatment of the acute burn injuries in different genders and its influences on the healing
      time and hospital stay, pain control, the need and take of a split thickness skin graft and
      its size, and the end resulting early scarring, in comparison with control group that were
      treated with traditional methods, so as to find out new method of treating burn injuries and
      decreasing its morbidity.

      as the patient is admitted, full evaluation locally ( as regard the wound itself and the
      areas of fat harvesting) and generally (assessment of the general condition) is done, fluid
      resuscitation is started as the unit protocol hand in hand with the analgesia and other
      medications prescribed according to the unit protocol.

      the patient's general condition is optimized for surgery of the fat extraction and grafting
      which typically should be within the first 6 days of admission.

      then under anesthesia (any possible type from local and regional up to general anesthesia)
      liposuction procedure is performed, then fat is processed then grafted at the wound site with
      other portion prepared as nanofat for topical use and wound coverage, then sterile dressing
      is applied.

      typically follow up is held daily with the dressing change day after another with the use of
      the nanofat only and sterile dressing
