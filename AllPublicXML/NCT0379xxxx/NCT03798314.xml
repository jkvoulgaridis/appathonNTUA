      This phase I trials studies side effects and best dose of pomalidomide when given together
      with nivolumab in treating patients with primary central nervous system diffuse large B cell
      lymphoma or primary vitreoretinal diffuse large B cell lymphoma that has come back or that
      has not responded to treatment. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as
      pomalidomide and nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may
      interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of pomalidomide which can be safely combined
      with the fixed dose schedule of nivolumab in patients with relapsed/refractory primary
      central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) and primary vitreoretinal lymphoma (PVRL). (Phase I)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the overall response rate (ORR) and progression free survival (PFS) of
      nivolumab and pomalidomide combination in patients with relapsed/refractory PCNSL and PVRL.

      OUTLINE: This is dose-escalation study of pomalidomide.

      Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 and pomalidomide
      orally (PO) on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks until disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 weeks, then every 3
      months for 4 years.

    <description>The maximum grade for each type of toxicity will be recorded for each patient, and frequency tables will be reviewed to determine toxicity patterns within patient groups. In addition, we will review all adverse event data that is graded as 3, 4, or 5 and classified as either &quot;unrelated&quot; or &quot;unlikely to be related&quot; to study treatment in the event of an actual relationship developing. The overall toxicity rates (percentages) for grade 3 or higher adverse events considered at least possibly related to treatment are reported below.</description>
