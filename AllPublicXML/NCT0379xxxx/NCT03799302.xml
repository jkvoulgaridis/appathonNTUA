  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to test the impact of an empirically derived implementation strategy—under
      real-world conditions and across multiple child service systems—on successful adoption and
      sustainment of two evidence-based programs that address adolescent substance abuse: Treatment
      Foster Care Oregon (TFCO; formerly Multidimensional Treatment Foster Care) and
      Multidimensional Family Therapy (MDFT), both developed with funding from NIDA. Methods for
      this study utilize &quot;technology-based approaches&quot; for &quot;implementing large-scale change.&quot;
      Leveraging previous data focused on developing and testing the 8-staged Stages of
      Implementation Completion (SIC) tool, a randomized evaluation of a SIC Coaching Strategy
      (SIC-CS) is proposed. Study activities include extending the SIC into the Sustainment Phase
      and testing the SIC-CS to support the adoption of new evidence-based programs.
