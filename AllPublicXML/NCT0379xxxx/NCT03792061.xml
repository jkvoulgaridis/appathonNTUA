      Abstract

      Method: Participants with a diagnosis of stroke and have cognitive impairment (a score of 3
      or more on the Executive Interview, 14-item version) will be randomly assigned to the
      intervention group and the attention control group at a 1:1 ratio. Each session will be
      around 45 minutes and will be delivered 1 to 2 sessions per week for 12 to 15 sessions.

      Outcome measures including the Participation Measure- 3 Domains, 4 Dimensions (PM-3D4D),
      Canadian Occupational Performance Measure(COPM), Activity Measure for Post-Acute Care (AMPAC)
      Outpatient Short Forms, Wisconsin Card Sorting Task (WCST), Stroop Test, Montreal Cognitive
      Assessment (MoCA), Trail-Making Test (TMT A and B), The National Institutes of Health Stroke
      scale (NIHSS), modified Rankin Scale (MRS), Euro-QoL-5-Dimension (EQ-5D) and Participation
      Strategies Self Efficacy Scale (PS-SES) will be administered at baseline (T1),
      post-intervention (T2), 3-month follow-up (T3), 6-month follow-up (T4), and 12-month
      follow-up (T5).

      Of the recruited participants, 50 will recieve the fMRI tests (including the resting-state
      scan, the fMRI scan with Stroop Test and TMT tasks, and the anatomical structure scan) at
      baseline, post-intervention, and 6month follow-up.Data will be analyzed using multiple linear
      regression models and mixed-effects regression models.

      The proposed study will examine the efficacy of a newly developed intervention program, the
      Optimizing Participation after Stroke through Strategy-training (OPASS) program on improving
      participation in productivity, social activities, and community among community-dwelling
      people with cognitive impairments after stroke. The OPASS program were developed based on the
      theoretical tenets of strategy training, with the goal of helping participants to set their
      participation goals, identify barriers to their performance, develop strategies to address
      these barriers, and generalize their learning through iterative practice. To examine the
      efficacy of OPASS, the following objectives will be addressed in this study:

        1. To examine whether, compared to a control group, participating in the OPASS program will
           improve participation in productivity, social, and community domains in stroke survivors
           with cognitive impairments;

        2. To determine whether the changes in participation after the intervention is correlated
           with changes in applied cognition, daily activities, executive functioning, and
           self-efficacy.

        3. To examine whether the intervention effect sustains at 3-, 6-, and 12-month following
           the intervention.

      To address this purpose, parallel-group randomized controlled trial will be implemented to
      assess the efficacy of the OPASS program in comparison to the control group. An expected
      sample of 210 adults with stroke-related cognitive impairments and are undergoing outpatient
      rehabilitation services will be recruited from our collaborative sites in Northern Taiwan.
      These participants will be randomly assigned to the intervention group and the attention
      control group at a 1:1 ratio.

      Outcome measures including the Participation Measure- 3 Domains, 4 Dimensions (PM-3D4D),
      Canadian Occupational Performance Measure(COPM), Activity Measure for Post-Acute Care (AMPAC)
      Outpatient Short Forms, Wisconsin Card Sorting Task (WCST), Stroop Test, Montreal Cognitive
      Assessment (MoCA), Trail-Making Test (TMT A and B), The National Institutes of Health Stroke
      scale (NIHSS), modified Rankin Scale (MRS), Euro-QoL-5-Dimension (EQ-5D) and Participation
      Strategies Self Efficacy Scale (PS-SES) will be administered at baseline (T1),
      post-intervention (T2), 3-month follow-up (T3), 6-month follow-up (T4), and 12-month
      follow-up (T5). Data will be analyzed using multiple linear regression models and
      mixed-effects regression models. Of the recruited participants, 50 will recieve the fMRI
      tests (including the resting-state scan, the fMRI scan with Stroop Test and TMT tasks, and
      the anatomical structure scan) at baseline, post-intervention, and 6month follow-up. Data
      will be analyzed using multiple linear regression models and mixed-effects regression models.

      Qualitative in-depth interviews with participants, caregivers, and therapists will be
      conducted following the intervention. Data regarding the interviewees' experiences,
      satisfaction, and their perceived effectiveness of the intervention will be collected.
      Transcribed data will be coded by two independent coders and analyzed with thematic analysis
      method.

    <measure>Participation Measure- 3 Domains, 4 Dimensions (PM-3D4D)</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 12-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The PM-3D4D is a 19-item measure that was designed to evaluate three domains of participation: Productivity, Social, and Community. Respondents are asked to rate each item on four dimensions: (1) 'Diversity of participation' (yes [1] vs. no [0]); (2) 'Frequency'(5- and 7-point scales, from &quot;never&quot; to &quot;everyday or almost everyday&quot;); (3) 'Desire for change' (yes [1] vs. no[0]); and (4) 'Perceived difficulty' (4-point scale, from &quot;very difficult&quot; [1] to &quot;not difficult at all&quot; [4]). Each dimensional score of the PM-3D4D can be separately summed for each domain. Psychometric properties of the PM-3D4D were established in rehabilitation populations.</description>

    <measure>Activity Measure for Post-Acute Care (AMPAC) Outpatient Short Forms</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 12-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The AM-PAC consists of three subscales that assesses three activity domains: basic mobility (18 items), daily activity (15 items), and applied cognitive (19 items). Each item asks the respondent to rate the difficulty to perform specified activities using a 4-point scale. The summary scores for each subscale will be transformed into standardized scores on the t-score scale.</description>

    <measure>Participation Strategies self-efficacy Scale (PS-SES)</measure>

    <description>The PSSES was developed to measure self-efficacy in managing home participation, community participation, productivity, communication, staying organized, and advocating for resources. The scale consists of 35 items. Each item is rated using a 1-10 Likert scale, with higher score indicating greater self-efficacy.</description>

    <measure>Stroop Test</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 12-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked to read out the ink color of the word as accurately and as soon as possible. The ink color of the word could be congruent or incongruent with the written color name. Each participant's time to complete the task will be calculated and recorded. Construct validity of the Stroop Test in the TBI population has been published.</description>

    <measure>Trail-Making Test (TMT A and B)</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 12-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Trail-Making Test (TMT A and B) will be used to measure sustained attention, sequencing, mental flexibility, and visual tracking. TMT-A requires the individual to link in an ascending order a series of 25 numbered circles distributed randomly on a test paper as quickly as possible. TMT-B is similar, although it requires the individual to link switching alternatively between a set of numbers (1-13) and a set of letters (A-L) in an ascending order (1-A-2-B-3-C...). The Time to complete TMT A and B will be calculated, in which a longer completion time will indicate poorer outcome. This instrument was validated in healthy people, patients with head injury, vascular disorders, and other diverse populations.</description>

    <description>This approach is different from traditional direct skill training, which emphasizes clinicians' responsibility on identifying their patients' challenges in performing activities and teaching patients task-specific problem-solving strategies. Strategy training, on the other hand, requires clinicians to take a role as a facilitator, guiding participants to learn through prompts and questions. In the training process, participants learn to develop their own problem-solving strategies and work through the problems they have, through which they can develop self-efficacy and confidence to manage participation challenges. Participants can also generalize the strategies they learn to other similar problems they encounter in daily life.</description>
