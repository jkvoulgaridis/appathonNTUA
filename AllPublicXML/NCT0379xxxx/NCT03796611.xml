  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent works highlight the B cells involvement in multiple sclerosis (MS) pathology but their
      role remains poorly understood. It was previously described that activated memory B cells
      called 4BL due to the increased expression of 4-1BBL, an activation marker, induce
      pro-inflammatory response by activating T CD8+ lymphocytes. Those 4BL cells are also
      described in systemic inflammation in 80 years old people explaining the poor efficiency of
      vaccination in that sub population. Those 4BL cells can also induce anti-tumoral T cell
      response.

      The hypothesize is that 4BL may induce a pathogenic inflammatory response in MS.

      the aim to compare the proportion of peripheral (blood) 4 BL cells but also 4-BL cells in
      cerebro spinal fluid (CSF) in MS compared to healthy controls and to other inflammatory
      neurological disease but also non inflammatory neurological disease.

      For all groups of patients and controls we will collect blood and CSF only once (at diagnosis
      time for patients).

      Blood collect from healthy controls will come from transfusion volunteers and we won't have
      CSF from them.

      For patients from the MS group, the blood collect will be sequential at diagnosis, 3, 6, 12
      and 24 months after during the follow up.

      In the blood and CSF we will evaluate:

        -  percentage of 4 BL cells. 4 BL cells are found using cytometric parameters

        -  capacity of 4 BL cells to induce inflammatory response in vitro: percentage of induced
           activated TCD8 proliferation after cell culture using extracellular and intracellular
           cytometric parameters
