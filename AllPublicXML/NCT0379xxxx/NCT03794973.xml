  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center trial
      in subjects with new onset T1D.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will include 210 male or female subjects aged 12 to 35 years diagnosed with T1D, as
      defined by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria and meeting enrollment criteria
      as follows. Initial enrollment will be restricted to subjects aged 18 and older until an
      analysis of data from subjects with 3 months' exposure to drug confirms safety. Upon
      completion of this assessment, enrollment will be open without further restrictions for
      subjects aged 12-35.

             prevent complete participation in the study or would pose a significant hazard to the
             subject's participation.

         19. Anticipated major surgery during the duration of the trial, which could interfere with
             participation in the trial.

         20. History of drug or alcohol dependence within 12 months of screening.

         21. Psychiatric disorder that would prevent subjects from giving informed consent.
