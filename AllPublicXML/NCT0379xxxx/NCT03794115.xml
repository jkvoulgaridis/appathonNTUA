  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this preliminary study, peripheral blood and carcinoma tissue with pericarcinomatous
      tissue are taken from the patients with ovarian high grade serous carcinoma at several
      points: before any treatment, after the debulking surgery, and after all the proposed
      chemotherapy. The differential expression of the T/B lymphocyte receptors in these samples
      will be analyzed with the platinum-based treatment and survival outcomes of the patients. The
      primary objective is the expression rates of T/B lymphocyte receptors in different stages of
      checking points.
