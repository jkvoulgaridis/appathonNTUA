  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trial was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      parallel-controlled, exploratory clinical study.Through the intervention of soluble dietary
      fiber in the pre-type 2 diabetic population, the change of blood glucose spectrum before and
      after intervention can show the effect of this intervention on the outcome, and further
      elucidate the effect of soluble dietary fiber intervention on the level of insulin resistance
      and its effect on outcome. Helps to prevent the more scientific and effective prevention of
      type 2 diabetes from pre-diabetes.

      Subjects who met the criteria were randomly divided into the experimental group and the
      control group, after 24 weeks of intervention, the incidence of blood sugar reversion to
      normal was main observed.The main purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of
      soluble dietary fiber treatment regimens on the conversion rate of pre-type 2 diabetes
      (converted to normal blood glucose, type 2 diabetes, or stable in the stage of impaired
      glucose tolerance). The secondary objective was to study the improvement of insulin
      resistance and changes in intestinal flora after intervention.

      The soluble dietary fiber (NIUCHANG®) and placebo used in the trial were exclusively produced
      by Inuling (Beijing) Technology Co., Ltd. and provided free of charge. During the treatment
      period, the treatment group was given oral &quot;NIUCHANG®&quot; (once 15g,once a day)and the control
      group was given oral placebo (once15 g, once a day) for 24 weeks.

      The test was performed for 12 weeks as a course of treatment。At the end of one course of
      treatment, if the glucose tolerance was changed to normal or the blood glucose was stable in
      the pre-diabetes phase, the original dose was maintained and continued for 12 weeks. At 24
      weeks, patients with normal blood glucose and glucose tolerance tests were followed up for 48
      weeks. At the end of one course of treatment, if the blood glucose progresses to the stage of
      diabetes, the test is withdrawn and treated according to clinical routine.
