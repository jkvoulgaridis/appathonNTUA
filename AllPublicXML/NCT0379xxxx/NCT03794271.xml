  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators measure a pupil size every 5 minutes during the operation in
      patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy under general anesthesia. The investigators
      would compare the postoperative pain intensity between the group adjusted the anesthetic drug
      concentration based on the changes of the pupil (Pupil group) and the group based on the
      changes of a surgical pleth index (SPI group).

    <description>Patients are asked to rate their pain according to the numeric rating scale (NRS, 0=no pain to 10= extreme pain imaginable) every 10 min after the PACU admission. Peak pain score is the peak NRS during PACU stay. Higher NRS represents a worse outcome.</description>

    <description>Remnant sedation is evaluated by Riker Sedation-Agitation (RSA) Scale every 10 minutes after the PACU admission.
unarousable, minimal or no response to noxious stimuli, does not communicate of follow commands
very sedate, arouse to physical stimuli but does not communicate or follow command, may move spontaneously
sedate, difficult to arouse but awakens to verbal stimuli or gentle shaking, follows simple commands but drifts off again
Calm and cooperative, calm and follows commands
agitated, anxious or physically agitated and calms to verbal instructions
very agitated, requiring restraint and frequent verbal reminding of limits, biting endotracheal tubes
dangerous agitation, pulling at tracheal tube, trying to remove catheters or striking at staff
RSA scale 4 means normal. If the RSA &lt;4, it means the patients are sedated. If the RSA &gt;5, it means the patients are agitated.</description>

    <description>At least 10 min after anesthesia induction by target-controlled infusion of propofol and remifentanil, baseline values for pupillary diameter is recorded before any surgical procedure.
During the operation, propofol effect-site target concentration (Ce) is adjusted to maintain the bispectral index (BIS) value between 40 and 60. Remifentanil Ce is adapted every 5 min based on the changes of pupillary diameter. If the pupillary diameter is increased by more than 30% compared to baseline value, remifentanil concentration is increased by 0.5 ng/ml. If the pupillary diameter is maintained between 5 and 30 % change compared with baseline, remifentanil is not modified. In a case of pupillary diameter is decreased less than 5 % change of baseline, remifentanil concentration is decreased by 0.5 ng/ml.</description>

    <description>During the operation, SPI value should be maintained between 20 and 50 by changing the infusion rate of remifentanil. Even if the SPI is maintained within the target range, the remifentanil infusion rate is increased by 0.5 ng/ml in a case of the SPI value suddenly arises by more than 10.</description>
