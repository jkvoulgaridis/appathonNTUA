    <textblock>
      REDHART2 is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial to determine the effects
      of Anakinra on peak aerobic exercise capacity measured with a cardiopulmonary test after 24
      weeks in patients with recently decompensated systolic heart failure and increased systemic
      inflammation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The REDHART2 (REcently Decompensated Heart failure Anakinra Response 2 Trial) study is a
      phase II clinical trial of anakinra or placebo to determine improvement in aerobic exercise
      capacity (by measuring maximal oxygen uptake (VO2)) in patients with recently decompensated
      systolic heart failure (HF). The recently completed pilot REDHART study showed anakinra
      treatment for 12 weeks led to a significant improvement in peak aerobic exercise capacity,
      whereas anakinra treatment for 2 weeks did not, and no significant changes were seen in
      placebo. The REDHART2 study is designed to expand and confirm the beneficial effect of
      sustained anakinra treatment (24 weeks) on peak VO2, and to explore the potential effect size
      on hospital readmissions for HF. The rationale of Interleukin-1 (IL-1) blockade with anakinra
      in heart failure stems from the evidence of a) reduced adverse cardiac remodeling and heart
      failure in animal models of acute myocardial infarction (AMI); b) reduced incidence of heart
      failure in patients with ST-segment elevation AMI; c) enhanced IL-1 activity in patients with
      heart failure, d) quenching of the acute inflammatory response in patients with acute
      decompensated heart failure, e) direct cardiodepressant effects of IL-1 in animal models, f)
      improved exercise capacity in pilot studies including patients with stable systolic heart
      failure, stable diastolic heart failure, and, recently decompensated systolic heart failure
      in the pilot REDHART study. Patients will be randomized 2:1 to active treatment, such that
      patients will be twice as likely to receive anakinra versus placebo.
