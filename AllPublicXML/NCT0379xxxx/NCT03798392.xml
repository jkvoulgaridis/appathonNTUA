  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Supraglottic airway devices (SGAs) are very commonly used during anesthesia but structural
      vulnerability to airway morbidity and issues about cuff pressure still concern
      anesthesiologists. There have been controversial results regarding optimal intra-cuff
      pressure in various types of cuffed supraglottic airways. When the supraglottic cuff pressure
      is more than the mucosal perfusion pressure, it is likely to either cause postoperative
      pharyngo-laryngeal symptoms like sore throat (dysphagia, dysphonia) or cause local mucosal
      trauma and nerve injuries. Supraglottic airway devices with non-inﬂatable cuff have
      advantages in omitting the cuff pressure monitoring and reducing potential pharyngo-laryngeal
      complications.

      Self-pressurizing Air Q blocker is the latest version. It has a drain tube through which a
      suction tube is passed. There is an inflatable cuff at the end of this tube. On inflation,
      the cuff seals the esophageal opening into the stomach, preventing any regurgitation of
      stomach contents. Instead of the pilot balloon and inﬂating cuff, the air-Q SP with blocker
      has a communication oriﬁce at the junction of the peri-glotic cuff and the airway tube. This
      communication between two spaces enables the cuff to dynamically regulate intra-cuff pressure
      depending on airway pressure. This distinguishing feature of the air-Q SP may result in
      reduced risk for airway morbidities related to cuff hyperinﬂation.

      The Baska mask is a novel supraglottic airway device with a non-inﬂatable cuff, an
      oesophageal drainage inlet and side channels to facilitate aspiration of gastric contents,
      and an integrated bite-block. It was revealed that the baska mask is relatively easy to
      insert, provided a high-quality seal with the glotic aperture and the incidence of throat
      discomfort appeared low.

      To our knowledge, and after searching in previous literature, no previous studies have
      compared the Air-Q SP with blocker with Baska mask; another supraglottic airway devices with
      non-inﬂatable cuff.
