  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A total of 40 HIV infected patients will be randomly assigned into intervention or control
      group. Participants in the intervention group will use an smart phone application for two
      months. Participants will receive reminder notifications and use the app to take and send
      videos of themselves taking the pill(s), uploaded videos will be centrally reviewed by a
      study nurse . Control group participants will receive standard care. Antiretroviral Therapy
      adherence will be measured by self-report, pill count, and smart bottle as well as the App.
      Participants' perceptions of app using experience will be recorded via face to face
      interview.

    <measure>Participants' perceptions on using MIST intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>two-month follow-up visit (end of the study visit)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants' perception of MIST intervention , assessed at the 2 month visit by a sei-structured interview. The interview mainly addressed five areas namely: perception of overall MIST app use experience, perceived usefulness of each feature, strengths and weakness of MIST, interest in continued to use MIST for future and recommendations for further improvements.</description>

    <description>MIST system will send a reminder notification (via push or SMS) to participants 10 to 15 minutes before the scheduled time for taking their medication. Participants will then activate the recording function of the MIST app on their phone, and record themselves taking their medication.Participants will be asked to go through a series of steps for recording the video.</description>
