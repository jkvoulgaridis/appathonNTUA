      The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of a brief, emotion regulation intervention
      on the ability to perceive other people's emotions.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The ability to perceive negative and positive emotional expressions, as measured by a behavioral computer-based assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Laboratory assessment, up to one week</time_frame>
    <description>Emotion perception is measured by a computer-based behavioral assessment during the laboratory session. Scores for negative emotional expressions and positive emotional expressions range from 0-30, with higher scores indicating greater emotion perception accuracy.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in emotion perception, as measured by a phone-based behavioral assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>Perception of positive emotional expressions and negative emotional expressions are measured by a behavioral phone-based assessment, delivered multiple times over one week via mobile phones. Scores for negative emotional expressions and positive emotional expressions range from 0-21, with higher scores indicating greater emotion perception accuracy.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Emotional distress, as measured by Subjective Units of Distress (SUDS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Laboratory assessment, up to one week</time_frame>
    <description>Scores are measured on a 10-point Likert self-report scale of Subjective Units of Distress (SUDS), ranging from 0-9 with higher scores indicating higher emotional distress (worse outcome).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in emotional arousal, as measured by skin conductance response (SCR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Laboratory assessment, up to one week</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in emotional arousal are measured physiologically with electrodermal activity. Skin conductance response measures phasic changes in electrical conductivity of skin, with a minimum threshold of 0.01Î¼S with higher values indicating greater changes in emotional arousal.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Placebo Comparator</arm_group_type>

          4. high emotion dysregulation, assessed with the Difficulties with Emotion Regulation
             Scale (DERS)(Gratz &amp; Roemer, 2004) with scores over 90.

        Exclusion Criteria:
