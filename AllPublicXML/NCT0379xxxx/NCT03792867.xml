  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Retroperitoneal sarcoma is a rare cancer that accounts for 15% of soft tissue sarcomas and
      affects many young people. In approximately 50% of patients, the tumour will reappear in the
      same area regardless of therapy. Current treatment involves radical resection; however, it
      does not significantly reduce recurrence rates or improve overall survival. Recurrent
      retroperitoneal sarcoma does not respond well to chemotherapy and prognosis is often guarded.
      One of the main challenges in the surgical treatment of this disease is the ability to
      accurately identify the local extension of the disease and to prevent local recurrence.

      At present, there are no options to prevent recurrence after surgery. In recent years, there
      has been increased interest in the use of combined radical surgery with heated
      intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC). Radical resection is defined as en-bloc resection of
      the tumour including but not limited to surrounding organ resection and normal fat. This is
      in combination with the use of HIPEC. HIPEC is the use of chemotherapy in the intraperitoneal
      cavity that is heated to 40 to 42 degree Celsius.

      Surgery coupled with HIPEC has shown to reduce recurrence in colorectal cancer, appendiceal
      cancer and mesothelioma. We hypothesize that HIPEC when coupled with radical surgery will
      improve the overall outcomes of patients with retroperitoneal sarcomatosis. We hope to learn
      if this treatment approach will increase locoregional control to reduce recurrence rates and
      improve survival.
