      This is an open-label, single arm, two-stage Simon Design study for women with Triple
      Negative Breast Cancer treated with Nanoparticle Albumin-Bound Paclitaxel and Carboplatin.

      The primary objective of the trial is to evaluate of the efficacy and safety of weekly
      Nanoparticle Albumin-Bound Paclitaxel(Nab-P) Followed by Dose-Intensive Epirubicin in
      Combination with Cyclophosphamide as Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Triple Negative Breast
      Cancer.

      The primary endpoint of the study is to to assess Pathological complete response
      rate（pCR）using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1)..

      The total number of patients to be included in this study is 60 patients.

      The duration of the study, from first patient visit to last patient visit will be
      approximately 19 months.
