  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is 1) to evaluate the feasibility of manufacturing a
      patient-specific neoantigen cancer vaccine, which involves predicting the patient's
      neoantigens and generating a vaccine that encodes the predicted neoantigens; and, 2) to
      identify and select patients who may be eligible for a shared neoantigen cancer vaccine where
      their tumor contains a specific shared mutation and who have the correct HLA allele capable
      of presenting the neoantigen derived from the tumor-specific mutation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gritstone is developing two neoantigen-based cancer vaccines: the first is a patient-specific
      cancer vaccine that requires a manufacturing period for each patient and the second is an
      off-the-shelf cancer vaccine that targets shared neoantigens.

      The process of generating a patient-specific neoantigen cancer vaccine involves multiple
      steps, including collection of patient tumor and blood specimens, performing next-generation
      sequencing (NGS), predicting the neoantigens to be included in the patient-specific vaccine,
      and the manufacture and release of the patient-specific vaccine. Gaining experience in
      managing the manufacturing process will provide important insights and experience regarding
      this process to be used in operationalizing future clinical trials.

      Selecting patients who may be eligible to receive a shared neoantigen vaccine requires first
      identifying patients whose tumor possesses a neoantigen derived from an oncogenic mutation
      that is encoded by the vaccine, and then determining whether the patient expresses a matching
      HLA allele for antigen presentation.

      Study participants will not receive any investigational treatment as part of this trial.
      Patients screened in this study may be able to enroll in a separate investigational treatment
      study sponsored by Gritstone Oncology, provided that the patient meets the specified
      eligibility criteria for that treatment study.
