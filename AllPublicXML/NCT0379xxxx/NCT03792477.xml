    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, 2-treatment, 2-period, single dose (200 mg, IM) cross-over study,
      2-part design to evaluate the bioequivalence (BE) of a reformulated presentation (test) of
      testosterone cypionate solution for injection relative to the currently approved marked
      formulation (reference). In the first part of the study (Part 1), an estimate of the exposure
      variability will be evaluated for both test and reference. This will help guide sample size
      in Part 2. Part 2 will be powered to assess the BE of both test and reference formulations.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Hypogonadal male subjects who, at the time of screening, are otherwise healthy and
             between the ages of 18 and 65 years, inclusive. Healthy is defined as no clinically
             relevant abnormalities identified by a detailed medical history, full physical
             examination, including blood pressure (BP) and pulse rate measurement, 12 lead
             electrocardiogram (ECG), or clinical laboratory tests.

             Hypogonadism is defined as serum testosterone levels below 2.5 ng/mL (250 ng/dL).

          2. Body mass index (BMI) of 17.5 to 35 kg/m2; and a total body weight &gt;50 kg (110 lb).

          3. Evidence of a personally signed and dated informed consent document indicating that
             the subject has been informed of all pertinent aspects of the study.

          4. Subjects who are willing and able to comply with all scheduled visits, treatment plan,
             laboratory tests, and other study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurological, or
             allergic disease (including drug allergies, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic,
             seasonal allergies at the time of dosing).

          2. Subjects who are currently being treated for hypogonadism. This is defined as either
             patients who have received a testosterone injectable product within the past 3 months
             or have used a transdermal or gel product within the past 2 weeks.

          3. A positive urine drug test.

          4. History of regular alcohol consumption exceeding 14 drinks/week (1 drink = 5 ounces
             [150 mL] of wine or 12 ounces [360 mL] of beer or 1.5 ounces [45 mL] of hard liquor)
             within 6 months before screening.

          5. Treatment with an investigational drug within 30 days (or as determined by the local
             requirement) or 5 half lives preceding the first dose of investigational product
             (whichever is longer).

          6. Screening supine BP greater than or equal to 140 mm Hg (systolic) or greater than or
             equal to 90 mm Hg (diastolic), following at least 5 minutes of supine rest. If BP is
             greater than or equal to 140 mm Hg (systolic) or greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg
             (diastolic), the BP should be repeated 2 more times and the average of the 3 BP values
             should be used to determine the subject's eligibility.

          7. Screening supine 12 lead ECG demonstrating a corrected QT (QTc) interval &gt;450 msec or
             a QRS interval &gt;120 msec. If QTc exceeds 450 msec, or QRS exceeds 120 msec, the ECG
             should be repeated 2 more times and the average of the 3 QTc or QRS values should be
             used to determine the subject's eligibility.

          8. Subjects with ANY of the following abnormalities in clinical laboratory tests at
             screening, as assessed by the study-specific laboratory and confirmed by a single
             repeat test, if deemed necessary:

               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level greater
                  than or equal to 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN).

               -  Total bilirubin level greater than or equal to 1.5 times the ULN; subject with a
                  history of Gilbert's syndrome may have direct bilirubin measured and would be
                  eligible for this study provided the direct bilirubin level is less than or equal
                  to ULN.

          9. Fertile male subjects who are unwilling or unable to use a highly effective method of
             contraception as outlined in this protocol [Contraception (Section 4.3.4)] for the
             duration of the study and for at least 45 days after the last dose of investigational
             product.

         10. Use of prescription or nonprescription drugs and dietary supplements within 7 days or
             5 half lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of investigational product.
             As an exception, acetaminophen/paracetamol may be used at doses of greater than or
             equal to 1 g/day. Limited use of nonprescription medications that are not believed to
             affect subject safety or the overall results of the study may be permitted on a case
             by case basis following approval by the sponsor.

         11. Blood donation (excluding plasma donations) of approximately 1 pint (500 mL) or more
             within 56 days prior to dosing.

         12. History of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B, or hepatitis C; positive
             testing for HIV, hepatitis B surface antigen (HepBsAg), hepatitis B core antibody
             (HepBcAb), or hepatitis C antibody (HCVAb).

         13. History of sensitivity to heparin or heparin induced thrombocytopenia.

         14. Unwilling or unable to comply with the criteria in the Lifestyle Requirements section
             of this protocol.

         15. Subjects who are investigator site staff members directly involved in the conduct of
             the study and their family members, site staff members otherwise supervised by the
             investigator, or subjects who are Pfizer employees, including their family members,
             directly involved in the conduct of the study.

         16. Other acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition including recent (within the
             past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior or laboratory abnormality that may
             increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational product
             administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the
             judgment of the investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for entry into this
             study.

         17. Subjects with carcinoma of the breast.

         18. Subjects with known or suspected carcinoma of the prostate gland.

         19. Subjects who are hypersensitive to testosterone cypionate or its inactive ingredients.
