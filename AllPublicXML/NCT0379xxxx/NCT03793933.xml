  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program's (ACS-NSQIP)
      calculator has been endorsed by the surgeons' community to counsel patients and relatives
      regarding estimated postoperative complications. However, it does not include organ-specific
      risks. The aim of this study was to assess the ACS-NSQIP calculator's ability to predict
      complications, mortality and length of stay (LOS) in patients undergoing hepatectomy for
      liver tumors

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational retrospective study conducted in a tertiary-referral university
      hospital. An established classification of complications, including post-hepatectomy
      insufficiency and bile leak, was adopted. The endpoint was the rate of complications,
      mortality and LOS as expected by the ACS-NSQIP calculator and as observed within 90-day after
      surgery.
