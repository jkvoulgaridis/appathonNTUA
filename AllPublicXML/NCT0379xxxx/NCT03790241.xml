  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to analyze the palpation and perforation motion performed by the
      practitioner during the insertion of a catheter while measuring the loads applied on the skin
      and the veins.

      These experimental measures will be used for the design of a more realistic peripheral venous
      catheter insertion simulator in order to better prepare healthcare students for their first
      in vivo venous puncture.

    <measure>Punctures forces of the skin and veins measured by an instrumented syringue</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 (at intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>According to the literature, puncture forces of soft tissues are decomposed as a summation of stiffness forces, friction forces and cutting forces. In the case of this study, an instrumented syringe has been designed to measure the puncture force in function of time. This device includes a miniature1-axis load sensor. The catheters can be easily removed thanks to a conical fitting which is directly connected to the load sensor to obtain the forces when inserting and withdrawing the catheter.
The primary sought measures are the peak force occurring when penetrating the skin and the vein as well as the friction forces when withdrawing the catheter from the vein.</description>

    <measure>Needle velocity during perforation measured by a flexible piezoresistive sensor</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0</time_frame>
    <description>In order to obtain the load applied by the practitioner to locate the vein to puncture, a flexible piezoresistive sensor is placed to the practitioner's fingertip with double side tape The sensor is linked to its acquisition module which is connected via Wi-Fi to a computer.
In order to not disturb the motion of the practitioner, the module if fixed with a sport armband to the forearm.
The primary sought measure is the curve force in function of time.</description>
