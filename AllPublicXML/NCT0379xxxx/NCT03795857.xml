  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In France, according to current legislation, termination of pregnancy could be performed
      without any upper gestational age limit, if there is a strong probability that the fetus will
      be affected by a particularly severe and incurable disease. When there is a lethal fetal
      diagnosis most of parents wish to terminate their pregnancy. However, and despite some
      medical resistance a few of them do wish to continue pregnancy. In these situations,
      palliative care seems to be a good way to prepare to welcome the child and surround him until
      death.

      The aim of the study is to describe parents' experience for a better understanding and a
      better care.
