  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if a combination of paclitaxel protein bound (also known
      as nab-paclitaxel), gemcitabine, and cisplatin when given with high dose Ascorbic Acid will
      be safe and effective in individuals with untreated metastatic pancreatic cancer.

      Vitamin C is a nutrient found in food and dietary supplements. It protects cells and also
      plays a key role in making collagen (which provides strength and structure to skin, bones,
      tissues and tendons). High-dose vitamin C may be given by intravenous (IV) infusion (through
      a vein into the bloodstream) or orally (taken by mouth). When taken by intravenous infusion,
      vitamin C can reach much higher levels in the blood than when the same amount is taken by
      mouth. Some human studies of high-dose IV vitamin C in patients with cancer have shown
      improved quality of life, as well as improvements in physical, mental, and emotional
      functions, symptoms of fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain, and appetite loss. Intravenous
      high-dose ascorbic acid has caused very few side effects in clinical trials.

             percent AND serum ferritin &gt; 200 ng/mL (males) or &gt;150 ng/mL (females).

          -  Current, serious, clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias as determined by the
