  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single centre randomised, placebo-controlled phase 2 study in which 96 children age
      4 to 16 years with moderate to severe, longstanding allergic eczema will be enrolled.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following a 4 to 6 week period on standardised treatment (run-in period, to ensure everyone
      starts with the same treatment approach), participants will be randomised to an active or
      dummy temperature-controlled laminar airflow (TLA) device, which has been shown to markedly
      reduce exposure to particles which can cause allergic reactions when being inhaled (inhaled
      allergens) and other particles which are in the air the investigators breathe in. This has
      been shown to be an effective treatment of atopic asthma.

      The participants will undergo a 12-week treatment period. The device will then be removed and
      a final follow-up visit occurs at 16 weeks. The total study duration, including the run-in
      period is up to 22 weeks.
