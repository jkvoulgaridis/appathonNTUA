  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Candidemia is the most frequent invasive fungal disease in intensive care units (ICUs). It
      remains a major health concern, considering its attributable mortality up to 40% in
      critically ill patients. Successful clinical outcome requires early diagnosis and effective
      antifungal therapy. Guidelines for the treatment of candidemia were published by the
      Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the European Society of Clinical
      Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID). According to these guidelines, echinocandins
      are the preferred first-line therapy for candidemia in critically ill patients. Considering
      the bibliography supporting this statement, the place of triazoles still needs to be defined
      in candidemia therapeutic arsenal. In this context, we are setting up a retrospective cohort
      study using Hospital database to compare the efficacy of echinocandins and azoles for the
      treatment of candidemia in intensive care units.
