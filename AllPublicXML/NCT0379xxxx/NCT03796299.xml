  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer, the development and introduction to the
      clinical practice of an adequately accurate biomarker may allow to limit the indications for
      performing control cystoscopy. Thus, it will reduce the discomfort and stress of patients,
      the risk of complications of the invasive procedure and probably significantly reduce the
      costs incurred by healthcare systems.

      The aim of the present study is to determine the usefulness of the determination of MCM5
      protein expression in the urine of patients with urinary bladder or upper urinary tract
      cancer.

    <description>Each participant will be asked to urinate in a plastic container. Urine will be centrifuged afterwards, then the expression of MCM5 protein will be examined in cells from urine sediment. For this purpose, it is planned to use the Arquer Diagnostics ADXBLADDER test. It is an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using two monoclonal antibodies directed against two different epitopes. Both antibodies have high affinity and specificity for the MCM5 antigen.</description>
