  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The long-term goal of this study is to validate a simple and inexpensive intervention to
      reduce the incidence and impact of Postpartum Depression (PPD). The central hypothesis is
      that enhancing social support of new mothers specifically via an organized peer get-together
      will decrease rates of postpartum depression. The rationale for the proposed research is that
      even though PPD is common and risk factors for developing PPD are known, simple and
      inexpensive interventions to prevent PPD need to be studied. Postpartum mothers will be
      recruited for the study and randomized into control versus intervention group. The
      intervention group will be placed in a peer discussion group. Incidence of PPD will be
      tracked.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to a 2014 Cochrane Review, postpartum depression (PPD) is present in 13% of new
      mothers by twelve weeks postpartum. Infant feeding, sleep routines, growth, and
      socioemotional and cognitive development can be adversely affected by maternal PPD. These
      negative effects can last into childhood. Previous studies have shown that strong social
      support is protective against PPD. The 2014 Cochrane Review on this topic comments that
      simple, inexpensive interventions to decrease rates of PPD are needed and that interventions
      led by lay-people and done in groups may be helpful to decrease rates of PPD. More recent
      studies focus on interventions for mothers already showing symptoms of postpartum depression,
      not on preventing these symptoms from developing.

      The proposed work is important, because it capitalizes on recommendations for future research
      from the 2014 Cochrane Review on Psychosocial and Psychological Interventions for Preventing
      Postpartum Depression. The proposed work is also innovative, because it involves a preventive
      intervention from lay-people in a group setting, with new moms benefiting from each other. At
      the completion of this project, it is our expectation that mothers in the intervention group
      will have sustained decreased rates of PPD.

    <description>Subjects in the intervention group will be asked to attend one peer group between four and eight weeks postpartum. Peer groups will be expected to last approximately one hour. Each peer group will include 5-10 new mothers. A facilitator will be present for these groups, but the hope is to have mothers discuss with each other their postpartum experience and activities of their newborn at home.</description>
