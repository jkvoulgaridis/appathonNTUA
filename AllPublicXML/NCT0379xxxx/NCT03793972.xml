  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Introduction: Patients who might also go to the general practitioner (GP) frequently consult
      emergency departments (ED). This leads to additional costs for both government and patient
      and a high workload for emergency physicians in Flanders. The Belgian government wants to
      address this problem by improved collaboration between EDs and general practice cooperatives
      (GPCs).

      Intervention: Patients presenting at the ED during out-of-hours (OOH) will be triaged and
      allocated to the most appropriate service. For this purpose the Manchester Triage System
      (MTS) which is commonly used in Flemish hospitals, will be extended (eMTS). By doing so a
      trained nurse will be able to diverge suitable patients towards the GPC.

      Methodology: The investigators will conduct a cluster randomised controlled trial in which
      eligible ED patients will be diverged to the GPC using the eMTS. The investigators will
      collect data using the iCAREdata database. The investigators will study the use of the eMTS,
      the effectiveness and effects of triage, work load changes, epidemiology at both departments,
      patient safety, health insurance (HIS) and patient expenditures. Furthermore, facilitators
      and barriers will be studied and an incident analysis of problem cases will be performed.

      Outcome: The primary outcome is the proportion of patients who enter the ED and are handled
      by the GP after triage. Secondary outcome measurements are related to safety: referral rate
      to the ED by the GP, proportion of patients not following the triage advice and file review
      for selected patients.

    <description>During intervention weekends(and holidays) a nurse will triage patients using a newly developped extended Manchester Triage System (eMTS). Patients appropriate for primary care will be referred to the general practitioner on call.We will inform patients about the nature of the intervention using leaflets and broadcasting in the waiting room of the Emergency Department.</description>

    <description>During a control weekend (and holidays), all data registration and collection will be the same as during intervention weekends but patents will not be informed about their allocation advice. The emergency physician will see all patients deciding to stay at the ED, without influence of the triage advice. As in standard clinical care, patients will have the right to change their mind and go spontaneously to the general practitioner. . During control weekends, we will only inform about triage in general but no about the general practioner or the intervention.</description>
