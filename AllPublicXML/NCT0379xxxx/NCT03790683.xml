      The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of EnsoETM as a supplemental warming
      device compared to the standard of care warming practice in patients having major surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Maintaining patient's body temperature is of major importance in patients undergoing surgical
      procedures and existing methods to warm patients to maintain perioperative normothermia have
      limitations. This results in as many as half of patients undergoing surgery developing
      inadvertent hypothermia during and/or after their procedure. The EnsoETM is an Esophageal
      Temperature Management (ETM) device consisting of a multi-chambered silicone tube connected
      to a heat exchanger and placed in the esophagus, providing highly efficient heat transfer to
      a patient. The EnsoETM potentially improves the ability to control patient temperature by
      eliminating the disadvantages of existing methods while maintaining the functionality of the
      orogastric tube that it replaces.

      The primary objective of this study is to measure the number of degree-hours spent below 37°C
      intraoperatively and until recovery in the PACU. This measure will be compared between
      patients having standard management of body temperature to patients having the EnsoETM placed
      as an additional warming device.
