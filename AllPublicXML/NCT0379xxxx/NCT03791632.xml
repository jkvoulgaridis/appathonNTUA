    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to identify the knowledge and behavior on dental health and hygiene
      among adolescents. In most cases, the investigators know tooth decay can be prevented and
      reversed at an early stage by observing good oral hygiene. Few studies have been done among
      adolescents.

      This study could justify the implementation of public health actions in terms of prevention.
