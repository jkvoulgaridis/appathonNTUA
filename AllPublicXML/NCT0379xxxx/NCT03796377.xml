  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Single-center, open-label, sequential treatment study to investigate the influence of the
      combined P-glycoprotein and CYP3A4 inducer hypericum perforatum on the pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics of rivaroxaban in healthy volunteers.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each session (one with and one without preceding CYP induction) will start with phenotyping
      using 25 mg fexofenadine orally for P-gp phenotyping and 2 mg midazolam orally for cytochrome
      P450 (CYP) 3A4 phenotyping. After a washout period of 5 days, subjects will receive a single
      oral dose of 20 mg rivaroxaban, a dose currently approved for human use in clinical routine.
      The same procedure will be repeated after pretreatment with St. John's wort extract (Jarsin®)
      twice daily 450 mg po (dose usually used in clinical routine) for 2 weeks.
