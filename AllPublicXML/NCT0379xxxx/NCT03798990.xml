  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      On the first July 2018, the French government lowered the maximum authorized speeds on
      two-way roads without a central separator from 90 km/h to 80 km/h. The network concerned
      represents approximately 400 000 km of roads outside the built-up area, accounting for 55% of
      road deaths.

      The objective of the measure is to reduce the number of deaths on the roads concerned by
      encouraging the reduction of the average speed practiced by drivers.

      The analysis deals with a comparison of the number of killed persons on the network
      concerned, before and after the reduction of the speed limits. The &quot;before&quot; period is
      2015-2017. The &quot;after&quot; period is from July 2018 to June 2019.

      The data used are extracted from the national bodily injury accident file (BAAC). The police
      fills this file for each road accidents occurring on a road open to public traffic and
      causing at least one victim (i.e., one user requiring medical care and involving at least one
      vehicle).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This measure was intended general and concerns a type of roads in its entirety. The rest of
      the road network is too heterogeneous (urban, highways ...), leading to an accidentology very
      far in terms of severity, users concerned and families of accidents to allow the
      establishment of control groups that would not be affected by a reduction in the speed limit.
      As a result, the principle of an assessment of &quot;before-and-after&quot; effects has been retained.
