      The Automated Check-in Data Collection (AC DC) Study, is a pilot feasibility study, observing
      patients consulting in general practice and completing an automated check-in screen prior to
      their booked appointment, to confirm their attendance. Participants will be recruited over
      three weeks from approximately 11 participating general practices.

      The primary objective of the study is to assess patient acceptability for answering brief
      research questions in the general practice waiting room, using an automated check-in screen.
      This will be measured by observing the percentage of completed automated check-in screens
      with entered research data.

      Secondary objectives will assess check-in completion of self-reported pain and willingness to
      be contacted about future research studies of relevance. Reported severity of bodily pain
      experienced over the last 4 weeks and the proportion of patients agreeing to be contacted
      about future research studies of relevance, will be observed.
