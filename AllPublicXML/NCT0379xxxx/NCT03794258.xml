    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2a, open-label, randomized study. The study is designed to test the
      hypothesis that the nucleoside inhibitor sofosbuvir combined with NS5A inhibitor daclatasvir
      and NS5B non-nucleoside inhibitor CDI-31244 with/without the protease inhibitor asunaprevir
      will result in high SVR rate with a shortened treatment duration (2 weeks) in non-cirrhotic
      HCV genotype 1b-infected subjects.

         10. Male subjects must agree to refrain from sperm donation from the date of screening
             until at least 4 months after the last dose of the triple therapies.

             as determined by the Investigator.

         12. Subject must be able to comply with the dosing instructions for study drug
