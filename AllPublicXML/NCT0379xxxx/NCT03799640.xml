  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Older individuals, 60-90, will be provided regular or cognitively based yoga training. They
      will then be evaluated using standard cognitive testing devices.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Reductions in executive function are common with age. Along with these declines come
      reductions in simple functional patterns of daily living such as crossing a street, walking
      in a crowded area, or performing any functions that occurs in an open (changing) environment.
      This study will use a newly developed yoga program incorporating multi-directional movements,
      cognitive challenges and visuomotor disturbances to improve executive function and associated
      movements in persons over 60 years of age.

    <measure>NIH Toolbox: Picture Sequence Memory Test</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Measures episodic memory. Participants are asked to reproduce a sequence of pictures that is shown on the screen.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>NIH Toolbox Flanker test</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Measures attention and inhibitory control. Participant focuses on a given stimulus while inhibiting attention to stimuli flanking it.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>NIH Toolbox List Sorting test</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Measures working memory. Participant recalls and sequences different visually and orally presented stimuli.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>NIH Toolbox Pattern Comparison Processing Speed test</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Measures speed of processing. Participants discern whether two side-by-side pictures are the same or not, with 85 seconds to respond to as many items as possible. Items are simple so as to purely measure processing speed.</description>

    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Walking and responding to visual cues presented on a 60 inch monitor.</description>
