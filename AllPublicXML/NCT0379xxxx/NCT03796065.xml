  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will employ a cross-cultural Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR)
      approach to build from prior needs assessments and mixed-methods research to evaluate the
      effectiveness of the Family Strengthening Intervention for Refugees (FSI-R), a preventative
      family home-based visiting intervention intended to mitigate mental health disparities among
      refugee children and families using a hybrid implementation-effectiveness design. Results of
      the investigator's trial will expand the evidence-base on community-based interventions for
      refugees and has the potential to be replicated to reduce mental health disparities affecting
      diverse groups of refugee children and families.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Using a CBPR approach, a family based prevention model, the Family Strengthening Intervention
      for Refugees (FSI-R) was adapted from a tested model used in Africa and designed for delivery
      by refugee community health workers with through a process involving stakeholder consultation
      and local refugee Community Advisory Board input. Pilot data on the FSI-R demonstrates strong
      feasibility and acceptability, but further data are needed on effectiveness as well as
      barriers and facilitators to implementation by community health workers embedded in
      refugee-serving social services agencies. Specific aims are to (1) examine the impact of a
      family-based preventive intervention on outcomes of parent-child relationships, family
      functioning, and child mental health using a Hybrid Type 2 Effectiveness-Implementation
      Design (families with children aged 7-17 in a two-arm randomized controlled trial); (2)
      identify barriers and facilitators to implementation of the FSI-R by community health workers
      by conducting a process evaluation concurrent with the delivery of the intervention; and (3)
      strengthen the science of community engagement to address health disparities by fortifying
      CBPR-based pathways of change via collaborative partnerships between refugee communities,
      service providers, and academic stakeholders.

    <measure>Change in conflict via the Family Conflict Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>T1 (Baseline), T2 (approximately 24-months post-baseline), T3 (6-months follow-up from T2)</time_frame>
    <description>The Family Conflict Scale utilizes a 7-point Likert Scale (0-6) to assess family conflict within the past month. Higher scores reflect greater family conflict.</description>

    <time_frame>T1 (Baseline), T2 (approximately 24-months post-baseline), T3 (6-months follow-up from T2)</time_frame>
    <description>Utilizes a 5-point Likert scale (1-5) to assess parent-child communication. Greater scores indicate higher communication between parents and their children.</description>

    <time_frame>T1 (Baseline), T2 (approximately 24-months post-baseline), T3 (6-months follow-up from T2)</time_frame>
    <description>Utilizes a 5-point Likert scale (1-5) to assess intergenerational congruence across several domains of the parent-child relationship. Higher scores denote greater intergenerational congruence.</description>

    <measure>Change in parenting via the Alabama Parenting Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>T1 (Baseline), T2 (approximately 24-months post-baseline), T3 (6-months follow-up from T2)</time_frame>
    <description>Likert scale (1-5) that includes 5 sub-domains. Each sub-domain results in a summed score that relates to 5 domains of parenting: involvement, positive parenting, poor monitoring/supervision, inconsistent discipline, and corporal punishment.</description>

  <intervention>
    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>FSI-R Treatment</intervention_name>
    <description>The FSI-R involves a series of separate and joint meetings with parents and children to discuss challenges the family has faced and the strengths that helped them make it through past challenging times. Additional psychoeducation on mental health and promoting resilience along with coaching to enhance parenting skills is provided throughout and may be tailored to family needs. The FSI-R provides a shared space for refugee families both to recognize their strengths and to problem-solve in a more collective way on family challenges and shared hopes for the future. The FSI-R is delivered in the home, by a trained interventionist, over the course of 10-modules.</description>
