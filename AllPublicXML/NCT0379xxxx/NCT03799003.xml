    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the tolerability and safety profile of
      ASP1951 when administered as a single agent and in combination with pembrolizumab in
      participants with locally advanced (unresectable) or metastatic solid tumors; characterize
      the pharmacokinetic profile of ASP1951 when administered as a single agent and in combination
      with pembrolizumab; and determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of ASP1951 and/or
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) when administered as a single agent and in combination with
      pembrolizumab. This study will also evaluate the anti-tumor effect of ASP1951 when
      administered as a single agent and in combination with pembrolizumab.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a dose-escalation and expansion study of ASP1951. The study consists of 3 periods for
      monotherapy and combination therapy: screening, treatment and follow up, followed by an
      optional Re-treatment period for participants that qualify.

      The monotherapy escalation cohorts will evaluate escalating dose levels of ASP1951 in
      participants with locally advanced (unresectable) or metastatic solid tumor malignancies
      including but not limited to squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), colorectal
      cancer, metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) and cervical cancer.

      The combination escalation cohorts will evaluate escalating dose levels of ASP1951 in
      combination with a fixed dose of pembrolizumab.

      For dose expansion, the tumor-specific cohorts will include participants with squamous cell
      carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC),
      colorectal and cervical cancer, as well as participants with any tumor types that respond to
      study drug treatment during dose escalation.

      Participants may reinitiate study drug treatment in the optional Re-treatment period after
      confirmation that the participant meets all the re-treatment eligibility criteria.

      After discontinuation of study drug, all participants will complete an end-of-treatment
      visit, along with 30-day and 90 day safety follow-up visits from the last dose of study drug.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Safety and tolerability assessed by Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 years</time_frame>
    <description>A DLT is defined as any of the prespecified Adverse Events (AEs) (graded using National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [NCI-CTCAE] version 4.03) that the investigator (or sponsor) cannot clearly attribute to a cause other than study drug.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Safety and tolerability assessed by adverse events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 years</time_frame>
    <description>Initial and retreatment. An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a study drug, and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. AEs will be coded using the medical dictionary for regulatory activities (MedDRA) and graded using NCI-CTCAE 4.03.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Safety and tolerability assessed by immune-related AEs (irAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 years</time_frame>
    <description>Initial and retreatment. Most frequent immune-related AEs include rash, oral mucositis, dry mouth, colitis/diarrhea, hepatitis, pneumonitis, and endocrinopathies (hypophysitis, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, adrenal insufficiency and Type 1 diabetes mellitus). In the event a participant is diagnosed with an irAE, then it should be reported as an AE.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Safety and tolerability assessed by infusion-related reactions (IRRs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 years</time_frame>
    <description>Initial and retreatment. IRRs are considered AEs of special interest. In the event a participant is diagnosed with an IRR, then it should be reported as an AE.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Safety and tolerability assessed by serious adverse events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 years</time_frame>
    <description>Initial and retreatment. An AE is considered &quot;serious&quot; if it results in any of the following outcomes: results in death; is life-threatening; results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions; results in congenital anomaly or birth defect; requires inpatient hospitalization (except for planned procedures as allowed per study) or leads to prolongation of hospitalization (except if prolongation of planned hospitalization is not caused by an AE). Hospitalization for treatment/observation/examination caused by AE is to be considered as serious; and other medically important events.</description>
