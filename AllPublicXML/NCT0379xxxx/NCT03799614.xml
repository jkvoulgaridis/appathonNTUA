  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to test the safety, tolerability and efficacy of
      vibration (delivered by an experimental device called RMBand that is worn on the subject's
      arm) on parkinsonian tremor. The RMBand was developed by Resonate Forward, LLC (RF). This
      RMBand is designed to administer a vibration to the wearer to decrease or stop tremor in
      persons with Parkinson's disease (PD).

      Participation will be completed in one visit at VCU Parkinson's and Movement Disorders
      Center. A baseline Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale
      (MDS-UPDRS) will be taken prior to vibration therapy. The RMBand (experimental device) will
      be placed on the arm of the participant to provide the vibration therapy. The MDS-UPDRS Part
      III will be repeated both during and after the therapy. Participants will be asked to provide
      feedback about the device, the therapy session and how they are feeling.

    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 2 hours.</time_frame>
    <description>The &quot;Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale&quot; (MDS-UPDRS), parts II-IV will be used to assess the total burden of motor Parkinson Disease (PD) symptoms and impact on activities of daily living. All parts use scale of 0 (no problem) - 4 (severe problems) lower scores are better. Part II: 13 items about Activities of Daily Living, score range 0-52. Part III: 18 items PD motor signs, score range is 0-72, Part IV: 6 items, assesses dyskinesia (excessive motion) and motor fluctuations (medication is working or not), range is 0-24. Parts II-IV total scores will be summed and used to describe the participants, total score range 0-148. Part III, only, will be repeated during vibration and post vibration data collection times and will take 5 minutes to complete. This outcome measure will be used to report a change in PD motor symptoms from baseline, to vibration on, and to after vibration treatment is turned off.</description>

    <measure>Clinical Rating for Tremor</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 2 hours.</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical Rating for Tremor scale assesses total severity of tremor symptoms. This scale takes 10-minutes, will be used at baseline, during, and post vibration therapy to report changes in tremor. Items are rated on a scale of 0=normal to 4=severely abnormal, total summative score range for all 3 parts is 0 - 144 points. Lower scores are better. Part A, 21 items, quantifies tremor (at rest, holding a posture, action maneuvers) for 9 body parts, score range 0-84. Part B, 5 items, relates to action tremors of the arms, score range 0 - 36. Part C, 8 items, quantifies participants view if their tremors have improved since the previous assessment. The score is based on 8 items, responses range from +3 = Marked improvement to -3 = Marked worsening. This scale includes the choice of 0 = unchanged. Score range is -24 to 24. Higher scores are better. Total time to complete the Scale for Tremor assessment is 10 minutes.</description>

    <measure>Tremor frequency</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 2 hours.</time_frame>
    <description>A watch like device (worn on the arms) will describe tremors of both the left and right arms. The device will calculate the average frequency of the tremor. The device will measure tremor 5 minutes prior to treatment, during treatment and 5 minutes post treatment.
This outcome measure is going to report a change in tremor frequency from baseline to vibration treatment on, and then compare to after vibration treatment is completed.</description>

    <description>A watch like device (worn on the arms) will describe tremors of both the left and right arms. The device will calculate the average the amplitude of the tremor. The device will measure 5 minutes prior to treatment, during treatment and 5 minutes post treatment.
