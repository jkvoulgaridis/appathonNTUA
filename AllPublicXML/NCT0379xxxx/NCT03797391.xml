      First-in-human, Phase I/II, Multicenter, Open-Label Study of EMB-01 in Patients with
      Advanced/Metastatic Solid Tumors

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human (FIH), open-label, Phase I/II study of EMB-01, a bispecific
      Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and c-Mesenchymal-Epithelial Transition (cMet)
      antibody, in patients with advanced solid tumors who have progressed on available standard
      therapies or for which no standard therapy exists. The study consists of two parts: Phase I
      (dose escalation) and Phase II (cohort expansion). The study is planning to recruit
      tentatively 33-66 subjects with advanced/metastatic solid tumors in phase I and about 40
      patients with EGFR mutant Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) in Phase II. Both parts consist
      of screening period (-28 to -1 days), treatment cycles (each cycle is 28 days), and follow-up
      period (30 days safety follow up and disease progression follow up).
