  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators aimed to demonstrate the efficacy of ESWT (extracorporeal
      shock wave therapy) and local corticosteroid injection in patients with carpal tunnel
      syndrome(CTS) compared to participants receiving only splint and exercise therapy. And the
      investigators wanted to show that ESWT, a noninvasive treatment modality, is as effective and
      reliable as local corticosteroid injection, which is the least invasive treatment. Mild and
      moderate CTS patients will be determined according to American Association of
      Electrodiagnostic Medicine (AAEM) criteria. 90 idiopathic moderate and mild CTS patients will
      be included in the study. The participants will be informed about their participation in a
      study and written informed consent will be obtained.The demographic characteristics and
      disease duration of the participants will be recorded.The participants will be randomly
      divided into 3 groups.40 mg of local methylprednisolone (depomedrol) injection will be
      applied to Group 1 once.

      And group 1 will also be given a hand wrist rest splint to use for 3 months, especially at
      night, when not using the hand. ESWT will be applied to Group 2 once a week for a total of 3
      weeks and hand wrist rest splints will be given for 3 months especially at night when it is
      not in use. Group 3 (control group) will be given a hand wrist rest splint to use for 3
      months, especially at night, when not using the hand. The evaluations will be repeated before
      treatment, after the first week after treatment (first ESWT application) and at the 3rd
      month. Hand grip strength measurement will be performed using Boston carpal tunnel syndrome
      questionnaire, visual analog scale and dynamometer.

      Electromyogram (EMG) data will be recorded before and 3 months after treatment. During the
      trial, the routine will not be excluded.

    <measure>Visual Analog Scale (VAS) - Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>3. months after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>VAS is used to digitize some values that cannot be measured numerically.Two ends of the parameter to be evaluated are written on both ends of a 100 mm line.The participant is asked to mark the point indicating his/her status on this line.The patient marks his current state on this line.The length of the distance from where the pain is no longer to the point marked by the patient indicates the pain of the patient.The values obtained before and after treatment will be compared.The starting point of the graph is zero and the end point is 10.The distance of the point marked by the participant is measured in millimeters.And divided into 10.This value gives the participant's pain score.For example, if the point marked by the participant is 50 mm, it will get 50/10 = 5 points.Increasing the score of the participant means that the complaint is too high and the result is bad. The scale has no subscales and total score.</description>

    <description>Hand grip strength measurement using Jamar hydraulic hand dynamometer. Hand grip strength measurements will be performed using the elbow at 90 degrees of flexion, while the forearm and wrist is in neutral position using resistance at level 2.

    <measure>boston scale</measure>
    <time_frame>3. months after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Boston symptom severity score(SSS) and improvement in functional status score(FSS). There are 11 questions at SSS. Responses vary from 'none(1 point)' to 'very severe(5 points)'. There are 8 questions in FSS. Responses vary from 'very easy (1 point)' to 'very difficult (5 points) according to difficulty level. In both scales, the degree of symptom severity and dysfunction increases as the total score increases.The score of the patient is divided by the total score (total score is 11x5 = 55 for the SSS and the total score is 8x5 = 40 for FSS) and 0 to 1 for each patient. As this ratio reaches 1, the degree of symptom severity and dysfunction of the patient increases. For example; Considering that the total score obtained from all the questions in the SPS is 22, the ratio of 22/55 = 0. 4 is obtained.These scales will be applied after treatment and the rates obtained before and after treatment will be compared.</description>
