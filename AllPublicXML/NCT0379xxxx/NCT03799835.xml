    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomized, multicentric study in patients with high-risk non-muscle
      invasive bladder cancer who had never received BCG for this disease.

      The objective is to evaluate the efficacy of atezolizumab as measured by recurrence-free
      survival.
