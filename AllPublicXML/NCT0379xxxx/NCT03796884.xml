  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the how well linaclotide works in treating patients with stages
      0-3 colorectal cancer. Linaclotide is a very small protein that binds to receptors on
      intestinal cells and makes them secrete water and salt.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether, compared to placebo, linaclotide administered as a single oral daily
      dose x 7 days, induces a pharmacodynamics (PD) effect on cGMP levels, based on biopsy samples
      of adenomas or resected colorectal adenocarcinomas.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare Ki-67, guanylin levels and GUCY2C expression in adenomas and cancers versus
      normal tissue.

      II. To confirm the safety and tolerability of linaclotide in sporadic adenoma and cancer
      patients.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  History of 1 or more sporadic colorectal adenoma on previous endoscopy (adenoma
             cohort) or stage 0-3 biopsy proven colorectal cancer (CRC) (colorectal cancer cohort)
             who are scheduled for a surgical procedure

          -  Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent document and
             follow study procedures

          -  Ability to swallow capsules without difficulty

          -  Ability to maintain pill diaries

          -  Willingness to employ adequate contraception for men and women of childbearing
             potential for the duration of the study. Acceptable methods include double barrier
             methods, intrauterine device (IUD), postmenopausal status, and/or documentation of
             surgical sterilization

          -  Participants must have no chronic, clinically severe health issues which, in the
             opinion of their physician or the research team, could preclude trial activities
             including the one week drug exposure phase

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of gastroparesis

          -  History of celiac disease

             of the investigator

          -  Participants may not be receiving any other investigational agents, or be active
             participants in any clinical trials. If participants previously participated in a
             clinical trial, a 30 day washout period for the investigational drug is needed before
             the participant can be considered for this study

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to linaclotide

          -  Uncontrolled current illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Pregnant or lactating women

          -  History of bleeding/coagulation problems. Concurrent use of nonsteroidal
             anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) including aspirin is acceptable

          -  Any medical condition judged by the investigator to constitute a risk to safe
             participation

          -  At risk for obstructing or near-obstructing mechanical gastrointestinal obstruction

          -  Chronic use of anti-coagulants or non-NSAID anti-platelet agents will serve as an
             exclusion only when such medications cannot be safely discontinued before study
             related endoscopy or surgery
