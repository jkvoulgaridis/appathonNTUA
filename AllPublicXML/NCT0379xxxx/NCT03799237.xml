  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During dengue outbreaks, the Ministry of Health Malaysia employs various methods to control
      the spread of disease, including killing the larvae of Aedes mosquitoes, fogging, together
      with educating and disseminating information about the dengue outbreak, to the community.
      However, this is too late. Research has shown that when an outbreak has occurred, the viral
      infection has already spread among the community. Therefore, this current trial aims to
      educate the public (via questionnaire survey and interactions with the residential
      managements, mainly), detect dengue-infected mosquitoes, inform the communities of the
      presence of dengue-infected mosquitoes, followed by approaching and educating them to take
      precautionary measures before the outbreak happens. Trapping (using gravid oviposition sticky
      (GOS) traps) and detecting dengue virus non-structural 1 (NS1) antigen (using dengue NS1 kit)
      in the Aedes mosquitoes will be a more reliable way to alert the community before a potential
      dengue outbreak in their housing area. The community will receive information of presence of
      infected mosquitoes and probable dengue infections before dengue cases are reported. This
      will be an ideal time for clean-ups and for search and destroy activities. With this shift in
      approach and the use of newer techniques, it is hoped that deaths and epidemics due to dengue
      will be reduced.

      This cluster randomised controlled trial will be conducted to provide evidence on the
      efficacy of an integrated active vector surveillance and preventive strategy in the
      community. It aims to demonstrate effectiveness of a new proactive paradigm in reducing
      dengue epidemics. The main hypotheses are 1) This new paradigm (GOS trap and dengue NS1 kit
      for detection of dengue in Aedes) will reduce dengue epidemics compared to the usual current
      vector surveillance/control carried out by the Ministry of Health. 2) Community will be more
      receptive to this new surveillance activity as they will receive information of dengue
      transmissions before dengue cases are reported.

      The study sites at PJU10, Damansara Damai, Petaling Jaya, Selangor, Malaysia are

        1. Intervention arm: Harmoni Apartment, Impian Apartment, Park Avenue Condominium, and
           Suria Shop Apartment

        2. Control arm: Permai Apartment, Lestari Apartment, Indah Apartment, and Vista Shop
           Apartment

      Activities to be carried out include:

      A. Questionnaire survey and blood taking for dengue seroprevalence among residents from both
      arms When people in the community are gathered at an identified, suitable area, the
      Knowledge, Attitude and Practice (KAP) questionnaires will be distributed for them to answer.
      After the questionnaire survey, about 3 ml of venous blood would be taken by trained
      personnel for dengue IgG and IgM serology.

      B. Placement of the GOS mosquito trap in the intervention arm The GOS mosquito traps will be
      placed in the intervention arm and serviced weekly. The trapped Aedes mosquitoes would be
      checked for dengue virus via dengue NS1 rapid diagnostic test kit.

      The GOS mosquito traps will also be placed randomly in the control arm once per month for
      entomological survey.

      C. If a dengue-positive mosquito is found, flyers and banners will be distributed and hung to
      inform the residents of the presence of dengue transmission in the apartment block/apartment.
      Alternatively, the residents may also be approached house-to-house or an educational booth
      set up at strategic locations in the apartment to warn and educate the residents.

      D. The KAP questionnaire survey will be carried out again 3 months before the completion of
      the trial in the intervention arm to gauge the communities' perception of this intervention.

    <description>The GOS trap lure and sticky surfaces to trap gravid Aedes mosquitoes. Three GOS traps will be placed on every 3 floors of the residential blocks. The traps will be changed weekly. Trapped Aedes mosquitoes will be identified to species. The mosquitoes will then be dissected, to remove the abdomen from the thorax. Five to seven abdomens of the same mosquito species will be pooled and tested for dengue NS1 antigen using the SD Biosensor Standard Q dengue NS1 antigen test kit. If the pool is tested positive for dengue NS1, the head and thorax of the respective abdomens will be subjected to the same procedure for dengue NS1 antigen test, individually. This may allow us to identify a focus where there could be dengue-infected individuals. Flyers/Posters will be disseminated besides, house-to-house approach to inform the residents of the findings and apartment blocks where these mosquitoes were found. The apartment management will also make use of social media disseminate this information.</description>
