  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PK of Caspofungin in ICU septic patients might be changed as compared to healthy volunteers
      due to sepsis-related pathophysiology.

      Sub-optimal plasma and tissue concentrations might be achieved in these patients when drugs
      are administered at the same dosage/regimen suggested for healthy volunteers.

    <textblock>
      Open non randomized, non controlled single center study on the pharmacokinetics of
      caspofungin in 20 consecutive ICU patients with severe sepsis or septic shock, requiring
      caspofungin therapy and PK-PD evaluation for the optimization of caspofungin therapy. The aim
      of this study is to describe the Caspofungin PK-PD alterations in a cohort of critically ill
      septic patients.

    <description>In accordance with routine clinical practice, Caspofungin will be given at the loading dose of 70 mg followed by 50 mg daily (for people &lt; 80 kg body weight). No dose reduction will be performed in Child-Pugh score A or B. Duration of therapy will be performed in accordance with ESCMID guidelines and clinical conditions.</description>

      Serum and urine samples. To perform the PK study, blood samples (of approximately 2 ml each)
      will be obtained at different time points following the first administration. These samples
      will occur at the same time of routine blood gas analysis (hourly obtained in the ICU) and no
      further extra-routine blood samples will be required for this study. In particular, the blood
      that normally remains in the syringe of blood gas analysis, and usually thrown as waste
      fluid, will be saved and used for PK analysis. Thus, no increase in blood sampling from the
      patient will be obtained, both in terms of frequency of sampling or volume of blood.
