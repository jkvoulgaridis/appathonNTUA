    <textblock>
      This study design is a randomized, double-blind, intra-individual controlled, single-center,
      phase 1 healthy volunteer study. Subjects who voluntarily signed the informed consent and are
      judged to be eligible for this study will be intramuscularly injected with the study drug or
      the comparator at a randomized unit(2U, 5U, 10U, 20U, 30U) in each site of the Extensor
      digirotum brevis. Thereafter, follow-up visits will be made 14 days, 30days, 60days, 90days
      and pharmacodynamic and safety assessments will be conducted for total 90days.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised, double-blind, intra-individual controlled, dose escalation study to
      assess the safety, tolerability and preliminary effectiveness of a single dose of MT10107 in
      comparison to Botox®50U (BOTOX® is a registered trademark owned by Allergan). This is the
      first-in-human study for MT10107, and will be performed in healthy volunteers.

      Subjects will be administered a single equivalent dose of MT10107 and Botox®50U by
      intramuscular injection to the EDB muscles of contralateral feet. Five cohorts of eligible
      subjects will be studied; Group A (2 U dose), Group B (5 U dose), Group C (10 U dose), Group
      D (20 U dose) and Group E (30 U dose).

      The foot in which each drug is to be administered (i.e. left or right) will be assigned in a
      randomized manner.
