  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research is to study an intervention, which the investigators call
      &quot;Supportive Oncology Care at Home,&quot; that entails both remote patient monitoring (e.g.
      patient-reported symptoms, home monitored vital signs, and body weight) and a Medically Home
      care model (e.g. triggers for phone calls and visits to patients' homes to address and manage
      any concerning issues identified). Specifically, the investigators will conduct a single arm
      pilot study (N=20) in patients with pancreatic cancer who sign consent for parent trial of
      neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX (18-179) receiving preoperative FOLFIRINOX to assess the feasibility
      and acceptability of Supportive Oncology Care at Home.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preoperative treatment can cause significant morbidity and often result in hospitalizations.
      Patients receiving preoperative FOLFIRINOX often experience numerous side effects, including
      nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, fever, neuropathy, and loss of appetite. Frequently,
      patients require hospital admissions to help address uncontrolled symptoms related to their
      cancer and side effects related to the treatment,

      Interventions targeting patients' symptoms and delivering care to patients at their homes
      have the potential to improve patient outcomes. Studies show that interventions targeting
      patients' symptoms can improve symptom management, enhance quality of life (QOL), and prevent
      hospitalizations.

      Medically Home interventions have shown the potential to enhance patient outcomes. The
      Medically Home model of care is an alternative to a hospital admission for acute care and
      treatment of a clinical condition. Medically Home interventions entail providing medical care
      to acutely ill patients in their home. In addition, research in the general medicine
      literature has demonstrated that interventions involving remote patient monitoring with
      'triggers' for visits to patients' homes for worrisome symptoms can enhance care outcomes.

      Although this research demonstrates promising results, these studies have not been conducted
      among patients with cancer. Notably, the prior work involving home monitoring with visits as
      needed has lacked patient-reported outcomes, such as symptom monitoring. Thus, efforts are
      needed to develop and test interventions containing both symptom monitoring and the potential
      for home visits when necessary in a population of patients with cancer.
