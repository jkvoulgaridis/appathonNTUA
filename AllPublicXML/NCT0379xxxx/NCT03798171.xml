  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In peritoneal dialysis patients, the presence of the catheter presents a risk of infection -
      exit site infection, tunnel infection or peritonitis. In our dialysis unit, we noticed a rise
      in exit-site infection associated with organisms derived from contaminated water. Therefore
      we decided to change the exit-site care in our unit.

      This is a prospective observational single center study, that compares exit-site infection
      rated in peritoneal dialysis patients before and after our policy change for exit-site care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peritoneal dialysis is a method for renal replacement therapy that uses the peritoneal
      membrane for exchange of fluids and dissolved substance . A catheter is surgically inserted
      with one end in the abdomen and the other protruding from the skin, in order to allow fluid
      exchange.

      The presence of the catheter presents a risk of infection - exit site infection, tunnel
      infection or peritonitis - a cause of morbidity and treatment failure.

      Infection prevention is based, among other measures, on aseptic handeling of catheter
      exit-site. In our dialysis unit, we noticed a rise in pseudomonas exit-site infection and
      other organisms associated with contaminated water. Therefore we decided to change the
      exit-site care in our unit. Similar to central catheters handeling, we decided to cover the
      catheter exit-site during water exposure, and to change the prophylactic exit-site antibiotic
      regimen.

      This is a prospective observational single center study. All peritoneal dialysis patients in
      our institue will be counseled about change in exit-site care. For prevention of water
      exposure the patients will use stoma bags around the catheter during showers. After the
      shower, the exit-site is cleaned with a chlorhexidine based solution, an antibiotic cream is
      applied (Mupirocin) and dressed with a clean gauze.

      The patients will be followed for 3 years for adverse events. The number of infectious
      episodes will be recorded and compared to historical data (January 2015-December 2017).
