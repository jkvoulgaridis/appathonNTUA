  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) is a constellation of pain symptoms which are
      associated with impairment in mood, social and physical function. Spinal Cord Stimulation
      (SCS), a technique of placing electrodes into the epidural space is a validated treatment for
      Complex Regional Pain Syndrome . Treatment of CRPS with SCS, in combination with physical
      therapy, reduced pain to a greater degree than physical therapy alone. 40%-50% of CRPS
      patients achieve &gt;50% pain relief with SCS using dorsal column stimulation . Dorsal Root
      Ganglion (DRG) SCS has also recently demonstrated clinical efficacy in patients with CRPS and
      peripheral causalgia . The hypothesis is that DRG stimulation is non-inferior to dorsal
      column SCS in patients with CRPS who have failed to respond to a course of analgesics and
      physical therapy. The aim to assess functional, quality of life, patient satisfaction and
      medication requirements in subjects treated with neuromodulation for CRPS and contrast
      outcomes amongst subjects treated with DRG SCS and dorsal column SCS.

      The purpose of this study is to compare outcomes between dorsal column spinal cord
      stimulation and dorsal root ganglion spinal cord stimulation in patients with Complex
      Regional Pain Syndrome at an infraumbilical location who have failed a course of conservative
      management including analgesic pharmacotherapy and physical therapy.

      This is a prospective randomized post-marketing clinical study. Patients will be randomized
      in a 1:1 ratio to Dorsal Column or Dorsal Root Ganglion Spinal Cord Stimulation if they have
      failed a course of conservative management including analgesics and physical therapy. All
      patients are expected to undergo clinical, neurological, and imaging assessments, if
      appropriate, at selected follow-up visits.

      The study will be conducted a single center with a target maximum of 62 patients (31
      randomized to each group).

      Enrollment of subjects in this study is anticipated to take 24 months. Clinical follow-up
      evaluations will be conducted at 10 days, 1, 3 and 6 months post-implant. The total study
      duration is expected to be at least 30 months.

      All patients presenting to the Investigators with Budapest criteria, research subset , for
      the diagnosis of Complex Regional Pain Syndrome at an infraumbilical location who have not
      had an adequate response to a course of conservative management including analgesics and
      physical therapy will be screened for eligibility. A Screening/Enrollment Log will be
      utilized in order to maintain a cumulative tracking of all screened patients.

      Patients must meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria for enrollment in the clinical study.
      Reasons for screening failure(s) will be documented.

    <description>To compare the outcomes of dorsal column stimulation with Dorsal Root Ganglion stimulation in patients with Complex Regional Pain Syndrome that persist despite a course of conservative management including physical therapy and analgesic pharmacotherapy using an 11-point [0-10] Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) for Pain Intensity at 6 months. A score of zero indicates no pain, and 10 indicates the worst possible pain imaginable.</description>

    <description>To compare the outcomes of dorsal column stimulation with Dorsal Root Ganglion stimulation in patients with Complex Regional Pain Syndrome that persist despite a course of conservative management including physical therapy and analgesic pharmacotherapy in function based on Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) for functional impairment. A score of 0 on the 101-point [0-100] Oswestry Disability Index indicates no disability while 100 indicates bed-bound.</description>

    <time_frame>6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in Quality of Life as measured by the European Quality of Life 5 Dimension (EQ-5D) Scale. The EQ-5D-5L is composed of - the EQ-5D-5L descriptive system and the EQ Visual Analogue scale (EQ VAS). The descriptive system comprises 5 dimensions (mobility, self care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression). Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems. Each level corresponds to 1-digit number expressing the level selected for that dimension.</description>

    <measure>Pain Medication Usage</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The opioid morphine equivalent conversion factor is used to standardized opioid usage having as a reference morphine as the main indicator for analgesic potency. Oral morphine equivalents are based on the idea that different doses of different opioids may give a similar analgesic effect. Where the doses of two different opioids are considered to give a comparable analgesic effect, they are deemed to be equianalgesic doses.</description>

    <measure>Satisfaction With the Pain Relief</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>There will be 3 separate questions on the form. Subjects will be asked to rate their satisfaction with the pain relief, satisfaction with the therapy in general and their likelihood undergoing the therapy again for a similar outcome as a percentage from 0-100% with 0% indicating no satisfaction/likelihood and 100% indicating completely satisfied and 100% likelihood of undergoing the therapy again for a similar outcome.</description>

        <description>Change in Quality of Life as measured by the European Quality of Life 5 Dimension (EQ-5D) Scale. The EQ-5D-5L is composed of - the EQ-5D-5L descriptive system and the EQ Visual Analogue scale (EQ VAS). The descriptive system comprises 5 dimensions (mobility, self care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression). Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems. Each level corresponds to 1-digit number expressing the level selected for that dimension.</description>

        <title>Pain Medication Usage</title>
        <description>The opioid morphine equivalent conversion factor is used to standardized opioid usage having as a reference morphine as the main indicator for analgesic potency. Oral morphine equivalents are based on the idea that different doses of different opioids may give a similar analgesic effect. Where the doses of two different opioids are considered to give a comparable analgesic effect, they are deemed to be equianalgesic doses.</description>
