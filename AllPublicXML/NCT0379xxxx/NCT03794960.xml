  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial
      in subjects with established T1D.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will include 216 male or female subjects aged 12 to 35 years diagnosed with T1D, as
      defined by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria and meeting enrollment criteria
      as follows. Initial enrollment will be restricted to subjects aged 18-35 until an analysis of
      data from subjects with 3 months' exposure to drug confirms safety. Upon completion of this
      assessment, enrollment will be open without further restrictions for subjects aged 12-35.

         16. Positive urine pregnancy test: Females of childbearing potential must be excluded if
             they have a positive urine pregnancy test at screening or randomization or if they are
             not using medically acceptable methods of birth control. Acceptable methods of birth
             control include oral or transdermal contraceptives, condom, spermicidal foam, IUD,
             progestin implant or injection, abstinence, vaginal ring, or sterilization of partner.
             The reason for non-childbearing potential, such as bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral
             oophorectomy, hysterectomy, or 1 year or more postmenopausal must be specified in the
             subject's Case Report Form (CRF).

         18. Any social condition or medical condition that would, in the opinion of the PI,
             prevent complete participation in the study or would pose a significant hazard to the
             subject's participation.

         19. Anticipated major surgery during the duration of the trial, which could interfere with
             participation in the trial.

         20. History of drug or alcohol dependence within 12 months of screening.

         21. Psychiatric disorder that would prevent subjects from giving informed consent.

         22. Participation in other studies involving the administration of an investigational drug
             or device, including the administration of an experimental agent for T1D, at any time,
             or use of an experimental device for T1D within 30 days prior to screening, unless
             approved by the Medical Monitor.
