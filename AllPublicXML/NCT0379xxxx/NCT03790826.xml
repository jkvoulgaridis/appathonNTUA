  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine whether an indwelling low profile Kohli Atraumatic Catheter causes less
      macro-morphologic inflammation and edema to the bladder mucosa than a traditional indwelling
      Foley catheter as assess by computerized image analysis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Kohli Atraumatic Catheter similarly aims to reduce bladder mucosal trauma with its low
      profile pancake shaped balloon versus the ovoid balloon of a traditional Foley catheter. The
      Kohli Atraumatic Catheter has a short, opened-ended tip that minimally protrudes through a
      patented low-profile donut-shaped balloon. The combination of the low profile and reduced tip
      length prevents the catheter from contacting the bladder walls and thereby minimize
      disruption of the bladder surface mucus layer and trauma to the urothelium - theoretically
      reducing the chance of bacterial invasion. A trial in which sheep were randomized to a
      traditional indwelling Foley catheter or a prototype Kohli Atraumatic Catheter demonstrated a
      dramatic reduction in both bladder wall trauma and edema. The ulcerated area dropped from
      7.2% to 1.8% (75%) and the edema from 26.9% to 13.0% (52%).

      Statistical Analysis To compare the effects of 2 catheter types, data will be analyzed using
      the general linear models tools from SAS/STAT software and presented as means Â± standard
      error of the mean. The model will include 2 catheter types, inflamed vs non-inflamed areas,
      and their interactions.

Image Analysis Technique Image of each bladder will be analyzed using FLIR Research IR Software (FLIR Systems Inc., Wilsonville, OR) to determine the proportion of inflamed areas characterized by red surface including hemorrhage and ulceration, and edema (eg, swollen smooth surface) out of total bladder area.</description>

    <description>Visual macro-morphologic inflammation and edema assessment of bladder mucosa by experienced urologists familiar with the assessment of bladder diseases. Images and videos from a first visit where the traditional Foley catheter has been in place will be compared to those from a subsequent cystoscopy. Urologists will be blinded as to the catheter associated with each block of images captured during the cystoscopy.</description>

    <measure>Patient discomfort via Numeric Pain Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>A numeric pain rating scale chart will be completed by each patient for comparison of patient discomfort with a traditional indwelling Foley catheter in patients with chronic indwelling Foley catheters. The scale runs from 0 &quot;No Pain&quot; to 5 &quot;Moderate Pain&quot; and 10 &quot;Worst Possible Pain.&quot; More information on the scale can be seen here &quot;https://www.physio-pedia.com/Numeric_Pain_Rating_Scale&quot; There are no Subscales and the marked score for first assessment will be compared to 2nd assessment to assess any changes in patient comfort with the two different catheters.</description>
