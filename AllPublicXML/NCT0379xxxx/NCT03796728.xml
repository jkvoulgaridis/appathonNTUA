    <intervention_model_description>All subjects will sign an informed consent form, and begin at the Screening Visit (V0). Filler treatment (Juvéderm® VOLIFT™ with Lidocaine) will be performed at V2 (Initial Treatment visit) and data will be collected at this visit for all relevant parameters as per the Schedule of Study Procedures, Treatments and Assessments (Table 1.1). Fourteen days after the initial treatment, subjects will return to the clinic and the Investigator will assess whether a Touch up treatment is to be performed at this visit (V3). Follow up visits will occur at V4 and V5 at 1, 3, and 6 months after the last treatment</intervention_model_description>
