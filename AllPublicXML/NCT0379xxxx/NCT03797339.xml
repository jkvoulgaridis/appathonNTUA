  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to explore underlying mechanisms of individual differences in drugs for
      coronary heart disease treatment and its association with adverse consequences. It will
      enroll approximately 4000 coronal heart disease patients aged between 18 and 80 years in
      mainland China and follow-up for at least 1 years. Questionnaires, anthropometric measures,
      laboratory tests, and biomaterials will be collected . The principal clinical outcomes of the
      study consist of ischemia attack , cardiac death, renal injury,and myotoxic activity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a multicenter prospective cohort study, aimed to explore underlying mechanisms
      of individual differences in drugs for coronary heart disease treatment and its association
      with adverse consequences.The genomic genotype, DNA methylation and metabolome of 1000
      patients with coronary heart disease were determined using illumina high-density genotyping
      chip, high-throughput sequencing and high-resolution mass spectrometry. Blood exposures of
      statins and metoprolol and its metabolites was determined by UPLC-MS/MS.

      The biological network using cross-omics analysis was reconstructed to identify potential
      causative key genes, bacteria, and endogenous metabolite targets that cause differences in
      individual responses. A machine identification algorithm selecting clinical factors and
      multi-omics targets was used to establish a predictive mathematical model.

      A multi-center clinical cohort of 3000 coronal heart disease patients was used to verify the
      effects of various levels of omic targets on drug blood exposures, efficacy and toxic side
      effects. A comprehensive model based on multi-target combination of individualized drugs was
      constructed, and the predictive effect was clinically analyzed.

    <measure>MACE</measure>
    <time_frame>from date of baseline examination until the date of first documented cardiovascular events,up to 48 months</time_frame>

    <measure>Bleeding</measure>
    <time_frame>from date of baseline examination until the date of first documented bleeding,up to 48 months</time_frame>
    <description>Bleeding was the six-month incidence of combined alarming, internal, and nuisance bleeding events defined according to Serebruany et al15. Alarming bleeding included bleeding requiring a transfusion, intracranial bleeding, and life-threatening bleeding. Internal bleeding included haematoma, epistaxis, blood loss from the mouth, vagina, melaena, eye bleed, haematuria, and haematemesis. Nuisance bleeding included easy bruising, bleeding from small cuts, petechiae, and ecchymosis.</description>

    <measure>Statin-induced myopathy (SIM)</measure>
    <time_frame>from date of baseline examination until the date of first documented SIM,up to 48 months</time_frame>
    <description>The definition of SIM from statin treatment was based on the patients' subjective sense of muscular pain as well as CK elevations. These muscular side effects included myalgia (muscle pain/ache without serum CK elevations), other muscle-related symptoms such as weakness, cramps, spasms, soreness and twitching, CK elevations without physical symptoms, myositis or other muscle symptoms with CK elevations, and rhabdomyolysis.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>CI-AKI</measure>
    <time_frame>more than 6 h within 48 h after Coronary Angiography</time_frame>
    <description>CI-AKI was diagnosed if a patient had an absolute increase in serum creatinine (sCr) concentration ≥ 0.3 mg/dl (26.4 μmol/L) from baseline or a relative increase ≥ 50 % in sCr concentration for more than 6 h within 48 h after surgery</description>

    <description>It is mainly used for the treatment of left main coronary artery lesions and/or three-vessel lesions.Patients with a score of ≥33 are recommended for CABG. Patients with a score between 23 and 32 can choose either PCI or CABG. Patients with a score of ≤22 are recommended for PCI and CABG.</description>
