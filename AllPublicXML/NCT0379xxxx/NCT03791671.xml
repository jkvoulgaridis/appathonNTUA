  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study is part of a master's thesis. In the rehabilitation of stroke patients
      should be compared whether individual balance training has a greater effect than group
      balance training. The result is determined based on the walking speed.

    <textblock>
      The RehaClinic Kilchberg is a neurological rehabilitation facility with the phases B-D.
      Between February and the end of March, out of 78 patients, 71% of the patients had a stroke.
      Therefore, my choice of topic for the Master's thesis fell on balance training of patients
      after a stroke. The duration of the study is based on the timetable for the Master's thesis.
      Initially, 20 stroke patients will be recruited. When the number is reached, the study is
      completed to begin descriptive statistics and analyze potential BIAS.

      Deficits in the vestibular, visual, motor, and / or somatosensory systems lead to falls in
      the first 6 months after the stroke. This affects approximately 46% of patients. But also
      cognitive processes, such as attention and concentration. Therefore, the treatment must be
      adapted to the respective strategy of the patient. If the patient increasingly uses the
      visual system, the therapy has to work a lot with the eyes closed. In turn, if he uses more
      of the sensorimotor system is increasingly trained with unstable documents. After this
      system, the balance program was set up. It is the same for the intervention and control group
      to make a difference between individual and group training.

    <intervention_model_description>There will be a intervention group and a control group. Both groups do active treatment. In the intervention group they will have individual balance training and in the control group they will have balance training in a group from 3-6 persons. But both groups will do the same balance program.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The Berg Balance Scale is used to determine the risk of falling. The BBS detects deficits at both activity and body function levels. It consists of 14 items. Some items require that the patient maintains positions of increasing difficulty, from sitting to standing on one leg. Other items evaluate the ability to perform specific tasks, such as reaching forward, turning around and picking up an object from the floor. Scoring is based on the ability to meet certain time or distance requirements and to perform the items independently. Scaling takes place from 0 points (not possible) to 4 points (independently possible). This results in a total score of 56 points. The cut-off is at 45 points.</description>

    <description>Functional Ambulation categories - is a functional walking test that evaluates ambulation ability. This 6-point scale assesses ambulation status by determining how much human support the patient requires when walking, regardless of whether or not they use a personal assistive device. To use the FAC, an assessor asks the subject various questions and briefly observes their walking ability to provide a rating from 0 to 5. A score of 0 indicates that the patient is a non-functional ambulator (cannot walk); A score of 1, 2 or 3 denotes a dependent ambulator who requires assistance from another person in the form of continuous manual contact (1), continuous or intermittent manual contact (2), or verbal supervision/guarding (3). A score of 4 or 5 describes an independent ambulator who can walk freely on: level surfaces only (4) or any surface (5=maximum score).</description>

    <description>After the initial assessments, the three week intervention time begins, which is completed with the reassessments.
The patients receive 2x weekly individual balance training for 25 minutes each. This runs in addition to the normal, prescribed rehabilitation program. The rehabilitation program includes at least 3 therapies daily. These may be group therapies, speech therapy, occupational therapy, neuropsychology and physiotherapy adapted to the needs of the patient. In physiotherapy and occupational therapy no balance training will be performed during the intervention period.</description>
