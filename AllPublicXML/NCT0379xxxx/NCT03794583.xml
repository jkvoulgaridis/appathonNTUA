  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label study will evaluate the safety of continued therapy with inhaled treprostinil
      in subjects who have completed Study RIN-PH-304. This study hypothesizes that long-term
      safety findings will be similar to those observed in the randomized, placebo-controlled,
      double-blind, adaptive study 'A Phase 3, Randomized, Placebo-controlled, Double-blind,
      Adaptive Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Inhaled Treprostinil in Patients with
      Pulmonary Hypertension due to Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (PH-COPD)(RIN-PH-304).

    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label study for eligible subjects who completed all scheduled
      study visits during the Treatment Period of Study RIN-PH-304.

      Subjects who provide informed consent for this open-label extension study on or prior to the
      final study visit of RIN-PH-304 may participate in the study, provided all other eligibility
      United Therapeutics Corp. RIN-PH-305 Original Protocol Lung Biotechnology PBC Inhaled
      Treprostinil Version Date 05 September 2018 Confidential Page 12 criteria are met. The
      RIN-PH-304 final study visit and the RIN-PH-305 Enrollment Visit will occur on the same day.

      All subjects will reinitiate inhaled treprostinil at a dose of 3 breaths at 18 micrograms
      (mcg) 4 times daily (QID) during waking hours. Study drug doses should be maximized to
      tolerability throughout the study, and dose titrations should occur as rapidly as possible
      (as directed by the Investigator) with a target dosing of 12 breaths (72 mcg) four times a
      day (QID) or to maximum tolerability. If there are adverse events (AEs) that are dose
      related, the dosing can be adjusted to tolerability.

      Study visits will occur at enrollment, Week 6, and quarterly thereafter. The study may be
      terminated at any time by the Sponsor for reasons that may include, but are not limited to,
      commercial availability of inhaled treprostinil for PH-COPD and Sponsor termination of the
      development for the indication of PH-COPD.
