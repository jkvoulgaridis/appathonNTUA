    <textblock>
      Single center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study to assess the
      safety and tolerability of PBF-1650 in order to obtain the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD).

    <textblock>
      The clinical trial will be a dose escalation study without therapeutic benefit, in which
      PBF-1650 will be administered as single oral ascending- dose to healthy young male
      volunteers. Up to four different rising doses will be tested (40 mg, 80 mg, 120 and 240 mg)
      in groups/cohorts of 8 participants. Thus, four groups/cohorts will participate. For each
      dose level / group, the participants will be randomized to active or placebo with 2
      participants being randomly assigned to placebo and 6 to the active drug. First, one
      volunteer will receive active drug (subgroup 1); after at least 48h of safety and
      tolerability assessment a second subgroup of 3 volunteers will receive 2 active drug and 1
      placebo; after at least another 48h of safety and tolerability parameters assessment a third
      subgroup of 4 volunteers will receive 3 active drug and 1 placebo. After evaluation of safety
      parameters of corresponding dose level, the process will replicate one week afterwards in the
      following dosages.

      The pharmacokinetics profile of PBF-1650 after single oral dose administration of the four
      dose levels will be also assessed.
