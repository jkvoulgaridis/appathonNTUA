  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the Genesis Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT)
      imaging system for use in pediatric respiratory disease populations including neuromuscular
      and bronchopulmonary dysplasia, as well as in age and height matched controls. The EIT does
      not use radiation, and is read through electrodes.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate EIT for use in pediatric respiratory disease
      populations including neuromuscular and bronchopulmonary dysplasia, as well as in age and
      height matched controls.

      Researchers will use EIT to determine changes in regional ventilation with pulmonary
      interventions including airway clearance and invasive and noninvasive ventilation in a
      pediatric respiratory disease population.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>EIT imaging maps that provide regional information regarding ventilation and perfusion of the lung.</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>These images will be analyzed both visually for qualitative abnormalities and through quantitative pixel analysis that can provide information regarding lung volume, blood volume, and changes in either based on respiratory cycle, cardiac cycle, or intervention. Areas of low ventilation (atelectasis and consolidation) will be identified.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Regional conductivity changes due to ventilation</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Describe regional ventilation in pediatric respiratory disease populations including neuromuscular weakness, skeletal/chest wall disorders, and chronic airway and parenchymal lung disease including bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
This is a qualitative aim and will summarize EIT images pictorially. Pixel densities will be evaluated for normality and summarized as mean (SD) or median (interquartile range). EIT images will be qualitatively compared between cases and controls.</description>

    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>This is a qualitative and quantitative aim. Results will qualitatively compare EIT images with CXR and CT scan images when available. Images will be displayed side by side and interpreted by both the clinician and the EIT study staff. Various summary measures of EIT outcomes will be calculated including pixel heterogeneity, summary changes over tidal breath and variation between tidal peaks. Pearson and Spearman correlation will be calculated between summary EIT outcomes and continuous primary clinical values. Linear and logistic regression will be used to estimate associations (with 95% CI) between EIT measures and clinical outcomes. Summary data will be presented in tables and figures using basic descriptive statistics stratified by study group.</description>
