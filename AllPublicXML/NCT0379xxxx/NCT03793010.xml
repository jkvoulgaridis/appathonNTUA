  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in
      patients with hip OA. Approximately 440 patients will be randomized to one of two treatment
      groups (1:1) and treated with a single IA injection of either 32 mg FX006 or normal saline.

      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in
      patients with hip OA. Approximately 440 patients will be randomized to one of two treatment
      groups (1:1) and treated with a single IA injection of either 32 mg FX006 or normal saline.

      FX006 or saline placebo will be administered as a single IA injection with a 12-week
      follow-up period in the double-blind phase.

      Patients eligible for the second injection in the open-label phase at Week 12 will receive an
      open-label injection of FX006 at Week 12 and return for follow-up visits at Weeks 16, 20, and
      24. These patients will complete the study at Week 24.

      Patients who are not clinically indicated for a second injection at Week 12 will return to
      the clinic at Weeks 16, 20, and 24 and will receive an open-label injection of FX006 at the
      first evaluation where the patient has been determined to meet all criteria. Patients will
      then return for follow-up visits every 4 weeks for 12 weeks post second injection and will
      complete the study 12 weeks post second injection (e.g., Week 24, 28, 32, or 36 depending on
      when the patient receives the open-label injection).

      Patients who are not eligible for a second injection after evaluation at Weeks 12, 16, 20,
      and 24 will complete the study at the Week 24 visit and complete the End of Study (EOS)
      assessments.

    <description>The change from baseline on the average Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) A (pain) score at Week 12. The average WOMAC A score is calculated by taking the average of five subscales with a range from 0 (no pain) to 10 (extreme pain).</description>
