  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lower extremity peripheral arterial disease (LEPAD) is a highly prevalent chronic disease.
      Cardiovascular mortality of LEPAD patients at five years ranges between 18 to 30%. LEPAD is
      primarily caused by atherosclerosis that induces an inadequate blood flow to meet the tissues
      demand due to the narrowing of the arteries. An aggravation of the arterial lesions in LEPAD
      patients induces a worsening of patients' symptoms and a severe limitation of their walking
      capacity, contributing to an impairment of their quality of life.

      Interventions designed to improve walking impairment may have a significant impact on the
      functional capacity in LEPAD patients. Lower extremity electrical stimulation is an older
      technique that relies on different types of electrical stimulations with different expected
      physiological effects on hemodynamics, skeletal muscle functions or pain pathway. The aim of
      the ELECTRO-PAD study is to assess the effect of a 12 weeks program of neuromuscular
      electrical stimulation (NMES) on the absolute walking distance (AWD) measured during a
      treadmill test in peripheral artery disease patients.

      The aim of the ELECTRO-PAD study is to assess the effect of a 12 weeks program of
      neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) on the absolute walking distance (AWD) measured
      during a treadmill test in peripheral artery disease patients.

      Arteriopatic patients will be randomized in 2 groups :

        -  patients submitted to a 12 weeks program of neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES
           group)

        -  patients without any program (control group) All patients will also receive a study
           participation guide that will include an information leaflet outlining tips for active
           living and walking.

      After eligibility criteria will be assessed, patient will be included and randomized (visit
      1). A second visit will be performed after 12 weeks (visit 2).

      In parallel, 2 ancillary studies will be performed :

        -  Among Rennes' arteriopatic patients, endothelial function will be assessed using
           measures from 40 patients. Assessment will be done between 1 and 14 days after visit 1
           (visit 1')

        -  The second ancillary study concerns 40 volunteers with no cardiac or vascular pathology,
           only in the coordinating center Rennes. The same measures will be performed for these
           volunteers and for arteriopatic patients.

    <description>Comparison of change in the Short Form (36) Health Survey (SF36) score between visit 1 and visit 2, and between NMES and control group. The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability. To calculate the scores it is necessary to purchase special software.</description>

    <description>Comparison of change in ankle brachial index between visit 1 and visit 2, and between NMES and control group. The ankle-brachial index (ABI) is the ratio of the blood pressure at the ankle to the blood pressure in the upper arm (brachium). Compared to the arm, lower blood pressure in the leg suggests blocked arteries due to peripheral artery disease (PAD). The ABI is calculated by dividing the systolic blood pressure at the ankle by the systolic blood pressure in the arm</description>
