  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study would be designed as a multi-center cross-sectional investigation on the prevalence
      of Wearing-off in Parkinson's patients in Shanghai as well as related influencing factors.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PD patients would be randomly recruited into this investigation from around thirty hospital
      covering the 16 districts of Shanghai. The wearing off would be defined by two methods: the
      doctors' judgement or the WOQ-9 questionnaire which was a patient-determining tool. The
      investigation also includes the medicine, the severity of PD symptoms, the demographic
      factors. The study would be designed with the purpose of clarifying the prevalence of the
      &quot;wearing-off&quot; and its related influencing factors.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>the prevalence of wearing off effect in Parkinson's patients that received stable anti Parkinsonian therapy in Shanghai of China</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>every participant receives a clinical assessment of the wearing-off symptoms by a physician and completes a self rating scale of the wearing-off 9 questionnaire (WOQ-9) to obtain a prevalence of wearing-off positive individuals( wearing-off would be diagnosed by physicians during the clinical assessments)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>the sensitivity and the specificity of the wearing-off 9 questionnaire in the diagnosis of wearing-off effect in Parkinson's disease.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The physician assessment served as the standard for comparison with the WOQ-9 questionnaire. Sensitivity was defined as the probability that a PD patient, classified as having wearing-off (WO) according to physician assessment, would be classified as having the WO using the WOQ-9 questionnaire. The specificity was defined as the probability that a PD patient without the WO by physician assessments would be classified as being without the WO using the WOQ-9 questionnaire</description>
