      In this cross-section study, all patients in the gynecologic ward of Peking Union Medical
      College Hospital will accepted a survey about the prevalence and severity of nausea and
      vomiting according to visual analogue scale and WHO classification. Epidemiological,
      surgical, anaesthetic characteristics and post-operative treatment are considered as
      predictors for the post-operative nausea and vomiting. The primary objective is the incidence
      of nausea and vomiting. The secondary objective is the possible predictors of nausea and
