  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test an intervention to improve Latino/a patients' and their caregivers'
      ability to manage difficult emotions and communicate about the patient's illness. This
      culturally sensitive intervention has the potential to reduce Latino/a patient and caregiver
      distress and improve patient and caregiver quality of life, shared understanding of the
      patient's illness, and patients' and caregivers' ability to discuss, identify, and document
      patients' treatment preferences. The intervention is designed to minimize burden to patients,
      caregivers, and healthcare institutions to allow for easy integration into clinical practice.
