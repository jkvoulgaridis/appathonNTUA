  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators would like to show that when patients undergo upper limb
      surgery under supraclavicular brachial plexus block, additional blocking of the
      Intercostobrachial Nerve Block (ICBN) does not affect the incidence or course of tourniquet
      pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The ICBN is a cutaneous sensory nerve that supplies the medial aspect of the upper arm.
      Traditionally this nerve is blocked to alleviate tourniquet pain. The etiology of tourniquet
      pain is complex and the study team hypothesize that blocking the ICBN has no impact on
      tourniquet pain. Patients will receive a supraclavicular block and be divided into two
      groups; ICBN with local anesthetic or ICBN with saline. All patients in this study will
      receive a supraclavicular block as their primary anesthetic and then be divided into two
      groups; those who receive ICBN and those who do not. Amount of intraoperative analgesics,
      conversion to deep sedation or general anesthesia, and onset of time to tourniquet pain will
      be the primary measures of this study.

    <description>Determine if ICBN has an affect on the severity of tourniquet pain as assessed by Descriptor Differential Scale of Pain Intensity (DDSI) There are 10 points along which patients can rate their pain intensity to the right and left of each descriptor, so the pain is rated on a 21 point scale for each descriptor. Pain intensity is defined as a mean of the ratings and can range from 0 to 20.</description>
