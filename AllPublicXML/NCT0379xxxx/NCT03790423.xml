  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the trial is to test the new radio tracer 18F-ASIS for PET imaging
      of tissue factor (TF) expression. The tracer has the potential of identifying tumors with
      high levels of TF expression, which is expected to correlate with tumor aggression and
      prognosis. Furthermore, the tracer can potentially be used as companion imaging diagnostic
      agent for identifying patients eligible for TF directed therapies.

      This is a first-in-man study to test the radio tracer in cancer patients. Safety,
      biodistribution and dosimetry will be evaluated by repeated PET imaging (1 hour, 2 hours and
      4 hours post-injection).

      4 hours post-injection).

      The primary end points are safety, biodistribution and dosimetry of 18F-ASIS. In addition,
      the quantitative uptake of 18F-ASIS will be compared to the expression of TF measured
      directly in tumor tissue obtained by surgery or biopsies. The study will be monitored and
      evaluated in accordance with the principles of Good Clinical Practice (GCP).
