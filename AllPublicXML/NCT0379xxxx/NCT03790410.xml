  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Deficits in postural control are increasingly recognized among the important secondary
      impairments in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). There are
      conflicting results regarding the effect of inspiratory muscle training in improvement of
      inspiratory muscle strength, endurance, and dyspnea in stable COPD patients. The main
      inspiratory muscle, the diaphragm has also a stabilizing function of the trunk. The aim of
      this study to enhance postural control of COPD patients with improving the stability of the
      trunk by using inspiratory muscle training.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized controlled trial in patients with stable COPD. The participants are
      divided into two groups. Patients in the inspiratory muscle training (IMT) group take part in
      a complex pulmonary rehabilitation program containing breathing exercises, bicycle ergometer
      conditionings, relaxations, strength and endurance trainings completed by inspiratory muscle
      training. The members of the IMT group use the POWERbreathe Medic device. The control group
      perform the complex pulmonary rehabilitation program without IMT. The program is divided into
      3 weeks inpatient period and 3 weeks home period. Before, between and after the 3 weeks
      period all subjects are measured. 60 patients are planned to take part in the investigation.
      The inspiratory muscle strength is measured by POWERbreathe K1 device. Balance is assessed by
      functional balance tests: Timed Up and Go Test, Four Square Step Test, Modified Functional
      Reach Test, Modified Lateral Reach Test, Stand Up Test. Body Sway is measured by HR Mat
      VersaTek System. The diameter of the diaphragm muscle is assessed by B-mode ultrasound
      examination using Zonare Z. One Ultrasound System. Arterial stiffness parameters measured by
      Arteriograph.
