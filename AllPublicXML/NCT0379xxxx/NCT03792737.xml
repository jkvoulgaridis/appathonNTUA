      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of two types of
      absorbable surgical sutures -- STRATAFIX Spiral PDS Knotless Plus Tissue Control Device and
      STRATAFIX Spiral MONOCRYL Plus Knotless Tissue Control Device (hereinafter referred to as
      Spiral PDS Plus and Spiral MONOCRYL Plus) used in thyroid surgery to suture surgical
      incision.

    <textblock>
      This study adopts a multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled design. The study
      population are subjects who undergo thyroid surgery.

      Before the surgery, subjects are randomized in 1:1:1 ratio to the investigational group 1
      (using Spiral PDS Plus), investigational group 2 (using Spiral MONOCRYL Plus) and control
      group. See the table below for the specific suture levels, materials and techniques of each
      group.

      A blinded central imaging evaluation will be performed on the healing condition of surgical
      incision on Day 5-7 post-surgery. The subjects will be blinded to the type of suture used for
      wound closure.

    <measure>Proportion of subjects achieving Grade A healing of surgical incision(success) in each group.</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 5-7 post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Wound healing grade will be assessed by independent, blinded Central Imaging evaluators using (a picture of complete neck anterior view, containing full length of the incision) on Day 5-7 post-surgery.
Wound healing status is classified into three grades:
Grade A healing: Good healing with no adverse reaction;
Grade B healing: Inflammatory reaction(s) at the healing, such as red swelling, induration, hematoma, effusion, etc., but without suppuration;
Grade C healing: Suppuration of incision, requiring incision and drainage and other treatments.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Postoperative incision pain score (Visual Analogue Scale, VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>5-7 days after surgery, 28-35 days after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Postoperative incision pain score (Visual Analogue Scale, VAS).Score range is from 0 to 10, Score 0 means no pain, for the best outcome, and score 10 means unbearable: severely affects sleep with other symptoms, or passive position, for the worst outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health related quality of life scale (EQ-5D-5L).</measure>
    <time_frame>5-7 days after surgery, 28-35 days after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L essentially consists of 2 pages: the EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS).
The descriptive system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state.
The EQ VAS records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale, where the endpoints are labelled, score 100 means the best health you can imagine, score 0 means the worst health you can imagine.</description>

    <description>The Spiral PDS Plus is an antibacterial monofilament, synthetic absorbable device. It contains triclosan, a broad spectrum antibacterial agent. The device consists of barbed suture material, armed with a surgical needle on one end and a fixation loop at the opposite end. The device is designed to anchor with a closed loop at one end and a unidirectional barbed section on the other end. Spiral PDS Plus barbs are oriented in one direction to allow tissue approximation without the need to tie surgical knots.</description>
