  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to decrease the rate of visits to the Emergency Department (ED)
      and Acute Care Clinics (ACC) for dehydration for head &amp; neck (H&amp;N) and esophageal cancer
      patients that are given Gatorade while receiving radiation therapy with or without
      chemotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Among patients with cancer of the H&amp;N or esophagus, complications related to dehydration are
      fairly common, and can result in requiring IV fluid support in an ACC setting, ED or even
      inpatient admission. By instructing participants to drink a reasonable amount of a common
      electrolyte-rich energy drink from the initiation of treatment through its completion, the
      hypothesis will be tested that this inexpensive and easily administered preventative strategy
      can significantly decrease the rate of ACC and ED visits.

      The objectives of this study are to decrease the frequency of ACC visits during the course of
      radiation therapy and decrease the frequency of ED visits during the course of radiation
      therapy. The study team also seeks to decrease the incidence of orthostatic vital signs
      during the course of radiation therapy and decrease the number of days of missed treatments
      due to radiation toxicity during the course of radiation therapy.

      In the pilot cohort, participants will be given Gatorade G2 to drink daily during the course
      of radiation, along with standard of care nutritional support from dietitians. The randomized
      Phase 2 cohort has two study groups. Group 1 will receive standard of care nutritional
      support. Group 2 will receive standard of care nutritional support plus the study agent,
      Gatorade G2.
