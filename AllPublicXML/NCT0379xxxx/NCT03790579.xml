  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dietary habits resembling Western style, rich in animal protein and poor in fruit and
      vegetables, increase the body acid load, a predictor of type 2 diabetes risk. Recently, the
      studies related to relationships between dietary acid load and insulin resistance has become
      a growing interest but there are only a few study conducted with gestational diabetes
      mellitus (GDM). Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the potential relationship
      between dietary acid load in second trimester, blood lipid profiles and GDM.

      This cross-sectional study conducted with 40 women with GDM diagnosed with two-step 100g oral
      glucose tolerance test and 40 healthy women, aged 21-41 years, between weeks of 14-28 of
      pregnancy, who attended the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of Gulhane Training and
      Research Hospital. Participants with polycystic ovary syndrome, chronic diseases, pre-GDM, or
      multiple pregnancies were excluded. Sociodemographic information was recorded via
      questionnaire and anthropometrics of women were measured.

      Blood samples were taken after an overnight fasting. Dietary information was obtained by mean
      intakes of a 3-day food records (2 weekdays and 1 weekend day) and analyzed via nutrition
      analysis software. According to the data obtained from software analysis, animal protein
      (g/day) to potassium (g/day) ratio (AP/K), potential renal acid load (PRAL; mEq/day) score
      and net endogenous acid production (NEAP; mEq/day) were calculated from established
      algorithms to estimate dietary acid load. All nutrients were age and energy- adjusted before
      being introduced into the equation and tertiles of the scores were used for statistical
      analysis. ANOVA, ANCOVA and Logistic regression test were used. The study plan was approved
      by the Hospital&amp;#39;s Ethics Committee.

    <description>We randomly selected the 40 pregnant women diagnosed GDM by two-step procedure based on Carpenter-Coustan criteria at this hospital. The diagnosis of GDM was confirmed if at least 2 of 4 glucose levels exceed based on Carpenter-Coustan criteria: fasting ≥ 95 mg/dL (5.3 mmol/L), 1 hour ≥ 180 mg/dL ( 10.0 mmol/L), 2 hour ≥ 155 mg/dL (8.6 mmol/L), and 3 hour ≥ 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L).</description>

        In this observational cross-sectional study, 40 women with GDM and 40 healthy pregnant
        between 21-41 years in age, in their 24-28th gestational week applied to Gulhane Education
        and Research Hospital were recruited. This study must recruit 40 women for each group to
        have 80% study power with 5% type I error level to detect a clinically significant
        difference.
