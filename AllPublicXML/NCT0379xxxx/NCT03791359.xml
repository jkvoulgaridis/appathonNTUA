      Introduction and Background:Cardiac arrest is an important public health problem
      worldwide.Registries on Out Of Hospital Cardiac arrest(OOHCA) not only contribute to research
      and surveillance but also provide inputs to improve the links in the Chain of
      Survival.Whereas various registries on OOHCA exist and are ongoing globally ,registries and
      studies on OOHCA are limited in India.The awareness on Cardiovascular Health, Cardiac Arrest
      and CPR is less in India when compared to some developed countries.A study done earlier noted
      the lack of awareness on Cardiovascular Health,cardiac arrest and CPR in a cohort of Indian
      population.This study pointed the need to increase awareness on CV health,cardiac arrest and
      CPR among Indian population(abstract presented by Dr Srinivas Ramaka at the World Congress of
      Cardiology,2016).There is a dire need to improve the survival of victims of OOHCA in India.

      With this background and understanding,the need for a Registry on OOHCA ,the Warangal Area
      Out Of Hospital Cardiac Arrest Registry has been initiated in January 2018 as a Pilot study
      in India.

      Objectives:1.To collect available OOHCA data for one year from a selected geographical area
      in India following an International standard format(Utstein Template) tailored to India.

      2.To compile reports which might be useful to improve the links in the survival of OOHCA
      victims.

      Methods and study design:This is an Observational study of a cohort of Out of Hospital
      cardiac arrest victims. Geographical area:Warangal and surroundings ,Telangana state. Time
      frame--January 1 ,2018 to December 31,2018.As it is both a surveillance and research
      study,the project is proposed to be continued mostly for another year 2019 depending on
      logistic support and feasibility.

      Sources of data:Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Hospital,participating local hospitals and practising
      physicians,reports from local media,local governmental agencies,births and deaths department
      of local Municipal Corporation and district medical and health officials.MGM Hospital is a
      secondary care govt hospital catering to the medical needs of Warangal and surrounding
      districts.Data of victims brought in cardiac arrest or declared dead on arrival is collected
      from the Casualty or Emergency dept .Missing data or additional information is collected
      telephonically from the victim's relatives and attendants.The local legal and ethical
      guidelines are followed in collecting the data.Data is collected on a standard report form
      /Online fillable pdf which includes the variables as mentioned in the data collection
      form,participants/cohorts of victims of OOHCA,definition of OOHCA,inclusion criteria,sources
      of information collected in person or telephonically,consent,methods of selection of
      participants and methods of followup.Data is entered in standard excel format and will be
      analyzed according to appropriate/standard statistical methods.Permission from the hospital
      administration and all concerned is taken prior.At present there is no funding for the
      project.Dr Srinivas Ramaka is the Principal Investigator. Dr Vemuri S Murthy from USA is the
      coinvestigator in this project.
