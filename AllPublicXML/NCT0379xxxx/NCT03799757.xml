  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      in this study we are investigating the role of instillation of Bupivacaine through surgical
      drains at the end of mastectomy surgeries in controlling post operative pain and decreasing
      their pain killers requirement in the early postoperative period

    <textblock>
      patients were enrolled into 2 groups. in one group the wound was installed by 40ml of 0.25%
      bupivacaine through axillary and chest wall drains (20ml in each drain). Then, the drains
      were clamped for 20 minutes.

      in the other group the wound was installed by 40ml of 0.9% normal saline through axillary and
      chest wall drains (20ml in each drain). Then, the drains were clamped for 20 minutes.
      (placebo group) patients and health care providers were blinded as regard the study group
      patients enrolled in. Visual Analog Pain Scale which is a score for detection of how much the
      patient is annoyed from the pain- was assessed two and four hours post-operative then every
      four hours thereafter.
