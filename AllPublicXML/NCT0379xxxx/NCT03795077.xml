  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to assess the effect of a higher education programme based on
      professional ethics in physiotherapy students.

      A simple-blind clinical trial was performed. A three-months program based in professional
      ethics was carried out.

      The investigators compared a control group (traditonal lectures) with an intervention group
      (syllabus, activities, face to face techniques). Students´ attitudes, knowledge, professional
      values, and opinions towards professional ethics were evaluated before and after the
      programme, in both groups. All participants were informed about the study and procedures, and
      provided written informed consent.

      Participants. 250 second-year degree students of Physiotherapy Degree at the University, aged
      between 20 and 30 years, were recruited voluntarily from March 2018 to January 2019. All
      enrolled participants were informed of the purpose of the study and procedures, and provided
      written informed consent. The study was carried out at the institution where the authors
      belong.

      Research design. A prospective simple-blind trial was performed. After baseline assessment,
      participants were allocated to one of the two groups (control group, n=125; experimental
      group, n=125). An external assistant not involved in the study performed assignment.

      Intervention. A Physiotherapy professor with over-10-year experience in Ethics and
      Physiotherapy performed the teaching methodology and opened the allocation envelopes and
      applied the teaching methodology to the EG according to the group assignment. The
      intervention consisted of a three-month program based in professional ethics, including two
      phases: A) syllabus and activities; and B) face to face group sessions including techniques
      such as concept maps, glossaries, brainstorming, four corners activity, aquarium, philip 6-6,
      kahoot, Realm Individual-Process Situation, reduced groups, guided debates, and discussion
      groups.

    <description>Attitude towards learning professional ethics was measured. A self-reported questionnaire of 33 items (the &quot;Attitudes Questionnaire towards Professional Ethics in Physiotherapy&quot;, AQPEPT) was previously described by Aguilar-Rodríguez et al. A high reliability (Cronbach's alpha=0.898) was obtained. All items of the AQPEPT approached to the one-dimensionality needed in cases where attitudes are analyzed.The higher score indicated the best attitude.</description>
