  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is the development and implementation of a survey
      administered to hospitalized patients on Internal Medicine that can be used in conjunction
      with previously validated predictive indices to identify patients at risk for readmission.
      The survey consists of previously validated as well as investigator developed survey
      instruments that will assess the following: health literacy, numeracy, medication adherence,
      self-efficacy, and tolerance. The predictive indices are the LACE, Charlson Comorbidity Index
      (included in LACE), and the Comorbidity Polypharmacy Score (CPS) which have been previously
      validated for risk of readmissions. The survey consists of both closed and open ended
      questions. A part of the survey will be administered by the study personnel while the rest is
      a questionnaire-based survey that will be completed by the subjects. Study personnel will be
      with the subjects in an open dialogue while subjects are completing the survey to answer any
      questions and identify questions that may be confusing or bias subjects. Approximately 30
      days after hospital discharge, patients will be contacted via telephone to ask how many
      admissions and/or Emergency Department (ED) visits they have had since discharge. A
      correlation analysis will be done of the different aspects of the survey to determine whether
      there are redundancies. A regression analysis will be done to determine the predictive
      ability of the survey combined with predictive indices for readmission.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many patients are readmitted to the hospital shortly after discharge. Twenty percent of
      Medicare beneficiaries discharged were re-hospitalized within 30 days at a cost to Medicare
      estimated at $17.4 billion.1 This problem does not only affect the elderly. Medicaid
      enrollees aged 21-64 had 10.7% 30-day readmission rate.2 Identifying which patients are at
      highest risk is important for allocating resources to those high risk individuals.

      Several studies have attempted to retrospectively identify medical conditions, medications,
      labs, and vitals associated with increased risk of readmission with different levels of
      success. Examples of these include the Charlson Comorbidity Index, LACE, and the Comorbidity
      Polypharmacy Score. Although not always developed for use in predicting readmissions, they
      have been subsequently associated with this.3 While these indices examine objective data, it
      is thought that health beliefs, abilities, and behaviors can also affect the risk of
      readmissions. Health literacy in particular has been shown to be associated with 30 day
      readmissions after an acute myocardial infarction and in general medical patients.4,5 Low
      numeracy has been associated with increased risk of 30 day readmission in patients with acute
      heart failure.6 Inpatient questionnaires are able to identify patients who are more likely
      than others to be readmitted.7 Additionally, objective qualities such as insurance status,
      comorbidities, and admissions within the past year are predictors of readmission.8 Due to the
      unique patient populations at different health systems, an institution-specific approach is
      necessary to analyze the specific factors contributing to readmission. Therefore, a survey
      will be used to gauge the most predictive factors of readmissions and ED visits, including
      objective and subjective sections. After further research and modification, the survey will
      potentially serve as a tool for clinicians to select the best approach to post-discharge care
      and follow-up.

      This pilot will attempt to test a survey for predicting readmission through measurements of
      health literacy, numeracy, medication adherence, self-efficacy, and tolerance, and in
      conjunction with co-morbidity indices.
