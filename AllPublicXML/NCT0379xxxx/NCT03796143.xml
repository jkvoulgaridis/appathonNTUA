  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to compare the efficacy of acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT)
      and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for depression in a bibliotherapy format and assess
      hypothesized mechanisms of change in depression symptomatology, quality of life, and
      functioning.

      This study will test the following hypotheses:

        1. CBT and ACT will both result in decreased depression, distress, and self-stigma
           associated with depression. Life satisfaction and values progress will increase in both
           conditions.

        2. CBT will result in greater use of reappraisal than ACT.

        3. ACT will results in greater use of defusion and decreased psychological inflexibility
           than CBT.

        4. Changes in experiential avoidance and defusion will predict changes in depression in the
           ACT condition.

        5. Changes in reappraisal will predict changes in depression in the CBT condition.

        6. Participants who are given their choice of treatment will show better adherence and
           satisfaction in the intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to recruit 150 participants for this RCT (50 per treatment condition).
      This will provided adequate power (0.80) to detect differences between groups of medium
      effect size (d=0.50). Note that detailed eligibility criteria are listed in the &quot;Eligibility&quot;
      section. Participants will be recruited via SONA, flyers, online postings, classroom
      announcements, and through the USU CBS lab website.

      All study procedures will be completed online, on a computer/mobile phone. After completing
      informed consent online through Qualtrics, participants will complete an online baseline
      survey. Participants will then be randomized to one of three groups: a CBT book, an ACT book,
      or a choice between the two books. Participants will be asked not to access other self-help
      books during the study duration. A link will be provided to access the book online along with
      a 10-week suggested reading schedule. Participants will be asked to complete a midtreatment
      survey 5 weeks after the beginning of treatment, and a posttreatment survey 10 weeks after
      the beginning of treatment. A follow-up survey will be sent to participants 3 months after
      the posttreatment survey. In addition to psychological measures, these surveys will also ask
      about adherence and use of strategies taught in the book. Researcher contact will involve
      reminders to complete assessments and weekly reminders of the suggested reading schedule.

      Participants assigned to the CBT condition will receive a link to access The Cognitive
      Behavioral Workbook for Depression (Knaus, 2008), based on a psychosocial treatment that has
      shown effectiveness in reducing depression symptoms (Jiménez, 2012). The primary treatment
      components in this book are psychoeducation (introducing the cognitive behavioral model of
      depression), self-assessment worksheets (e.g. identifying depressive thought patterns,
      separating sensations from appraisals), cognitive restructuring, using metacognition/logic,
      and avoiding perfectionism.

      Participants assigned to the ACT condition will receive a link to access The Mindfulness and
      Acceptance Workbook for Depression (Strosahl &amp; Robinson, 2008), based on a modern cognitive
      behavioral therapy that combines acceptance and mindfulness methods with values and behavior
      change methods (Hayes, Strosahl &amp; Wilson, 2011). The primary treatment components in this
      book are psychoeducation (introducing the ACT model of depression), values and goals,
      mindfulness, acceptance, defusion, committed action, and &quot;rewriting&quot; inflexible life stories.

      An additional subset of study participants will be given their choice of the two self-help
      books described above after completing the baseline assessment. Participants who are
      randomized to receive their choice of book will be provided a brief description of the
      contents of each book before making a decision.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Depression, Anxiety and Stress</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, midtreatment (5 weeks after baseline), posttreatment (10 weeks after baseline), and follow-up (3-months after posttreatment)</time_frame>
    <description>Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS) : a self-report measure of depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms. Higher scores indicate higher negative emotional states of depression, anxiety, and stress. This measure assesses each of these symptoms as a distinct subscale. Items are rated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 &quot;did not apply to me at all&quot; to 3 &quot;applied to me very much, or most of the time.&quot; Ranges for depression, anxiety, and stress are 0-28, 0-20, and 0-33, respectively.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-Stigma of Depression Scale (SSDS; Barney, Griffiths, Christensen, &amp; Jorm, 2010)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, midtreatment (5 weeks after baseline), posttreatment (10 weeks after baseline), and follow-up (3-months after posttreatment)</time_frame>
    <description>The SSDS is a 16-item measure of self-directed stigma about one's own experience of depression and consists of subscales of shame, self-blame, social inadequacy, and help-seeking inhibition. The measure generates four subscales for shame, self-blame, help-seeking inhibition, and feelings of social inadequacy, with higher scores indicating greater presence of these experiences. The subscales are summed to calculate a total score which ranges from 16 to 80, with higher scores indicating greater overall self-stigma.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-II (AAQ-II; Bond et al., 2011)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, midtreatment (5 weeks after baseline), posttreatment (10 weeks after baseline), and follow-up (3-months after posttreatment)</time_frame>
    <description>The AAQ-II is a 10-item measure of psychological inflexibility and experiential avoidance. Items are rated on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 &quot;never true&quot; to 7 &quot;always true.&quot; A total score is calculated by reverse coding so that higher scores indicate greater psychological flexibility.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cognitive Fusion Questionnaire (CFQ; Gillanders et al., 2014)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, midtreatment (5 weeks after baseline), posttreatment (10 weeks after baseline), and follow-up (3-months after posttreatment)</time_frame>
    <description>The CFQ is a 7-item measure of cognitive fusion. Items are rated on a 7-point scale, ranging from 1 &quot;never true&quot; to 7 &quot;always true.&quot; Total scores range from 7 to 49 with higher scores indicating greater levels of cognitive fusion.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Behavioral Activation for Depression Scale (BADS; Kanter, Mulick, Busch, Berlin, &amp; Martell, 2007)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, midtreatment (5 weeks after baseline), posttreatment (10 weeks after baseline), and follow-up (3-months after posttreatment)</time_frame>
    <description>The BADS is a 25-item measure of approach and avoidance behaviors in depression, separated into two subscales. Two additional subscales measure work/school and social impairment due to depressive symptoms. Within each subscale, higher scores indicate greater frequency of these behaviors.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Automatic Thoughts Questionnaire-Frequency (ATQ-30; Hollon &amp; Kendall, 1980)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, midtreatment (5 weeks after baseline), posttreatment (10 weeks after baseline), and follow-up (3-months after posttreatment)</time_frame>
    <description>The ATQ is a 30-item measure of the frequency of automatic negative self-statements associated with depression. Items are rated on a 5-point scale, ranging from 1 &quot;not at all&quot; to 5 &quot;all the time,&quot; with higher scores indicating a greater frequency of automatic thoughts.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Thought Control Questionnaire-Reappraisal Subscale (TCQ; Wells &amp; Davies, 1994)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, midtreatment (5 weeks after baseline), posttreatment (10 weeks after baseline), and follow-up (3-months after posttreatment)</time_frame>
    <description>The TCQ-Reappraisal subscale is 6-item measure of cognitive reappraisal of negative thoughts. Items are rated on a 4 point scale ranging from 1 &quot;never&quot; to 4 &quot;almost always&quot; indicating the frequency of cognitive reappraisal of negative thoughts. Total scores range from 6 to 24, with higher scores indicating greater frequency of cognitive reappraisal of negative thoughts.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Adherence to self-help book</measure>
    <time_frame>Midtreatment (5 weeks after baseline), posttreatment (10 weeks after baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked to rate their adherence to the exercises in the book with a single question on 7-point scale from &quot;Did all recommended assignments&quot; to &quot;Did no recommended assignments,&quot; with higher scores indicating a greater proportion of the assignments were completed. This is adapted from previous studies of self-help adherence (Abramowitz, Moore, Braddock, &amp; Harrington, 2009).</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Satisfaction with self-help book</measure>
    <time_frame>Posttreatment (10 weeks after baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked to rate 7 items evaluating their satisfaction with the self-help book on a 6-point scale from &quot;Strongly disagree&quot; to &quot;Strongly agree.&quot; The scale produces a total score ranging from 7 to 42, with higher scores indicating greater satisfaction with the book. These items have been used to evaluate program satisfaction in previous self-help research conducted by our lab (e.g., Levin, Pierce, &amp; Schoendorff, in press).</description>
