  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are more and more pregnant women who are obese. It is very difficult for obese women to
      get into labor. That is why when women are obese, half are likely to need a Cesarean
      delivery(C-section). Unfortunately, C-sections are more dangerous for obese women. There may
      be a combination of issues that cause obese women to need C-sections. We believe one of those
      reasons is that the womb of obese women respond differently to medications and devices
      compared to non-obese women. There are commonly two ways to help women get into labor. One
      way is a medication called misoprostol. The second way is a device called Foley balloon. In
      most studies, both ways are equally effective in helping women get into labor. However, these
      studies included everyone, and didn't focus on obese women.

      So far there are no studies in this area that focus only on obese women. Therefore we need to
      design this study to focus just on obese women and what is the best way to help them get into
      labor and avoid a C-section.
