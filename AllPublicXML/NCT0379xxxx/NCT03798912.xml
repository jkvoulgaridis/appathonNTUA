      The objective of this study is to ascertain the efficacy and short-term safety of the
      RaniPill capsule in healthy volunteers
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The RaniPill device is an ingestible, capsule-like device, which, once in the jejunum,
      deploys and, via a microneedle, injects a microtablet (payload) into the intestinal wall.
      This is a phase I (first-in-human) open-label study in 46 healthy volunteers. In 6 subjects,
      100 mcg of octreotide (Sandostatin®) will be injected intravenously. In 20 subjects a
      RaniPill capsule with a small balloon size (RaniPill A) containing 100 mcg of octreotide will
      be administered. In 20 other subjects a RaniPill capsule with a larger balloon size (RaniPill
      B) containing 100 mcg of octreotide will be administered. In each study group, the
      bioavailability and PK of octreotide will be examined by serial blood sampling after its
      enteral or intravenous administration.
