  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breastfeeding has various benefits for the mother and infant. It has the capability of
      reducing the risk of short term and long term problems for the infant, such as
      gastroenteritis, respiratory infections, type II diabetes and obesity, and of providing
      benefits for neurodevelopment. Breast milk offers even greater benefits for preterm infants.
      Some of the advantages of breastfeeding are related to the constituents of breast milk such
      as the macronutrients and bioactive factors, the hormones associated with breastfeeding such
      as oxytocin, and the behavioural aspects of breastfeeding (maternal sensitivity to infant
      cues). Despite these advantages, breastfeeding rates are below target levels mainly due to
      the challenges that women face that hinder breastfeeding success. Interventions aimed at
      improving policies, practices, and maternal support have been developed. However, other
      interventions that target specific modifiable barriers to breastfeeding can be useful.

      The aim of this study is to investigate a simple support intervention for breastfeeding
      mothers of late preterm infants on maternal stress reduction and infant weight gain. The
      investigators also aim to study the potential mechanisms by which this effect could be
      achieved (breast milk composition and volume, mother and infant behaviour).

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Infant appetite change at 6 weeks from 2 weeks post-delivery.</measure>
    <time_frame>Home visit 1 (2 weeks postnatally) and Home visit 2 (6 weeks postnatally)</time_frame>
    <description>Infant appetite will be assessed using the Baby Eating Behaviour Questionnaire, with the following subscales (appetite traits): General Appetite (1 to 5 points), Enjoyment of Food (1 to 5 points), Satiety Responsiveness (1 to 5 points), Food Responsiveness (1 to 5 points), and Slowness in Eating (1 to 5 points). Higher scores on each subscale indicates a greater degree of the appetite trait.</description>
