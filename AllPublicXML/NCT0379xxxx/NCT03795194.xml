  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized study of patients 2-17 years old who are diagnosed with perforated
      appendicitis and develop an abscess after laparoscopy that is subsequently drained. Patients
      will be randomized to either receive an 8-day or a 4-day course of antibiotics. The aim of
      this study is to determine whether duration of antibiotic treatment at discharge demonstrates
      significant differences in clinical outcomes.

      The central aim of this study is to determine whether duration of antibiotic treatment at
      discharge demonstrates significant differences in primary and secondary clinical outcomes.
      Specifically, this research aims to determine whether the readmission rate and length of stay
      for pediatric patients diagnosed with perforated appendicitis who form a post-laparoscopic
      abscess that is treated with percutaneous drainage and are treated with a 8-day oral
      antibiotic regimen at discharge is significantly different from those treated with a fixed
      4-day regimen at discharge.

      This study includes patients ages 2-17 years old who present with perforated appendicitis—as
      diagnosed at laparoscopy and photographed as either a hole or as feces in the abdomen—and who
      develop an abscess after laparoscopy that is treated with percutaneous drainage.

      All post-laparoscopic abscess patients will receive the standard of care for antibiotic
      therapy at Phoenix Children's Hospital—IV ceftriaxone/metronidazole—until afebrile and
      tolerating food. All patients will be treated with the PCH standard of care and receive
      in-patient treatment for abscess until afebrile.

      At discharge, study patients will be randomly assigned to either an 8-day
      ampicillin/clavulanate regimen or a 4-day ampicillin/clavulanate regimen. Pediatric patients
      who are allergic to ampicillin will be excluded from the study. Patients will be followed
      thirty days post discharge to assess clinical outcomes.
