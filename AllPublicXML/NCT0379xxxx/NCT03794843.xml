      The investigation product Nimodipine Injection (II) was supplied by Shenyang Dongxing
      Pharmaceutical Technology Co., Ltd.And Nimodipine injection (trade name: Nimotop)
      manufactured by Bayer Pharma AG was used as the reference preparation.The volunteers were
      administered with Nimodipine injection for intravenous infusion (containing nimodipine 11 mg)
      for 12 consecutive hours, respectively.The Venous blood was collected at 0 hours before the
      administration (ie, 1 hour before the administration) and 10 minutes, 20 minutes, 30 minutes,
      45 minutes, 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, 4 h, 6 h, 8 h, 10 h, 12 h (Administration was over) and 12.5 h, 13
      h, 14 h, 16 h, 19 h, 22 h, 25 h, 36 h, 3 ml per blood collection.
