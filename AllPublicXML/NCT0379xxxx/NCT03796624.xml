  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This clinical investigation is a prospective, non-randomised, open, controlled, single-center
      post-market clinical follow whereby study patients undergoing routine cataract surgery will
      have implantation of monofocal intraocular lens Micropure 1.2.3. (PhysIOL, Liège, Belgium) in
      one eye and implantation of monofocal intraocular lens PODEYE (PhysIOL, Liège, Belgium) in
      the contralateral eye of the same patient.

      The study purpose is to obtain clinical data on visual acuity and contrast sensitivity on
      patients implanted with Micropure 1.2.3. and PODEYE

      The devices under investigation (Micropure 1.2.3. and PODEYE) are a monofocal glistening-free
      hydrophobic acrylic intraocular lenses (IOLs) manufactured by the sponsor of this study
      PhysIOL sa/nv. The optical properties of the lenses are very comparable. The main difference
      is the mechanical design of the haptics, that is not expected to have an influence on the
      clinical outcomes.

      The IOLs will be implanted as part of the routine cataract surgery on patients suffering from
      cataract development.

      In total 76 patients will be recruited for this clinical study and receive the implantation
      of Micropure 1.2.3. and POPDEYE intraocular lenses.

      Subjects participating in the trial will attend study visits over a period of 12 months.

    <description>The slitlamp examination is one examination to analyse the integrity of eye structures and the implanted IOL. The examination is performed and documented according to the guidelines in ISO 11979-7:2018.
With the slitlamp the ophthalmologist can observe the eyes stereoscopically. A focussed slit of light, which can be width-adjusted, is projected on the eye to be examined. The investigator observes this projection on the eye through a reflected light microscope. The slitlamp is used to observe the anterior and posterior part of the eye, including cornea, lens and anterior chamber. By dilating the pupil the fundus can also be examined. Following conditions shall be examined with the slitlamp:
