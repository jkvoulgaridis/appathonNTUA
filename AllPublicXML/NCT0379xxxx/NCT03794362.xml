  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is generally recognized that pain assessment and management especially in newborns,
      children and other nonverbal populations is an unmet need. According to the American Medical
      Association, &quot;the pediatric population is at risk of inadequate pain management, with
      age-related factors affecting pain management in children. Children are often given minimal
      or no analgesia for procedures that would routinely be treated aggressively in adults.
      Although much is now known about pain management in children, it has not been widely or
      effectively translated into routine clinical practice&quot;. These two factors combine to
      emphasize the necessity for an objective tool to quantify pain and monitor the effectiveness
      of analgesia, especially during treatments. Further, it is reported that many patients
      require a combination of treatments, and it is often necessary to test a variety of
      treatments before the personal match for treatment is found. The method in place to change
      the care on a subjective basis is difficult, time consuming, and not easily individualized.
      This pilot study is part of an ongoing effort to develop a method to objectively assess
      response to specific analgesic interventions. It specifically aims to discern the impact of
      analgesic interventions on sensory nerve fiber sensitivity in a diverse patient population.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The subject is 7 to 21 years of age

          2. The subject is receiving an analgesic intervention in the Children's National Medical
             Center Pain Clinic

          3. The subject is willing and able to provide written informed assent/parental consent to
             the study participation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Eye pathology precluding pupillometry

          2. Patients who are actively using opioids (history of use acceptable). Rationale:
             opioids constrict the pupil, and therefore concomitant opioid use would bias our
             results.

          3. Subjects who are or may be pregnant
