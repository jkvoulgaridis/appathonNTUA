    <textblock>
      FADOI-ICECAP is a observational, prospective, multicenter study involving 20-25 nationwide
      Units of Internal Medicine. The study foresees the participation of 26 Internal Medicine
      Operative Units, and for each of them a prospective registration of data relative to at least
      50 patients admitted with CAP (in total, at least 1300 evaluable subjects) is foreseen.

      Phase 1 - Patients enrollment (October 2016 - February 2018) Each Investigator have recorded
      data concerning 50 patients. It will be collected general characteristics of patients,
      clinical parameters and conditions, diagnostic imaging and blood tests,

      Phase 2 - Database review and validation (April 2018 - October 2018) The data collected will
      be analysed to process the endpoints.
