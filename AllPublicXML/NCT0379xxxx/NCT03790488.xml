    <textblock>
      JTX-4014-101 is a Phase 1, open label, dose escalation clinical study of JTX-4014 in adult
      subjects with advanced refractory solid tumor malignancies, to determine the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      JTX-4014 is a fully human IgG4 monoclonal antibody designed to specifically bind to PD-1 and
      block its interaction with its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, to augment anti-tumor T cell
      activity. This is a Phase 1, first in human, open label, multicenter, dose escalation
      clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK of JTX-4014 when administered as
      a single agent to adult subjects with advanced refractory solid tumor malignancies. The
      intent of this study will be to determine the MTD and RP2D.
