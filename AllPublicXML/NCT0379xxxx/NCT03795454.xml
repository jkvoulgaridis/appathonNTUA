  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess whether a musical intervention (maternal/paternal singing) during the skin-to-skin
      sessions (Kangaroo care) would improve the language development of the preterm infant.
      Infants will be randomized to singing or silence during the Kangaroo care from the age
      corresponding to 30th gestational week until term age (40 gestational weeks).

      The outcomes are:

      a 2-year neurodevelopmental follow up

      - Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third Edition (in Finnish in Finland and
      in Swedish in Sweden)

      At the age corresponding to term (40 gestational weeks)

        -  Auditory event related potentials (AERPs) in electroencephalography (EEG), in Helsinki
           cohort

        -  Auditory event related magnetic fields in magnetoencephalgraphy (MEG) in Karolinska
           cohort

        -  Parental stress with The State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)

    <description>&quot;Bayley III&quot; :- Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Develoment, Third Edition (in Finnish in Finland and in Swedish in Sweden)
- The following scales will be used: Cognitive, Language, Motor, Language scale includes Expressive Language and Receptive Language Motor scale includes Fine Motorics and Gross Motorics
All scale ranges will be included (i.e., minimum and maximum scores) required to interpret any values. For example, if the *total* score is reported, the *total* range should be provided. If *subscale* scores are reported, the range for each *subscale* should be provided.</description>
