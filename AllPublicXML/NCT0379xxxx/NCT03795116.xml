  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Skin scarring (fibrosis) is a common complication in the wound healing process and remains a
      therapeutic challenge. Scar formation often occurs following injury to the skin such as
      surgery, trauma, and burns. The goal of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      visible red light as a modality to reduce skin scarring after mini-facelift surgery. Based on
      laboratory data, light emitting diode-red light (LED-RL) phototherapy may lessen
      post-surgical skin fibrosis clinically.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Skin fibrosis is a significant global health problem that has a profoundly negative impact on
      quality of life. Characterized by excessive fibroblast proliferation and collagen deposition,
      skin fibrosis underlies a wide spectrum of dermatologic conditions ranging from pathologic
      scars secondary to injury (e.g., burns, surgery, trauma) to immune-mediated diseases.
      Effective anti-scarring therapeutics remain an unmet need, underscoring the importance of
      developing novel approaches to treat and prevent skin fibrosis.

      In vitro data show that LED-RL can modulate key cellular and molecular processes involved in
      skin fibrosis. Two phase I clinical trials (STARS 1 and STARS 2) demonstrated the safety and
      tolerability of LED-RL at fluences of 160 J/cm2 up to 480 J/cm2 on normal human skin. The
      administration of LED-RL phototherapy in the early postoperative period may optimize wound
      healing and prevent excessive scarring. The results from this study may change the current
      treatment paradigm for fibrotic skin diseases and help to pioneer LED-RL as a safe,
      non-invasive, cost-effective, portable, at-home therapy for scars.

    <masking_description>This is a single-blind study. Participants and clinicians involved in subjective efficacy assessments will be blind to the study intervention (LED-RL phototherapy versus mock therapy). The principal investigator, along with the research coordinator who administers the LED-RL phototherapy, will be aware of each participant's treatment assignment.</masking_description>

    <description>The ElastiMeter, a non-invasive indentation instrument, will be used to evaluate skin elasticity (i.e., skin stiffness) of the LED-RL-treated scar versus the untreated scar. Skin elasticity is measured in Newtons/meters (N/m).</description>

    <description>The SkinFibroMeter, a non-invasive indentation instrument, will be used to evaluate the induration of the skin and subcutaneous tissue (i.e., hardness) of the LED-RL-treated scar versus the untreated scar. Skin induration is measured in Newtons (N).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month, 3 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The two subscales of the POSAS each consist of six items rated from 1 to 10, where 1 is &quot;normal skin&quot; and 10 is the &quot;worst imaginable scar&quot;. The observer (i.e., investigator) evaluates scar vascularity, pigmentation, thickness, relief, pliability, and surface area while the patient assesses pain, itching, color, stiffness, thickness, and irregularity. The scores of each of the six items are summed for a total score (range 6 to 60).</description>

    <measure>Visual analog scale (VAS) scoring of digital photographs of scars</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month, 3 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The scar images will be rated by two independent, blinded dermatologists using a VAS. The VAS is presented as a 10 cm horizontal line, where the extreme ends of 0 indicates &quot;normal skin&quot; and 10 corresponds to the &quot;worst possible scar,&quot; for each of the following scar attributes: pigmentation, vascularity, observer comfort, contour, and overall severity.</description>
