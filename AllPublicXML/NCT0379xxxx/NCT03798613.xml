    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess the accuracy of the Apple Watch 4 Series watch in
      generating an ECG that is suitable for determination of heart rhythm compared to rhythms
      monitored via telemetry. Secondary objective is to assess the accuracy of the Apple Watch 4
      series watch in identifying atrial fibrillation when it is present.

      The study will assess the accuracy of the Apple watch 4 series watch when worn by
      post-operative cardiac surgery patients after they have transferred from the ICU to the
      cardiac telemetry unit.

      During testing each subject will wear:

        1. An Apple Watch 4 series watch for no more than 5 minutes.

        2. Standard continuous telemetry monitor

      The location of the watch (left or right wrist) will be randomly assigned.

      Heart rate and rhythm will be assessed by obtaining tracings from the Apple Watch 4 series
      watch while at the same point in time obtaining tracings from a standard telemetry monitor.

      ECGs from the Apple Watch 4 will be collected by asking the patient to place his/ her finger
      on the digital crown of the Apple Watch 4 for 30 seconds. The rhythm displayed by the Apple
      Watch 4 will be viewed on the Apple health app (available on the iPhone 8) and will be saved
      for subsequent viewing and analysis.

      Each enrolled patient will have a minimum of three assessments of heart rhythm per day for at
      least two days, generating a minimum of six data points per patient.

      After conclusion of the study for each subject, the ECG's from the health app pertaining to
      that subject will be reviewed by a board certified cardiologist as will the telemetry
      tracings.

      In order to obtain tracings of new onset post-operative atrial fibrillation. 50% of the
      subjects enrolled will be in sinus rhythm and 50% will be in atrial fibrillation at the time
      of enrollment.
