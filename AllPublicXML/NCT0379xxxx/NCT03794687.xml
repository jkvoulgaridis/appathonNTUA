  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study team aims to perform a prospective observational case series of one hundred
      consecutive distal radial artery heart catheterizations to evaluate the safety and
      feasibility of distal radial access. Distal radial artery access has evolved in the past few
      years as an alternative to the standard radial artery access for coronary angiography and
      interventions. However, the available data on the distal radial artery access for coronary
      angiography and interventions is limited to case reports and small retrospective case series.
      To date, no prospective randomized data is available. Therefore, the investigators aim to
      perform a prospective observational case series of one hundred sequential left heart
      catheterizations performed via distal radial artery to evaluate the safety and feasibility of
      the distal radial artery access.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite the abundance of data supporting the use of the radial artery compared to the femoral
      artery, data on the use the distal radial access site in the anatomical snuffbox is limited.
      Most of the available literature on the distal radial access comes from case reports and
      small retrospective case series looking primarily at the feasibility and success rates with
      this approach (4-6). Crossover rate from proximal radial to femoral approach in a prior
      randomized controlled trial was reported at 3.7% (2). A similar rate has been reported in
      case series studies of distal radial access, with success rates ranging from 88.6% to 96.3%
      (4-6). No cases of radial artery occlusion, hematoma, or hand paresthesia were reported in
      any of these series. Given the promising results with the distal radial approach, its use has
      expanded to many cardiac catheterization laboratories across the country. However,
      prospective randomized data comparing distal versus the conventional proximal radial arterial
      access sites is warranted.

      Therefore, the aim of this study is to compile a prospective observational case series to
      evaluate the safety and feasibility of distal radial artery access in a prospective case
      series. If an acceptable safety profile can be demonstrated, the case series will be followed
      with a randomized controlled trial directly comparing distal to standard proximal radial
      artery approach.

      Specific Aims and study hypothesis:

      The primary aim of the present study is to assess the safety and feasibility of distal radial
      arterial access. The study hypothesis is that distal radial access for coronary angiography
      is associated with similar incidence rates of access site related complications compared to
      complication rates previously reported with the standard proximal radial artery access.
