  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The lymphocele is the main early postoperative complication of axillary clearance for breast
      cancer patients with rates up to 85%.

      The usual treatment consists of external drainage. However, this method increases the
      duration of hospitalization.

      As a result, some practitioners have abandoned drainage, allowing for ambulatory surgery.

      If this solution makes it possible to reduce the duration of the hospitalizations, it
      involves iterative punctures of the axillary hollow in case of lymphocele These punctures may
      be responsible for pain, hematoma or infection of the operative site.

      To date, no method has proved superior in terms of decreasing the incidence of lymphocele
      postoperatively axillary clearance.

      Octreotide (Sandostatin®) is a peptide, one of whose effects is to reduce the inflammation
      responsible for lymphoceles.

      The aim of the study is to inject Sandostatin® before surgery, with the aim of reducing the
      incidence of seroma by 50% after axillary clearance
