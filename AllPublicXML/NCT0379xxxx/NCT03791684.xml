      WHAT WAS KNOWN

      *Standard CXL is the common procedure for treating progressive corneal ectasia. Modifications
      of the standard protocol were introduces to reduce its complications especially long exposure
      to ultraviolet rays. The Accelerated protocol, while believed to overcome this issue with
      comparable outcomes, has not been studied fully in patients with ectasia following corneal
      refractive surgery and penetrating keratoplasty.

      WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS Accelerated CXL is as safe and effective as the Standard CXL in halting
      the progression of ectasia post refractive surgery and penetrating keratoplasty with the
      benefit of: reduced ultraviolet exposure, reduced operation time, and reduced patient
      discomfort.

      Purpose:

      The aim of this study is to compare the clinical outcomes of the Standard CXL and the AC CXL
      in patients with progressive corneal ectasia post refractive surgery and penetrating
      keratoplasty.

      Setting:

      Menoufia University Hospital, Egypt

      Design:

      Prospective, randomised comparison.

      Methods:

      Patients scheduled to receive either Standard CXL (3mW/cm2 for a period of 30 min) or
      Accelerated CXL (18mW/cm2 for a period of 5 min).The main outcomes for comparison were the
      change in; Maximum-K reading (K-max), manifest refractive spherical equivalent (SE), central
      corneal thickness (CCT), and the best corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA).
