    <textblock>
      To evaluate the clinical effectiveness of a virtual reality psychological preparation app at
      reducing peri-operative anxiety and its associated sequelae in children aged 3-12 years old
      undergoing ambulatory surgery compared to standard care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase III multi-centre randomised controlled trial evaluating the effectiveness of
      the Little Journey app: a pre-hospital psychological preparation tool designed for children
      undergoing ambulatory surgery.

      Children presenting to the Preoperative assessment clinic before their operation will be
      screened for recruitment to the trial. Those meeting the inclusion criteria will be recruited
      to participate in the trial before randomisation into either a standard practice arm or
      intervention arm. Consent will be provided by parents / guardians and assent by children aged
      7-12 years old.

      Children assigned to the intervention arm will be provided with a virtual reality google
      cardboard headset and access code for the Little Journey app which they can use as many times
      as they wish before their operation. They will also receive the standard pre-operative
      preparation and care as per the recruiting site. In comparison, the standard care arm will
      receive a google cardboard virtual reality headset with suggestions of free virtual apps to
      use and standard pre-operative preparation and care - as defined by each participating site.

      Children's anxiety will be assessed at multiple time points along the surgical journey,
      ranging from the preoperative assessment clinic, ward and finally in the anaesthetic room
      during the induction of anaesthesia. Secondary outcome measures such as parent anxiety
      levels, post-hospital behavioural changes, need for rescue analgesia and antiemetics in the
      recovery room will be recorded.

      Children's anxiety scores in those assigned to the intervention arm will undergo a further
      analysis assessing the impact of frequency and timing of Little Journey app use before
      surgery.

    <description>An independent and blinded observer completed observational scoring tool. Children are scored in four categories: Activity, vocalisations, emotional expressivity and state of apparent arousal, according to pre-determined Likert scale observations. Each category score is divided by its highest possible score, before being added together; these scores are then divided by four and multiplied by 100, giving a value between 22.92 to 100. Higher values indicate greater anxiety levels, with scores greater than 30 typically representing clinically significant anxiety.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive standard of care from the pre-assessment clinic until discharge.
A typical preparatory National Health Service pathway would include: meeting a specialist nurse in the preoperative assessment clinic; a preoperative anaesthetic and surgical consultation; interaction with health play specialists on the day of surgery; and distraction interventions such as hand-held tablets during induction of anaesthesia. Participants may have inhalation or intravenous induction depending on the primary management plan of the anaesthetist in charge.
Participants in the standard care arm will also receive a virtual reality cardboard headset, which can be taken home, personalised and decorated before use with virtual reality apps available to download from the app stores.</description>

    <description>Participants allocated to the intervention arm will receive the same peri-operative management as the standard care arm and will also receive an access code enabling them to use the Little Journey app in the weeks leading up to their operation. We suggest the Little Journey app is used in the days to weeks leading up to the child's operation depending on their age. On downloading the app, if parents/carers insert the age of the child and date of surgery into the Little Journey app they will be sent a push notifications reminding them when to use it according to their child's age. However, it can be used as frequently as the child and/or their parents or carers wish before the operation.</description>

    <description>The Little Journey app allows children to explore 360-degree hospital environments familiarising and desensitising them to areas and staff they'll see on the day of surgery. Children can &quot;visit&quot; the day case ward, anaesthetic and recovery rooms where their operation will occur -all while feeling safe in their own home. As the child explores the three areas, they are introduced to animated characters of staff who explain what will happen, the equipment that will be used and how they might feel. Using head tracking technology, the child triggers the animated characters by looking at them; meaning they control the pace of learning and speed at which they progress. The preparatory tool follows a pre-set story-line reflecting what happens from admission to discharge on the day of surgery.</description>
