  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 70-80% of patients with advanced disease will be affected by moderate to severe
      pain. Opioid analgesics represented by morphine and oxycodone are the cornerstone of
      cancer-pain management, and recommended for use in the management of moderate to severe
      cancer pain according to WHO Cancer Pain Relief Guidelines. One view is that a trial of
      systemic opioid therapy should be administered to all cancer patients with pain of moderate
      or greater severity regardless of the pain mechanism. Although opioids analgesics do work
      well as relieving pain and improving quality of life via their action at opioid receptors in
      the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system, they also have powerful
      adverse effects. The overall occurrence of opioid-related adverse drug events has ranged
      from1.8% to 13.6%. Opioid-induced constipation (OIC), one of the most prevalent adverse
      events (AEs) in patients receiving opioid analgesics, defined as a change in baseline bowel
      habits or defecatory patterns following initiation, alteration, or increase in opioid
      therapy. The prevalence of OIC has been estimated to affect 41% of patients with chronic
      noncancer pain taking opioids and 94% of cancer patients taking opioids for pain. Unlike many
      other opioid-related AEs, OIC is persistent and rarely tolerated. OIC impacts pain control,
      patients' quality of life and may cause patients to reduce the dose or discontinue opioid
      use.

      Acupuncture, a traditional Chinese medicine, has been used to treat gastrointestinal disease
      including constipation for thousands of years. Two systematic reviews concluded that
      acupuncture can improve spontaneous bowel movements for functional constipation, and our
      recent study indicated that electroacupuncture(EA) could increase complete spontaneous bowel
      movements and is safe for chronic severe functional constipation. Acupuncture could improve
      gastrointestinal function via facilitating gastrointestinal motility. Currently, there is
      little detailed information available regarding the acupuncture use for OIC. The objective of
      this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of EA for OIC in patients with cancer.
