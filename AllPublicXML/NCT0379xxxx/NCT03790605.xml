    <textblock>
      The study will follow a parallel arm, randomised, double blinded, placebo controlled design.

      There will be two groups Group 1 = receiving 1% curcumin chips after routine scaling and root
      planing (n=20) Group 2 = receiving placebo chips after routine scaling and root planing
      (n=20) Clinical parameters: ( Baseline, 4 weeks, 12 weeks) Probing pocket depth, clinical
      attachment level, gingival index, plaque index Cytokine parameter ( Baseline, 4 weeks)
      Interleukin 1 beta in GCF

      Statistical analysis Repeated measures of ANOVA Paired t-tests
