  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this pilot study is to test the Mindful Recovery OBOT Care Continuum (M-ROCC)
      model in primary care office-based opioid treatment (OBOT). M-ROCC features integration of
      evidence-based mindfulness training with weekly group-based opioid treatment. Primary
      outcomes include (1) Feasibility measured by implementation of the curriculum into two CHA
      primary care sites and attendance at weekly sessions; (2) Acceptance via self-report and
      qualitative interviews. Secondary outcomes include anxiety reduction.

      The primary objective of this study is to conduct a single-arm pilot study in order to refine
      a Mindfulness-Based Intervention for the Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) treatment in primary care,
      called the Mindful Recovery OUD Care Continuum (M-ROCC). Study investigators will conduct
      qualitative interviews, assess opioid use, preliminary pre/post measures for participants
      participating in the pilot study. Additional aims of the pilot study is manual refinement and
      pilot testing assessment batteries to prepare for a multi-site RCT.

      The study will focus on demonstrating feasibility and acceptability of the M-ROCC continuum.

    <measure>Anxiety PROMIS-SF 8a</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System - Anxiety Short Form 8a (PROMIS-ASF) is an 8-item scale used to assess patient-reported health status for anxiety. PROMIS instruments are funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and used to reliably and validly measure patient-reported outcomes for clinical research and practice. Subjects are asked to rate their experience of the item in the past seven days on a 5-point scale from 1 (Never) to 5 (Always). With use of the PROMIS Assessment Center Scoring Service, a T score is generated from subject responses. A sample item includes &quot;My worries overwhelmed me.&quot;</description>

    <description>Number of 2-week time periods with no self-reported illicit opioid use and biochemically-confirmed abstinence from illicit opioid use during a 24-week period.

    <measure>PROMIS-SF 8a (PROMIS-ASF) Pain Interference</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The PROMIS Pain Interference instruments measure the self-reported consequences of pain on relevant aspects of one's life. This includes the extent to which pain hinders engagement with social, cognitive, emotional, physical, and recreational activities. Pain Interference also incorporates items probing sleep and enjoyment in life, though the item bank only contains one sleep item. The Pain Interference short form is universal rather than disease-specific. It assesses pain interference over the past seven days. each question has five response options ranging in value from one to five (for pediatrics and parent proxy it is 0 to 4). To find the total raw score for a short form with all questions answered, sum the values of the response to each question. For example, for the adult 6-item form, the lowest possible raw score is 6; the highest possible raw score is 30. A higher PROMIS T-score represents higher consequences of pain.</description>

The scale assess 6 aspects of emotional dysregulation: non-acceptance of emotional responses (&quot;When I'm upset, I become embarrassed for feeling that way&quot;), difficulties engaging in goal directed behavior (&quot;When I'm upset, I have difficulty thinking about anything else&quot;), impulse control difficulties (&quot;When I'm upset, I lose control over my behaviors&quot;), lack of emotional awareness (&quot;When I'm upset, I take time to figure out what I'm really feeling (reverse-scored)&quot;, limited access to emotion regulation strategies (&quot;When I'm upset, it takes me a long time to feel better&quot;), and lack of emotional clarity (&quot;I have no idea how I am feeling&quot;). Answers are selected from a 1-5 Likert scale. Total score is sum of each subscale. Subscales are scored by summing individual subscale items. Total score ranges from 36 to 180 and subscale scores range from 5 to 40.</description>

    <measure>Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The PSS Scale uses 14 items to measure the degree to which situations in life are stressful. Items are designed to evaluate how overloaded, unpredictable, and uncontrollable one finds one's life. Each item is scored on a 5 point Likert scale from 0 (Never) to 4 (Very often). An example question is, &quot;In the last month, how often have you felt difficulties were piling up so high that you could not overcome them?&quot; Positively stated items are reverse scored before all scale items are summed to yield a total score. Total score ranges from 0 to 56.</description>

The scale is scored on a 5 point Likert scale (1 = Almost never; 5 = Almost always), and negative subscale items are reverse scored. Total score is calculated by taking the mean of all scores and ranges from 1 to 5.</description>

    <description>Mindful Recovery OUD Care Continuum (M-ROCC) builds on other mindfulness interventions for addictive disorders, but is specifically designed with the clinical needs of OUD patients on buprenorphine and logistic needs of primary care OBOT clinicians in mind. It focuses on integration of mindfulness practice for living well through stress, anxiety, depression, pain and addiction recovery. M-ROCC curriculum has three primary components, including a low-dose mindfulness phase, an intensive mindfulness training phase and then ongoing mindful recovery support.</description>
