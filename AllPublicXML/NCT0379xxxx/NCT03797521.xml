    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study
      consisting of a screening period of up to 40 days, a 6 week randomized double-blind treatment
      period, followed by an up to 2 week safety follow-up period after the last dose of study
      medication.

      Patients will be randomized to one of four treatment groups. Patients will participate for a
      total of up to 10 weeks, including screening, the 6-week treatment period and follow-up.
