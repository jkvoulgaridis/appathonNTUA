  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is focused on people with chronic spinal pain. To investigate the impact of sleep
      problems on pain and function, 45 people with chronic spinal pain and comorbid insomnia will
      be compared to 45 people with chronic spinal pain without insomnia.
