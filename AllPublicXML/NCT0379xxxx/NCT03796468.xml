      Stroke represents the fourth leading cause of death in industrialized nations, after heart
      disease, cancer, and chronic lower respiratory disease. Approximately one-quarter of the
      patients suffering a stroke die within one year after the initial event and stroke is a
      leading cause of serious long-term disability. Although mechanical thrombectomy (MT) has
      become the standard of care for acute ischemic stroke with proximal large vessel occlusion
      (LVO) in the anterior circulation, the management of patients harboring proximal occlusion
      but presenting minor-to-mild stroke symptoms, has not yet been determined by these recent
      randomized clinical trials. However, patients with proximal occlusions may present with a low
      NIHSS, a proximal intraarterial occlusion being present in up to 28% when considering
      patients with an NIHSS ≤ 4.

      The evidence of benefit from endovascular therapy (EVT) in large vessel occlusion stroke is
      demonstrated, STAIR IX (Stroke Treatment Academic Industry Roundtable) consensus
      recommendations were developed that outline priorities for future research in EVT.

      Stroke represents the fourth leading cause of death in industrialized nations, after heart
      disease, cancer, and chronic lower respiratory disease. The overall burden of stroke will
      rise dramatically in the next 20 years due to an ageing population. Approximately one-quarter
      of the patients suffering a stroke die within one year after the initial event and stroke is
      a leading cause of serious long-term disability. Although mechanical thrombectomy (MT) has
      become the standard of care for acute ischemic stroke with proximal large vessel occlusion
      (LVO) in the anterior circulation, the management of patients harboring proximal occlusion
      but presenting minor-to-mild stroke symptoms, has not yet been determined by these recent
      randomized clinical trials. However, patients with proximal occlusions may present with a low
      NIHSS10, a proximal intraarterial occlusion being present in up to 28% when considering
      patients with an National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) ≤ 4.

      In observational study, patient with minor or mild stroke symptoms and LVO have a high risk
      of both clinical worsening and bad outcome. The STAIR meeting aims to advance acute stroke
      therapy development through collaboration between academia, industry, and regulatory
      institutions. In pursuit of this goal and building on the available level I evidence of
      benefit from endovascular therapy (EVT) in large vessel occlusion stroke, STAIR IX consensus
      recommendations were developed that outline priorities for future research in EVT.
