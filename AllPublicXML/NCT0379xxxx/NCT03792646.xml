  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nutritional interventions witch stimulate the rate of muscle protein synthesis are relevant
      for the development of therapeutic strategies aimed at attenuating the loss of mass and
      muscle strength related to aging (sarcopenia). To aim of the study is to investigate the
      effect of protein supplementation on body composition, muscle activity, muscle strength and
      plasma concentration of inflammatory biomarkers of elderly with type II diabetic, submitted
      to 12 weeks of resistance training. This is an interventional, controlled, randomized,
      double-blind study. The population of the present study will be composed of 40 men with type
      2 diabetes aged between 70 and 74 years, whose body mass index (BMI) should be between 22 and
      32 kg / m2. It will be composed of patients from the Diabetes Outpatient Clinic of the
      Endocrinology Department at the Medical School of the University of São Paulo. Elderly
      subjects will be randomized into two groups (n = 20) who will undergo resistance training for
      12 weeks, twice a week, and receive protein or placebo supplementation. Exercises will be
      performed for the large muscle groups: pectoral press, paddling, leg-press, extensor chair,
      gastrocnemius plantar flexions and abdominal crunches. Protein supplementation will be
      performed immediately after strength training by ingestion of 20 g of whey protein diluted in
      water. Also, immediately after training the placebo group will receive 20 g of maltodextrin
      diluted in water. All participants will be instructed to ingest 1.0 to 1.2 g of protein / kg
      of body weight per day. 24-hour food recall and food frequency questionnaires will be
      performed throughout the study. The following evaluations (before and after 12 weeks
      training) will be applied: Anthropometric: body mass, height, BMI and hip waist ratio.
      Functional evaluation through isokinetic dynamometry of knee extensors and flexors and a
      maximal repetition (1RM). Evaluation of body composition through Bioimpedance balance.
      Evaluation of food intake will be obtained by means of a 24-hour recall and food frequency
      questionnaire. All the evaluations will performed after 6 months. The training sessions will
      have a frequency of twice a week for 12 weeks. Eight exercises will be performed for the main
      muscle groups. In each exercise, 3 sets will be performed between 8 and 12 repetitions. The
      intensity should be between 7 - 8 and will be monitored according to Subjective Effort
      Perception using a scale of 0 to 10.

    <description>The postural balance assessment (posturography) was performed on the NeuroCom Balance Master® force platform system (NeuroCom International, Inc., Clackamas, Oregon, USA). The parameter measured was the center of gravity (COG) sway velocity while rising. The COG sway velocity documented the degree of control over the COG above the support base during the rising phase and for 5 seconds thereafter. Sway was expressed in degrees per second.</description>
