      A prospective non-interventional single-centre study aimed to evaluate actual adherence of AF
      patients using the validated adherence Scale.

      Primary Study Objective(s) Primary study objective The aim of the present study is to assess
      adherence to therapy and factors associated with adherence in patients with CV disease
      complicated by non-valvular atrial fibrillation requiring OAC treatment within the outpatient
      registry PROFILE (prospective, observational study).

        1. Data collection in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation requiring OAC
           treatment included in the registry

        2. Evaluation of actual patient adherence to OACs

      Secondary Study Objective(s)

        1. Evaluation of potential patient adherence to OACs

        2. Determination of the most significant factors associated with adherence to OACs in
           patients with non-valvular AF

        3. Validation of new original 5-item Questionnaire

        4. Evaluation of doctor's adherence to OAC prescription according to Guidelines (ESC).

      AF patients from ongoing PROFILE registry will be invited to visit the scientific center.

      2 visits with a 6-month interval are expected for each patient as part of routine clinical
      practice and phone contact is scheduled for each patient 1 year from the first visit to the
      scientific center (follow-up period).

    <description>The study consisted of two visits half a year apart (V0, V1) and a phone contact (PC) one year after V0. During V0 all patients were recommended to start therapy with one of the NOACs.
Adherence to therapy was assessed during V1 with the use of the original questionnaire - National society of evidence-based pharmacotherapy (NSEPh) adherence scale.</description>

    <time_frame>Total - 1 year (two timepoints - 6 months (V1) and 1 year (PC)</time_frame>
    <description>Specifically designed 5-item questionnaire was used for assessment of potential adherence to OACs. According to results patients were divided into groups: completely adherent, partially adherent, completely non-adherent to OACs.</description>

    <measure>Proportion of OACs Prescribed by Doctors According to Guidelines</measure>
    <time_frame>Total - 1 year (two timepoints - 6 months (V1) and 1 year (PC)</time_frame>
    <description>Prescription of OACs according to guidelines was considered &quot;positive&quot; if it matched the key points of 2016 ESC Guidelines for the management of atrial fibrillation.
Oral anticoagulation therapy to prevent thromboembolism is recommended for all male AF patients with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 2 or more.
Oral anticoagulation therapy to prevent thromboembolism is recommended in all female AF patients with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 3 or more.
Antiplatelet monotherapy is not recommended for stroke prevention in AF patients, regardless of stroke risk.
NOACs (apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban) are not recommended in patients with mechanical heart valves (Level of evidence B) or moderate-to-severe mitral stenosis (Level of evidence C).
In male or female AF patients without additional stroke risk factors, anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy is not recommended for stroke prevention.</description>
