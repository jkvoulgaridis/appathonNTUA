  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Magnetic anastomosis has been attempted in biliary and intestinal reconstruction. Based on
      our initial experience, the investigators have successfully utilized magnetic anastomosis for
      biliojejunostomy and pancreaticojejunostomy during pancreaticoduodenectomy. The current study
      was to design a prospective and case-control study with utilization of magnetic compression
      anastomosis for pancreaticojejunostomy and biliojejunostomy in Whipple's procedure versus
      traditional hand-sewn technique on the postoperative morbidity, such as biliary/pancreatic
      fistula, hemorrhage, anastomotic stenosis, etc. In addition, the investigators are seeking to
      assess the safety and formation of the anastomosis by magnetic technique.

      The magnets used in the current study consists of a mother and daughter magnets. An 8-Fr
      nasogastric tube is tightly fixed with the mother magnet, which will be used for bile or
      pancreatic drainage before formation of anastomoses. The outside diameter (OD) of the magnets
      ranges from 5mm to 15mm. In fact, for biliojejunostomy, larger magnets are applied, whereas
      for pancreaticojejunostomy, smaller magnets are routinely used. This study is a
      single-center, parallel controlled trial to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of magnetic
      compression technique for biliojejunostomy and pancreaticojejunostomy, versus traditional
      hand-sewn techniques on the postoperative morbidity of the patients. And also how to avoid
      mutual attraction of the two pairs of magnets, formation of bilio-/pancreaticojejunostomy
      time, discharge rule of the magnets will be all evaluated in the current study.
