      This phase III trial studies whether pembrolizumab alone as a first-line treatment, followed
      by pemetrexed and carboplatin with or without pembrolizumab after disease progression is
      superior to induction with pembrolizumab, pemetrexed and carboplatin followed by
      pembrolizumab and pemetrexed maintenance in treating patients with stage IV non-squamous
      non-small cell lung cancer. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab,
      may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of
      tumor cells to grow and spread. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as pemetrexed and
      carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the
      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. It is not yet
      known whether giving first-line pembrolizumab followed by pemetrexed and carboplatin with or
      without pembrolizumab works better in treating patients with non-squamous non-small cell
      cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate overall survival (OS) in each of the 2 experimental arms (Arms A and B) to
      control (Arm C).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate progression-free survival (PFS) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
      Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 for Arm C versus each of Arms A and B.

      II. To evaluate best objective response rates per RECIST 1.1 for Arm C versus each of Arms A
      and B.

      III. To estimate toxicity within each of the treatment arms via the Common Terminology
      Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) criteria.

      IV. To compare outcomes between Arms A and B. V. To compare outcomes by treatment arm within
      subgroups defined by a cutpoint of PD-L1 expression at &gt;= 50%.

      BIOMARKER OBJECTIVE:

      I. To collect and bank tissue and blood for future research studies, including potential
      development of a prognostic and predictive signature for MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) in
      combination with chemotherapy versus MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) alone.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Cycles
      repeat every 21 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Within 6 weeks of disease progression, patients receive pemetrexed IV over 10
      minutes and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up
      to 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then may
      receive pemetrexed IV over 10 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM B: Patients receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat every 21
      days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Within
      6 weeks of disease progression, patients receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes, pemetrexed
      IV over 10 minutes, and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21
      days for up to 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients then receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes and pemetrexed IV over 10 minutes on
      day 1. Cycles repeat every 21 days for up to 2 years for pembrolizumab in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity and until to disease progression for pemetrexed.

      ARM C: Patients receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes, pemetrexed IV over 10 minutes, and
      carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 4 cycles
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then receive
      pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes and pemetrexed IV over 10 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat
      every 21 days for up to 2 years for pembrolizumab in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity and until to disease progression for pemetrexed.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 5 years.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed stage IV non-squamous
             non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (includes M1a, M1b, and M1c stage disease, American
             Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC] 8th edition). Patients with Stage IIIB and IIIC
             disease are eligible if they are not candidates for combined chemotherapy and
             radiation

          -  Patients must have PD-L1 expression Tumor Proportion Score (TPS) &gt;= 1% in tumor cells.
             If PD-L1 expression TPS is unevaluable or the testing could not be completed, the
             patients are not eligible. The assay must have been performed by a Clinical Laboratory
             Improvement Act (CLIA) (or equivalent) certified laboratory

          -  Patients must have measurable or non-measurable disease. The presence of malignant
             pleural fluid alone is sufficient to satisfy this eligibility criterion. Baseline
             imaging assessments and measurements used to evaluate all measurable or non-measurable
             sites of disease must be done within 4 weeks prior to study registration

               -  NOTE: If patient receives pemetrexed, follow institutional guidelines to drain
                  fluids

          -  Patients must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of
             0 to 1

          -  Patients must NOT have received the following:

               -  Prior systemic chemotherapy or immunotherapy for advanced metastatic NSCLC.
                  Patients treated with any prior checkpoint inhibitors for metastatic lung cancer
                  are ineligible. Chemotherapy for non-metastatic disease (e.g. adjuvant therapy)
                  or immunotherapy for locally advanced Stage III disease is allowed if at least 6
                  months have elapsed between the last dose of the prior therapy and study
                  registration. Local therapy, e.g. palliative radiation, is allowed as long as a
                  period of 14 days has passed between completion of local therapy and study
                  registration. Registration prior to treatment during the 14 days is allowed.
                  Palliative radiation must be to non-target lesions

               -  Methotrexate (MTX) given in low doses for non-malignant conditions with last dose
                  at least 14 days prior to date of registration will be allowed. Other low dose
                  chemotherapeutics for non-malignant conditions will be considered, but review by
                  the study chair is required

          -  Patients with known EGFR mutations (except exon 20 insertion), BRAF mutations (V600)
             or ALK or ROS1 translocations that can be treated with oral tyrosine kinase inhibitors
             are excluded

          -  Patients with treated brain metastases are eligible if follow-up brain imaging after
             central nervous system (CNS)-directed therapy shows no evidence of progression. CNS
             progression counts as progression and patients must move on to the next phase after
             CNS treatment. Patients with asymptomatic new (at screening) or progressive brain
             metastases (active brain metastases at screening) or leptomeningeal disease are
             eligible if the treating physician determines that immediate CNS specific treatment is
             not required and is unlikely to be required during the first cycle of therapy

               -  Patients are eligible if off steroids for at least 14 days prior to protocol

               -  Patients with asymptomatic, sub-centimeter brain metastasis who at the discretion
                  of investigators do not need immediate CNS directed therapies are eligible

          -  Patients with prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does
             not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the
             investigational regimen are eligible for this trial

          -  Patients must not have known pre-existing and clinically active interstitial lung
             disease, or a known history of (non infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids, or
             current pneumonitis

          -  Patients must not have significant gastrointestinal disorders with diarrhea as a major
             symptom (e.g. Crohn's disease, malabsorption, etc.)

          -  Patients must not have history of auto-immune condition requiring ongoing or
             intermittent systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e. with use of disease
             modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy
             (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for
             adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic
             treatment

          -  Patients with known history or current symptoms of cardiac disease, or history of
             treatment with cardiotoxic agents, should have a clinical risk assessment of cardiac
             function using the New York Heart Association Functional Classification. To be
             eligible for this trial, patients should be class 2B or better

          -  Patients must not have any other concomitant serious illness or organ system
             dysfunction that in the opinion of the investigator would either compromise patient
             safety or interfere with the evaluation of the safety of the study drug

          -  Patients must not receive any other investigational agents during the course of
             therapy

          -  Women must not be pregnant or breast-feeding due to potential harm to the fetus or
             infant from cytotoxic chemotherapy and the unknown risk of MK-3475 (pembrolizumab).
