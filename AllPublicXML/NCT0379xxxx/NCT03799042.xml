  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Virtual Reality (VR) is a technology that combines virtual technology and real-world
      scenario. In recent years, more and more neuroscience and psychology scientists utilised VR
      technology in their research. In Hong Kong, many of the community-dwelling elders are
      immobile. Long-term homestay may negatively affect the emotional state. Measuring the
      emotional change after administration of VR may prove it as an alternative tool for emotion
      intervention.

      The primary objective is to compare the improvement in the emotional changes between
      intergeneration interaction and the use of VR technology.

      The secondary objective is to evaluate the side effect after using VR technology.

      This is a randomized, open label-controlled trial with a crossover design. The subject will
      be randomized in a ratio of 1:1 into two different intervention groups, the VR group and the
      Intergeneration Interaction group. After 2 weeks of washout period, the VR group will receive
      Intergeneration Interaction and vice versa. The intervention phases last approximately 2
      hours. The change in the emotional state will be assessed using the Positive and Negative
      Affect Scale. Any adverse event that causes by the VR will be recorded using the Simulator
      Sickness Questionnaire(SSQ).

      This trial is the first study in Hong Kong to investigate the change of emotional state after
      the administration of VR technology, targeting community-dwelling elders in Hong Kong.

    <description>Measure the difference in mean score between the two intervention groups. The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) is consist of 20 emotions. Positive Affect Score consists of 10 positive emotions, while Negative Affect Score consists of 10 negative emotions. Positive Affect Score ranges from 10 to 50, a score of 30 indicates a higher level of positive emotion. Negative Affect Score ranges from 10 to 50, a score of 15 indicates a higher level of negative emotion. Total PANAS score is 100, added up by both Positive Affect Score and Negative Affect Score.</description>

    <description>Measure the difference in mean score between the two intervention groups. The Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ) is consist of 16 symptoms. Each symptom includes four level, none (0 marks), slight(1mark), moderate (2 marks) and severe(3). Three subscore are included, Nausea-related subscore (Symptom 1,6,7,8,9,15,16), Oculomotor-related subscore (Symptom 1,2,3,4,5,9,11), and Disorientation-related subscore (5,8,10,11,12,13,14). Adding Nausea subscore, oculomotor subscore, and disorientation subscore and multiply by 3.74. Total score larger than 15 indicated a significant level of adverse reaction.</description>
