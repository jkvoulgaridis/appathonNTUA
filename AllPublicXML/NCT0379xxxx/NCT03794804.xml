    <description>ColdZyme® Mouth Spray. The IP should be applied every second hour up to 6 times, with each time 2 sprays (1 dose) per occasion.
The IP use should start when following conditions have been fulfilled:
Answering &quot;Yes&quot; to either of the questions in the subject daily diary: &quot;Do you think/feel you have a cold?&quot; or &quot;Do you think/feel you are coming down with a cold (might be having the first signs of cold)?&quot; AND
A Jackson score of at least 1 in the subject's cold diary (mild = present, but not disturbing or irritating) for any symptom except headache
The IP should be used until 2 days after the subject is symptom free (=answering &quot;No&quot; to the question &quot;Do you think that you are still sick with this respiratory infection?&quot; for 2 days in a row), but not longer than 10 days in total.</description>
