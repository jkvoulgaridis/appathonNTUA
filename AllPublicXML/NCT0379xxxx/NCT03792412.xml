  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a growing number of patients undergoing bariatric surgery requiring lifelong
      follow-up. BagEL (Bariatric Patients in Primary Care: Post-operative Nutrition and Lifestyle
      Management) is a survey to evaluate a newly developed structured disease management program
      including nutrition and lifestyle management in primary care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During last decades the prevalence of obesity is growing. Therefore, the number of bariatric
      procedures are also increasing. Frequent complications after surgery are nutritional
      deficiencies (e.g. vitamins, minerals, protein) which require mandatory long-term follow-up.
      So far adequate follow-up programs are only provided in specialized bariatric centers like in
      the outpatient clinic for obesity at the General Hospital of Vienna. These programs are
      focusing on prevention and premature identification of deficiencies.

      Rising numbers of bariatric-surgical procedures pose a challenge for bariatric centres
      because of the accumulating numbers of bariatric patients requesting follow-up at least once
      a year.

      To provide full coverage an appropriate possibility would be to transfer follow up to
      non-specialised facilities including general practitioners and family doctors using a so
      called &quot;pass&quot; providing practical treatment recommendations (necessary follow-up
      appointments, laboratory blood tests, questions regarding nutrition and lifestyle behavior).

      To our best knowledge such a structured post-bariatric care management program in primary
      care does not exist by now. The aim of this study is therefore the evaluation of such a pass.

    <description>Usability of the follow-up passes (intervention and control) will be evaluated in primary care. In a pilot study the usability questionnaire was evaluated.
The patient hands over the follow-up pass together with the questionnaire at each appointment (twice) at the family doctor. A stamped envelope to return the questionnaire is included. Family doctors will be asked to complete a series of actions regarding the content of the follow-up passes. Each action will be rated in a 5 point likert scale. An average score will be calculated for each question.</description>
