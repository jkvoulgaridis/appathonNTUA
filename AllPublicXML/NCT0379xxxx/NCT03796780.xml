  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Consumption of extra-virgin olive oil has beneficial effects on cardiovascular risk factors.
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of extra-virgin olive oil and refined
      olive oil, in adjunct to conventional medical treatment, in improving liver enzymes, plasma
      lipid profile and inflammatory markers in patients with cardiovascular risk factors.

      A randomized placebo controlled clinical trial will be conducted in Rajaie Cardiovascular
      Center in Tehran, Iran. After review of the inclusion and exclusion criteria and explanation
      of the design of the study, written consent form will be completed. The participants are 40
      eligible patients, aged 20-75 years. Intervention group will be received 25 mL/d extra-virgin
      olive oil and control group will be received 25 mL/d refined olive oil for 6 weeks. Fasting
      blood sample will be taken to measure lipid profile, liver enzymes and inflammatory markers
      (Interleukine-6 [IL-6] and Interleukine-10 [IL-10] and C-Reactive Protein [CRP]).
