  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The increasing use of FET emphasizes the importance of preparing and timing the endometrium
      in FET cycles, however there is no consensus on luteal phase progesterone supplementation in
      mNC-FET and the optimal day of blastocyst warming and transfer. The aim of this multicenter
      RCT is to assess the effect of progesterone supplementation in hCG-triggered mNC-FET and the
      effect of embryo thawing and transfer at hCG+6 or hCG+7 days, respectively. In total 604
      patients will be included with n=151 in each of the four study arms. The primary outcome is
      live birth rate per transfer (LBR) and the goal is to show a 10% increase in LBR after
      progesterone supplementation and to assess whether blastocyst warming+transfer 6 days after
      hCG trigger is superior to 7 days after hCG trigger in mNC-FET.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Single embryo transfer and freezing of surplus embryos has lowered twin birth rates after in
      vitro fertilization (IVF) to a level of less than 5% in Denmark. However, several treatments
      with repeated frozen embryo transfers (FET) before a viable pregnancy is confirmed are
      burdensome to the patients. New freezing techniques has optimized the quality of the embryo
      transferred in FET cycles, but optimization of the endometrium in the luteal phase is still
      lacking behind. In a mNC-FET, which is the routine in many clinics, ovulation is induced with
      an hCG injection when the leading follicle is ≥17 mm. The hCG trigger is important for
      controlling the time of ovulation, but triggering an unhealthy follicle at an inappropriate
      time may cause luteal phase insufficiency and thus suboptimal function of the endometrium.
      Danish public fertility clinics are not routinely using progesterone supplementation in
      mNC-FET, but there may be a rationale to do so, and some implantations may be rescued. In
      this study we will compare live birth rates in mNC-FET with and without progesterone
      supplementation in the luteal phase, and further we will explore the optimal timing of
      blastocyst warming and transfer by comparing embryo transfer at hCG trigger +6 days versus +7
      days. This is a superiority study with the aim to detect an increase in live birth rates of
      10%. Hence, this adequately powered RCT may make a major contribution to knowledge on mNC-FET
      to the benefits of patients. We will include 604 patients divided 1:1 (302:302) in each arm
      +/- progesterone and these will further be divided 1:1 in blastocyst warming and transfer +6
      and +7 days after hCG injection. The primary endpoint is live birth rate per transfer.

    <intervention_model_description>Randomized, controlled multicenter trial with inclusion of 604 mNC-FET cycles. We will include 604 patients divided 1:1 (302:302) in each arm +/- progesterone supplementation and these will further be divided 1:1 in blastocyst warming and transfer +6 and +7 days after hCG injection. Patients randomised to progesterone supplementation will start administering medicine four days after the ovulation trigger up til the day of the pregnancy test. If the pregnancy test is positive, medication will continue for 30 days more.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>The study is a single blinded study; therefore, the study medication will be blinded for the treating doctors, but not for the patients, the non-treating doctors or the study nurses. Patients will only be seen by a treating doctor at the day of blastocyst transfer and at the day of the pregnancy scan. The participants will not take progesterone the morning of the blastocyst transfer, but immediately after to keep the treating doctors blinded. Patients will be instructed in not disclosing their study group to the treating doctor.</masking_description>
