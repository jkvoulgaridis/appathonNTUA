  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study explores the utility of a tablet computer-based, individually-tailored application
      called Computer Intervention Authoring Software (CIAS) in the Emergency Department for
      discharge education on proper child car restraint safety. The investigators hypothesize that
      tablet-based, individually-tailored discharge instructions are more effective than current
      standard, one-size-fits-all, printed discharge instructions. This is a randomized,
      controlled, non-blinded trial of of children age 0-21 years old in the Emergency Department.
      Patients will be randomized to receive either (a) a brief tablet-based questionnaire followed
      by standard, paper discharge instructions or (b) a brief tablet-based questionnaire followed
      by the intervention - CIAS, a tablet-based computer program. One week after discharge,
      participants in both groups will receive an automatic text message and/or email message with
      a link to a web-based survey that will assess: knowledge of appropriate car restraints and
      whether the parent/patient engaged in any behavioral changes regarding child car restraint.
      These variables will be compared between the control and intervention groups.

      This study explores the utility of a tablet computer-based, individually-tailored technology
      called Computer Intervention Authoring Software (CIAS) in the Emergency Department for
      discharge education on proper child car restraint safety. The investigators hypothesize that
      tablet-based, individually-tailored discharge instructions are more effective than current
      standard, one-size-fits-all, printed discharge instructions. This is a randomized,
      controlled, non-blinded trial of a convenience sample of 200 children age 0-21 years old who
      present to the Hasbro Children's Hospital Emergency Department by car and have access to a
      smartphone and/or email. Patients will be randomized to receive either (a) a brief
      tablet-based questionnaire followed by standard, paper discharge instructions or (b) a brief
      tablet-based questionnaire followed by the intervention - CIAS, a computer program that
      allows families to interact with a tablet computer to receive educational information
      customized to the patient. Children 13 years old and above will answer questions themselves
      instead of having their parent/guardian answer for them. Both group will be offered
      information for the Lifespan Injury Prevention Center's Kohl's Car Seat Program. Both groups
      will complete a questionnaire on the usefulness of their discharge education. One week after
      discharge, participants in both groups will receive an automatic text message and/or email
      message with a link to a web-based survey that will assess: knowledge of appropriate car
      restraints and whether the parent/patient engaged in any behavioral changes regarding child
      car restraint. These variables will be compared between the control and intervention groups.

    <description>This is a digital application that allows families to interact with a tablet computer to receive educational information customized to the patient's age and size. allows authors to develop screening, assessment, and intervention tools for patients without requiring new programming. The CIAS intervention is programmed using tailored branching logic to allow a custom path through the intervention based on the respondent's answers. Delivery of the intervention uses a two-dimensional avatar narrator character that mimics the conversational structure of person-delivered brief interventions.</description>
