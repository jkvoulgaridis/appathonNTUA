  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will conduct the development and preliminary evaluation of Cognitive Bias
      Modification for Interpretation (CBM-I) and Approach Avoidance Training (AAT) as
      augmentations to treatment as usual for OCD and related disorders. CBM-I refers to
      computerized interventions designed to directly manipulate interpretation bias through
      repeated practice on a training task, thereby inducing cognitive changes in a relatively
      automatic or implicit manner. In AAT, automatic approach tendencies toward feared stimuli are
      re-trained. Specifically, this study will examine the feasibility, acceptability, and
      clinical outcomes associated with CBM-I and AAT.

      Adults with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and related disorders will be recruited from
      a treatment program for these disorders and participants will be randomly assigned to either
      receive: 1) eight sessions of CBM-I or eight sessions of psychoeducation as a control
      condition, or 2) AAT or eight sessions of an inactive (sham) version of the AAT training.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Behavioral Approach Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 0, 2, and 4</time_frame>
    <description>Behavioral Approach Test (BAT) will be administered as a measure of OCD-related avoidance, based on previously validated procedures (Cougle et al., 2007; Amir, Kuckertz, &amp; Najmi, 2013). Participants rate peak anxiety 0-100 for each step of approaching feared stimuli.
Three different types of BAT will be implemented in order to measure avoidance with multiple types of contaminants, each with six steps on a hierarchy to be completed sequentially, providing a rating of anxiety 0-100 for each step.</description>

    <measure>Change in Average Score on Behavioral Inhibition/Behavioral Activation Scales</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 0, 2, 4, and 8</time_frame>
    <description>24-item measure of behavioral approach and behavioral avoidance, rated 1-4 and summed.</description>

    <measure>Dimensional Obsessive-Compulsive Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 0, 2, 4, and 8</time_frame>
    <description>(DOCS; Abramowitz et al., 2010) participants with contamination fears will be identified by their DOCS contamination subscale score; the DOCS is part of the admission measures in the OCD Institute's main study protocol. Additionally, we will examine these scores as an outcome measure for contamination-related obsessions and compulsions. It includes 20 items and is rated 0-4.</description>

    <intervention_name>Cognitive bias modification for interpretation bias</intervention_name>
    <description>Eight sessions of scenario-based CBM-I training for OCD will be administered, based on the widely-used paradigm of ambiguous scenario training developed by Mathews and Mackintosh (2000), in which participants are presented with scenarios that are ambiguous in whether or not they are threatening. Participants will complete a computer task consisting of a series of written scenarios designed to improve interpretation and attributional biases; these scenarios conclude with word fragments, which participants must fill in to resolve the ambiguity.</description>

    <intervention_name>Approach avoidance training</intervention_name>
    <description>Eight sessions of this computerized training program will be used to train approach tendencies, following previously validated procedures (Najmi, Kuckertz, &amp; Amir, 2010). During the training program, participants will view a series of these images and be prompted to push or pull a joystick according to prompts on the screen, instead of the content of the picture. Avoidance will be stimulated through both pushing away (images on the screen will decrease in size upon the joystick being pushed), and approach will be stimulated through pulling towards pictures (images will increase in size to simulate approach).</description>
