  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, multi-site, study to evaluate the diagnosis rate of DNA and RNA sequencing of
      cerebrospinal fluid for identification of pathogens directly in patients who have already had
      a spinal tap to evaluate for infection and were found to have a pleocytosis. Diagnostic rate
      and clinical utility of concurrent standard testing will be compared to diagnostic rate and
      clinical utility of DNA and RNA sequencing.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      IDbyDNA, Inc. has developed a robust sequencing reference database for viruses, bacteria,
      fungi and parasites and developed novel analysis methods to analyze next-generation (NGS)
      sequencing data to rapidly identify infectious agents. This technology suite, known as the
      Explify™ platform, holds the promise to improve patient care and efficiently guide provider
      treatment planning for those suffering from infectious disease.

      The PIPSEC trial, developed by pediatric physicians specializing in genomic medicine, is
      intended to facilitate the acquisition of high quality and clinically annotated biospecimens
      for the purpose of research discovery. This project intends to advance metagenomics,
      microbial genetics, bioinformatics and data analytics, for pathogen detection utilizing
      cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) specimens to contribute to the diagnosis of infectious agents
      impacting the central nervous system among pediatric patients. Clinically annotated specimens
      will facilitate continued development and validation of the Explify test and its clinical
      utility for providers treating central nervous system (CNS) infections.

      The primary objective is to assess clinical utility of the Explify test compared to
      concurrent standard of care testing to identify pathogens from CSF fluid within a pediatric
      patient population.

        This project will enroll children who are having an evaluation for central nervous system
        (CNS) infection and have already had a lumbar puncture to obtain cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
        to evaluate for infection and host immune response. As such enrolled patients will be
        undergoing an evaluation for suspected meningitis, encephalitis, ventriculitis and VP shunt
        infection.

        Patients in whom there is CSF remaining after standard testing has been obtained and who
        meet the other inclusion criteria will be approached for enrollment in the study.
