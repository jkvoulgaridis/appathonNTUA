  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, crossover study will include four clinic visits: one screening (day -7) and
      three test visits (days 0, 2, 4). The objective of this study is to assess the effects of
      dietary fiber-containing bars, at two doses of fiber, compared to a control product, on
      postprandial glucose and insulin responses in healthy adult men and women.

          -  Subject has a vein access scale score of 7-10.

          -  Subject understands the study procedures and signs forms documenting informed consent
             to participate in the study and authorization for release of relevant protected health
             information to the study Investigator and is willing to complete study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Individual has a clinically significant gastrointestinal, endocrine (including Type 1

             neurologic, or biliary disorder.

          -  Subject has pre-diabetes (fasting capillary glucose between 100 and 125 mg/dL) at
             screening. One re-test on a separate day will be allowed for subjects with no known
             history of pre-diabetes or diabetes who have a capillary glucose of 100 - 110 mg/dL at
             screening (visit 1).

          -  Individual has uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure ≥160 mm Hg or
             diastolic blood pressure ≥100 mm Hg) at screening.

          -  Individual has a history of cancer in the prior 2 years, except for non-melanoma skin
             cancer.

          -  Individual has extreme dietary habits (e.g., Atkins, vegan).

          -  Individual has had weight change of ±4.5 kg (10 lbs) in the previous 3 months.

          -  Individual has a known allergy, sensitivity, or intolerance to any ingredients in the
             study products.

          -  Individual is a female, who is pregnant, planning to be pregnant during the study
             period, lactating, or is of childbearing potential and is unwilling to commit to the
             use of a medically approved form of contraception throughout the study period.

          -  Individual has been exposed to any non-registered drug product within 30 days of
             screening.

          -  Individual has a condition the Investigator believes would interfere with his or her
             ability to provide informed consent or comply with the study protocol, or which might
             confound the interpretation of the study results or put the person at undue risk.
