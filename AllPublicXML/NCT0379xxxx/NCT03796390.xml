  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open, single-arm, phase I clinical study to evaluate efficacy and safety of
      chimeric antigen receptor T cell immunotherapy (CAR-T) targeting CD123 in the treatment of
      Acute Myelocytic Leukemia. A total of 15 patients are planned to be enrolled following up one
      year.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-modified T cells targeted against CD19 have demonstrated
      unprecedented successes in treating patients with hematopoietic and lymphoid malignancies.
      Besides CD19, many other molecules such as CD22, CD30,BCMA,CD123, etc. may be potential in
      developing the corresponding CAR-T cells to treat patients whose tumors expressing those
      markers. In this study, investigators will evaluate the safety and efficacy of CAR-T
      targeting CD123 in patients with Acute Myelocytic Leukemia. The primary goal is safety
      assessment including cytokine storm response and any other adverse effects. In addition,
      disease status after treatment will also be evaluated.

    <description>Patients will be drawn 50-100 ml blood to obtain enough peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) for CAR-T manufacturing. The T cells will be purified from the PBMC, transduced with CAR lentiviral vector, expanded in vitro and then frozen for future administration. Chemotherapy will then be given. Following tumor burden reassessment, CD123 CAR-T cells will be infused.</description>
