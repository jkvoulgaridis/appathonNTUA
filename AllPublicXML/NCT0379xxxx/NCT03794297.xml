  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the side effects and how well dabrafenib and trametinib work in
      treating patients with Erdheim Chester disease that have BRAF V600 gene mutations. Dabrafenib
      and trametinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for
      cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To study the efficacy and safety of dabrafenib mesylate (dabrafenib) and trametinib
      dimethyl sulfoxide (trametinib) as combination therapy in patients with BRAF V600E positive
      Erdheim Chester disease.

      II. To determine the clinical response rate to dabrafenib and trametinib combination therapy
      in patients with BRAF V600E positive Erdheim Chester disease.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine time response, progression free survival and overall survival. II. To assess
      disease resistance to this combination therapy.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To monitor the degree of histiocytic infiltration-fibrosis progression, stability and
      regression under combination therapy using fludeoxyglucose F 18 (FDG)-positron emission
      tomography (PET) scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, computed tomography (CT) scans
      and technetium (T)-99m bone scans.

      II. To monitor serum C-reactive protein (CRP), estrogen receptor (ESR), and cytokine levels
      as inflammatory markers prior to and during combination therapy.

      III. To monitor renal function prior to and during combination therapy in order to assess for
      functional improvement.

      IV. To evaluate the level of functioning, fatigue, motor skills and ability to perform
      routine daily activities prior to and during therapy in order to assess for improvements in
      these areas as well as quality of life improvement.

      V. To establish duration of treatment-endpoints in patients with BRAF V600E positive
      Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD) lesions.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive dabrafenib mesylate orally (PO) twice daily (BID) and trametinib dimethyl
      sulfoxide PO once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12
      cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 48 weeks.

             protocol #11-HG-0207, &quot;Clinical and Basic Investigations into Erdheim Chester
             disease&quot;. Eligible patients must have been diagnosed with Erdheim Chester disease,
             confirmed by pathological evaluation of the affected tissue with adequate staining.

             Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1

          -  Prior treatment, involving interferon, anakinra, imatinib, steroids, chemotherapy
             with, but not limited to cladribine, vinblastine, 6-mercaptopurine and etoposide, or
             other medications used empirically for the treatment of ECD, will be acceptable. These
             therapies should have been completed and discontinued 4 weeks or for biologic agents 4
             weeks or 5 half-lives (whichever comes shorter) prior to enrollment in this study

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =&lt; 2 (Karnofsky &gt;= 60%)

               -  Exception will be made for patients with ECOG performance status =&lt; 3 and
                  Karnofsky performance scale &gt;= 50%, who require the use of wheelchairs, walkers
                  or canes as well as assistance with daily routines secondary to disabilities
                  caused by ECD cerebellar or brain disease that has been stable for &gt;= 3 months

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 3 months

          -  Able to swallow and retain oral medication and must not have any clinically
             significant gastrointestinal abnormalities that may alter absorption such as
             malabsorption syndrome or major resection of the stomach or bowels

          -  Patients must have BRAF V600 mutation in the tumor tissue and/or cell-free
             deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), identified by a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act
             (CLIA)-certified lab

          -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= 1.0 x 10^9/L

          -  Hemoglobin &gt;= 8 g/dL

          -  Platelets &gt;= 75 x 10^9/L

          -  Serum bilirubin =&lt; 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) except subjects
             with known Gilbert's syndrome

             echocardiogram (ECHO)

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 14
             days prior to registration or randomization

          -  Pregnancy and breast feeding. The effects of dabrafenib and trametinib on the
             developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason women of child-bearing potential
             must agree to use adequate contraception (barrier method of birth control, or
             abstinence; hormonal contraception is not allowed due to drug-drug interactions which
             can render hormonal contraceptives ineffective) for the duration of study
             participation, and for at least 2 weeks after treatment with dabrafenib or for 4
             months after dabrafenib in combination with trametinib. Should a woman become pregnant
             or suspect she is pregnant while she is participating in this study, she should inform
             her treating physician immediately. Based on studies in animals, it is also known that
             dabrafenib may cause damage to the tissue that makes sperm. This may cause sperm to be
             abnormal in shape and size and could lead to infertility, which may be irreversible.
             Safety and efficacy of the combination of dabrafenib and trametinib in pediatric
             populations have not been investigated. Dabrafenib or trametinib-dabrafenib
             combination should not be administered to pediatric populations outside clinical
             trials

          -  Therapeutic level dosing of warfarin can be used with close monitoring of prothrombin
             time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR) by the site. Exposure may be decreased
             due to enzyme induction when on treatment, thus warfarin dosing may need to be
             adjusted based upon PT/INR. Consequently, when discontinuing dabrafenib, warfarin
             exposure may be increased and thus close monitoring via PT/INR and warfarin dose
             adjustments must be made as clinically appropriate. Prophylactic low dose warfarin may
             be given to maintain central catheter patency

          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients on combination antiretroviral
             therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with

             enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants

          -  History or evidence of cardiovascular risks, except stable ECD cardiac lesion,

          -  Any serious or unstable pre-existing medical conditions (aside from malignancy
             exceptions specified above), psychiatric disorders, or other conditions that could
             interfere with the subject's safety, obtaining informed consent, or compliance with
             study procedures

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because of the potential for teratogenic
             or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with
             dabrafenib/trametinib, breastfeeding should be discontinued prior to treatment with
             dabrafenib/trametinib. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in
             this study

          -  History of retinal vein occlusion (RVO)

             mellitus, or a history of hyperviscosity or hypercoagulability syndromes); or visible
             pathology (e.g., evidence of optic disc cupping, evidence of new visual field defects
