  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and tolerance of human CD19 targeted T Cells injection for the
      treatment of relapsed and refractory CD19-positive B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
      Patients will be given a conditioning chemotherapy regimen of fludarabine and
      cyclophosphamide followed by a single infusion of CD19 CAR+ T cells.

      Participants with relapsed/refractory CD19-positive B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia can
      participate if all eligibility criteria are met. Tests required to determine eligibility
      include disease assessments, a physical exam, electrocardiograph and blood draws.
      Participants receive chemotherapy prior to the infusion of CD19 CAR+ T cells. After the
      infusion, participants will be followed for side effects and effect of CD19 CAR+ T cells.
      Study procedures may be performed while hospitalized.
