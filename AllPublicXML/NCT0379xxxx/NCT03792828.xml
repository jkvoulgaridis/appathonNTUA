  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Korea, the interval between knee arthroplasties is usually 1 week. According to previous
      studies, when total knee arthroplasty was performed at 1-week intervals, total bleeding was
      reduced and the period of hospital stay was shortened.

      However, if stepwise total knee arthroplasty is performed at intervals of one week, the pain
      is greater after the second operation, and the reason for this phenomenon is known to be due
      to central sensitization and opioid resistance.

      Therefore, the investigators aim to confirm whether Duloxetine reduces the central
      sensitization as previously known and affects the pain control after the second operation.

    <textblock>
      Degenerative arthritis of the knee is one of the most common arthritis. Currently, total knee
      arthroplasty is the most commonly used surgical procedure. The degenerative changes of the
      knee are often seen on both sides, and bilateral total knee arthroplasty is usually
      performed. In the past, bilateral total knee arthroplasty was performed at the same time.
      When bilateral total knee arthroplasty was performed simultaneously, the complications such
      as increased mortality occurred. So, it is common to perform bilateral total knee
      arthroplasty in a stepwise manner.

      In Korea, the interval between knee arthroplasties is usually 1 week. According to previous
      studies, when total knee arthroplasty was performed at 1-week intervals, total blood loss was
      reduced and the period of hospital stay was shortened. However, if stepwise total knee
      arthroplasty is performed at intervals of one week, the pain is greater after the second
      operation, and the reason for this phenomenon is known to be due to central sensitization and
      opioid resistance.

      Therefore, the investigators aim to 1) whether the pain is greater than the first operation
      at the second operation in the control group. 2) whether the pre-operative and post-operative
      duloxetine use causes the pre-analgesic effect on the second operation. 3) whether the
      central sensitization, clinical score, and painkiller usage are different by comparing
      duloxetine-treated group and control group.
