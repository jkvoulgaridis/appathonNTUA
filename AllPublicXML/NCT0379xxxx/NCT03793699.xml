  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several studies have demonstrated an association between sleep disorders such as insomnia and
      nightmares to suicidal ideations and behaviors.

      Nevertheless, some of these studies are methodologically questionable especially in the
      exploration of sleep disorders. Furthermore, confounding factors such as depressive
      symptomatology are not controlled and the measurement of suicidal behavior has often been
      taken into account as a historical measure, not as a current event, which introduces
      uncertainties and a lack of precision regarding the temporality of the phenomena.

      Today, while the links between sleep disorders and suicidal risk are well known, we have a
      lack of information on the importance and the role of sleep disorders as a precipitating
      factor. Indeed, few studies have evaluated the temporal link between sleep disorders and
      suicidal acts.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the links between acute and chronic sleep
      disorders and the risk of suicide attempt

      Pilot, prospective, monocentric case-control study.

      There are 2 groups of subjects :

        -  group of patients who have made a suicide attempt

        -  control group with only suicidal ideas

      First visit V1 is performed within the first 72 hours of hospitalization. A re-assessment is
      scheduled 1 month after (V2).

      At V1, collected parameters are : chronic sleep disorders, chronotype, specific sleep
      disorders in posttraumatic stress disorder, nightmares and the distress associated, childhood
      trauma, cognitive dysfunction, suicidal ideation and psychopathologic assessment.

      At V2, we assess evolution of sleep disturbances and suicidal ideation.

    <time_frame>at the 48 hours after the hospitalization; at the maximum within 72 hours.</time_frame>
    <description>ISI score in the last 2 weeks between a group of suicide attempts and a group with suicidal thoughts suicidal The Insomnia Severity Index has seven questions. The seven answers are added up to get a total score.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (visit inclusion) and at one month ago</time_frame>
    <description>Correlation between Beck Suicide Intent Scale (BSIS) score and ISI score The Suicide Intent Scale (SIS) wconsists of 15 questions which are scaled from 0-2, which take into account both the logistics of the suicide attempt as well as the intent. The scale has high reliability and validity. Completed suicides ranked higher in the severity of the logistics than attempted suicides (it was impossible to measure intent for the completed suicides), and those with multiple attempts had higher scores than those who only attempted suicide once</description>

    <measure>Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score</measure>
    <time_frame>at the 48 hours after the hospitalization; at the maximum within 72 hours,at 3 months +/-3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>PSQI score between the groups PSQI is a self-report questionnaire that assesses sleep quality over a 1-month time interval. The measure consists of 19 individual items, creating 7 components that produce one global score, and takes 5-10 minutes to complete.</description>

    <time_frame>at the 48 hours after the hospitalization; at the maximum within 72 hours.</time_frame>
    <description>CTQ score between the groups The Childhood Trauma Questionnaire was developed as a screening tool for histories of abut and neglect. The self-report includes a 28-item test that measures 5 types of maltreatment - emotional, physical, and sexual abuse, and emotional and physical neglect.</description>
