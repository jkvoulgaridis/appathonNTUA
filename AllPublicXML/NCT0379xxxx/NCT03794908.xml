  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect a morning light treatment has on
      improving physical function, pain intensity, and pain sensitivity in people with fibromyalgia
      syndrome (FMS).

    <masking>Double (Participant, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>The outcome assessors and participants will be blinded to condition. The PI and lab manager will remain unblinded, and perform the fidelity and side effects assessments. Participants are asked and reminded throughout the study to only speak about their light treatment with either the PI or lab manager.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire, Revised (FIQ-R) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The FIQR consists of 21 questions. Each question has 11 boxes similar to a visual analog scale. Questions cover the difficulty associated with various physical activities and the severity of symptoms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Heat pain threshold assessed by the heat pain sensitivity test</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Pain threshold will be assessed during a heat pain sensitivity task using a Medoc TSAII NeuroSensory Analyzer and an ascending method of limits protocol.</description>
