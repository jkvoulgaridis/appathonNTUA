  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A Phase 3 clinical trial has been completed and demonstrated the safety and efficacy of
      allogeneic islet transplantation in improving glycemic control in Type 1 diabetic patients
      using the UIC protocol.The objective in offering expanded access to donislecel (allogeneic
      islets of Langerhans for transplant; IND BB-11807) for the treatment of brittle T1D is to
      bridge the gap between completed clinical trials and marketing (i.e. approval by the FDA of a
      biological license application). Expanded access will allow clinical trial subjects, as well
      as patients outside a clinical trial, to receive treatment. New patients participating in the
      expanded access protocol are required to meet exclusion and inclusion criteria.

    <textblock>
      Expanded access to donislecel (allogeneic islets of Langerhans for transplant; IND BB-11807)
      is for the treatment of brittle T1D. Brittle T1D is a distinct subset of T1D, representing
      the most severe and difficult to manage manifestation of the disease. Standard therapies
      (i.e. exogenous insulin injections and insulin pumps) are not sufficient to regulate blood
      glucose levels for this subset of patients. Thus, the severity of disease and the lack of
      metabolic control that occur despite intensive insulin therapy in brittle T1D patients
      defines a patient population whose risk-benefit profile makes them suitable for islet
      transplantation. Eligible patients may receive one or several allogeneic pancreatic islet
      transplants. An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC), composed of 3 members who have
      training in medicine and/or organ transplantation, will review eligibility and safety data
      within 2 weeks after each islet transplantation and every two months thereafter. An
      independent monitor, who is knowledgeable about Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines and
      regulations, monitors the study for compliance with 21 CFR and according to ICH GCP
      Guidelines. The UIC Institutional Review Board (IRB) reviews safety data annually and on
      occurrence of serious adverse events. The principal investigator also reports serious adverse
      events to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Success, partial success, and failure
      criteria will be the same as indicated in the Phase III clinical trial. Patients will be
      closely monitored post-transplant by the UIC clinical team and/or their primary care
      physician for safety and efficacy.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Eligible subjects must have Type 1 diabetes mellitus for more than 5 years,
             complicated by the following situations that persist despite intensive insulin
             management efforts:

          -  At least one episode of severe hypoglycemia in the past 3 years defined as an event
             with symptoms compatible with hypoglycemia in which the subject required the
             assistance of another person, and which was associated with either a blood glucose
             level &lt; 50 mg/dL (2.8 mmol/L) or prompt recovery after oral carbohydrate, intravenous
             glucose, or glucagon administration

          -  Reduced awareness of hypoglycemia, as defined by the absence of adequate autonomic
             symptoms at capillary glucose levels of &lt; 54 mg/dL (3 mmol/L) as reported by the
             subject

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of co-existing cardiac disease characterized by any one of these conditions:

               -  Recent myocardial infarction (within past six months), or

               -  Angiographic evidence of non-correctable coronary artery disease, or

               -  Evidence of ischemia on functional cardiac exam (with a stress echo test
                  recommended

               -  for subjects with a history of ischemic disease).

               -  Heart failure &gt; New York Heart Assoication (NYHA) II

          -  Active alcohol or substance abuse-includes cigarette smoking (must be abstinent for

             Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) definitions.

          -  Psychiatric disorder making the subject not a suitable candidate for transplantation,
             e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or major depression that is unstable or
             uncontrolled on current medication. (A psychological or psychiatric consultation is
             required only if considered necessary by some current indication or history.)

          -  History of non-adherence to prescribed regimens

          -  Active infection including hepatitis C, hepatitis B, HIV

             creatinine clearance is &lt; 80 and serum creatinine is &lt; 1.2 mg/dl, then a nuclear renal
             scan is required to determine gomerular filtration rate.

             re-test. A re-test for any values between normal and 1.5 times normal should be made,
             and if the values remain elevated above normal limits, the subject will be excluded.)
