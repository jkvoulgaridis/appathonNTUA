  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study tests an intervention for tobacco cessation (named B-EPIC) in an established
      community medication assisted treatment (MAT) clinic for pregnant and postpartum women with
      opioid dependence. Half of the participants will receive the intervention for tobacco
      cessation, which is standard cessation counseling from the provider plus additional cessation
      support from a Certified Tobacco Treatment Specialist (CTTS). The other half of participants
      will receive standard tobacco cessation from their provider. The project will also determine
      the economic impact of the B-EPIC intervention on healthcare expenditures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will use a prospective, 2-group, randomized, comparative effectiveness design to
      determine if the B-EPIC tobacco intervention is superior to tobacco 'treatment as usual
      (TAU)' for opioid dependent pregnant women maintained on buprenorphine; the outcomes for the
      first aim will be quitting smoking and/or reducing cigarette consumption during pregnancy.
      The project design also will determine the economic impact the B-EPIC intervention
      (10-months) has on healthcare expenditures.

      After informed consent, eligible participants will be randomized (1:1) to the B-EPIC group
      (tobacco intervention) or TAU tobacco treatment (control group). All will continue to receive
      opioid dependence treatment with buprenorphine, regardless of treatment assignment.

      Women enrolled in the control group are informed of the risks of tobacco use and benefits of
      quitting using the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) 5'A's approach
      by their healthcare provider. This standard tobacco cessation counseling takes approximately
      5-15 minutes, and is offered at each prenatal and postpartum appointment.

      Women enrolled in the intervention group will receive TAU plus B-EPIC, which includes four
      core components: 1) Individualized tobacco treatment plus supplemental counseling, 2)
      Biomarker validation and feedback, 3) Change in maternal thought process and adoption of
      healthy behavior (e.g. exercise, based on PI framework), and 4) Pharmacotherapy as needed.
      The initial assessment for this intervention takes 60 minutes, with follow-up sessions
      typically lasting 15-20 minutes. The intervention will be led by a certified tobacco
      treatment specialist (CTTS).

    <description>Participants will be asked during the second trimester, third trimester, two months postpartum and six months postpartum (up to 50 weeks) to self-report the number of cigarettes smoked per day. Data will be presented as the change in the number of cigarettes smoked per day compared between groups.</description>

    <description>Participants will provide a urine sample to be measured by litmus analysis during the second trimester, third trimester, two months postpartum and six months postpartum (up to 50 weeks). Data will be presented as the change in cotinine levels over the course of the study compared between groups.</description>

    <description>Participants will be asked during the second trimester, third trimester, two months postpartum and six months postpartum (up to 50 weeks) to self-report electronic cigarette (e-cig) usage per day.

    <description>Participants will complete the Fagerstrom Test for Cigarette Dependence during the second trimester, third trimester, two months postpartum and six months postpartum (up to 50 weeks). The survey instrument asks seven questions related to cigarette dependency. Responses will be scored on a scale of zero to 3 and the answer to all questions totaled. Any score greater than 8 is considered high dependency, a score of 5-7 is considered moderately dependent, 3-4 is low to moderate dependence and 1-2 is low dependence. Data will be presented as the change in cigarette dependency over time compared between groups.</description>

    <description>Participants will complete the Penn State Electronic Cigarette Dependence Index (PSECDI) during the second trimester, third trimester, two months postpartum and six months postpartum (up to 50 weeks). The survey instrument asks ten questions and responses are scored on a scale from zero to 20. Summed scores correlate to a dependence category; 0-3 is not dependent, 4-8 is low dependence, 9-12 is medium dependence, and above 12 is high dependence. Data will be presented as the change in electronic cigarette dependency over time compared between groups.</description>

    <description>Women enrolled in the control group are informed of the risks of tobacco use and benefits of quitting using the ACOG 5'A's approach by their healthcare provider. This standard takes approximately 5-15 minutes, and is offered at each prenatal and postpartum appointment. The five steps of the ACOG recommendation are: 1.) Ask about tobacco use, 2.) Advise to quit, 3.) Assess willingness to make a quit attempt, 4.) Assist in quit attempt, and 5.) Arrange follow-up. The provider may also talk to the participant about nicotine replacement therapy.</description>
