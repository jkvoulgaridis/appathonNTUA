  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic respiratory disease (CRD) is among the most prevalent and growing diseases worldwide
      with disabling consequences. Many with a compromised respiratory system cannot support the
      metabolic energy demands of walking causing them to walk slowly and stop often. Those with
      CRD could receive substantial benefit from a powered wearable exoskeleton device that assumes
      part of the energy of walking. Assisting the legs will lower the metabolic energy demands,
      and therefore the ventilation required for exercise, thereby allowing them to walk faster and
      further. Proposed is a series of single-case experiments comparing walking endurance with and
      without a powered exoskeleton assist. The aim of this study is to determine the efficacy of
      an exoskeleton on walking endurance in ventilatory limited patients with CRD. An exoskeleton
      could be a novel immediate and long term strategy to augment walking as part of the spectrum
      of pulmonary rehabilitation and community reintegration.

    <description>A powered exoskeleton describes a wearable robot designed around the shape and function of the human body with segments and joints externally coupled to those of the user. The exoskeleton includes a rigid outer frame, sensors that detect a user's desired movements, a computerized controller, motors and actuators, and lightweight batteries.
The exoskeleton is designed to be worn in the community.</description>
