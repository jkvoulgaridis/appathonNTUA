      This Phase 1 First in Human study is designed to assess the safety, tolerability, and
      pharmacokinetics of single and multiple intravenous doses of SPR206 when administered to
      healthy adult volunteers. This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, ascending
      dose, multi-cohort trial. A total of 104 healthy volunteers will be enrolled in 13 cohorts.
      The study will be conducted in two phases: A single ascending dose (SAD) phase, followed by a
      multiple ascending dose (MAD) phase. In SAD, participants in Cohorts 1 - 8 will receive one
      dose of SPR206 or placebo. In MAD, participants in Cohorts 9 - 12 will receive multiple doses
      of SPR206 or placebo for 7 consecutive days, and a final cohort, Cohort 13, will receive
      multiple doses of SPR206 or placebo for 14 consecutive days at a dose deemed safe and
      tolerable and not to exceed the maximum dose administered to participants in Cohorts 9 - 12.
      In both parts sequential cohorts will be exposed to increasing doses of SPR206.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Healthy adult males and/or females (of non-childbearing potential), 18 to 55 years of
             age (inclusive) at the time of screening.

          2. BMI ≥ 18.5 and ≤ 29.9 (kg/m2) and weight between 55.0 and 100.0 kg (inclusive) for all
             cohorts;

          3. Medically healthy without clinically significant abnormalities at the screening visit
             or Day -1, including:

               1. Physical examination (PE) and vital signs including temperature, pulse,
                  respiratory rate, and blood pressure;

               2. Triplicate electrocardiograms (ECGs) taken at least 1 minute apart with QTcF
                  interval duration less than 450 msec obtained as an average from the triplicate
                  screening and pre-dose Day 1 ECGs after at least 5 min in a semi-supine quiet
                  rest;

               3. Hemoglobin/hematocrit, white blood cell (WBC) count, and platelet count equal to
                  or greater than the lower limit of normal range of the reference laboratory;

               4. Serum creatinine and bilirubin (total and conjugated) equal equal to or less than
                  the upper limit of normal for the reference laboratory. Serum urea, alanine

             Discussion between the PI and the Medical Monitor (MM) is encouraged regarding the
             potential significance of any laboratory value that is outside of the normal range
             during the pre-dose period.

          4. Be non-smokers (including tobacco, e-cigarettes, nicotine patches, or marijuana) for
             at least 1 month prior to participation in the study;

          6. Be willing and able to comply with all study assessments and adhere to the protocol
             schedule;

          7. Have suitable venous access for drug administration and blood sampling;

          8. If female, be of non-childbearing potential (e.g. post-menopausal as demonstrated by
             follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) or surgical sterilization i.e., tubal ligation or
             hysterectomy). Provision of documentation is not required for female sterilization,

             an intrauterine device, diaphragm, oral contraceptives, injectable progesterone,
             subdermal implants, or a tubal ligation). This criterion applies to males (and/or
             female partners) who are surgically sterile and must be followed from the time of
             first study drug administration until 90 days after the final administration of study
             drug.

         10. Are fluent in English such that they are able to understand the informed consent form
