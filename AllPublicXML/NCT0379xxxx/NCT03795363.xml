    <textblock>
      The purpose of this observational research study is to determine the effects of clinically
      prescribed Orkambi treatment on 2 to 5 year old children homozygous for the F508del Mutations
      in the Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene on sleeping energy
      expenditure, growth status and gut health and function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Orkambi is a novel FDA approved (August, 2018) therapy for use in patients with cystic
      fibrosis (CF) who are 2 to 5 years of age and homozygous for F508del mutations in the CFTR
      gene. It is a combination of lumacaftor and ivacaftor that addresses both the processing and
      gating defects of the F508del mutation. This investigator-initiated study is designed to
      evaluate the nutritional, growth and GI impact of Orkambi treatment for this unique younger
      (2 to 5 years) patient cohort. This proposal extends previous highly informative nutrition
      and weight gain investigation of ivacaftor treatment in people with CF gating mutations to
      another CFTR modulator treatment (Orkambi) in people homozygous for F508del mutations. The
      primary aims of the study are to evaluate the impact of 24 weeks of Orkambi treatment in 2 to
      5 year old subjects with CF homozygous for F508del mutations on sleeping or resting energy
      expenditure, growth status and gut health and function in n=32 children ages 2.0 to 5.9 years
      of age. Protocol evaluations will occur at baseline (pre-treatment) and 12 and 24 weeks after
      clinically prescribed Orkambi treatment has begun. Other outcomes of significant clinical
      interest in young subjects with CF will be explored. All subjects will be evaluated as
      outpatient at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, and will be recruited both regionally
      and nationally to ensure timely enrollment.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Sleeping or Resting Energy Expenditure</measure>
    <time_frame>24 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will examine the effects of 24 weeks of orkambi treatment on subject's SEE (sleeping energy expenditure) or REE (resting energy expenditure). Using indirect calorimetry, SEE/REE will be assessed using a computerized metabolic cart Vmax ENCORE at each protocol visit while the child is asleep or resting quietly. SEE/REE will be assessed in the morning if possible and careful note of previous feeding of the child, including the time of day, amount of food, and feeding interval prior to test. It will depend on the age of the subject, and if the subject still takes daily naps and is able to rest quietly without moving, if they will perform sleeping energy expenditure or resting energy expenditure. This will be one outcome measure for each subject, and it will depend on if the subject can nap (SEE) or rest quietly without moving (REE).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Anthropometric Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>24 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will examine the effects of 24 weeks of orkambi treatment on subject's body mass index (BMI). Investigators will compare the results to BMI Z scores over 24 weeks compared to baseline.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fecal Elastase I/Pancreatic Function</measure>
    <time_frame>24 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will examine the effects of 24 weeks of orkambi treatment on subject's pancreatic function. Pancreatic function will be assessed at two visits by obtaining spot stool samples with fecal elastase 1. The concentration of fecal elastase I is indicative of pancreatic function.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fecal Calprotectin/Gut Inflammation</measure>
    <time_frame>24 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will examine the effects of 24 weeks of orkambi treatment on subject's fecal calprotectin concentration. Spot stool samples will be obtained to determine fecal calprotectin concentration, which is a marker for gut inflammation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Plasma Total Fatty Acids</measure>
    <time_frame>24 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will examine the effects of 24 weeks of orkambi treatment on subject's dietary fat absorption. A total plasma fatty acid panel will be assessed to measure the change in status of 22 fatty acids.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Dietary Intake</measure>
    <time_frame>24 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Three day weighed food record will be obtained and to determine changes in dietary caloric intake and micro and macronutrient intake over the course of 24 weeks on orkambi treatment.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Serum fat soluble vitamin levels</measure>
    <time_frame>24 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will examine the changes in serum fat soluble vitamin A, E, D and K concentration levels after 24 weeks of orkambi treatment.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in bile acid concentration levels</measure>
    <time_frame>24 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will examine changes in the concentration levels of 14 bile acid species in subjects over the course of 24 weeks on orkambi treatment.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in concentration levels of serum calprotectin</measure>
    <time_frame>24 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will examine changes in the concentration levels of serum calprotectin in subjects over the course of 24 weeks on orkambi treatment.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Muscle-Fat Stores</measure>
    <time_frame>24 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will measure body composition to determine muscle and fat store changes over the course of 24 weeks on orkambi treatment compared to baseline.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Growth status changes</measure>
    <time_frame>24 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will observe the changes in growth status over time. Growth status will be measured by determining the changes in three different measurements- length (cm), weight (kg) and head circumference (cm). Each value will be used to calculate BMI (kg/cm^2), which will be used in accordance with age to determine the growth velocity percentile of the subjects over the course of 24 weeks on orkambi treatment. The growth velocity percentile will be indicative of changes in growth status over time.</description>

    <description>Orkambi is a novel approved therapy for use in people homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene. It is a combination of lumacaftor (VX-809) and ivacaftor( VX-770) that addresses both the processing and gating defects of the F508del mutation. The small-molecule corrector lumacaftor corrects the F508del processing defect and increases epithelial delivery of CFTR protein1. Ivacaftor is a CFTR potentiator that increases the channel open probability in F508del-mutant CFTRs that undergo epithelial delivery in vitro and has an additive effect with lumacaftor on chloride transport (2,3,4,5).</description>
