  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigator assumed that perturbed-event-induced vibrotactile cueing enable more
      precision arm movement adjustment, sensory function and dexterity improvement in the spastic
      arm. Thus the specific aim of the study was to develop a vibrotactile therapy system that can
      provide vibrotactile feedback through the pinch performance of the hand when countering
      mechanically induced perturbations and also analyzed training effects of the
      perturbation-based pinch task training system on the sensorimotor performance of the hands
      for stroke patients.

    <time_frame>baseline, endpoint (6 weeks) and follow up (18 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Each item is rated on a three-point ordinal scale (2 points for the detail being performed completely, 1 point for the detail being performed partially, and 0 for the detail not being performed). The maximum motor performance score is 66 points for the upper extremity.completely, 1 point for the detail being performed partially, and 0 for the detail not being performed). The maximum motor performance score is 66 points for the upper extremity.</description>

    <description>Muscle tone is defined by the resistance of a muscle being stretched.The tester graded the resistance felt, with a single score. The higher values represent a worse outcome. 0 point for no increase in muscle tone; 1 point for slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch or by minimal resistance at the end of the range of motion (ROM) when the affected part is moved in flexion or extension; 1 + for slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch, followed by minimal resistance throughout the remainder (less than half) of the ROM; 2 point for more marked increase in muscle tone through most of the ROM, but affected parteasily moved, 3 point for considerable increase in muscle tone and passive movement difficult; 4 point for affected part rigid in flexion or extension.</description>

    <description>MAL is a structured interview with testing sensitivity used to examine how much (amount of use, AOU) and how well (quality of movement, QOM) the subject uses their more-affected arm. For the 30 items MAL, each item is scored on a 0-5-ordinal scale.</description>

    <description>The perturbation-based pinch task training was conducted with the affected hand placed on the pinch device. The horizontal vibratory perturbation was generated for a total of 20 minutes by two recoil-type actuators with a frequency of 30 Hz and an amplitude of 2 mm, and intermittent exposure (10 s per 30 s). Each training session was divided into eight cycles with a training interval of 2 min per 2.5 min.</description>
