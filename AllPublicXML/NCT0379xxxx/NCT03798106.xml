      Pazopanib is an angiogenesis inhibitor targeting VEGFR-1, -2, and -3; PDGFR-α and -β; and the
      receptor c-Kit, and is indicated for the treatment of subjects with advanced renal cell
      carcinoma (RCC) and advanced STS. For this orphan tumor, STS, PD-L1 targeting may be a
      promising strategy and favorable toxicity may warrant further combination.

      Pazopanib is an angiogenesis inhibitor targeting VEGFR-1, -2, and -3; PDGFR-α and -β; and the
      receptor c-Kit, and is indicated for the treatment of subjects with advanced renal cell
      carcinoma (RCC) and advanced STS. Pro-angiogenic factors suppress various immune functions
      whereas antiangiogenic agents have potential to modulate the tumor microenvironment and
      improve immunotherapy. An analysis of patients with RCC treated with pazopanib demonstrated
      that elevated expression of PD-L1 correlates with shorter PFS. Investigator also identified
      43% of PD-L1 expression in STS and PD-L1 expression had worse overall survival (5-year
      survival rate: 48% in PD-L1 positive vs. 68% in PD-L1 negative, p=0.015). In detail, PD-L1
      expression was reported 52.6% in synovial sarcoma, 37.6% in rhabdomyosarcoma, and 100% in
      epithelioid sarcoma. For this orphan tumor, STS, PD-L1 targeting may be a promising strategy
      and favorable toxicity may warrant further combination.
