  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a multicenter prospective randomized study of adult patients with an acquired
      skull defect as a result of craniectomy and considered suitable for cranioplasty, i.e.
      reconstruction of the skull defect, at all seven Hong Kong Hospital Authority neurosurgical
      units. Patients that underwent their primary craniectomy operation at any of the Hospital
      Authority neurosurgery centers from the 1st March 2019 and considered suitable for
      cranioplasty will be included in this study. Those who underwent their primary craniectomy
      before 1st March 2019 or at an institution other than the aforementioned neurosurgical units
      will be excluded. Data from clinical records, operation notes, medication-dispensing records,
      laboratory records and radiological reports will be collected.

      30 adult patients with craniectomy will be recruited and randomized into two groups: &quot;early&quot;
      cranioplasty, i.e. performed within 3 months of craniectomy, and &quot;late&quot;, i.e. cranioplasty
      performed more than 3 months after the operation. The aim of the study is to determine
      whether early cranioplasty can improve on patient's cognitive performance compared to those
      who undergo the procedure after 3 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Decompressive craniectomy, a neurosurgical procedure where a portion of the skull calvarium
      is removed, is a life-saving procedure. The complication rate of cranioplasty, a
      neurosurgical procedure where the acquired skull defect is reconstructed, ranges from 11% to
      26% and includes postoperative hemorrhage and infection. (4) The syndrome of the trephined is
      a recognized long-term complication in which certain groups of patients, experience
      debilitating neurocognitive deficits in addition to chronic headache, dizziness, fatigability
      and clinical depression. (2) It is believed that the lack of an overlying bone may cause
      undue significant atmospheric pressure on the underlying cortex, thereby reducing cerebral
      perfusion and cerebrospinal fluid flow. There are reports that cognitive improvement can be
      observed in up to 30% of patients after cranioplasty yet the underlying mechanism for this
      observation is unclear. (1) Some studies have demonstrated enhanced cerebral perfusion by
      non-invasive investigations, but there is a lack of large scale systematically performed
      studies to verify such cerebral hemodynamic effects. (1-3) Clinical equipoise exists
      regarding the optimum timing of cranioplasty procedures after craniectomies. While the
      anecdotal practice of delaying cranioplasty for at least 3 months after a craniectomy is
      common, local and overseas observational studies suggest that performing early cranioplasties
      (i.e. within 3 months) is equally safe in terms of infection and other operative
      complications. (4-6)
