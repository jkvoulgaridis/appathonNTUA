      1. to investigate the feasibility and diagnostic performance of contrast quantitative flow
           ratio (QFR) for identifying the functional significance of intermediate degree stenotic
           lesions in all-comer patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) including presentation
           of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with non-culprit lesion.

        2. to compare the changes of contrast QFR and fractional flow reserve (FFR) according to
           severity of percent diameter stenosis (%DS)

        3. to evaluate prognostic implication of contrast QFR in comparison with FFR

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite potential clinical benefits and abundant evidences of FFR-guided percutaneous
      coronary intervention (PCI), adoption rate of FFR is still low in real world practice, most
      likely due to use of additional resource and to concern about side effects of hyperemic
      agent. Therefore, several tools to derive FFR non-invasively has been developed based on
      computational fluid dynamics to overcome the limitations. One of the novel methods, the
      contrast quantitative flow ratio (QFR) is a computation of FFR based on 3-dimensional
      quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) combined with Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction
      (TIMI) frame counts adjustment without hyperemic agent infusion.

      Although diagnostic performance of contrast QFR for evaluation of functional significance,
      using FFR as reference standard, is well validated in patients with stable ischemic heart
      disease (SIHD), there have been lack of evidence regarding the reliability of QFR for
      non-culprit stenosis in patients with AMI.

      Therefore, the investigators sought to investigate the feasibility and diagnostic performance
      of contrast QFR for identifying the functional significance of coronary stenosis in all-comer
      patients with CAD. In addition, prognostic implication of contrast QFR will be also compared
      with that of FFR.
