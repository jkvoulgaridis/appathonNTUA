  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) is a critical component of advanced prostate cancer
      treatment but causes numerous adverse effects including decreased bone mass, decreased muscle
      mass, gynecomastia, erectile dysfunction, loss of sexual desire, depression, disordered
      sleep, urinary symptoms, and hot flashes (HF). HF are unpleasant paroxysmal episodes of
      flushing, sweating with vasodilation of the face, neck, and chest. These episodes can last
      for seconds to minutes and are often associated with night sweats, anxiety, and insomnia and
      have negative effects on quality of life.

      Stellate ganglion blockade (SGB) with local anesthetic may be an effective treatment of HF in
      men on ADT, but has not been studied in any published clinical trials.

      The stellate ganglion is a neural structure in the anterior cervical spine region and is part
      of the sympathetic nervous system. It has been injected safely in the practice of pain
      management for more than 50 years in cases of post herpetic neuralgia (shingles), complex
      regional pain syndrome (CRPS) and other painful neuropathies as well as some types of cardiac
      dysrhythmias.

      Given the frequency and severity and interference of HF in men on ADT for prostate cancer, in
      addition to the negative effects HF impose on this patient population and a paucity of
      effective treatments, finding alternative treatments for HF in this population is needed.

    <measure>Hot flash severity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The change in hot flash severity (hot flash frequency * hot flash intensity) between baseline and 6 months after the SGB. Hot flash severity is determined using the Mean frequency = ((Fmo+Fse))/7 where Fmi, Fmo and Fse are the weekly total number of mild, moderate or severe/very severe HF events. The Mean severity = (Fmi+2×Fmo+3×Fse)/7 where Fmi, Fmo and Fse are the weekly total number of mild, moderate or severe/very severe HF events In the case of mean severity, frequency of mild VMS is not counted at baseline.</description>

    <measure>Hot Flash Related Daily Interference Scale (HFRDIS) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The change in Hot Flash Related Daily Interference Scale (HFRDIS) between baseline and 6 months following the intervention. Hot Flash Related Daily Interference Scale (HFRDIS)(34) is a validated measure which assesses the impact of hot flashes on overall quality of life as well as on work, social activities, leisure activities, sleep, mood, concentration, relations with others,sexuality, and enjoyment of life. A total of 10 areas are assessed with a 0-10 scale. The maximum score, demonstrating the most severe interference of HF is 100.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>PROMIS SF4a (sleep) Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System.One of the PROMIS measures is a 4-item questionnaire that queries sleep duration, quality, and interruption.This instrument assesses self-reported perceptions of sleep quality, sleep depth, and restoration associated with sleep. This includes perceived difficulties and concerns with getting to sleep or staying asleep, as well as perceptions of the adequacy of and satisfaction with sleep. The 4 items are scored 1-5 where 1 is good quality and 5 is poor quality for a total score range of 4 (good quality) to 20 (poor quality).</description>

    <measure>Patient Global Impression of Change Score (PGIC)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month to 6 months after the SGB</time_frame>
    <description>The PGIC assesses the participants improvement in hot flashes from the time of the SGB. This will be collected at 1, 3, and 6 month time points.
The PGIC queries how much the hot flashes have improved on a scale of 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse).</description>
