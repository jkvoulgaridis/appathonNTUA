    <textblock>
      This is an multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-controlled study to evaluated the
      efficacy of pioglitazone hydrochloride and metformin hydrochloride tablets on the patients
      with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus combined with non-alcoholic fatty liver
      disease.

    <textblock>
      Taking metformin monotherapy as a control, we evaluated the efficacy of pioglitazone
      hydrochloride and metformin hydrochloride tablets on hepatic fat ultrasound and liver enzyme
      levels, and observed whether the drug can improve fatty liver in patients with newly
      diagnosed type 2 diabetes combined with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. This is an
      multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-controlled study.
