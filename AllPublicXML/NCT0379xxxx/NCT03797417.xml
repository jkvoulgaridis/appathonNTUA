  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vitiligo is a chronic depigmenting autoimmune-associated skin disease and a growing
      psychological health concern because of its low quality of life. Genetics, immunology and
      environment triggers contribute to the pathophysiology of vitiligo. Identify and decrease the
      risk factors of vitiligo is very crucial for vitiligo treatment and prevention. Emerging
      evidence has linked gut microbiome to human autoimmune diseases. Here the investigators will
      analyze 10,913 metagenomes in stool samples from 100 adult vitiligo patients and gut
      microbiome associated metabolites in patients serum.

      Vitiligo, an autoimmune disease of the skin, is a commonly acquired chronic depigmenting
      disorder characterized by loss of epidermal melanocytes and progressive depigmentation
      clinically, affecting from 0.5% to 1% of the world population and about 1% in China Vitiligo
      can be a psychologically crushing associated with low quality of life, especially in colored
      skinned individuals. The pathoetiology of vitiligo is multifactorial and has genetic,
      immunological, and environmental components. Several environment-associated mechanisms have
      been implicated to explain melanocyte disappearance, including ultraviolet (UV) radiation
      exposure, repeated mechanical or thermal stress, and exposure to chemicals (especially
      phenols or catechols), but epidemiologic data remain limited.

      Broader gut dysbioses have been identified as potential causes or contributing factors to
      human autoimmune diseases; however, human studies have not yet identified microbial
      compositional or functional triggers that are predictive of skin autoimmunity or vitiligo.
      Metabolites from intestinal microbiota are key determinants of host-microbe mutualism and,
      consequently, the health or disease of the intestinal tract. However, whether such
      host-microbe crosstalk influences inflammation in peripheral tissues, such as the skin, is
      poorly understood.

      The investigators will perform a metagenome association study and serum metabolomics
      profiling in a cohort of vitiligo Chinese individuals.

    <time_frame>2018.10.1--2019.3.1</time_frame>
    <description>Fecal samples are obtained from all recruited subjects for metagenomic sequencing. The individuals have not received any antibiotic treatment for at least one month before sample collection. In the seven days before sample collection, subjects did not take any food containing probiotics such as yogurt. Each sample was either frozen immediately at −80 °C or briefly stored in personal −20 °C freezers before transport to the laboratory within 24 h. After extracting DNA from fecal samoles, gut microbiota sequencing results by using Shotgun Strategy or Meta 16s high-throughput sequencing.</description>

    <time_frame>2018.12.1--2019.3.1</time_frame>
    <description>All serum samples will be thawed on ice and a quality control (QC) sample, made by mixing and blending equal volumes (10 μl) of each serum sample, is used to estimate a mean profile representing all the analytes encountered during analysis. The acquired MS data pretreatments included peak selection and grouping, retention time correction, second peak grouping, and isotopes and adducts annotation, will be performed as previously described56. LC-MS raw data files will be converted into mzXML format and then analyzed by the XCMS and CAMERA toolbox with R statistical language.</description>
