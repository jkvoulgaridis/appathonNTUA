  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The CHARISMA study is a non-randomized, multicenter, prospective study in which consecutive
      patients indicated for arrhythmia will be enrolled.

      Patients can be treated with any market released catheter for ablation and diagnostic
      examination. The decision to perform the ablation will be made based on clinical evaluation
      of the investigators according to their clinical practice. The study does not require
      specific surgical techniques. The study has been designed to describe the Italian clinical
      practice in relation to the ablation approach of different kind of arrhythmias. In
      particular, the investigators will analyze the percentage of acute and long-term success in
      clinical practice, predictors of arrhythmias recurrence and they will describe the methods
      for the validation of ablation success, the techniques adopted, and the patient management
      approaches in the participating centers

    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measure of this study is to estimate, after 12-months from the procedure, the percentage of patients with documented arrhythmia recurrences, recognized with the registration of at least 30 seconds of the same arrhythmias with 24h Holter ECG</description>

    <measure>The percentage of acute procedural success of arrhythmias ablation</measure>
    <time_frame>within 30 minutes after ablation procedure</time_frame>
    <description>This secondary outcome measures the percentage of acute procedural success. The acute success of the arrhythmias ablation is verified by; the completion of the necessary ablation application(s), the validation of ablation through appropriate technique(s) and, when applicable, the termination of the primary arrhythmia.</description>

    <time_frame>36 months</time_frame>
    <description>This secondary outcome measure of this study is to evaluate baseline patient's characteristics as potential predictors of primary arrhythmia recurrences, that will be evaluated at 12 months and 36 months follow up</description>
