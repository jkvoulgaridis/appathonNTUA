  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to partner with the North Carolina Child Treatment Program (NC
      CTP) and the SAMHSA-funded National Child Traumatic Stress Network (NCTSN) to develop and
      pilot the Collaborative Organizational Approach to Selecting and Tailoring Implementation
      Strategies (COAST-IS). The COAST-IS intervention will involve coaching organizational leaders
      and therapists to use Intervention Mapping to select and tailor strategies. Intervention
      Mapping is a multistep process that is inherently ecological and incorporates theory,
      evidence, and stakeholder perspectives to ensure that intervention components effectively
      address key determinants of change. After collaboratively developing COAST-IS in Year 1, the
      investigators will conduct a randomized pilot trial of the intervention within an NC CTP
      learning collaborative, randomly assigning eight organizations to the learning
      collaborative-only condition or the learning collaborative plus COAST-IS condition.
      Participants will include organizational leaders (e.g., CEOs/Directors, Clinical Directors,
      Supervisors) and therapists (e.g., Licensed Clinical Social Workers, Licensed Psychologists,
      Licensed Professional Counselors). The investigators will evaluate COAST-IS in the following
      aims: 1) to assess the acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility, and utility of COAST-IS;
      2) to evaluate organizational stakeholders' fidelity to the core elements of Intervention
      Mapping; and 3) to demonstrate the feasibility of testing COAST-IS in a larger effectiveness
      trial. This work is significant because it will yield a systematic method that integrates
      theory, evidence, and stakeholder perspectives to improve the effectiveness and precision of
      implementation strategies. Ultimately, COAST-IS may have the potential to improve
      implementation and sustainment of a wide-range of EBPs in mental health and other health
      sectors.

    <measure>Organizational Readiness for Implementing Change (ORIC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The 12 items comprising the ORIC measure will be included in an organizational barrier assessment that will be administered to all enrolled participants and will guide implementation support provided through COAST-IS. This measure assesses whether members of an organization, collectively, are (1) committed to implementing a new practice or process and (2) believe that they have the capacity to do so. For these two subscales and the overall ORIC scale, organizations receive scores between 1 and 5 (higher scores are considered more positive).</description>

    <measure>Evidence-based Practice Attitudes Scales (EBPAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The 15 items comprising the EBPAS measure will be included in an organizational barrier assessment that will be administered to all enrolled participants and will guide implementation support provided through COAST-IS. This measure articulates practitioner willingness to adopt new interventions as a function of four factors: (1) appeal of the new intervention, (2) organizational requirements, (3) practitioner openness, and (4) divergence (perceived incompatibility with practice or limited usefulness of research-based interventions). For these four subscales and the overall EBPAS scale, organizations receive scores between 0 and 4 (higher scores are considered more positive).</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Inner Setting of the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire assesses factors related to the inner setting of organizations that are believed to be important in influencing the implementation of interventions. Thirty items from this questionnaire will be included in an organizational barrier assessment that will be administered to all enrolled participants and will guide implementation support provided through COAST-IS. These items measure three factors: (1) culture, (2) learning climate, and (3) available resources. Organizations receive scores between 1 and 5 for each of these factors (higher scores are considered more positive).</description>

    <measure>Scale for Implementation Climate</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The six items comprising this measure will be included in an organizational barrier assessment that will be administered to all enrolled participants and will guide implementation support provided through COAST-IS. This measure assesses whether organizations are primed for implementation via three factors: the extent to which employees believe implementation is (1) expected, (2) supported, and (3) rewarded. For these three subscales and the overall ICS scale, organizations receive scores between 1 and 5 (higher scores are considered more positive).</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Psychological Safety Scale (PSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The seven items comprising the PSS measure will be included in an organizational barrier assessment that will be administered to all enrolled participants and will guide implementation support provided through COAST-IS. This measure assesses how much the environment of a work team makes members feel they can safely engage in learning behavior (e.g., seeking feedback, discussing errors, asking questions, experimenting) without great risk of losing face. Organizations receive a score between 1 and 7 for this scale (higher scores are considered more positive).</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Implementation Leadership Scale (ILS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The 12 items comprising the ILS measure will be included in an organizational barrier assessment that will be administered to all enrolled participants and will guide implementation support provided through COAST-IS. This measure assesses whether leadership is proactive, knowledgeable, supportive, and perseverant based on specific actions leaders take in promoting implementation. For these four subscales and the overall ILS scale, organizations receive scores between 0 and 4 (higher scores are considered more positive).</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Implementation Citizenship Behavior Scale (ICBS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The six items comprising the ICBS measure will be included in an organizational barrier assessment that will be administered to all enrolled participants and will guide implementation support provided through COAST-IS. This measure assesses two critical employee behaviors that go beyond what is required to support the implementation of evidence-based practices: (1) helping their peers with implementation-related activities and (2) keeping informed about issues related to evidence-based practice and implementation efforts. For these two subscales and the overall ICBS scale, organizations receive scores between 0 and 4 (higher scores are considered more positive).</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Prior Experiences with Implementation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire assesses employees' experiences and judgments toward previous innovation implementation, which may affect their implementation behavior regarding future innovations. Sixteen items from this questionnaire will be included in an organizational barrier assessment that will be administered to all enrolled participants and will guide implementation support provided through COAST-IS. These items measure four subscales: (1) perceived intensity of previous innovations, (2) perceived failure of previous innovations, (3) innovation-targeted helplessness, and (4) innovation fatigue. Organizations receive scores between 1 and 5 for each of these subscales (higher scores are considered more negative).</description>
