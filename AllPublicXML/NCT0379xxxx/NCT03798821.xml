  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Determine the efficacy of the investigational product versus placebo in reducing stress
      oxidative during the performance of a physical exercise of a certain intensity and duration.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The effectiveness of a probiotic for oxidative stress after eight weeks of the product to
      study will be checked. the sample will be formed by cyclists that will submit to a baseline
      exercise and after the product is taken.
