  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS) is a communication system for children with
      autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The aim of this study was to assess the effect of a
      PECS-based tooth-brushing program on gingival health in children with ASD and assess parents'
      perception of PECS. This was a prospective interventional study. Using PECS as a
      pictures/cards series showing a structured tooth-brushing method, 37 children with ASD (31
      males, 6 females) (average age 9.49±4.10, 4-16 years) and their parents/caregivers were
      trained on tooth-brushing twice, two weeks apart. Data collected after examinations
      (baseline, 3, 6-months) included gingival and plaque indices (GI, PI) and two questionnaires
      (baseline, 6-months) for demographic data and parents' perception of PECS including:
      difficulty rating (easy, hard, very hard) and PECS usefulness.

      The need for improved oral hygiene routines in individuals with autism spectrum disorders
      (ASD) has been documented in many reports. The Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS),
      which is a series of pictures that show a structured method and technique for teeth brushing,
      was chosen for this study since it is a proven communication system for children with autism
      spectrum disorders (ASD).

      The aim of the study was to assess the effect of a PECS-based tooth-brushing program on
      gingival health in children with ASD and assess parents' perception of PECS.

      This was a prospective interventional study. Using PECS as a pictures/cards series showing a
      structured tooth-brushing method, 37 children with ASD (31 males, 6 females) (average age
      9.49±4.10, 4-16 years) and their parents/caregivers were trained on tooth-brushing twice, two
      weeks apart. The pictures were placed in the bathroom, at home and/or at the autism center.
      Data collected after examinations (baseline, 3, 6-months) included gingival and plaque
      indices (GI, PI) and two questionnaires (baseline, 6-months) for demographic data and
      parents' perception of PECS including: difficulty rating (easy, hard, very hard) and whether
      they found PECS useful in teaching their children how to brush their teeth (yes or no).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Gingival index score</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>This score indicates the level of gingival inflammation upon examination of teeth, reported as the average score calculated as (total score for all teeth/number of examined teeth): Score 0 (Absence of inflammation), Score 1 (Mild inflammation: slight change in colour (more red) and little change in texture (loss of stippling), No bleeding on probing), Score 2 (Moderate inflammation: moderate glazing, redness, edema and hypertrophy; bleeding on probing), Score 3 (Severe inflammation: marked redness and edema; tendency to spontaneous bleeding; ulceration). A lower score indicates less gingival inflammation (better gingival health) and vice versa.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Plaque index score</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>This score indicates the level of plaque (and reflects level of oral hygiene) upon examination of teeth, reported as the average score, calculated as (total score for all teeth/number of examined teeth): Score 0 (No plaque), Score 1 (Plaque not visible by eye, only detectable using a dental probe), Score 2 (Plaque visible by eye &amp; detectable with a dental probe along the gingival margin of the tooth), Score 4 (Thick layer of plaque visible by eye &amp; detectable by probe covering more than the gingival margin of the tooth). A lower score indicates less plaque (meaning better oral hygiene) and vice versa.</description>

    <measure>Parents' rating of PECS difficulty</measure>

    <description>Parents were asked to rate PECS difficulty as: easy, hard, very hard. This was assessed through a questionnaire.</description>

    <measure>PECS usefulness</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Parents were asked whether PECS was useful in teaching their children how to brush their teeth: yes, no. This was assessed through a questionnaire.</description>
