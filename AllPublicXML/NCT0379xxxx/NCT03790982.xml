      Brief summary: This is a phase II study to investigate the safety, preliminary efficacy and
      pharmacokinetics of AD-35 tablet in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's Disease. This
      study is to be run in China involving 21 sites. It will enroll approximately 480 patients to
      ensure 240 randomized with mild to moderate Alzheimer's Disease. The treatment period is 52
      weeks and total study duration per patient is approximately 57 weeks.

      In this multicenter, randomized, double blind, parallel-group, placebo controlled phase II
      study, 240 patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's Disease are planned to be enrolled and
      randomly assigned 1:1:1 to receive placebo, or different doses of AD-35 tablet (30 or 60 mg).
      After the first 26 weeks, subjects on active study drug will remain on the current doses, and
      subjects assigned to placebo will be randomized to receive 30 mg and 60 mg AD-35 tablet in a
      1:1 ratio, respectively, for the second 26 weeks. This study will evaluate the safety,
      preliminary efficacy and pharmacokinetics of AD-35 tablets in patients with mild to moderate
      Alzheimer's Disease.

             stimulator, metallic splinters in the eye, other magnetic, electrical and other metal
             implants) [note], or any other situation, in the judgment of the Investigator, is not
             suitable for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

             the cognitive evaluation in clinical trials.

          -  Dementia caused by other reasons: vascular dementia, central nervous system infection,
             endocrine system diseases (such as thyroid disease, parathyroid gland disease) and
