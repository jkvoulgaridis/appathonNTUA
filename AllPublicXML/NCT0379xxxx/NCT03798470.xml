  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Emergency Department (ED) is an ideal location to identify patients in need of treatment
      for opioid addiction. A local non-profit community-based addiction recovery program, Faces
      and Voices of Recovery (FAVOR) utilizes a peer recovery coaching model applied to substance
      use disorders by identifying, training, credentialing and supervising individuals who have
      been in recovery for at least 2 years.

      These peer recovery coaches become the primary workforce in this community-based model. FAVOR
      provides no-cost comprehensive services for addiction recovery. The investigators
      hypothesized that having FAVOR Recovery Coaches (FRC) evaluate patients during an ED visit
      for opioid overdose would result in a high degree of engagement from the patients and serve
      as an opportunity to begin treatment for addiction.

    <description>After identification, a 24/7 on-call FRC was paged and met with the patient in the ED. The patients were offered recovery services at the bedside by the FRC. The research team members offered voluntary participation and obtained informed consent to enrolling a longitudinal study looking into the success of his intervention. Patients did not need to participate to be eligible for counseling and resources from AVOR. The FRCs counselled and engaged the patient along with the family to offer a variety of services including active recovery coaching, group treatment modalities, family support services and transportation. After he initial encounter in the ED, the FAVOR team re-engaged the participant by phone or in person the next day and gradually increasing intervals thereafter.</description>
