  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of brivoligide injection administered intrathecally before
      surgery in patients with a Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) score ≥16 undergoing primary
      unilateral total knee arthroplasty.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and postoperative pain reducing
      efficacy of a single preoperative intrathecal administration of brivoligide injection in
      patients with a Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) score ≥16 undergoing unilateral total knee
      arthroplasty.

      Potential subjects will be prescreened for PCS scores of 16 or greater in advance;
      pre-qualified patients will be invited to the investigative site for informed consent and
      full screening within 30 days of randomization. Patients providing informed consent and
      meeting all study eligibility criteria will be enrolled in the study on the day of surgery
      (Day 1). Safety assessments will be performed through Day 28; efficacy assessments will be
      conducted at the follow-up visits and daily via electronic diary by subjects through Day 42.
      Follow up visits will occur on Days 7, 14, 21, 28, and 42.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Score of 16 or greater on the PCS scale

          -  Scheduled for primary unilateral TKA with spinal anesthesia as the primary anesthetic
             for painful osteoarthritis without congenital knee pathology

          -  American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status Classification System ≤ 3

          -  Medically stable for elective surgery with spinal anesthetic as determined by the
             Investigator

          -  Body mass index of 18-45 kg/m2

          -  Stable medical regimen at least 1 week before randomization

             months prior to randomization and/or at any time through the duration of the study

          -  Planned use of general anesthesia as the primary anesthetic; planned use of neuroaxial
             (intrathecal or epidural) opioids, or any use of extended release/long acting opioids
             or ketamine preoperatively and/or at any time through the duration of the study

          -  Use of more than 40 mg per day (on average) of oral morphine or its equivalent within
             1 month prior to randomization

          -  Current neurologic disorder, which could confound the assessment of pain (e.g.,
             Parkinson's, Multiple Sclerosis)

          -  Unstable mental condition and/or evidence of an uncooperative attitude in the opinion
             of the Investigator; subjects diagnosed with schizophrenia, prescribed antipsychotic
             medications or MAOIs

          -  Women who are pregnant or nursing

          -  Subjects engaged in pending or active litigation, or seeking disability compensation;
             subjects whose cases have been settled or finally decided are not excluded

          -  Participation in a clinical trial with the last dose or intervention within 1 month of
             randomization, or planned participation in a clinical trial during this study

          -  Previous participation in any study involving brivoligide injection
