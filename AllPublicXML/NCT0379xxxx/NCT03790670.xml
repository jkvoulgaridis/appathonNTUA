      First, the investigators will determine the safety of a 12 month regimen of Leukine
      administered as a weight-based dose at 3 µg/kg/day for 5 days (week), followed by a 2-day
      holiday (weekend). This 6 month (n=5) pilot study will extend the prior 2 month observation
      tests towards the goal of assessing the safety of Leukine for treatment of Parkinson's
      disease (PD). Clinical signs and symptoms will be measured by personal well-being, physical,
      and neurological examinations (UPDRS Parts I, II, III, and IV assessments) and blood tests
      (CBC with differential, total T cell count, and a comprehensive metabolic sera panel).
      Second, we will assess regimen tolerability administered in a dose reduction, from 6
      µg/kg/day without interruption, to 3 µg/kg/day with 2 day drug holidays. The investigators
      will examine over a time of 12 months, effects of treatment on defined adaptive immune
      deficits in PD as measured by analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected
      before, during, and after cessation of Leukine administration. Individual T cell parameters
      will be assessed and will include links between T cell function and subset analyses and
      clinical neurological signs and symptoms. In addition, the functional stability of the immune
      deficits will be assess in PD by examining T cell subsets in PD patients in this study
      against prior results. The investigators will also determine whether the immune deficits of
      PD are consistent during baseline data collection, and the potential Leukine-induced motor
      control and mobility improvements will be determined by UPDRS part I, II, III, and IV scores
      off treatment and on treatment.

      Primary Objectives: There are three study goals. First, the investigators will determine the
      safety of a 12 month regimen of Leukine administered as a weight-based dose at 3 µg/kg/day
      for 5 days (week), followed by a 2-day holiday (weekend). This 6 month (n=5) pilot study will
      extend the prior 2 month observation tests towards the goal of assessing the safety of
      Leukine for treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). Clinical signs and symptoms will be
      measured by personal well-being, physical, and neurological examinations (UPDRS Parts I, II,
      III, and IV assessments) and blood tests (CBC with differential, total T cell count, and a
      comprehensive metabolic sera panel). Second, the investigators will assess regimen
      tolerability administered in a dose reduction, from 6 µg/kg/day without interruption, to 3
      µg/kg/day with 2 day drug holidays. The lowered dose was chosen based on known tolerability
      and parallel-linked immune reconstitution seen in cancer-associated disease treatments. Due
      to fragility of the patient population and prior recorded adverse events the proposed dose
      reductions are justified.

      Secondary Objectives:

      Over a course of 12 months, the effects of treatment on defined adaptive immune deficits in
      PD as measured by analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected before, during,
      and after cessation of Leukine administration will be examined. Individual T cell parameters
      that include links between T cell function and subset analyses and clinical neurological
      signs and symptoms will be examined. These immune parameters will be serially examined as
      they may contribute to the immune deficits in PD. Thus, timed analyses of changes in T cell
      phenotypes and/or function will be completed. In addition, the investigators will assess the
      functional stability of the immune deficits in PD and will determine whether the immune
      deficits of PD are consistent during baseline data collection. The potential Leukine-induced
      motor control and mobility improvements will be determined by assessing UPDRS part I, II,
      III, and IV scores off treatment and on treatment. Specifically, over the course of this
      six-month treatment study, various biomarkers will be assessed including: T cell markers of
      immune activation, DNA methylation status, and B cell and bone marrow progenitor cell
      markers. We hope to uncover the time course of Treg induction, as well as link the
      pharmacokinetics of Leukine treatment (not previously recorded) to changes in specific
      biomarkers. Additionally, changes in the humoral response following extended Leukine
      treatment will be assessed by measuring the presence of antibodies against Leukine and
      alterations in B cell frequencies.
