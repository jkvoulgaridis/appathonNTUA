      Phase I, interventional, single arm, open label, treatment study to evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of CLL1-CD33 cCAR in patients with relapsed and/or refractory, high risk
      hematologic malignancies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AML bears heterogeneous cells that can consequently offset killing by single-CAR-based
      therapy, which results in disease relapse. Leukemic stem cells (LSCs) associated with CLL1
      expression comprise a rare population that also plays an important role in disease
      progression and relapse for myeloid malignancies. CD33 is widely expressed in AML, high risk
      myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and myeloproliferative neoplasms. Targeting both CD33 and
      CLL1 surface antigens together may offer two distinct benefits. First, targeting both bulk
      disease and leukemic stem cells together allows for a more comprehensive ablation of the
      disease. Second, dual targeting of myeloid malignancies by both CD33 and CLL1 directed
      therapy overcomes the pitfalls of single-antigen therapy by preventing relapse due to antigen
      loss. While loss of a single antigen under antigen-specific selection pressure is possible,
      loss of two antigens simultaneously is much less likely.

      CLL1-CD33 cCAR is a compound Chimeric Antigen Receptor (cCAR) immunotherapy with two distinct
      functional CAR molecules expressed on a T-cell, directed against the surface proteins CLL1
      and CD33. cCAR intends to target the mechanisms of single-CAR relapse, specifically antigen
      escape and leukemic stem cells.
