      This study investigates the efficacy of secukinumab in necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum
      (NLD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum (NLD) is a rare granulomatous condition of the skin often
      presenting with papules and eventually atrophic plaques, most commonly on the distal extensor
      lower extremities, which can be painful and disfiguring. Currently no FDA-approved treatment
      exists, and no well-established treatment algorithm has been described. Reports on successful
      therapeutic interventions have generally been small and inconsistent.

      Recent literature expanding on the previously poorly understood pathogenesis of NLD has
      suggested a potential role for IL-17 in the development of this condition. Thus blockade of
      IL-17 may be a potential therapeutic strategy in patients with NLD. Secukinumab (Cosentyx) is
      a human monoclonal antibody that targets IL-17a and is FDA approved for the treatment of
      psoriasis.

      This open-label, proof of concept study regarding the use of Secukinumab in patients with NLD
      may be a first step in elucidating and defining a treatment for this chronic and potentially
      debilitating condition for which no FDA approved treatment currently exists.

    <description>Proportion of patients achieving remission or clinical improvement based on Investigator Global Assessment Score as measured at week 24.
Score Description
0. Completely clear: except for possible residual hyperpigmentation
Almost clear: very significant clearance (about 90%); however, patchy remnants of dusky erythema and/or very small ulcerations
Marked improvement: significant improvement (about 75%); however, a small amount of disease remaining (i.e. remaining ulcers, although have decreased in size, minimal erythema and/or active boarder)
Moderate improvement: intermediate between slight and marked; representing about 50% improvement
Slight improvement: some improvement (about 25%); however, significant disease remaining (i.e. remaining ulcers with only minor decrease in size, erythema or boarder activity)
No change from baseline

    <description>Proportion of subjects achieving improvement based upon histological score. The score is calculated by adding subscores as listed below, which will be evaluated by the dermatopathologist. Average of pre and post scores and overall change in score will be calculated and compared using a paired T-test.
Inflammatory infiltrate (0, none; 1, slight; 2, moderate; 3, severe)
collagen degeneration (0, none; 1, slight; 2, moderate; 3, severe)
epithelioid histiocytes, (0, none; 1, slight; 2, moderate; 3, severe)

    <description>Self-reported pain and stinging intensity during and directly after treatment with Secukinumab injections
A Pain Score will be calculated based upon the Wong-Baker 10-point pain score, which has been widely used to rate pain in both children and adults and has also been used in dermatology clinical trials.
Response based on an improvement from baseline in the Wong-Baker pain score at all scheduled time points will be calculated. We will compare pre and post treatment pain values and categorize patients as (i) Resolved (ii) Improved (iii) Stable (iv) Worsened</description>

    <description>Proportion of subjects improving based upon patient-reported outcomes The DLQI is a validated general dermatology questionnaire that consists of 10 items that assess subject health-related quality of life (daily activities, personal relationships, symptoms and feelings, leisure, work and school, and treatment) The DLQI is a psychometrically valid and reliable instrument that has been translated into several languages, and the DLQI total scores have been shown to be responsive to change. The minimally important difference for the DLQI has been estimated as a 2 to 5 point change from baseline.</description>

    <description>Secukinumab is selective for human IL-17A and potently neutralizes the bioactivity of this cytokine. IL-17A is the central cytokine in multiple autoimmune and inflammatory processes. It is being recognized as one of the principal pro-inflammatory cytokines in autoimmune diseases such as psoriasis, PsA and AS, uveitis and is thought to play a role in other inflammatory conditions.</description>
