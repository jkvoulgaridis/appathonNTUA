  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory state of the gastrointestinal
      tract(1) affecting 1.6-3.1 million people in the United States. Patients with IBD are treated
      with immunosuppressants that increase their risk of herpes zoster (HZ), also known as
      shingles.

      Those with IBD have a two-fold increased risk for HZ compared to age matched controls.
      Because most IBD patients are treated with systemic immunosuppressants, which are an
      independent risk factor for HZ, the live attenuated HZ vaccine was not recommended. However,
      the release of the new inactivated HZ vaccine, Shingrix (GlaxoSmithKline), presents new
      opportunities for preventive care.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the immunogenicity of the herpes zoster subunit
      vaccine in inflammatory bowel disease patients on vedolizumab compared to those on anti-tumor
      necrosis factor (TNF) monotherapy.

      The study will evaluate humoral and cell mediated immunity in patients with IBD on
      vedolizumab who receive the two-dose herpes zoster vaccine. The investigators will evaluate
      short term, one month after second vaccination dose and sustained immunogenicity at 6 and 12
      months post vaccination.

      The central hypothesis of this proposal is that IBD patients on vedolizumab should be able to
      mount a normal vaccine response comparable to those on anti-TNF monotherapy who might benefit
      from a third dose of the subunit vaccine as has been evaluated in HIV and transplant
      populations. The hypothesis is that IBD patients on vedolizumab will be able to mount a
      superior response to those on anti-TNF therapy. A recent study showed that hepatitis B
      vaccine immunogenicity was not affected by vedolizumab.

      The study population will include adult patients aged 50 or older with IBD(diagnosed by
      standard clinical, radiographic, endoscopic, and histopathologic criteria) receiving care at
      University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics or Boston Medical Center. There is no
      randomization or use of placebo in this study. Two study groups (each containing 15 subjects)
      will be established Group A: Patients with IBD on anti-TNF monotherapy and Group B patients
      with IBD on vedolizumab monotherapy.

      Methods: Eligible patients with IBD will be recruited from the University of Wisconsin
      Hospital and Clinics or from Center for Digestive Diseases at Boston Medical Center.
