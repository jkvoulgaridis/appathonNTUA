  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In India, music is predominantly used as entertainment. Despite ample vedic literature
      available on the beneficial effects of ragas in Indian music on human mind and body,
      scientific evidence for the same is extremely meager. This initial systematic study of 6
      ragas, is an attempt to provide scientific evidence and validate the use of Indian classical
      music &amp; thus present the scientific community with a new complementary therapy / non-
      pharmacological mode of treatment which could be used in prevention of various
      non-communicable diseases. In our previous study on prehypertensives and hypertensives, blood
      pressure (BP) reduced significantly after listening to Indian music [raga 'bhimpalas' (raga
      that normalizes BP)], daily for 3 months. Heart rate variability (HRV) recorded once on
      recruitment and end of study failed to show any change. On retrospection, we realised that
      the effect of only a single raga had been tested and the acute effects had not been
      elucidated. Specifically, EEG waves &amp; cognitive ERPs were not studied. Hence a study
      encompassing all the 6 ragas that are known to normalize BP as given in literatures such as
      Gandharva Veda (Sama Veda) &amp; Raga Chikitsa was planned. Among these, 3 ragas are now being
      studied &amp; data analysis is in line. This proposal is to study the immediate
      electrophysiological changes with remaining 3 ragas. Music can be prescribed as a cheap and
      effective adjuvant in the treatment of hypertension along with other lifestyle modifications.
      To the best of our knowledge, there is scanty literature testing Indian ragas. Thus there is
      a great need to address this issue.

    <description>State trait anxiety inventory score in numbers - It comprises separate self-report scales for measuring two distinct anxiety concepts: state anxiety and trait anxiety. The STAI-T scale consists of 20 statements that ask people to describe how they generally feel. The STAI-S scale also consists of 20 statements. Each question is rated on a 4-point scale (not at all, somewhat, moderately so, very much so). The range of possible scores for form Y of the STAI varies from a minimum score of 20 to a maximum score of 80 on both the STAI-T and STAI-S subscales. STAI scores are commonly classified as &quot;no or low anxiety&quot; (20-37), &quot;moderate anxiety&quot; (38-44), and &quot;high anxiety&quot; (45-80).</description>
