  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to determine the feasibility and acceptability of a hospice
      decision aid among a diverse population of older adults at multiple stages of illness (Aim 1)
      and to determine the preliminary efficacy of the hospice decision aid on decision quality,
      hospice knowledge, and values-concordance (Aim 2). By testing the feasibility, acceptability,
      and preliminary efficacy of a novel hospice PtDA in a diverse population of older adults,
      additionally the study will simultaneously explore barriers to PtDA implementation in both an
      outpatient primary care and inpatient palliative care setting. The study will also gather
      sufficient pilot data to support a subsequent effectiveness/implementation trial and thus
      address the absence of quality of SDM interventions for end-of-life care decision-making.

    <measure>Change in Ottawa Acceptability Scale (OAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Acceptability will be measured using the Ottawa Acceptability Scale (OAS). PtDA acceptability evaluates the comprehensibility of components of a PtDA including: its length, pace, amount of information, balance in presentation of information about options, and overall suitability for decision making. The OAS scale consists of 8 questions on a 5-point Likert scale (ranging from poor to excellent) with additional yes/no questions. The OAS will be assessed at 2 time points.</description>

    <measure>Decision Aid Feasibility Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week FU Only</time_frame>
    <description>This survey will evaluate how the patients used the PtDAs, including when they used the PtDA and whether they used of the video, paper or both. These are opened questions:
After you received the decision aids, when did you view them?
Did you view the paper version, the video version or both?
Which did you prefer? Why?
Do you have any suggestions on how to improve the decision aids?</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Hospice Knowledge Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 1 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Hospice Knowledge Scale is a 23-item true/false scale. Each question is worth 1 point with 23 being the highest score. Hospice Knowledge will be assessed at 2 time points.</description>

    <measure>Change in Decision Conflict Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The Decision Conflict Scale is a 16-item with statements answered on a 5-point likert scale (ranging from not at all confident to very confident). DCS will be measured at 2 time points</description>
