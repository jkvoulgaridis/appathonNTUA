  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The intervention consists of a digital decision support system delivering a weekly plan of
      suggested activities that the participant can use to self-manage their low back pain (LBP)
      via an smartphone app.

      The selfBACK intervention consists of the selfBACK system, that provides the participants
      with an individually tailored weekly plan of suggested activities to use in their
      self-management of low back pain.

      The selfBACK system constitutes a data-driven decision support system that uses case-based
      reasoning to capture and reuse participant cases to suggest the most suitable self-management
      plan for participants. The system is an intelligent system delivering self-management plans
      tailored to individual participant characteristics. Information about participant
      characteristics is collected via a (baseline) questionnaire, weekly self-reports via the app
      on symptom progression etc., and a wristband that detect daily number of steps. The weekly
      plans are presented in an app to participants.

      The weekly plan includes three categories of content;

        1. information/education

        2. recommended daily number of steps

        3. recommended strength and flexibility exercises

      Outcomes are collected as baseline, 6 weeks, 3, 6, 9 months.
