  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this randomized, controlled single blind study is to compare pulse wave and
      blood pressure measurements before, during and after exercise ergometry in healthy male
      subjects.

    <textblock>
      In a randomized single-blind study design the investigators explore how well blood pressure
      parameters calculated using a Pulse Transit Time-based method (device: SOMNOtouchTM RESP)
      match blood pressure parameters measured by a classic upper arm blood pressure cuff
      (Mobil-O-Graph® PWA) under standardized load conditions (ergometry).

      In 30 healthy male subjects (age 18 - 40 years), cardiovascular parameters before, during and
      after a standardized load on a bicycle ergometer (half-lying position) are recorded with
      three different devices (Mobil-O-Graph® PWA versus SOMNOtouchTM RESP versus GeTeMed Vitaguard
      3100) and compared.

      Primary outcome is the difference of the systolic blood pressure values between the devices
      Mobil-O-Graph® PWA versus SOMNOtouchTM RESP during the three phases.

      The Mobil-O-Graph® PWA blood pressure cuff is applied randomized to the arm with the
      previously determined higher or lower systolic blood pressure mean difference. The subjects
      are blinded to the results of the measurements during ergometry.

      After a pre-rest period of 12 minutes, the subjects are physically strained on the ergometer
      for 48 minutes (6 minutes loading phase followed by a 2-minute rest phase; 30 watts increase
      every 8 minutes up to a maximum load of 180 watts), followed by a 12-minute rest period.
      Measurements are taken every two minutes with the Mobil-O-Graph® PWA; data acquisition with
      the SOMNOtouchTM RESP and GeTeMed Vitaguard 3100 devices takes place continuously over a
      total duration of 72 minutes.

    <description>After a pre-rest period of 12 minutes, the subjects are physically strained on the ergometer for 48 minutes (6 minutes loading phase followed by a 2-minute rest phase; 30 watts increase every 8 minutes up to a maximum load of 180 watts), followed by a 12-minute rest periodmaximum load of 180 watts), followed by a 15-minute post-rest period.
Mobil-O-Graph PWA blood pressure cuff is applied to the upper arm with the previously determined lower systolic blood pressure (reference parameter).
SOMNOtouchTM RESP and GeTeMed Vitaguard 3100 are accordingly applied to the arm with the previously determined higher systolic blood pressure.</description>
