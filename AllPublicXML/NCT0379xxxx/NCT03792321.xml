    <textblock>
      Aim of the study was to investigate the effects of testosterone replacement therapy on
      components of metabolic syndrome, vascular function and morphology, grade of non-alcoholic
      fatty liver disease (NAFLD), bone mineral density (BMD) and health-related quality of life.

      Studies have shown that approximately 50 % of older obese males, who are being treated for
      diabetes mellitus type 2, also exhibit low testosterone levels. Hypogonadism negatively
      affects glycemic control, exacerbates early cardio-vascular disease, causes osteoporosis,
      erectile disfunction, reduces lean body mass, accelerates the accumulation of visceral fat
      and leads to obesity.

      Patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 and confirmed hypogonadism were enrolled into this
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study. Placebo group patients were
      receiving placebo throughout the first year of this study and Testosterone group patients
      were receiving testosterone undecanoate during first year. Both groups were receiving
      testosterone undecanoate throughout the second year of this study.
