  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The combined use of Doppler ultrasound and fluoroscopy may increase efficacy and safety
      during cervical transforaminal epidural injection of steroid and local anaesthetic

      The study will detect by which technique we have to start and confirm by the other to reach
      the favourable outcome.

      In a previous Ultrasound study involving the C5C6 levels, a performance time of 248.8 Â± 82.7
      seconds was reported. On the basis of these findings, a 30% difference in performance time
      would represent an effect size of 0.82 and would require 20 patients per group to achieve an
      alpha error of 0.05 and beta error of 0.1. For dropped cases; 5% will be added. So a total
      sample size of 64 patients (32 per group) will be required.

      Statistical Analysis: will be performed using SPSS version 22 statistical software. For
      quantitative data, normality will be first assessed with the Shapiro test and then analyzed
      with the Student t-test. Data that will not have a normal distribution, as well as ordinal
      data, will be analyzed with the Mann-Whitney U test. For binomial data, Fisher exact test
      will be used. All P values presented will be 2-sided and values of less than 0.05 will be
      considered significant.

    <description>the cervical spine will be sonographically examined to determine the C7 transverse process then after lidocaine skin infiltration, a 22G spinal needle is directed towards the hypoechoic shadow of the nerve root using the in-plane technique. then 1ml of non-ionic contrast will be injected and AP and the oblique foraminal fluoroscopic view will be obtained. After confirmation of correct placement of the needle,(2ml, 8mg dexamethasone plus 1ml Lidocaine 1%) will be injected.</description>

    <description>After AP view, alignment or squaring of the target lower end plate, an oblique foraminal view is obtained. Following lidocaine 1% skin infiltration, a 22G spinal needle is directed towards the target foramen then, the superficial ultrasound probe will be applied to delineate the foramen. The needle will be advanced ~3mm towards the dorsal root ganglia under fluoroscopic guidance. After contrast confirmation of needle placement, 2ml,8mg dexamethasone plus 1ml Lidocaine 1%) will be injected.</description>
