  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study aims to enhance the adherence of beta-blockers by Patient Support Tool
      through a smart phone application and a wristband, subsequently reduce the risk of angina
      attacks in patients with stable angina pectoris.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To control heart rate in terms of guidelines in patients with stable angina pectoris reduces
      risk of cardiovascular events, rehospitalization, and death effectively. Using beta blockers
      is an efficient therapy to management the HR in SAP patients. However, the recent
      epidemiological studies have provided evidences that the rate of beta blocker prescribed and
      used was inadequate, as the first-line therapy to CAD patients with the usage rate less than
      30%. Several studies showed that with a reminder supported by smart phones and wearable
      devices, the adherence of management of patients with chronic disease could be improved
      significantly.Thus,the present study aims to enhance the adherence of beta-blockers by
      Patient Support Tool through a smart phone application and a wristband, subsequently reduce
      the risk of angina attacks.

    <description>The patient support tool, a software app installed on the smart phones plus a wrist connected to the smart phones by Bluetooth. The wrist could monitor the pulse, which was recorded to the app in the smart phone. Meanwhile, the app could inform to patients about the importance of medication, remind on the medicine intake, share the patients' data with themselves, and warn the patients if the wrist don't wear.</description>
