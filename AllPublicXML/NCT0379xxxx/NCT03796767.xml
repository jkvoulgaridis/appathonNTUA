    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well surgery and radiation therapy work in treating patients
      with prostate cancer that has come back or spread to other parts of the body. Radiation
      therapy uses high energy beams to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Surgical procedures,
      such as oligometastasectomy, may remove tumor cells that have spread to other parts of the
      body. Surgery and radiation therapy may work better in treating patients with prostate cancer
      that has come back or spread to other parts of the body.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess response to treatment of oligometastatic disease.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess additional measurements of response to treatment of oligometastatic disease.

      II. To assess prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression free-survival following treatment
      of oligometastatic disease.

      III. To assess time to disease recurrence following treatment of oligometastatic disease.

      IV. To assess time to initiation of antiandrogen therapy (ADT) for metastatic prostate cancer
      following treatment of oligometastatic disease.

      V. To assess the rate of undetectable PSA following treatment of oligometastatic disease in
      subjects who have previously undergone prostatectomy.

      VI. To assess safety. VII. To assess the impact of study treatment on change in quality of
      life over three years.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the prostate.

          -  Recurrent prostate carcinoma after definitive therapy for primary disease defined as:

               -  Post-prostatectomy (with/without adjuvant radiotherapy): Detectable or rising PSA
                  level that is &gt; 0.2 ng/mL with a second confirmatory level of &gt; 0.2 ng/mL after
                  1-4 weeks.

               -  Post radiotherapy/ablation (without radical prostatectomy): PSA rise &gt;= 2ng/mL
                  over nadir.

          -  Subjects treated with prior definitive radiotherapy for prostate cancer who have a
             positive fluciclovine positron emission tomography (PET) scan suggesting recurrent
             intraprostatic disease must undergo transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) biopsy:

               -  If negative, no additional treatment is required to the prostate in addition to
                  that of PET positive sites.

               -  If positive, subject must undergo salvage prostatectomy or salvage radiotherapy
                  to the primary site concurrently with the study treatment.

          -  Oligometastatic disease defined as 10 or fewer metastatic lesions to lymph nodes
             and/or bones only.

          -  For patients with oligometastatic disease involving lymph nodes, metastasis is
             confined to the pelvic or para-aortic (below IMA) regions on imaging (e.g.
             fluciclovine PET scans).

          -  All subjects must be surgical candidates if surgery is indicated per the treatment
             algorithm.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =&lt; 2.

          -  Use of condoms for male subjects who have not had surgical removal of their prostate
             and have a partner of child bearing potential beginning at the time of informed
             consent form (ICF) signature and lasting until at least 6 months after the last
             radiation treatment. Because of the potential side effect on spermatogenesis
             associated with radiation, female partners of childbearing potential must agree to use
             a highly effective contraceptive method during and for 6 months after completing
             treatment.

          -  Recovery to baseline or =&lt; grade 1 Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
             (CTCAE) version (v)5 from toxicities related to any prior treatments, unless adverse
             event (AE)(s) are clinically non-significant and/or stable on supportive therapy as
             determined by the treating physician.

          -  Able to provide informed consent and willing to sign an approved consent form that
             conforms to federal and institutional guidelines.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known brain or visceral metastases other than lymph nodes as defined by computed
             tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or fluciclovine PET imaging.

          -  Patients actively receiving hormone therapy for prostate cancer. Patients may have
             received hormone therapy perviously but must have documented non-castrate levels of
             testosterone (&gt;50 ng/dL)

          -  Prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment, in the opinion of
             the enrolling investigator, may have the potential to interfere wih the safety or
             efficay assessment of the investigational treatment protocol of the study.

          -  Use of finasteride within 30 days prior to initiation of therapy. Baseline PSA should
             not be obtained prior to 30 days after stopping finasteride.

          -  Use of dutasteride within 90 days prior to initiation of therapy. Baseline PSA should
             not be obtained prior to 90 days after stopping dutasteride.

          -  Use of any prohibited therapy.

          -  Active, uncontrolled, significant intercurrent or recent illness including, but not
             limited to, the following conditions:

                       mmHg systolic or &gt; 100 mmHg diastolic despite optimal antihypertensive
                       treatment.

                    -  Stroke (including transient ischemic attack [TIA]), myocardial infarction
                       (MI), or other ischemic event, or thromboembolic event (e.g., deep venous
                       thrombosis, pulmonary embolism) within 6 months before first dose.

               -  Acute bacterial or fungal infection requiring intravenous antibiotics at the time
                  of registration

               -  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation or other respiratory illness
                  requiring hospitalization or precluding study therapy at the time of registration
