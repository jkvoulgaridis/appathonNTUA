  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a chronic inflammatory airway disease that leads to episodic symptom exacerbations,
      which exerts a substantial burden on quality of life and can influence other health domains
      if not adequately controlled. Asthma prevalence rates have increased in the past decade,
      affecting 8.4% (25.7 million people) of the United States population. The economic costs of
      asthma have been estimated annually with $56 billion in the US alone. Despite progress in
      pharmacological treatment, overall asthma control remains unsatisfactory and treatment
      non-adherence is extremely high. Asthma is particularly under diagnosed and understudied in
      aging adults. This problem will increase in coming decades given demographic trends and will
      disproportionally contribute to the societal and personal economic costs associated with
      asthma treatment and management. In the proposed 4-year project we will evaluate, in a
      two-session assessment recruiting a total of 126 asthma patients and 66 healthy controls aged
      40-69 years, the extent to which asthma and aging are associated with changes in cognition
      and brain chemistry, structure, and function.

      This study will implement a cross-sectional design, conducted across two sessions. The first
      session will capture cognitive performance, health history, and relevant social, behavioral,
      and emotional processes. The second session approximately one week later will capture neural
      structure, function, and chemistry. In the first session, participants will undergo screening
      for psychological disorders, neuropsychological testing and pulmonary function assessment at
      the Southern Methodist University (SMU) or UT Southwestern site. They will then participate
      in a second session at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW) Advanced
      Imaging Research Center (AIRC) with structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and brain metabolic activity with spectroscopy. Blood
      draws and additional pre- and post-neuroimaging spirometry will also be performed at the
      second session. Potential participants identified by brief phone screen will be invited for
      two assessment sessions 1 week apart. At the first session, they will be consented,
      interviewed about their asthma and/or general health status, and pulmonary function tests
      will be performed. They will then fill in questionnaires and will be screened for
      psychological disorders by standardized psychiatric interview. After that, they will complete
      the neuropsychological test battery. The second session will entail spirometry (to ascertain
      adequate lung function for imaging), the 1 Â½ hour neuroimaging protocol, saliva samples, and
      blood sampling. Spirometry will be repeated at the end of the imaging session. We will also
      offer patients a brief optional session before the imaging session to get acquainted to the
      scanning environment in a mock scanner.

    <measure>Examine processing speed of middle- to late-age adults with asthma with the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) Symbol Search Test.</measure>
    <time_frame>From date of baseline until the date of second session, approximately one week after baseline.</time_frame>
    <description>The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) Symbol Search test is a subtest of the WAIS, a scale widely used to measure intelligence. The examinee scans a search group of symbols and indicates whether one of the symbols matches a symbol in the target group. The time limit for this subtest is 120 seconds. The total raw score is the sum of the number of correct responses minus the number of incorrect responses. A higher score indicates better performance. The maximum total raw score is 60. If the total raw score is equal to or less than 0, then the total raw score is recorded as 0.</description>

    <measure>Examine executive functioning of middle- to late-age adults with asthma with the Trails A&amp;B test.</measure>
    <time_frame>From date of baseline until the date of second session, approximately one week after baseline.</time_frame>
    <description>The Trails A&amp;B test is a neuropsychological assessment. The task requires a subject to connect a sequence of 25 circles on a sheet of paper as quickly as possible. The test has 2 parts, with the first part of the test requiring the subject to connect circles that are all numbers (1, 2, 3, etc.) in order. The second part of the test requires that the subject alternates between numbers and letters (1, A, 2, B, etc.). The time taken for each part, measured in seconds, is the raw score. The score is then converted to a scaled score and a T score, both based on sex (male, female), race, and age. A higher score indicates better performance.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Examine working memory of middle- to late-age adults with asthma with the National Institute of Health (NIH) Sorting Working Memory Test.</measure>
    <time_frame>From date of baseline until the date of second session, approximately one week after baseline.</time_frame>
    <description>The National Institute of Health Sorting Working Memory Test is a computerized test that requires the subject to sequence sets of visually and auditorily presented stimuli (pictures of animals and food) in size order from smallest to biggest. There are two lists, with the 1-list version requiring sequencing among a single category (either animals or food), and the 2-list version (requiring sequencing of both food and animals within a series). The raw score is based on the sum of the correct across both lists, which comprise the List Sorting &quot;Total Score&quot;. The raw score is converted into a t-score (mean = 50, standard deviation = 10). A higher score indicates better performance.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Examine episodic memory of middle- to late-age adults with asthma with the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT).</measure>
    <time_frame>From date of baseline until the date of second session, approximately one week after baseline.</time_frame>
    <description>The examiner reads a list of 15 nouns aloud at the rate of one per second. The subject is asked to repeat all words they recall over 5 trials. An interference list (List B) is then read and subject is asked to recall. Immediately following the interference trial, the subject is asked to recall words from List A (Trial 6). After a 20 minute delay the subject is asked to recall as many words as possible from the first list (delayed recall). A list of 50 words is presented containing all words from List A and the subject is asked to indicate whether each word was on List A (recognition task). The total score (Trials 1-5) is calculated by summing the correct number of words for each trial. List B, Trial 6 and Delayed Recall are calculated by summing the correct number of words. Recognition task is scored by taking the number of correct words and subtracting the number of false positive words. Scores are converted into t-scores with higher score indicating better performance.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Examine reasoning of middle- to late-age adults with asthma with the National Adult Reading Test (NART).</measure>
    <time_frame>From date of baseline until the date of second session, approximately one week after baseline.</time_frame>
    <description>The National Adult Reading Test is a commonly used test to measure intellectual ability in English-speaking patients. A list of 50 words, whose pronunciation cannot be determined from their spelling, are given to the subject and the subject is asked to read down the list. The examiner marks whether the subject pronounced the word correctly and the NART is scored by summing the number of words pronounced correctly.</description>
