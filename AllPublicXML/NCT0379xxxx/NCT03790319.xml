      Stress and stress related diseases are a huge health burden in modern societies.
      Psycho-emotional stress plays a key role in stress regulation. Therefore this study aims to
      investigate the effects of online-courses addressing emotion regulation.

      For this aim several different workshops about emotional competence and compassion are
      scientifically evaluated with psychometric questionnaires and heart rate variability
      measuring. The workshops are planned by the trainers and people register on their own
      initiative.

      The seminars are either single workshops over three days or a yearly program consisting of
      three three-day-workshops. They consist of lectures and exercises about the character of the
      different feelings, about the characteristics of emotions and teach practices on how to dael
      with difficult emotions.

    <intervention_name>The Power of Feelings</intervention_name>
    <description>Three workshops of three days each teach about the five basic feelings rage, sadness, fear, shame and joy and talk about the powerful and destructive qualities they can have. In addition to that they are about how to deal with emotions, which are defined as unfelt feelings of the past.
Smaller lectures give the participants an overview about the themes. Through exercises the participants can make experiences p.e. about each of the feelings. Another element is the sharing in dyads or small groups about actual feelings to practice emotional disclosure and to build a culture of openness and compassion.</description>
