      Open-label, Uncontrolled, Multicenter Observational Study on the Safety and Efficacy of
      Fibryga in Adults and Adolescents (12-17 years of age) with Congenital Fibrinogen Deficiency
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a need to increase the body of data on treatment effectiveness and safety in the
      ultra-rare setting of congenital fibrinogen deficiency. Real-world evidence (RWE) derived
      from non-interventional studies can describe product utilization, demonstrate value, and
      facilitate benefit-risk assessments; RWE can only be fully assessed once a product is
      launched and used in a real-life setting. This post-marketing, observational study is
      designed to collect information concerning safety, efficacy, and outcomes of Fibryga
      administration in routine clinical use in patients ≥12 years of age with congenital
      afibrinogenemia or hypofibrinogenemia. Documentation of the administration of Fibryga in
      clinical practice for the treatment of both minor and major bleeding events (BEs) will not
      only enhance the knowledge on the efficacy and safety profile of Fibryga, but will also
      gather information that cannot be obtained in the same way in controlled clinical studies.
      These observational data will support the safety and efficacy data generated with Fibryga in
      good clinical practice (GCP) clinical studies, providing benefit for both physicians and
      patients.

These data will be transformed into a dichotomous result, with 'treatment success—yes' defined as a rating of 'excellent' or 'good' and 'treatment success—no' defined as a rating of 'moderate' or 'none'.</description>
