  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Survivors of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) experience a range of mild to severe
      sequelae that impact upon their quality of life. The majority of studies to date have focused
      on the impact of IMD on childhood and very little is known about the impact of the disease on
      adolescents and young people.

      The aim of this study is to assess the physical, neurocognitive, economic and societal impact
      of IMD on adolescents and young adult Australian survivors.

      Hypothesis:

        1. Adolescents and young adult survivors who are 2 to 10 years post IMD have significantly
           poorer outcomes including intellectual functioning and quality of life when compared to
           healthy controls.

        2. IMD imposes a significant financial burden upon individuals, families and society.

        3. Serogroup B disease is associated with an increased risk of sequelae when compared to
           non-B serogroup IMD.

      Study design:

      This a multi-centre, case-control mixed-methods study. Survivors of IMD (retrospective and
      prospective cases) and non-IMD healthy controls will be invited to participate in the study.

      Retrospective IMD cases admitted in the previous 10 years will be identified through each of
      the participating hospitals (paediatric and adult hospitals). During the course of the study
      prospective recruitment of IMD cases will also occur at participating hospitals.
      Meningococcal foundations/groups will also be approached and asked to advertise and conduct a
      mail out to their members to inform them about the study.

      Healthy controls will be prospectively recruited by &quot;snowballing technique&quot; whereby enrolled
      IMD cases will be asked to distribute a study information sheet to their healthy
      friends/acquaintances who are approximately the same age. Control participants may also be
      identified from databases at each participating site or through community advertising.

      Enrolled cases will undergo a neurocognitive, psychological and physical examination 2 - 10
      years post IMD admission. A subset of IMD cases will be invited to participate in a
      semi-structured interview. Controls will also undergo neurocognitive, psychological and
      physical examination.
