  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      the target of the research is development of a predictive tool for early identification of
      women which are at higher risk for development of postpartum depression.

      the evaluating tools include self portraits and questionnaire during the third trimester of
      pregnancy.

      The suggested research aims to evaluate if and how it would be possible to predict the
      potential for postpartum mood swing disorders in pregnant women while in the third trimester.
      The later to prevent the mother from enduring such a detrimental experience, which influences
      the child development, the family as well as the mother's intimate relationship.

      The aim is to identify indicators to predict such potential, using questionnaires and
      self-portraits during pregnancy, to allow early intervention and treatment. Early diagnosis
      and quick treatment of pregnant women or post-partum mothers will allow them a higher level
      of functioning and may even prevent eventually infant neurological and developmental delays
      and hardships.

      the target of the research is to evaluate a method based on self portraits and targeted
      questionnaire done in the third trimester and three months later in order to identify
      pregnant women in higher risk to develop PPD.

      the minimal number of objectives participating in the research would be 100 pregnant women
      during the third trimester of pregnancy.

      the Draw A Person (DAP) test was described by Machover in 1949. it is still considered a
      reliable and well recognized test for evaluation of mental stress and disorders (Gilory,
      2012).

      in the research approximately 100 pregnant women in the third trimester would be asked to
      draw a self portrait in two different time points (during the third trimester and three to
      six months postpartum). in addition to the self portraits the participants would be asked to
      fill a set of questionnaires to evaluate the degree of depression, self esteem, personal
      history of traumatic events, and demographic data.

      the self portraits would be evaluated by three judges. the reliability between judges would
      be tested using KAPPA test.
