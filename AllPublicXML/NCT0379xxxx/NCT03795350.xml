    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the lung deposition and distribution pattern of
      TRIMBOW using a Gamma-scintigraphic technique after inhalation of a single dose of 99mTc
      radiolabelled TRIMBOW administered via pMDI in healthy volunteers, asthmatic and COPD
      patients
