      Myocardial infarction causes necrosis of myocardial cells and reduces cardiac function.
      Today, there are treatments such as primary angioplasty and thrombolysis that are effective
      in limiting cell death after acute myocardial infarction. However, the post-infarct scar
      often conditions a global ventricular remodeling that can evolve clinically towards heart
      failure and in more advanced stages the only therapy that completely restores cardiac
      function is heart transplantation.

      Mesenchymal stem cells are multipotent cells found from embryonic mesoderm and found in all
      tissues. In the field of cardiac regeneration, studies have shown a certain degree of benefit
      when treated with MSCs from different origins. Our approach is based on a decellularized
      matrix that carries the cells directly over myocardial infarction.

      Myocardial infarction causes necrosis of myocardial cells and reduces cardiac function. Today
      there are treatments such as primary angioplasty and thrombolysis that are effective in
      limiting cell death after acute myocardial infarction. However, the post-infarct scar often
      conditions a global ventricular remodeling that can evolve clinically towards heart failure
      and, in more advanced stages, the only therapy that completely restores cardiac function is
      heart transplantation.

      Experimental studies are evaluating new therapeutic approaches based on tissue engineering
      for myocardial regeneration. Cardiac tissue engineering attempts to create functional tissue
      constructs that can restore the structure and function of damaged myocardium.

      Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent cells that develop from embryonic mesoderm and
      are found in all structural tissues of the body.

      In the field of cardiac regeneration, studies have shown a certain degree of benefit when
      treated with MSCs from different origins. The investigators approach is based on a
      decellularized matrix that carries the cells directly over myocardial infarction.

      Among the different types of MSC currently available, the investigators propose the use of
      those derived from the connective tissue surrounding the great vessels (2 arteries and one
      vein) of the umbilical cord called Wharton's gelatin (MSC, WJ) whose immunomodulatory
      properties are described extensively in the literature. These MSC, WJ cells have a PEI
      approved by the Spanish Agency for Medicines and Healthcare Products (AEMPS) (PEI 16-017)
      that guarantees an optimal manufacturing process for a clinical trial.
