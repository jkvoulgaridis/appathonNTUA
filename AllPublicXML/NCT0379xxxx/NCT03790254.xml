  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this review is to address clinical reliability, efficacy and safety of long-term
      treatment with oral D Mannose for the prevention of recurrent urinary tract infections
      (RUTIs) in females.

      A comprehensive systematic MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane search was performed for English
      language reports published before December 2018 using the term &quot;recurrent urinary tract
      infections and d mannose.&quot; We searched Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Register of
      Controlled Trials since January 2010 to December 2018. Eligible studies did not include
      non-oral therapy, local (vaginal) treatment in women with RUTIs.

      Study eligibility criteria- We identified eligible original articles. The heterogeneity of
      the available studies, their different rationale and aim, the assumption of d mannose for
      prophylaxis or treatment of recurrent UTIs need to be taken into account.

        Search strategy and selection criteria Only publications with the text and/or the abstract
        written in the English language were considered. Additional papers cited in the references
        of the search manuscripts were further examined. Articles not addressing topics of interest
        were excluded, and the full text of the remaining articles was examined. Our literature
        search identified 15 articles pertaining to the search terms (Word variations have been
        searched). Further analysis of these articles resulted in 11 clinical trials which were
        deemed relevant to our review. The retrieved studies were assessed for their relevance
        based on the title and abstracts. Finally, studies references were screened in order to
        identify eventually unknown studies.
