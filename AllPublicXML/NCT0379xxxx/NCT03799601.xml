  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anlotinib which has shown an affirmatory efficacy in ALTER0303 controlled trial as a 3rd-line
      treatment on advanced NSCLC is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor with a favorable safety profile in
      phase I trial which mainly targets VEGFR1/2/3, FGFR, PDGFR and c-kit. The purpose of this
      trail is to establish whether advanced non-squamous NSCLC patients could benefit from the
      combination treatment of docetaxel, carboplatin and anlotinib as the first-line and
      maintenance treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      First-line patients (or postoperative recurrence) with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC
      were enrolled in this trail. The patients (clinical stage ⅢB/Ⅳ, with no sensitizing mutation
      of the epidermal growth factor receptor gene or translocation of the anaplastic lymphoma
      kinase gene) were confirmed by histological or cytological diagnosis. The primary endpoint is
      PFS; secondary endpoint includes OS, DCR and ORR. The study was single-arm, conducted at 8
      centers in China mainland. The primary end point was PFS (time from enrollment to first
      RECIST1.1-defined PD or death). 45 patients were planned for enrollment. This estimate was
      based on 80% power, with a two-sided 5% significance level. We analyzed PFS and OS using
      Kaplan-Meier methodology. The research protocol was approved by the relevant ethics
      committees, and the study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki and Good
      Clinical Practice guidelines. Patients gave written informed consent to participate in the
      trial.
