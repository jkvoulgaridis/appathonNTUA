  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Today music acts as an analgesic and anxiolytic in a safe, cheap and simple way. Several
      trials have confirmed its potential administration and benefits in urology practice. We aimed
      to assess the influence of music therapy on perceived anxiety and pain during outpatient
      urodynamic study (UDS) using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and the State-Trait Anxiety
      Inventory (STAI) in a prospective, randomized fashion

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Urodynamic study (UDS) is often used to help urologists to evaluate the functions of bladder
      and urethra in outpatient clinic.1 Although a UDS is a reliable tool for accurate diagnosis,
      the process itself can be accompanied by discomfort and pain as it includes the positioning
      the catheters urethral and rectally, and the bladder filling. Reports of having such invasive
      outpatient process whilst awake may demonstrate pain and disquiet that result in incomplete
      examinations and patient noncompliance2,3.

      Various pharmacologic options including lidocaine gel and catheter tip lubrication for
      urethral catheterization were used to relieve pain and anxiety during UDS. Besides, there are
      some non-pharmalogical methods such as patient education, heating pad, music, distraction and
      relaxation4-6.

      Music has been considered complementary treatment modality as cheap, safe and effective. In
      various urological procedures including cystoscopy, transrectal prostate biopsy and
      extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) music has been proven helpful on pain and
      anxiety levels 7-10. However, current literature presents limited and controversial data
      evaluating the influence of music on pain and anxiety perspective of the patient during UDS.
      We, therefore, aimed to assess the effect of music on patient satisfaction in a analgesic and
      anxiolytic way during UDS.

    <description>A total of 70 patients were included in the study. Using simple randomization method, the patients were acknowledged about the aim of the study and the cards with letters C (control) and S (study) were placed in closed envelopes and the patients were asked to draw a random envelope. After the draw, two groups were formed according to the letter as group I consisted of patients with C letter and group II consisted of patients with S letter.</description>

    <description>Patients in the study group were exposed to flute music therapy (Sufi musical recital - Huseyni mode) at low tempo (60-80 rhythm / min) with weak beats and calm rhythms during the UDS.
This audition involves both vocal and instrumental music performed by a reed flute called 'Ney'. A competent lecturer who was specialized in music suggested all the musical compositions during the therapy</description>
