  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To study non-inferiority of intestinal cleansing effect in both NPF-08 1-day treatment group
      and NPF-08 2-day split dose group to the cleansing effect in Moviprep® 1-day treatment group,
      for the subjects who will receive endoscopy large bowel. If the non-inferiority will be
      validated, superiority of intestinal cleansing effect in both groups of NPF-08 will be
      studied.

      Furthermore, for the assessment of safety of NPF-08, the adverse events and adverse drug
      reactions observed after the administration to post-examination period will be studied,
      compared to those at Moviprep® 1-day treatment group.

    <time_frame>1day</time_frame>
    <description>The bowel cleanliness at 5 colon segments (appendix/ascending colon, transverse colon, descending colon, sigmoid colon, rectum) will be evaluated. If the bowel cleanliness is &quot;1&quot; or &quot;2&quot; at all colon segments, it is judged as effective. Other cases will be judged as not effective.
Almost no residue is found in the intestinal tract enabling good observation
Residue remains but does not interfere the observation

    <measure>Evaluation based on Ottawa Bowel Preparation Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>1day</time_frame>
    <description>Endoscopic operators will evaluate for colon cleansing degree at the bowel 5 sites (cecum/ascending colon, transverse colon, descending colon, sigmoid colon and rectum) based on the following 5 degrees (0-4) and the amount of fluid at overall bowel based on the following 3 degrees (0-2), and will also evaluate the status during operating normal endoscopy. Lower score indicates better cleansing effect.</description>

    <measure>Time from the initiation of dosing the investigational product to the completion of colon cleansing on the day of endoscopy.</measure>
    <time_frame>1day</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical cooperator will determine the duration from the initiation of administration of the investigational product on the day of colonoscopy to the time when the cooperator will decide that colon cleansing will be completed as the discharged liquid will become transparent.</description>

    <measure>Concordance rate of intestinal cleansing effect between by EIEC members.</measure>

    <measure>Acceptability by subjects</measure>
    <time_frame>1day</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will evaluate the following points by selecting among 10 levels (circling the applicable figure): Taste of the investigational product; amount of the investigational product; amount of water you will drink after taking the investigational product; and acceptability of the pre-medication (will you choose the pre-medication at the next time?).</description>
