  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the context of pulmonary rehabilitation of COPD patients, recent guidelines and
      metanalysis describe that Resistance Training (RT) can be successfully performed alone or in
      conjunction with Endurance Training (ET) without evidence of adverse events.

      Maximal Strength Training (MST) is a kind of RT typically performed at ~85-90% of 1RM with
      maximal velocity to be developed in the concentric phase. Recent literature indicates a
      significant amelioration on the Rate of Force Development (RFD) after MST in healthy
      subjects, post-menopausal woman and older populations.

      When comparing to the conventional ET, MST generates a little change in muscle mass (no
      hypertrophy), but a much greater improvement in the RFD. It has been described that neural
      adjustments play a major role in the MST-induced adaptations. MST is also well documented to
      improve aerobic endurance by improving walking work efficiency.

      Only a small cohort study of COPD patients was conducted, describing that MST can
      meaningfully improve strength and RFD, with an increase of around 32% for mechanical
      efficiency and a decrease of the perceived effort during submaximal job. This improvement
      could determine best performances in daily activities and a best quality of life. The main
      aims of this physiological pilot randomized controlled trail will be to evaluate feasibility
      and efficacy of the MST compared to standard ET on strength, effort tolerance, fatigue,
      economy of walking, dyspnea and risk of falls in a populations of COPD patients, in a short
      and middle term (6 months).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Exercise intolerance is a cardinal problem existing in patients with Chronic Obstructive
      Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Moreover, skeletal muscle dysfunction is a common extra-pulmonary
      manifestation, leading to fatigue, decrease in activity of daily living (ADL) performance and
      quality of life and increase of risk of falls, mainly in older patients. In the context of
      pulmonary rehabilitation, recent guidelines and metanalysis describe that Resistance Training
      (RT) can be successfully performed alone or in conjunction with Endurance Training (ET)
      without evidence of adverse events.

      As concern the RT programs, metanalysis in COPD describe that training have been mainly
      performed with the lower limbs and the training intensities are heterogeneous, generally
      ranging from 40% to 70% of 1-Repetition Maximum (1-RM).

      Maximal Strength Training (MST) is a RT typically performed at ~85-90% of 1RM with maximal
      velocity to be developed in the concentric phase. Recent literature indicates a significant
      amelioration on the Rate of Force Development (RFD) after MST in healthy subjects,
      post-menopausal woman and older populations.

      When comparing to the conventional ET, MST generates a little change in muscle mass (no
      hypertrophy), but a much greater improvement in the RFD. It has been described that neural
      adjustments play a major role in the MST-induced adaptations. MST is also well documented to
      improve aerobic endurance by improving walking work efficiency.

      Although the mechanisms at the base of MST effect on the mechanical efficiency have not been
      completely clarified, there is evidence that changes in the relationships between power and
      speed bring to a longer relaxation phase inside the cycle of job, improving the recovery
      between contractions.

      In this field, only a small cohort study of COPD patients was conducted describing that MST
      can meaningfully improve the strength and the RFD, with an increase of around 32% for
      mechanical efficiency and a decrease of the perceived effort during submaximal job. This
      improvement could determine best performances in daily activities and a best quality of life.
      Nevertheless, this study has been conducted only in a small cohort (twelve patients) of
      patients with COPD and further studies are necessary to define the impact on the different
      components that determine the effort intolerance.

      The main aim of this physiological pilot randomized controlled trail will be to test the
      feasibility and the efficacy of the MST compared to standard ET on strength, effort
      tolerance, fatigue, economy of walking, dyspnea and risk of falls in a populations of COPD
      patients, in a short and middle term (6 months).

    <description>Patients will perform an addictive out-patients rehabilitative treatment of 8 weeks (3 times/week, â¥20 training sessions) consisting of:
MST- It will consist of four sets of five repetitions on a leg-press with a focus on the rate of force development during the concentric contraction of the quadriceps from a 90Â° to legs complete extension. The load will be 85-90% of 1RM. When a patient will be able to perform more than five repetitions in a set, the load will be increased. All strength training will be performed on a seated horizontal leg press.
ET - A cycling session will follow the MST and last 40 minutes at constant-load, starting from a load intensity corresponding to patient specific AT. The intensity will be gradually increased with a symptom-based progression.</description>

    <description>Patients will perform a usual out-patients rehabilitative treatment of 8 weeks (3 times/week, â¥20 training sessions). They will perform ET by cycling sessions that will last 40 minutes/each at constant-load, starting from a load intensity corresponding to patient specific AT, assessed during the baseline incremental test. The intensity will be gradually increased during the sessions with a symptom-based progression, according to the protocol by Maltais and coworkers. A 3-min warm-up and cool-down will be provided. Heart rate (HR), blood pressure, oxygen pulsoxymetry, and symptoms by Borg CR10 scale will be monitored at the beginning and end of each session.
Out of the training-days, both groups will continue their normal daily living with modest regular activity, as recommended by their physician.</description>
