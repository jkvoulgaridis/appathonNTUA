  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to generate additional data on the effect of ataluren for producing
      dystrophin protein in nonsense mutation nmDMD participants. This study will evaluate
      dystrophin levels from participants with nmDMD who currently have been receiving ataluren for
      greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 9 months.

      The study will have a single visit (Visit 1).

    <time_frame>Visit 1 (Day 1)</time_frame>
    <description>Immunohistochemistry will semi-quantitatively assess dystrophin protein levels and evaluate whether the dystrophin protein is correctly localized to the membrane of the muscle cell, consistent with a functional protein.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence of signed and dated informed consent/assent document(s) indicating that the
             participant (and/or his parent/legal guardian) has been informed of all pertinent
             aspects of the trial.

          -  Ambulatory (10 meters walk/run in less than [&lt;] 30 seconds) and functional grade on
             the Brooke Upper Extremity Scale of a 1 or a 2.

          -  Currently being treated with ataluren 10, 10, 20 mg/kg for &gt;=9 months, with no gap in
             treatment of greater than (&gt;) 1 month, in an ongoing PTC-sponsored nmDMD clinical
             trial prior to study entry.

          -  Phenotypic evidence of duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) based on the onset of
             characteristic clinical symptoms or signs (for example, proximal muscle weakness,
             waddling gait, and Gowers' maneuver) by 6 years of age and an elevated serum creatine
             kinase (CK). Medical documentation of phenotypic evidence of DMD needs to be provided
             upon request by the medical monitor.

          -  Willing to undergo muscle biopsy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known contra-indication to muscle biopsy (such as bleeding or clotting disorders).

          -  Exposure to another investigational drug within 2 months prior to study enrollment or
             ongoing participation in any non-ataluren interventional clinical trial.

          -  Requirement for daytime ventilator assistance or any use of invasive mechanical
             ventilation via tracheostomy. Note: Evening non-invasive mechanical ventilation such
             as use of bilevel positive airway pressure (Bi-PAP) therapy is allowed.

          -  Prior or ongoing medical condition (for example, concomitant illness, psychiatric
             condition, behavioral disorder), medical history, physical findings or laboratory
             abnormality that, in the investigator's opinion, could adversely affect the safety of
             the participant, makes it unlikely that the course of treatment or follow-up would be
             completed, or could impair the assessment of study results.
