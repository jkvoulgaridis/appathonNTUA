  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators intend to validate 18F-DCFPyL test-retest reproducibility in
      metastatic lesions, in order to investigate whether it serves as a reliable response
      assessment tool, both to interpret existing studies and to design future longitudinal trials.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will image patients with widely metastatic castration-sensitive (CSPC) or
      castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) using 18F-DCFPyL-PET/CT for detection of tumor
      burden and perform a lesion-based head-to-head comparison with a subsequent near-term (one to
      seven days) 18F-DCFPyL-PET/CT follow-up scan, to assess test-retest reproducibility of this
      second-generation PSMA-targeted compound. Second, as it has not been specifically
      investigated with this compound before, intra-observer agreement as well as inter-scan
      variability will be assessed.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Willing and able to provide written informed consent

          -  History of histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate
             without neuroendocrine differentiation or small cell histology

          -  Patients with metastatic castration-sensitive (CSPC) or castration-resistant prostate
             cancer (CRPC) with evidence of metastatic disease on conventional imaging with CT or
             bone scan.

          -  Prior docetaxel-based chemotherapy is permitted

          -  Documented metastatic prostate cancer progression as assessed by the treating
             oncologist with either one or both of the following and has not initiated a new
             therapy after determination of progression: Rising PSA over a minimum 1-week interval
             and/or radiographic progression in soft tissue and bone metastases (combination of
             bony and soft tissue metastases)

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of ≤ 2

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Serious or uncontrolled co-existent non-malignant disease, including active and
             uncontrolled infection

          -  Administered a radioisotope ≤5 physical half-lives prior to the date of study PET/CT

          -  Administered IV X-ray contrast medium ≤24 hours prior to the date of study PET/CT

          -  Administered oral contrast medium ≤120 hours prior to the date of study PET/CT

          -  Condition or situation which, in the investigator's opinion, may put the patient at
             significant risk, may confound the study results, or may interfere significantly with
             patient's participation in the study
