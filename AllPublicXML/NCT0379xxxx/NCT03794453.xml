  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antimicrobial resistance is regarded as one of the major global public health threats,
      causing at least 700,000 deaths per year. It has been estimated that if the current problem
      of antimicrobial resistance is not effectively tackled, it would cause the death of 10
      million people worldwide by 2050. Multi-drug resistant pathogen is the single most important
      contributing factor for inappropriate antibiotics therapy, and this in turn lead to higher
      mortality in patients with sepsis. The slow pace of development of new classes of
      antimicrobial agents limits the availability of effective therapy for multi-drug resistant
      organisms, both currently and in the near future. It is therefore of utmost importance to
      look for strategies to reduce the spread and burden of antimicrobial resistance.

      Intestinal microbiota probably played a dominant role in determining the risk of acquisition
      of multi-drug resistant organisms. For instance, findings from a mouse model showed that
      Barnesiella species conferred resistance to intestinal colonization by vancomycinresistant
      Enterococcus. Such findings were subsequently confirmed in human subjects.

      This is a prospective longitudinal observational study evaluating the correlation between
      changes in intestinal microbiota and acquisition of antimicrobial resistance in patients
      hospitalized for stroke.

      Adult patients admitted to the Medical unit of the Prince of Wales Hospital with a diagnosis
      of acute stroke will be screened for eligibility and will be invited to participate in this
      study. Data collected from this study will determine the correlation between antibiotics use
      and changes in intestinal microbiota in a cohort of hospitalized patients as well as the
      correlation between intestinal microbiota and acquisition of intestinal colonization or
      infection caused by resistant pathogens.

    <description>Intestinal colonization of resistant organisms are defined as the presence of ESBL or resistance to one or more carbapenems in Enterobacteriaceae identified in the stool samples, in patients without these organisms detected in their stool samples at the time of admission to hospital.</description>

    <description>Nosocomial infections are defined as infections with onset of 72 hours or more after hospital admission.
Multi-drug resistant pathogens are defined as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus species, ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, and carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, including Enterobacteriaceae, Acinetobacter species, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, detected in one or more of patients' clinical specimens.</description>
