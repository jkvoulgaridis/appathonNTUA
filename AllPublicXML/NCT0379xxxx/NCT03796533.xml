  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Among its authorized indications, posaconazole (PCZ) is prescribed for prophylaxis in
      onco-hematology patients at high risk of invasive fungal infections. This azole antifungal
      has a low bioavailability. The enteric-coated tablets form available since mid-2015 has
      significantly improved its pharmacokinetic profile compared to the oral suspension form
      initially used. According to the recommendations of The European Conference on Infections in
      Leukemia (ECIL-6), the minimum serum concentration desirable for prophylaxis is 0.7 mg/L.
      This concentration threshold was difficult to achieve in onco-hematology patients treated
      with oral suspension.

      The investigators retrospectively collected and analyzed 201 results of residual PCZ serum
      concentrations from 91 onco-hematology patients on Noxafil® tablets prophylaxis. The median
      concentration of PCZ was 1.08 mg/L. In this study, the pharmacokinetics of tablet-PCZ showed
      significant inter-individual variability. Thus, while 25% of the concentrations remained
      below the recommended threshold of 0.7 mg/L (25% percentile = 0.69 mg/L), exposure to PCZ was
      greater than 2.63 mg/L in 10% of cases. This level of exposure, however, did not have obvious
      hepatic repercussions. Nevertheless, further studies involving larger cohorts are needed to
      clarify a hypothetical relationship between serum PCZ concentration and the occurrence of
      hepatic toxicity.

      In addition, the investigators found significant intra-individual variability in PCZ exposure
      (CV = 48.8%), especially in leukemic patients. This variability is probably related to a
      modification during the treatment of the physio-pathological conditions of the patient likely
      to impact the pharmacokinetics of PCZ (absorption, distribution, metabolism, etc.) as well as
      the effect of possible pharmacokinetic drug interactions.

      The metabolism of PCZ is mediated primarily by the uridine diphosphate
      (UDP)-glucuronosyltransferase 1A4 (UGT1A4) pathway. Although hepatic metabolism of PCZ is low
      compared with other azoles (such as itraconazole or voriconazole), differences in the
      metabolic capacity of UGT1A4 may alter PCZ exposure. A previous study of the oral suspension
      form had shown that low concentrations of PCZ were associated with a high ratio of
      PCZ-glucuronide / PCZ concentrations. Two genetic variants of the gene encoding UGT1A4 are
      associated with a decrease in the metabolic clearance of glucuronide drugs via UGT1A4. A
      recent study suggests less exposure to PCZ in the presence of UGT1A4 polymorphism.

      The main objective of the investigator's project is to study prospectively in a homogeneous
      population of patients treated by intensive chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia
      (induction and consolidation) the pharmacokinetics of PCZ administered in its tablet
      formulation, and in particular:

        -  Clinical and biological tolerance of high concentrations of PCZ

        -  The influence of clinical and demographic covariates on PCZ and PCZ-glucuronide ratio

        -  The influence of genetic variants of UGT1A4 on PCZ metabolism (PCZ-glucuronide / PCZ
           ratio).

    <description>Posaconazole (PCZ) treatment will start at Day 1 at the beginning of induction/ consolidation therapy.
For the pharmacokinetics study of PCZ during induction, blood samples (5 mL) will be taken on days 3, 7, 14 and 21. Predoses (just prior to a daily dose) or trough concentrations (C0) will be collected on days 3, 7, 14 and 21. A peak concentration (at 3 hours post dose) will also be collected on day 14.
After achieving complete remission, patients receive a consolidation cure. During the consolidation cures, trough concentrations will be collected on days 3, 7, 14 and 21. A peak concentration (at 3 hours post dose) will also be collected on day 14.</description>

    <description>PCZ will be used as recommended in tablet formulation at an initial dosage of 300 mg twice a day on the first day and then once a day at a dose of 300 mg the following days.
PCZ prophylaxis will be started on the same day as the start of chemotherapy and will be continued until the end of aplasia.
The dosage of the PCZ can be adjusted according to the results of the PCZ assay. It may be interrupted if the transaminase level is greater than 3 times higher than normal (3N) or on medical decision.</description>
