  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to determine whether TAK-653, in comparison to placebo,
      increases CNS excitability, assessed with TMS-evoked motor-evoked potential (MEP) in healthy
      participants.

    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-653. This study is designed to evaluate the
      central pharmacodynamic activity of TAK-653 using TMS. The study will enroll approximately 24
      participants to yield 22 participants that complete treatment periods 1, 2, and 3.
      Participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of the 6 sequences to receive TAK-653 0.5 mg low
      dose or TAK-653 6 mg high dose or Placebo in double-blind treatment periods 1, 2, and 3,
      followed by Ketamine 0.5 mg/kg in open-label Treatment period 4.

      All participants will receive one dose of TAK-653 (0.5 or 6 mg), or Placebo or Ketamine on
      Day 1 of each treatment period.

      This single center trial will be conducted in the Netherlands. The overall time to
      participate in this study is 15 weeks. Participants will make 5 visits to the clinic. A
      washout period of minimum 10 days will be maintained between the doses in treatment periods 1
      to 3. Follow-up phone call will be made on Day 14.

    <description>TMS was a neurophysiologic test for assessing upper motor neuron function. TMS was a noninvasive neuro stimulation method involving the application of brief magnetic pulses to the skull, based on the principles of electromagnetic induction, create an orthogonal electric current that can be sufficient to depolarize neurons and activate neuronal circuits. Single-pulse TMS was used to determine peak-to-peak amplitude of MEP at a stimulation intensity of 120 percent (%) of baseline resting motor threshold (rMT). rMT was defined as the minimum stimulus intensity to evoke an MEP. Change in peak-to peak amplitude of MEP was be assessed by TMS after treatment with 0.5 mg or 6 mg of TAK-653 versus (vs.) matched oral placebo.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Peak-to-Peak Amplitude of Motor-evoked Potential (MEP) Obtained With Single-pulse Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) for TAK-653 at 2.5 Hours Post TAK-653 Dose</title>
        <description>TMS was a neurophysiologic test for assessing upper motor neuron function. TMS was a noninvasive neuro stimulation method involving the application of brief magnetic pulses to the skull, based on the principles of electromagnetic induction, create an orthogonal electric current that can be sufficient to depolarize neurons and activate neuronal circuits. Single-pulse TMS was used to determine peak-to-peak amplitude of MEP at a stimulation intensity of 120 percent (%) of baseline resting motor threshold (rMT). rMT was defined as the minimum stimulus intensity to evoke an MEP. Change in peak-to peak amplitude of MEP was be assessed by TMS after treatment with 0.5 mg or 6 mg of TAK-653 versus (vs.) matched oral placebo.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Resting Motor Threshold (rMT) Obtained With Single-pulse TMS for TAK-653 at 2.5 Hours Post TAK-653 Dose</title>
        <description>The rMT was defined as the minimum stimulus intensity to evoke an MEP. Single-pulse TMS was used to determine rMT. A lower rMT value indicated greater neuronal excitability. TMS was a neurophysiologic test for assessing upper motor neuron function. TMS was a noninvasive neuro stimulation method involving the application of brief magnetic pulses to the skull, based on the principles of electromagnetic induction, create an orthogonal electric current that can be sufficient to depolarize neurons and activate neuronal circuits. Change in rMT was be assessed by TMS after treatment with 0.5 mg or 6 mg of TAK-653 vs. matched oral placebo.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Magnitude of Short Intracortical Inhibition (SICI) Obtained With Paired-pulse TMS for TAK-653 at 2.5 Hours Post TAK-653 Dose</title>
        <description>SICI was TMS stimulation paradigm that capture modulation of cortical excitation-inhibition balance with pairs of TMS pulses at stimulation intensity conditioning pulse 80% of baseline rMT and test pulse of 120% of baseline rMT. rMT was defined as the minimum stimulus intensity to evoke an MEP. TMS was a neurophysiologic test for assessing upper motor neuron function. TMS was a noninvasive neuro stimulation method involving the application of brief magnetic pulses to the skull, based on the principles of electromagnetic induction, create an orthogonal electric current that can be sufficient to depolarize neurons and activate neuronal circuits. Change in SICI was be assessed by TMS after treatment with 0.5 mg or 6 mg of TAK-653 vs. matched oral placebo.</description>

The PD analysis set included all participants who had completed first 3 treatment periods.

        <description>The rMT was defined as the minimum stimulus intensity to evoke an MEP. Single-pulse TMS was used to determine rMT. A lower rMT value indicated greater neuronal excitability. TMS was a neurophysiologic test for assessing upper motor neuron function. TMS was a noninvasive neuro stimulation method involving the application of brief magnetic pulses to the skull, based on the principles of electromagnetic induction, create an orthogonal electric current that can be sufficient to depolarize neurons and activate neuronal circuits. Change in rMT was be assessed by TMS after treatment with 0.5 mg/kg Ketamine.</description>
