  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to provide prospective evidence that the use of Magseed/Sentimag
      in marking axillary lymph nodes and guiding surgical localization in patients with breast
      cancer following neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is effective.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a post-market, prospective, open-label, single arm study of Magseed and Sentimag in
      patients with breast cancer with biopsy-proven axillary node metastases who had a clip placed
      to mark the metastatic node and are having that clipped node selectively removed at surgery
      following neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Subjects will have the Magseed placed to mark
      axillary lymph nodes with biopsy-proven metastasis under ultrasound guidance before
      initiating NAC. After completion of NAC, the Magseed will be localized using the Sentimag
      system during surgery and removed with the targeted lymph node.
