  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess the safety, tolerability and effectiveness of
      Sintilimab in combination with IBI305 in patients with HCC as the first-line treatment
      compared with Sorafenib. This study is a randomised, Open-label，Multi-center Study. The
      primary endpoint is overall survival.
