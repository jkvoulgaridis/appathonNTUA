  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled trial to evaluate which treatment protocol in selective laser
      trabeculoplasty that is most optimal in terms of efficacy and safety.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled trial in which individuals scheduled for SLT are randomized to one of
      four treatment protocols, which represent the most common variants of the treatment in
      clinical use.

      Treatment is performed either at 360 degrees or 180 degrees and with a laser energy level
      either 0,1 millijoules (mJ) below the microbubble formation limit (&quot;low&quot; energy) or at a
      level that gives microbubbles at 50-75% of laser effects (&quot;high&quot; energy). This gives four
      treatment arms: 180/low, 180/high, 360/low and 360/high. Group allocation is masked for the
      patient and is coded in the records.

      The results for short and long term treatment effects are compared between the groups, as
      well as the complication rate and postoperative discomfort.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in intraocular pressure (IOP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Before SLT and thereafter regularly for 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The IOP is measured with a Goldmann Applanation Tonometer (GAT) three times before SLT and then at regular intervals after the procedure. The reduction is registered and analyzed in absolute (mmHg) and relative (percent of the IOP before SLT) measures.
Measurement of IOP is planned 1, 3, 6 and 12 months post SLT, and thereafter every six months for 3 years after SLT. The study is conducted in a regular clinical setting and the above mentioned times might be delayed. If target pressure is not achieved, measurements will be planned at shorter intervals, according to a specified algorithm, due to safety reasons.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Achievement of 20% reduction in IOP</measure>
    <time_frame>For 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>See Outcome 1. Analysis of differences between the study arms will also be conducted measuring the proportion of eyes achieving 20% reduction in IOP or more at different time points in each group.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Survival (no additional intervention)</measure>
    <time_frame>For 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Kaplan-Meier survival analysis will be conducted, measuring the proportion of eyes that stay in the study groups but do not receive any further IOP-lowering intervention (medical, surgical or laser).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Survival (SLT allowed)</measure>
    <time_frame>For 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>See Outcome 3. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis is performed the same way, but additional SLT-treatment will not be judged as failure.</description>

    <measure>Survival (no surgery)</measure>
    <time_frame>For 3 years</time_frame>

    <time_frame>During the first month</time_frame>

    <time_frame>During the first month</time_frame>
    <description>The patient will grade post-operative sensitivity to light on an arbitrary scale between 0 (no difference) and 4 (very intense sensitivity to light) on a written protocol, also stating the duration of light sensitivity.</description>

    <measure>Impairment of vision postoperatively</measure>
    <time_frame>During the first month</time_frame>
    <description>The patient will grade post-operative impairment of vision on an arbitrary scale between 0 (no difference) and 4 (cannot see ones own hand) on a written protocol, also stating the duration of vision impairment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Redness postoperatively</measure>
    <time_frame>During the first month</time_frame>
    <description>The patient will grade post-operative redness of the eye on an arbitrary scale between 0 (no difference) and 4 (very intense redness) on a written protocol, also stating the duration of redness.</description>
