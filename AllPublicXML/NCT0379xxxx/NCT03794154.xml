  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Brazil, duloxetine is currently available as hard gelatinous capsule with delayed release
      microgranules for oral administration containing enteric-coated pellets of 33.7, or 67.3 mg
      of duloxetine hydrochloride equivalent to 30 mg or 60 mg of duloxetine (Cymbalta®),
      respectively.

      The Sponsor has developed a hard gelatinous capsule with delayed release microgranules
      formulation containing enteric-coated pellets of 33.7, or 67.3 mg of duloxetine hydrochloride
      equivalent to 30, or 60 mg of duloxetine, respectively.

      The purpose of this study is to verify through a single dose study, if the test formulation
      of duloxetine is bioequivalent to the reference formulation (Cymbalta®) when administered
      with the same dosage and under fed conditions in healthy male research subjects.
