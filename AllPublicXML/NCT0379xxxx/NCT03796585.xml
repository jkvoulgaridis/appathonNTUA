      The purpose of this study is to identify barriers to utilization of immunization registries
      within a pharmacy context and tailor the information learned about barriers into a novel
      immunization registry training program with strategies specific to individual subsets of
      pharmacies, independent pharmacies in rural areas. Doing so will help achieve the long-term
      goal which is to increase the use of immunization registries in community pharmacies in
      Alabama.

      The specific aims are to

        1. identify barriers and best practices of immunization registry implementation,

        2. use a participatory design approach to develop an immunization registry training
           program, and

        3. disseminate and assess the impact of the immunization registry training program among
           community pharmacies' registry participation rates.

      The impact of the training program on registry participation rates will be assessed using a
      randomized controlled trial design comparing Alabama community pharmacies' registry data as
      well as intention to participate.

    <description>The change in the number of participant pharmacies enrolled in the Alabama immunization registry from baseline to 3 months.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Level of Immunization Registry Participation</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Proportion of self-reported doses administered that are verified in the immunization registry.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in awareness</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The change in participant awareness of immunization registries from baseline to 3 months assessed by online questionnaire at baseline, one month, and three months. Awareness will be measured using three true or false items. Each item will be scored, 0 for an incorrect answer and 1 for a correct answer. Awareness index is the sum of the 3 items and could range from 0-3 with higher values representing greater awareness.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in knowledge</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The extent to which participant is familiar with and understands immunization registries will be assessed via online questionnaire at baseline, one month, and three months. Eight true or false and multiple answer items will be used to measure knowledge. Each item will be scored, 0 for an incorrect answer and 1 for a correct answer. Knowledge is the sum of the 8 items and could range from 0-8 with higher values representing greater knowledge.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in attitudes</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participant's perceptions toward attributes of the immunization registry assessed via online questionnaire at baseline, one month, and three months. A scale including 25 Likert-type items will be used to measure attitudes. Each Likert-type item will be scored, ranging from 0 for strongly disagree to 6 for strongly agree. Mean scores will be calculated for the 25 items in the scale so that attitudes score range from 0 to 6 with higher values indicating greater positive attitudes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in intention to enroll in immunization registry</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participant's likelihood to enroll their pharmacy in the immunization registry assessed via online questionnaire at baseline and one month. A scale including 3 Likert-type items will be used to measure intention. Each Likert-type item will be scored, ranging from 0 for strongly disagree to 6 for strongly agree. Mean scores will be calculated for the three items in the scale so that intention score ranges from 0 to 6 with higher values indicating greater intention.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Implementation Factors</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Implementation factors informed by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) including innovation characteristics, characteristics of individuals, inner setting, outer setting, and process will be assessed via online questionnaire at baseline and three months. A scale including 42 Likert-type items will be used to measure Implementation Factors. Each Likert-type item will be scored, ranging from 0 for strongly disagree to 6 for strongly agree. Mean scores will be calculated so that the implementation factors score ranges from 0 to 6 with higher values indicating greater positive influence of CFIR implementation factors.</description>
