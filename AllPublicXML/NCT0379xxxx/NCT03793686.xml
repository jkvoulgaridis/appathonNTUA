    <textblock>
      This Phase I double blind, randomized clinical study to evaluate the safety of human milk
      oligosaccharides (HMO) is designed to assess the safety and dosage ranging of PBCLN-003 in
      adults with Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD). Within 3 dose cohort, subjects
      will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive PBCLN-003 or placebo.
