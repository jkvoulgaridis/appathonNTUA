    <textblock>
      The presented study is an explorative prospective study. First, it focusses on the
      longitudinal analysis of outcome quality in stroke treatment (12 months). Particularly, it
      addresses patient reported quality of life after inpatient stroke treatment and influencing
      factors. Second, it focusses on the feasibility and acceptance of a standard set of measures
      capturing outcome quality of medical care in stroke patients.

      With a shift in focus to patient-centered health care and a constant effort to improve the
      quality of treatment, the role of the patient's perception of his/her medical care becomes
      essential. Patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) are among the most adequate instruments
      for assessing the patient's perspective on symptom load, functional status, and quality of
      life. After stroke, patients not only suffer from objectively scaled and measurable symptoms
      and impairments but also experience dramatic changes in everyday routine and quality of life.

      In this project, a standardized outcome measurement, including PROMs, for stroke patients is
      used.

      This stoke standard set was developed by the International Consortium for Health Outcomes
      Measurement (ICHOM; www.ICHOM.org); an international, interdisciplinary and
      inter-professional expert group with the contribution of patient representatives, aiming to
      create a comprehensive tool for measuring the most important outcomes and risk factors
      applicable to a broad variety of diseases.

      Main objective of this study is the analysis of quality of life 90 and 360 days after stroke
      and its association with stroke specific risk factors and complications, also measured within
      the scope of the ICHOM tool.

      Furthermore, the process and success of the implementation of the ICHOM stroke standard set
      within the stroke unit of the University Medical Centre Hamburg- Eppendorf (UKE) will be
      studied and evaluated.

    <description>Introduction and assessment of the ICHOM standard set consisting of demographic and medical data as well as questionnaires filled in by patients, shortly after admission to the stroke unit, at discharge, and at 90 and 360 days after stroke.
Specifically the intervention includes an assembly of clinical records, in particular records of complications, recurrence of disease and mortality. Further patients will be required to complete a questionnaire assessing their situation in terms of housing and symptom burden as well as their self-perceived autonomy and quality of life.
Telephone assessments will be administered to support patients if necessary and validate their responses.</description>
