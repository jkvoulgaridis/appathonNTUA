  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adherence to a healthy dietary pattern is part of the self-care of patients with
      hypertension, and may contribute substantially to therapeutic target goals as well as to a
      better quality of life. However, not all nutritional recommendations aimed at these patients
      are easily applicable in clinical practice. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate
      the effectiveness of a nutritional strategy for blood pressure control in patients with
      hypertension users of a Public Health System after 1 year of follow-up. As secondary
      objectives, we will evaluate the impact of the proposed strategy on self-care and on the
      quality of life of the patients. In this multicenter open-label randomized trial, 408
      patients ≥21 years old with hypertension, systolic blood pressure (SBP)

      ≥140mmHg and who have not received or received nutritional counseling for at least 06 months
      will be enrolled. Patients allocated to the control group will receive individualized dietary
      prescription according to the guidelines of the Brazilian Society of Cardiology. Nutritional
      counseling in the intervention group will be performed based on the quality of the diet, the
      Food Guide for the Brazilian Population and concepts of mindfulness and mindful eating; all
      dietary guidance will be based on feasible goals built together (patient and nutritionist),
      and no diet will be prescribed for intervention group. In both groups, patients will receive
      automatic monitors for residential self-monitoring blood pressure. On-site follow-up visits
      will be carried out at 30, 60, 90, 180, 270 and 360 days (final consultation). At 120, 150,
      210, 240, 300 and 330 days, participants in the intervention group will receive motivational
      messages via e-mail or SMS (for these patients, consultations of 30 and 270 days will be
      group meetings). Laboratory tests (lipid and glycemic profile, serum creatinine, serum
      sodium, urinary sodium, serum potassium, urinary potassium and albuminuria) will be performed
      at baseline, 180 and 360 days; anthropometric indexes and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) will
      be also evaluated.

    <description>Quality of life evaluated by the Brazilian version of the Mini-cuestionario de calidad de vida en la hipertensión arterial. In this tool, ten items are related to the &quot;mental status&quot; domain and six items to &quot;somatic manifestations&quot;. Questions refer to the past seven days. The score scale is a likert-type scale with four possible answers (0=absolutely no; 1=yes, a little; 2=yes, fairly; 3=yes, a lot). The points range from 0 (best health level) to 30 (worst health level) for the &quot;mental status&quot; dimension, and from 0 (best health level) to 18 (worst health level) for the &quot;somatic manifestations&quot; dimension.</description>

    <description>Self-care evaluated by the Brazilian version of the Self-care of Hypertension Inventory Questionaire. This tool includes 23 items divided across 3 scales: Self-care Maintenance (11 items), Self-care Management (6 items), and Self-care Confidence (6 items). Items in the instrument are scored on a Likert-type scale. In the Self-care Maintenance domain, scores range from 1 to 5 (''never'' to ''always''). In the Self-care Management domain, 2 items range from 0 to 5 to capture a fully negative response, and other item options are scored 1 to 5. The remaining items are scored from 1 to 5 (''not likely'' to ''very likely''). In the self-care confidence scale, items are scored from 1 to 5. Scores are calculated for each scale individually. Each scale is standardized to range from 0 to 100. Self-care is considered adequate if the score is 70 or greater.</description>
