  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The PICCOLINO is a randomized health services study performed within the framework of the
      Polish Colonoscopy Screening Program (PCSP) in Poland.

      Within the study 12,298 eligible persons between 55 and 64 years of age will be drawn from
      the Population Registry and randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive an invitation to
      participate in one of the three screening strategies: (I) postal invitation to colonoscopy
      and a re-invitation to colonoscopy for initial non-responders, (II) postal invitation for
      screening using fecal immunochemical test (FIT) for non-responders and subjects refusing a
      colonoscopy, or (III) postal invitation offering a choice between FIT and colonoscopy.

      Colonoscopies will be performed in seven local centers participating in the study. FITs will
      be analyzed in the central laboratory. Subjects with positive FIT result will be recommended
      to undergo colonoscopy.

      The primary outcome is participation with CRC screening within 18 weeks after enrollment,
      defined as completion of colonoscopy, or completion of FIT along with colonoscopy for
      positive FIT result. Secondary outcome will be diagnostic yield for advanced neoplasia (CRC
      or advanced adenoma). The study has been approved by a local bioethics committee.

    <description>Subjects randomized into this group will receive named invitations for colonoscopy with pre-specified date, contact details of dedicated screening center. Invitations will be sent 6 weeks prior to suggested date of screening test. All subjects not responding to the invitation will receive a reminder letter 3 weeks prior to proposed appointment date. Additionally, a re-invitation for colonoscopy (screening test in 6 weeks) will be sent to participants not responding to the first invitation and the reminding letter.</description>

    <description>Subjects randomized into this group will be initially invited to participate in a screening colonoscopy as per group 1. All subjects who will refuse colonoscopy or do not respond to invitation within 6 weeks since the first letter, will receive another invitation letter with FIT test enclosed.
The screening office will contact persons with a positive test result in order to determine the date of the colonoscopy appointment.
A negative test result will be sent together with a recommendation to have another screening test performed 2 years later and information about the possible delivery of the test in two years.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Subjects in this group will receive a letter with an offer to choose between colonoscopy or FIT screening.
The first letter will include an invitation with a scheduled date of colonoscopy (in 6 weeks) and a FIT kit.
Three weeks before a scheduled date of colonoscopy subjects randomized into this group will receive a reminder letter with an information about proposed screening methods. After the scheduled date of the colonoscopy examination, subjects who will not respond to the invitation for colonoscopy and will not send the FIT test back to the laboratory will receive another invitation for colonoscopy (in 6 weeks) and a FIT kit.</description>
