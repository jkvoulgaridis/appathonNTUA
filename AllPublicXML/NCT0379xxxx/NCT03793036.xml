    <textblock>
      This study compared traditional concept of preoperative fasting before elective open colon
      surgery and preoperative treatment with carbohydrate oral drink in intention to improve
      postoperative stress response to surgical procedure. Hypothesis was: preoperative oral
      carbohydrate drink reduces postoperative insulin resistance, improves insulin sensitivity,
      reduces postoperative inflammatory response in terms of the value of Glasgow Prognostic Score
      (GPS) and IL-6, improves postoperative patient's subjective well-being and surgical clinical
      outcome.

      This prospective randomized, controlled clinical study was carried out in the Department of
      Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Unit and Department of Surgery at the Cantonal Hospital
      Zenica, Bosnia and Herzegovina. After obtaining ethical committee approval 50 participants,
      scheduled for elective open colon surgery were included into study. Sample size was estimated
      using sample size calculator software and power analysis with 95% confidence interval and
      power of 80%. Statistical significance was considered as p&lt; 0,05. The calculation indicated
      19 participants per group would be sufficient to detect a 50% difference for insulin
      resistance between the groups. Assuming dropout would lead to a total sample size of 50
      participants. Before each participant agreed to the join the study, the purpose and
      procedures of the study were fully explained and informed and written consent was obtained
      from each participant. A preoperative anesthetic examination was conducted the day before
      surgery. The participants who fulfilled study criteria were randomly allocated into two
      groups of 25 participants, depending on the preoperative treatment. The intervention group,
      received preoperative carbohydrate oral supplementation (CHO group) and the control group
      (FAST group) underwent to a conventional routine of preoperative fasting. Randomization was
      performed by computer generated randomization codes. The codes which indicated the treatment
      were held in sealed opaque envelopes. Nurse who conducted randomization and opened the
      envelopes the night before surgery was blinded to the study protocol as well as the surgeons,
      nurses, anesthesiologists and staff involved in data collection.

      The participants of FAST group were undergone to the traditional concept of preoperative
      fasting before surgical procedure. The participants in the intervention group received
      carbohydrate oral supplement at 10:00 pm the evening before surgery and again on the day of
      surgery, 2 hours before induction of anesthesia. Assessment of clinical parameters started at
      06:00 am on the day of surgery (basal value). The fasting peripheral venous blood samples
      were collected to measure serum levels of glucose, insulin, C-reactive protein, albumin and
      IL-6, and further 6 hours post-surgery, at 06.00 am on the first postoperative day and at
      06:00 am on the second postoperative day. All patients underwent general anesthesia followed
      by colon surgery. Assessment of subjective well-being was performed immediately before
      induction into anesthesia using a 10 cm horizontal Visual Analogue Scales and then repeated
      for 0-4, 4-8, 8-12 and 12-24 hours post-surgery. Pain at rest, pain with mobilization,
      thirst, hunger, mouth dryness, anxiety and weakness were evaluated. The patients were
      explained how to use the scale. Surgical outcome was evaluated by postoperative return of
      gastrointestinal function, time to independent ambulation and postoperative discharge day.
      Postoperative data included and the time to oral intake. The following data were recorded
      also: age, sex, body weight, body mass index, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA)
      physical status class, nutritional status of the participants according to Nutritional Risk
      Screening 2002 (NRS-2002), tumor localization, type of surgery, duration of surgery,
      preoperative fasting time and, blood loss during surgery

    <intervention_model_description>The diagnostic protocol for colon cancer was performed in patients at the surgery department. The patients with diagnosed colon tumor were prepared for the surgical procedure. After that, patients were examined to a preoperative anesthetic visit. During the visit, participants were assessed according to eligibility for enrollment in the study. The participants who have met the eligibility criteria have explained the nature of the study protocol. Those who agreed to participate in the study were randomized to one of two study groups for the duration of the study.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Triple (Care Provider, Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>Surgeons, anesthetists, and outcome assessors were masking to the treatment allocation. Masking was possible because group allocation was performed by a nurse from the surgical ward, and the attending surgeon and anesthetist welcomed the participants at the operating room the next morning without knowledge of the type of intervention. The outcome study were evaluated by independent assessors who were also masked because they evaluated patients after surgery on a daily base during hospital stay without knowledge of the type intervention.</masking_description>

    <time_frame>blood samples were taken at 06:00 am on the day of surgery ( basal value), 6 hours post-surgery, at 06.00 am on the first postoperative day and at 06:00 am on the second postoperative day.</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples were collected to measure serum levels of glucose and serum levels of insulin. Insulin resistance, was calculated according to the equation = [fasting insulin (µU/ml) x fasting glucose (mmol/L)] / 22,5 using computer model Homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance 2 Calculator version 2,2. The value &gt;1 indicated the presence of resistance to insulin.</description>

    <time_frame>The assessment of subjective well-being and pain score was performed immediately before induction into anesthesia and then repeated for 0-4, 4-8, 8-12 and 12-24 hours post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The participant's subjective well-being included: pain at rest and with movement, thirst, hunger, dry mouth, weakness, anxiety, nausea and vomiting. The mean change were measured using a 10 cm horizontal Visual Analogue Scale. The scales were undivided and limited at both ends by vertical lines. The left end represented &quot;no symptom&quot; (score:0) and the right end represented &quot;the worst imaginable&quot; (score 100) limits of the variable to be evaluated. The participants rated discomfort by marking on the scales line at the point that represented their level of perceived symptom. The distance on the scales line from score 0 to the patient's mark determined the score of symptom intensity. The score was calculated as follow: 0-1cm no symptom; 1-3 cm mild symptom; 3-7 cm moderate symptom; 7-10 cm strong symptom. The patients were questioned about presence of nausea and vomiting at five study time points. A &quot;NO&quot; answer was grade as 1 and a &quot;YES&quot; answer was graded as 2.</description>
