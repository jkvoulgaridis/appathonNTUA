  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate whether and how 'MyPlan 2.0' helps older adults to be
      more physically active or less sedentary. Two groups will be created, an intervention group
      and a waiting-list control group.

      The aim of this study is to investigate whether and how 'MyPlan 2.0' helps older adults to be
      more physically active or less sedentary. Two groups will be created, an intervention group
      and a waiting-list control group. Both groups will be tested during three testing waves:
      pretest, posttest and follow-up test. Only the intervention group will be given acces to
      'MyPlan 2.0'.

      'MyPlan 2.0' consists of a website and mobile application targeting physical activity and
      sedentary behaviour. The intervention has a duration of five weeks.

    <description>Change in amount of total, light and moderate-to-vigorous PA well as total work-related, transport-related, household-related and leisure time PA will be measured via the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). The IPAQ measures physical activity in four domains: work, transport, household and leisure time. Higher scores indicate higher levels of physical activity. For each scale the minimum value is 0. We will use the method described by Dubuy et al. (2013) to truncate the data.</description>

    <description>Change in amount of total sitting time, measured via the LASA sedentary behaviour self-report questionnaire. The total score is calculated by summing all 10 items.The minimum value is 0 and the maximum value is 24 hours. However, data will be truncated at 16 hours.</description>
