  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates muscle thickness of trunk and lower limb and balance in young and older
      healthy adults. The participants will be evaluated muscle thickness for 14 different muscle
      and balance which evaluated by computerized force plate system.

    <textblock>
      Aging had an adverse affect on musculoskeletal system and balance parameters. Decreased
      muscle strength or thickness negatively affect person's balance control. But there are no
      information in the literature about the relationships between muscle thickness and balance in
      healthy subjects. In addition to, it is not known which muscle responsible for balance.
      Therefore, this study will evaluate muscle thickness via ultrasonography and balance in young
      and older adults. Balance will be evaluated computerized Balance system. Muscle thickness for
      different 14 muscle ( diaphragm, transversus abdominis,multifidus, longissimus, quadratus
      lumborum, rectus abdominis, external and internal obliques, rectus femoris, vastus
      intermedius, vastus lateralis, tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius, soleus) will be evaluated by
      ultrasonography at the right side. Only diaphram muscle will be evaluated both right and left
      side.

    <description>Limits of stability test evaluates dynamic balance of participants. Computerized balance system measured limits of stability for forward, backward, right and left side movements. It calculates the maximum distance a person can lean without losing balance. The unit of measure is centimeters. The higher value is indicated the better balance.</description>

    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Knee joint position sense test will be evaluated using an isokinetic dynamometer. The testing included passive positioning performed by the assessor and active-repositioning performed by the participants. As the difference between the target degree and the degree is increased, the sense of position worsens.</description>
