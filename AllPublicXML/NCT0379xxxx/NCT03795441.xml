    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the shedding and kinetics of the Adenovirus Serotype
      26 Based Respiratory Syncytial Virus Pre-fusion F Protein (Ad26.RSV.preF) vaccine after one
      intramuscular injection of Ad26.RSV.preF in adults.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants with Presence of Ad26.RSV.preF (shedding) as Assessed by qPCR</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 183</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of Participants with presence of Ad26.RSV.preF in the adhesive bandage covering the injection site, the injection site area, nares (mid-turbinate), throat, rectum, urine, semen and blood, will be assessed by Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR). Percentage of participants with presence of Ad26.RSV.preF (shedding) will be assessed.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants with Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>First vaccination (Day 1) to the end of the study (Day 183)</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants with SAEs will be evaluated. An SAE is any AE that results in: death, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, is life threatening experience, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, is suspected transmission of any infectious agent via a medicinal product, is medically important, and may jeopardize participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants with Solicited Local and Systemic Adverse Events (AEs) After Vaccination</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days after vaccination (Day 1 up to Day 7)</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants with solicited local and systemic AEs will be evaluated. Solicited local AEs (erythema, swelling/induration, and pain/tenderness at the injection site) and solicited systemic AEs (fatigue, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, chills, nausea, and fever) will be noted in the participant diary through the 7 days post-vaccination. Local and systemic AEs will be graded according to severity as mild (Grade 1), moderate (Grade 2), severe (Grade 3) and potentially life threatening (Grade 4).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants with Unsolicited AEs as a Measure of Safety</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 Up to Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants with unsolicited AEs will be evaluated. An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant administered a medicinal (investigational or non investigational) product, and it does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the intervention, therefore an AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational or non investigational) product, whether or not related to that medicinal (investigational or non investigational) product. Unsolicited AEs will include all AEs for which the participant is specifically not questioned in the participant diary. Unsolicited AEs will be graded according to severity as mild (Grade 1), moderate (Grade 2), severe (Grade 3) and potentially life threatening (Grade 4).</description>

             mellitus, hyperlipoproteinemia, or hypothyroidism, as long as their symptoms and signs
             are medically controlled. If they are on medication for a condition, the medication
             dose must have been stable for at least 12 weeks preceding vaccination and expected to
             remain stable for the duration of the study. Participants will be included on the
             basis of physical examination, medical history, vital signs measurement and 12-lead
             electrocardiogram (ECG; for participants greater than [&gt;] 65 years of age only)
             performed at screening

          -  Contraceptive use by women should be consistent with local regulations regarding the
             use of contraceptive methods for participants in clinical studies

          -  All women of childbearing potential must have a negative highly sensitive serum
             beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) pregnancy test at screening and a
             negative urine beta-hCG pregnancy test immediately prior to study vaccine
             administration

          -  From the time of vaccination through 3 months after vaccination, participant agrees
             not to donate blood

             pulmonary disease or clinically significant congestive heart failure, requirement for
             supplemental oxygen, end-stage renal disease with or without dialysis, clinically
             unstable cardiac disease, Alzheimer's disease, or has any condition for which, in the
             opinion of the investigator, participation would not be in the best interest of the
             participant (eg, compromise well-being) or that could prevent, limit, or confound the
             protocol-specified assessments

          -  Per medical history, participant has chronic active hepatitis B or hepatitis C
             infection

             medical device within 30 days or received an investigational vaccine within 6 months
             before the planned administration of study vaccine or is currently enrolled or plans
             to participate in another investigational study during the course of this study

          -  Participant has received treatment with immunoglobulin in the 2 months, or blood
             products in the 4 months before the planned administration of study vaccine or has any
             plans to receive such treatment during the study
