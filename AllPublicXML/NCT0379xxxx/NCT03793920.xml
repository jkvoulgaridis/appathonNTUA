  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypothesis:

      Individuals presenting with prenatal alcohol exposure (PEA) show emotional abilities
      deficits, and imbalance between the two systems involved in decision-making according to
      dual-process models, namely an under-activated reflective system (involved in deliberate
      behaviors) and an over-activated affective-automatic one (involved in impulsive behaviors).

      Primary objective:

      To explore performance (as a percentage of correct answers) in an emotional facial expression
      decoding task in PEA participants compared to controls without alcohol disorder.

      Each participant will undergo 2 visits :

      First visit :

        -  Checking inclusion and non-inclusion criteria

        -  Note of information and consent form

        -  Record of concomitant treatments and anamnestic elements

        -  Alcohol, Tobacco, and Toxic Consumption

        -  Urinary Toxicity Test for Control Groups

        -  Laterality test (Hecaen, 1984)

        -  Brief visual and auditory acuity test

        -  Standardized psychiatric interview (Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview -
           MINI)

      Second visit = Experimental testing

        -  State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Beck Depression Inventory, Inventory of Interpersonal
           Problems, Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20).

        -  Participant installation and testing: 6 behavioral tasks on a computer (also used to
           collect responses, except for task 2, see details below) :

      Task 1 (MAIN): Test for recognition of facial emotions Task 2: 'Reading the Mind in the Eyes
      Test' (Decoding of complex emotional states) Task 3: Emotional evaluation of natural scenes
      Task 4: Target detection (measure of attentional bias towards alcohol-related stimuli) Task
      5: Go / No-Go evaluating the interactions between inhibition processes and auto-affective
      system Task 6: &quot;N-back&quot; evaluating the interactions between working memory and
      automatic-affective system

    <measure>Beck Depression Inventory score</measure>
    <time_frame>one day</time_frame>
    <description>Score at Beck Depression Inventory The BDI consisted of twenty-one questions about how the subject has been feeling in the last week. Each question had a set of at least four possible responses, ranging in intensity. (0) I do not feel sad/ (1) I feel sad./ (2) I am sad all the time and I can't snap out of it/ (3) I am so sad or unhappy that I can't stand it.
When the test is scored, a value of 0 to 3 is assigned for each answer and then the total score is compared to a key to determine the depression's severity. The standard cut-off scores were as follows:0-9: indicates minimal depression/ 10-18: indicates mild depression/ 19-29: indicates moderate depression/ 30-63: indicates severe depression.</description>

The current version has twenty statements rated on a five-point Likert scale. ( range : Strongly disagree/Disagree/ Neither agree nor disagree/ Agree/ Strongly agree)</description>
