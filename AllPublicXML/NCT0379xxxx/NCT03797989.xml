  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical study to assess the safety and feasibility of Plasmodium vivax (P. vivax)
      controlled blood-stage human malaria infection (CHMI), by inoculation using a newly created
      source of P. vivax malaria-infected blood.

      25 healthy malaria-naïve UK volunteers, aged 18 - 50, will be recruited through the five
      phases of the study at the CCVTM, Oxford. Volunteers will undergo primary, secondary and
      tertiary P. vivax blood-stage challenges, which will be induced by injection of P. vivax
      infected blood. After the first challenge, the optimal dose for blood-stage CHMI will be
      selected and used for the second and third challenges. Through each challenge period,
      volunteers will have blood taken at regular intervals to measure the parasite growth,
      quantify the sexual parasite forms and assess the immune response to P. vivax infection.
      Transmission of P. vivax from volunteers to the Anopheline mosquito vectors will also be
      assessed.

      In each challenge, following diagnosis, volunteers will be treated with a standard
      antimalarial course of oral artemether-lumefantrine (Riamet), given over 60 hours. Volunteers
      who take part in this study will be involved in the trial for approximately 2 years,
      receiving each of the three challenges at intervals of approximately 5 (and up to 9) months.
      Volunteers will be followed for 3 months after their last challenge.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aims primarily to assess the safety and feasibility of controlled blood-stage
      human P. vivax malaria infection. This will be the first time that this source of P. vivax
      infected blood will be utilised and the first P. vivax bloodstage CHMI in Europe. If
      demonstrated to be safe, it is intended that this parasitised blood bank be used in future
      CHMI studies to evaluate candidate vaccines.

      This study will also assess parasite growth, including quantifying the sexual-stage parasites
      in the blood, as well as the transmission of P. vivax from volunteers to the Anopheline
      mosquito vectors and the immune responses in primary, secondary and tertiary P. vivax
      blood-stage challenge, as further secondary aims. Natural immunity to P. vivax is acquired
      over time, following repeated exposure. Repeated blood-stage challenge would improve
      understanding of how the human immune response to P. vivax infected is acquired, and how
      parasite growth changes in a second or third exposure. Repeated challenges can also be used
      to test if potential vaccine candidates can protect against repeated malaria infection. If
      proven to be safe and feasible in this study, this will provide a basis for conducting P.
      vivax blood-stage re-challenge studies for evaluation of new vaccine candidates.

      The study is funded through MultiViVax, a European Commission Horizon 2020 funded project.

    <description>Choosing the optimal inoculation dose to take forward to future P. vivax CHMI studies will be decided based on the following algorithm:
Ideal choice = the first group (2/2 volunteers) to reach diagnosis criteria (within 21 days). N.B. If both volunteers in Group 1 develop infection AND both volunteers in Group 2 (or 3) reliably develop infection within 5 days of Group 1 (and within the 21-day window) then the lowest dose group should be chosen.</description>
