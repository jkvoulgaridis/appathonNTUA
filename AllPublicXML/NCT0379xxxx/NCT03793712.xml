    <measure>Change in Negative Symptom Scale (BNSS) total score</measure>
    <time_frame>from baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The BNSS is a brief clinician rating scale, intended to measure negative symptoms. It consists of 13 items organized into 6 subscales: anhedonia, distress, asociality, avolition, blunted affect and alogia. The items score the impairment. Items 1 to 4 are rated from 0 (Normal) to 6 (Extremely severe) and items 5 to 13 are rated from 0 (No impairment) to 6 (Severe deficit). The BNSS total score is calculated by summing the 13 individual items; subscale scores are calculated by summing the individual items within each subscale. Users of the BNSS should have training in psychiatric interview techniques and have clinical experience working with patients with schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders. The BNSS total scores ranges from 0 to 78.</description>

    <measure>Change in Personal and Social Performance (PSP) score</measure>
    <time_frame>from baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The PSP is a clinician-rated scale designed and validated to measure a patient's current level of social functioning. The PSP consists of 4 items: socially useful activities (including work and study), personal and social relationships, self-care, and disturbing and aggressive behaviours. The 4 items are assessed on a 6-point scale, from absent to very severe. Based on these assessments and their combination, individual scores are converted into a global score ranging from 1 to 100.</description>

    <measure>Change in Clinical Global Impression - Schizophrenia (CGI-SCH-S) negative symptoms score</measure>
    <time_frame>from baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-SCH is a clinician-rated scale to assess global illness severity and degree of change in patients with schizophrenia. For both the global illness severity and degree of change, the CGI-SCH consists of four different groups of symptoms (positive, negative, cognitive and depressive) and the overall severity of the disorder. The CGI-SCH-S severity of illness category symptoms and overall severity are rated on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (normal - not ill) to 7 (Among the most severely ill). For the first four ratings (positive, negative, depressive, and cognitive symptoms), the assessment should focus on the severity of symptoms only. Additionally, for 'overall severity' rating, both severity of symptoms and interference with functioning should be considered.</description>

For both the global illness severity and degree of change, the CGI-SCH consists of four different groups of symptoms (positive, negative, cognitive and depressive) and the overall severity of the disorder. In the CGI-SCH-DC degree of change category symptoms and overall severity are rated on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse). Each single rating (conditions of severity and degree of improvement) and overall ratings of severity and improvement are scored independently and no total score is derived.</description>

             Disorders Studies (MINI-Schz).

          -  The patient has been known to the site or investigator and treated by the site or
             investigator for at least the last 6 months prior to Screening Visit 1.

          -  The patient has suffered from persistent prominent negative symptoms for the last 6
             months prior to the Screening Visit 1, in the opinion of the investigator and recorded
             in medical records.

          -  The patient has been treated for schizophrenia with stable doses of an oral
             antipsychotic within the approved dose range and without any dose increase during the
             last 6 months prior to Screening Visit 1 (dose reductions are acceptable). Combination
             therapy of two antipsychotics is only allowed with the written approval of the Medical
             Monitor in cases where the second antipsychotic is a low-potency first generation
             antipsychotic drug (e.g., chlorpromazine, promazine or chlorprothixene at low doses)
             or quetiapine at a dose of ≤150 mg, given in the evening for sleep problems and where
             both can be discontinued during the washout phase without endangering the patient's
             safety. Both antipsychotics will be withdrawn during the washout phase and need to be
             discontinued before Screening Visit 2. Combination therapy of more than 2

             recreational cannabis use is acceptable). Patients with a positive drug screen test
             for opiates, methadone, cocaine, amphetamines [including ecstasy], barbiturates,
             verified by repeated testing, are excluded from the study.

          -  The patient has tested positive for hepatitis A virus antibody (anti-HAV IgM),
             hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), or hepatitis C virus antibody (anti-HCV). If the
             anti-HCV test result is positive, but acute/chronic infection is excluded with a
             negative HCV RNA test patient can be included in the study.

          -  The patient has tested positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

          -  The patient has a present condition that might compromise liver function (for example,
             alcohol abuse, hepatitis, hepatic insufficiency, cholestasis, haemachromatosis,

          -  The patient has any other disorder for which the treatment takes priority over
