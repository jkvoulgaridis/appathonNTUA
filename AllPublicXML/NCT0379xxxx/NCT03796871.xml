  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Skin cancers represent a real public health issue. The diagnosis of pre-cancerous lesions
      thus is a priority. The diagnosis gold standard is based on the combination of clinical and
      histopathological examinations. Nevertheless, the clinical examination is not sufficiently
      effective, meaning that a biopsy has to be done for each suspected lesion. In order to avoid
      unnecessary biopsy excisions, a new medical device (DERMAPOL) was designed to help
      dermatologists in diagnosing skin lesions.

      This medical device combined with its software is a strong and ergonomic spectro-polarimetric
      imager instrument. It can realize images of the superficial cutaneous tissues and
      subcutaneous tissues close to the surface by exploiting polarized light properties.

      This first clinical trial aims to demonstrate that this medical device is able to segment
      effectively healthy and tumor tissues and that it can correlate main semiological elements
      (identified thanks to the clinical and histopathological examinations) to the physico-optical
      characteristics obtained on the images of the medical device.
