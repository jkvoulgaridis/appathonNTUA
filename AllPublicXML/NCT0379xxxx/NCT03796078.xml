      ABSTRACT OBJECTIVES: To study the correlation between pharyngeal airway volume (PAV), the
      clinical indicators of obstructive sleep apnea (AHI, ESS), and the impact of orthognathic
      surgery on them.

      METHODS: A prospective, descriptive, unicentric study carried out by a multidisciplinary team
      to evaluate the following parameters in patients undergoing orthognathic surgery at
      Maxillofacial institute Teknon medical center.

      During the study period:

        -  Record of the type, magnitude and direction of surgical movements of the maxillofacial
           complex made during the surgery (Day 0-Month 1).

        -  Assessment of PAS/PAV stability (relapse) at short term (1 month).

           3D PAV assessment by cranial voxel-based superimposition protocol before and one month
           and 12 months after orthognathic surgery.

        -  Household polysomnography (PSG) registry/ apnea-hypopnea index (Day 0, Month 1 and Month
           12). (AHI evaluation bu neurophysiologist)

        -  Assessment of the clinical indicators of obstructive sleep apnea at day 0, month 1 and
           month 12:, blood pressure (mm Hg) , and daytime hypersomnia test (Epworth sleepiness
           scale, ESS) (Day 0, Month 1 and Month 12).

        -  Record of body mass index (BMI) (cm/Kg2)

      Main Objective:

      • Evaluate the impact of orthognathic surgery (bimaxillary or monomaxillary) and its
      movements on the PAV and the clinical indicators of OSA.

      Specific objectives:

      • Interrelate the degree of dentofacial deformity with the IAH.

        -  Study the potential correlation between the volume of the VAS and the IAH.

        -  Correlate the type, direction and magnitude of the surgical movements of the
           maxillofacial complex with PAV/PAS increase Correlate the type, direction and magnitude
           of the surgical movements of the maxillofacial complex with the cure of OSA (household
           PSG AHI assessment) and the following clinical indicators of OSA: diurnal hypersomnia
           test (ESD, ESS).

        -  Evaluate negative effects of either maxillary or mandibular surgical movements in
           PAS/PAV increase and the cures of OSA.

      Evaluate negative effects of either maxillary or mandibular surgical movements in the
      improvement of the clinical symptoms and the cure of OSA.

        -  To study the possible effect of surgical complications on PAS/PAV stability at long term
           and the clinical symptoms of OSA.

        -  Demonstrate that maxillomandibular surgery is a defined, predictable and a definitive
           cure for OSA.

        -  Demonstrate that skeletal, linear, and cross-sectional volume parameters remain stable
           at long-term.

        -  Demonstrate that AHI and OSA-related parameters stay stable at long term after mono- or
           bimaxillary surgery.

      Hypothesis

        -  H1a: Maxillomandibular advancement (orthognathic surgery) does correlate with the volume
           of the upper airway, at both short or long term.

        -  H2a: Maxillomandibular advancement (orthognathic surgery) does correlate with the
           clinical indicators of obstructive sleep apnea, at both short or long term.

    <description>The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) is a scale intended to measure daytime sleepiness that is measured by use of a very short questionnaire. Used clinically to screen for the manifestations of the behavioral morbidity associated to obstructive sleep apnea, first used by Johns, 1991.
The ESS asks people to rate, on a four-point scale, their usual chances of falling asleep in eight different situations. These must be answered beyond 4 punctuations ranges depending on: 0 = would never doze, 1 = slight chance of dozing, 2 = moderate chance of dozing or 3 = high chance of dozing. The total ESS score is the sum of item-scores and ranges between 0 and 24; the higher the score, the higher the person's level sleepines. A score of 10-12 is suggested as the cutoff among clinic populations being screened for a sleep disorder.</description>
