  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lateral epicondylitis (LE) is the most frequent painful musculoskeletal condition, which is
      characterized by a pain in the lateral epicondyle of the humerus and the common extensor
      tendon. The incidence of LE is approximately one to three percent of general population. LE
      is mostly the result of the overuse and repetitive movements of wrists and hands because of
      occupational or recreational activities. Diagnosis depends on clinical symptoms, history and
      physical examination including manual provocation tests. Magnetic resonance imaging,
      ultrasound (US), x-ray and electrophysiological assessment may be used in patient who do not
      response to conservative treatments. It is known that the radial nerve cross sectional-areas
      (CSAs) are increased in cases of refractory LE, although nerve conduction studies are normal.
      There is insufficient evidence to prove the superiority of any of conservative treatments to
      the others in patients with LE. The literature indicates that Kinesio taping decreases pain
      intensity, recovers grip strength, and improves functional status in patients with LE. The
      investigators design a randomized, single-blind, controlled trail to evaluate the effects of
      Kinesio taping both clinical and using ultrasonography.

      After obtaining written informed consent, patients of clinically diagnosed with LE are
      randomized into intervention and control group. To all patients, activity modification is
      suggested and 750 mg/day oral naproxen is administered for 10 days. Additionally, in
      intervention group, kinesio tape was applied 3 times a week for 2 weeks with a total of 6
      sessions. The primary outcome is visual analog scale (VAS) and secondary outcomes include the
      Patient-Rated Forearm Evaluation Questionnare (PRTEQ), CET thickness and radial nerve CSAs.
      The evaluation was performed pretreatment as well as on the 2nd week, and 6th week after the
      treatment.

    <description>Using Patient-Rated Forearm Evaluation Questionnare (PRTEQ) to evaluate functional status. The PRTEQ is a 15-item questionnaire which has two subscale: pain subscale and function subscale.. It is shown to be a reliable and valid tool for measuring pain and function in patients with LE. Pain subscale is comprised of 5 questions, and function subscale is comprised of 10 questions. The total score is calculated by the sum of these two subscales.</description>
