  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain is a common condition that affects 70% of people at least once. Sacroiliac
      joint Dysfunction (SIJD) is a skipped health problem that is ignored in patients with low
      back or hip pain. Fluoroscopy-guided SIJ injection showed that SIJD is a source of pain in
      13-30% of patients with chronic low back pain. Inadequate function of SIJ leads to abnormal
      gait pattern, pain during walking, increase in load on discs, long-term interdisciplinary
      stability and causing to increase of the listhesis. The pain worsens with running, climbing
      stairs or standing up from the sitting position. Pharmacological, non-pharmacological and if
      required surgical treatment may be applied in the osteoarthritis treatment.
      Non-pharmacological treatment includes patient education, exercise, massaging, SIJ,
      manipulation-mobilization, chiropractic applications, physical therapy modalities, use of the
      assistive device.

      Kinesio Taping is a treatment that has not been studied much and can be applied in SIJD. When
      investigators reviewed the literature, investigators found a study and a case report
      investigating the activity of Kinesio taping in sacroiliac joint dysfunction. Although the
      mechanism of Kinesio taping cannot be understood, it is claimed that it has four beneficial
      effects: normalizes muscular function, improves blood and lymphatic circulation, reduces
      pain, regulates possible disorders of joints. In studies showing the effectiveness of Kinesio
      banding in the reduction of pain in health problems related to the waist area with the
      highest number of publications, it was noted that the pain was reduced rapidly within three
      days, decreased the need for analgesics within two weeks and increased function in daily
      living activities.

      The study is a randomized, controlled study. 52 participants will be included to study who
      apply to Dokuz Eyl√ºl University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Physical Medicine and
      Rehabilitation Clinic with the complaint of hip and back pain, aged between 18-60 years.
      Participants have diagnosed as Sacroiliac Joint Dysfunction according to The International
      Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) diagnostic criteria. These participants will be
      divided into two groups randomly (Treatment group n:26, control group n:26). Because the
      therapeutic effect may be seen with unsealed banding in Kinesio taping and the placebo effect
      may not be evaluated, After the last evaluation, participants in both groups will be given
      the necessary treatment and since there is no study on this subject in the literature, no
      treatment was given to the control group due to the fact that the actual effect of banding
      was desired. The treated group received Kinesio taping 3 times at 5-day intervals, one of the
      fan-shaped cut bands, 2-3 inches above the SIJ, and the other below 2-3 inches below the SIJ,
      and crossed each other by 90 degrees. Both groups were evaluated at baseline and on the 15th
      day by physical examination of the sacroiliac joint, visual analog scale, Modified Oswestry
      Pain Inquiry Form. The kinesiological taping group was also evaluated with VAS and positive
      SIJ pain provocation tests, 20 minutes after the first banding, to assess the acute effect.
