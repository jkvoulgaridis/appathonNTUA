    <description>The teachers and students of the YoBEKA study arm receive a guided YoBEKA practice from an experienced YoBEKA trainer during the regular 4 month intervention period. The YoBEKA program is based on a combination of different, easy to perform exercises appropriate to the school situation, consisting of postures, verses for speech, song and movement, affirmations in movement to promote balance and coordination, and various rest and silence exercises to promote body awareness and relaxation techniques. The teaching is ideologically neutral and without religious background. The participating teachers receive an initial two-hour YoBEKA introductory course. Every 2 weeks there is a one to two-hour training course. The pedagogical specialists are supported once a week by an experienced YoBEKA trainer. The teachers are encouraged to integrate the learned exercises independently and regularly into their everyday school life.</description>
