  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the effect of wearing a custom-fitted, FDA-registered, Class I device, compression
      garment (Obesinov, S.A.R.L.) by an individual with a BMI ≥ 35 on his/her day-to-day quality
      of life over a period of one year. Various measures of quality of life will be taken,
      including assessing an individual's level of pain, mood, self-stigma and comfort with the use
      of a compression garment. Additionally, to assess the impact of the compression garment on
      activity, strength, posture and movement of an individual with a BMI ≥35 over the period of
      one year.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals suffering with obesity often experience daily pain and discomfort which limits
      movement, a critical factor in managing weight, cardio-metabolic health, mood, sleep,
      self-esteem and ultimately overall quality of life. Many individuals who experience weight
      gain have an abdominal or central distribution of weight which affects body mechanics leading
      to back pain, poor posture, difficulty walking with altered gait, knee, foot, ankle and leg
      pain (IT band, meralgia paresthetica) and other non-specific chronic pain. Chronic pain
      impedes mobility often incorporating depression and low motivation in an endless cycle.
      Furthermore, as individuals are losing weight, they often suffer from excess skin which also
      aggravates by chafing (arms, inner thighs), hanging down and interfering with gait.

      The Investigators will examine the effect of wearing a custom-fitted, FDA-registered, Class I
      device, compression garment (Obesinov, S.A.R.L.) by participants with a BMI ≥ 35 on
      day-to-day quality of life over a period of one year. Various measures of quality of life
      will be taken, including assessing the participant's level of pain, mood, self-stigma and
      comfort with the use of a compression garment. Additional assessments include impact of the
      compression garment on activity, strength, posture and movement as well as potential impact
      of the use of this garment on weight loss and change in laboratory measures of metabolic
      health.

    <description>SF-36 consists of 8 sub-scales of health-related quality of life measuring various aspects of functioning. The summary score for physical component includes physical functioning, physical role, bodily pain and general health scores. This sub-score is reported on a scale from 0-100 with higher numbers indicating better physical functioning.</description>

    <description>Registered FDA class I device:
The FeelWell™ Compression garment is a custom-made orthopedic abdominal binder with full or half-body support. The garments are made of 70% polyamide and 30% elastane and OEKO-TEX certified confirming human-ecological safety of textiles. The company uses a wrap knitting to ensure an optimal compression and durability. The garment has two 360 degrees whalebones in the front and two in the back to provide support for the posture, reinforcing compression on the abdomen and lower-back.</description>
