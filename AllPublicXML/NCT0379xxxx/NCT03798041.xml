  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Wound healing after surgery is a complex procedure. Liquefaction of the fat and necrosis of
      inactivated tissue, as well as blood clots are always accumulated mostly within 24 hours
      after surgery. As such, early debridement within 24 hours after surgery might improve the
      healing of the wounds. This study is designed to compare the impact of early debridement of
      the wound versus regular dressing (24 hours later) on the wound healing. 100 patients will be
      included in this study, and divided into 2 groups randomly. Then, the healing of the wound,
      stitch removal time, incidence of incision complications will be compared between the two
      groups.
