  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To understand the effects induced by acute hypoxia that sets in during surgery in breast
      cancer. To study this, clinical samples (Tumor biopsies) will be obtained during the surgery
      after partial devascularisation (sample B) and stored for future genomic and proteonomic
      evaluations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Three tumor samples will be obtained after the patient is under anaesthesia,

        1. Prior to starting surgery (Sample A)

        2. The middle intra-operative sample, which will be collected when half the tumour has been
           devascularized (i.e., somewhere midway during the surgery). (Sample B)

        3. A third post excision (anoxic sample C). These tumour tissue samples will be stored as
           snap frozen, in RNA later and as paraffin sections.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Gene expression changes</measure>
    <time_frame>The study aims to evaluate gene expression changes during surgical resection, which lasts for 30-90 minutes on an average. Thus, we have not planned a clinical follow-up or collection of data for the patients post sampling during surgical resection.</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measured will be gene expression changes during surgical resection. Messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) transcripts will be quantitated and their levels evaluated during different time-points of surgical resection, using high throughput omics technologies (Next generation sequencing, nanostring ncounter, qRT-PCR array).</description>

    <time_frame>The study aims to evaluate gene expression changes during surgical resection, which lasts for 30-90 minutes on an average. Thus, we have not planned a clinical follow-up or collection of data for the patients post sampling during surgical resection.</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary outcome measured will be protein expression changes during surgical resection. Protein levels will be quantitated, and their levels evaluated, during different time-points of surgical resection. Transcripts found to be de-regulated or changed at different time-points of surgical resection will be evaluated using IHC at protein level. We will also use high throughput omics technologies (SILAC, ITRAQ) for characterising these changes at protein levels.</description>

    <description>The changing pattern of gene expression during surgery has never been studied. This could be an effect of acute hypoxia that sets in the tumour during surgery or could be a surgical response. To study these changes happening in the tumour during surgery, we are taking serial biopsies during surgery, one at the beginning, one midway during surgery and one at the end of surgery. These samples will be snap frozen and stored at -80 deg celsius in biorepository for future analysis.</description>
