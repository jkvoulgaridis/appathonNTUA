  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate whether the personal characteristics of the endoscopist is
      associated with effect of interventions for colonoscopy quality improvement.

      This is a prospective, 9-month, multicenter, single-blind study. Baseline quality indicators
      including adenoma detection rate, polyp detection rate, withdrawal time and adenomas per
      colonoscopy of each endoscopist were measured in the health promotion centers of academic
      hospitals for 3 months. Follow-up measurements of quality indicators were repeated every 3
      months after each interventions (personal notification of quality indicators, open
      notification of quality indicators, and colonoscopy quality education by a GI faculty. At the
      end of the study, personal characteristics of each endoscopist was evaluated using fear of
      negative evaluation scale, cognitive flexibility inventory, and almost perfect scale.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Suboptimal colonoscopy quality is associated with development of interval colorectal cancer
      and colorectal cancer-related death. It is uncertain how to improve colonoscopy quality
      effectively. The quality of screening colonoscopy for colorectal cancer depends on the
      endoscopist who performed the examination. The aim of this study was to investigate the
      impact of endoscopists' personal characteristics on the quality of colonoscopy and
      effectiveness of intervention.
