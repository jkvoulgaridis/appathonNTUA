  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nucleos(t)ides analogues(NAs) is a safe and effective treatment among chronic hepatitis
      B(CHB) patients with excellent tolerance. Entecavir or tenofovir mono therapy has been shown
      to achieve inhibition of HBV replication in almost all adherent patients. However, HBsAg loss
      rate is low even after long-term NAs treatment. Recent studies indicated that cessation of
      NAs treatment could increase HBsAg clearance rate. Identifying the collected cases who can
      stop NAs safely with satisfactory clinical outcome including sustain viral remission and
      HBsAg clearance is very important.
