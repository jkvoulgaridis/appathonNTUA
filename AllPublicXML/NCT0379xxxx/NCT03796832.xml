  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic degenerative joint disease and leading cause of
      musculoskeletal pain and disability worldwide. The high rates of knee replacement surgery
      worldwide emphasize the need for more effective non-surgical interventions to attenuate
      progressive disability. International scientific and professional societies also propose that
      therapies need to seek efficacious combinations of modalities with the ultimate aim to
      achieve longer-term, optimal and synergistic treatment effects.

      Exercise therapy, such as strengthening and aerobic exercise, is universally, and strongly,
      recommended as it demonstrates beneficial effects on clinical symptoms and is considered safe
      for all patients with knee OA. However, during activities as simple as walking, higher knee
      joint loads have been demonstrated in people with medial tibiofemoral OA, a common form of
      knee OA. Increased joint loading as such may elicit aggravated symptoms and accelerated joint
      structural decline over time. No convincing evidence exists to confirm exercise therapy
      effectively alters joint loading parameters during walking gait in people with knee OA.
      Notably, recent studies suggest that wearing appropriate footwear may help offload the joint
      in people with knee OA, a strategy that is also easily applicable at a wide population level.

      The purpose of this clinical study is to compare 9-month treatment consisting of exercise
      therapy and daily wear of one of two shoe classes (flat flexible shoes or stable supportive
      shoes), on symptom relief and joint structural damage in people with knee OA. In this study,
      we will randomly allocate eligible participants in one of two treatment arms. This means
      there will be an equal amount of participants in each group, and participants nor researchers
      will be able to choose in which group participants will end up in.Participants in both groups
      will enroll in a 9 month exercise program and will be provided a pair of one of the two shoe
      classes to wear daily. To ensure an unbiased appraisal of treatment effects, we will not
      disclose the study hypotheses to participants during the intervention period.

      The results of this study will help determine whether the addition of appropriate footwear to
      exercise therapy improves symptom relief and/or slows structural disease progression in
      people with knee OA.

    <description>The 3-month supervised exercise program will consist of one group session per week of approximately 30 minutes complemented with home-based exercises 3 times per week. Group sessions will consist of a 10-min warm-up followed by a circuit training of strengthening and/or neuromuscular exercises. Subsequently, during a 6-month unsupervised home exercise program, participants will perform strengthening exercises of the lower limb muscles 3 times weekly. Throughout the 9-month intervention, participants will be encouraged to maintain a daily routine of aerobic exercises, consisting of structured activity bouts of at least 10 minutes at a moderate intensity (grade 5-6 (out of 10, maximum exertion) on a Rate of Perceived Exertion scale), achieving at least 70 minutes of weekly physical activity at 3 months and 150 minutes at 9 months.</description>
