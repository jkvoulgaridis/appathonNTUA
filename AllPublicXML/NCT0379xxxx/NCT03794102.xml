  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the rate of absorption of fluids (water or saline)
      during ureteroscopy and to assess the effects on electrolyte levels. The investigators also
      want to measure how much better the urologist can see the ureter based on the type of
      irrigation fluid that is used.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of fluid irrigation is important during urologic procedures. There is little research
      done on the use of water versus saline for irrigation during ureteroscopy.

      This study will evaluate whether the use of water or saline during ureteroscopy has any
      clinical implications. The investigators will compare the amount of fluid absorbed and
      differences in electrolytes between the two participant groups.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Amount of irrigation fluid used during ureteroscopy</measure>
    <time_frame>Measurement will be performed day of ureteroscopy</time_frame>
    <description>At conclusion of the ureteroscopy, the bag with the remaining fluid will be weighed to determine amount of fluid used. The study will last from the start to the completion of the ureteroscopy, i.e. the duration of the ureteroscopic evaluation.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in serum sodium levels</measure>
    <time_frame>Measurement will be performed day of ureteroscopy</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples will be drawn preoperatively and at conclusion of case (prior to awakening the participant) to assess the serum sodium levels (mEq/L). The study will last from the start to the completion of the ureteroscopy, i.e. the duration of the ureteroscopic evaluation.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Surgeon's rating of ureteroscopic visualization</measure>
    <time_frame>Measurement will be performed day of ureteroscopy</time_frame>
    <description>The surgeon will be asked to rate the degree of ureteroscopic visualization on a scale of 1-5, where 1=Poor visualization and 5= Excellent visualization. The study will last from the start to the completion of the ureteroscopy, i.e. the duration of the ureteroscopic evaluation.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Measurement of fluid clarity</measure>
    <time_frame>Measurement will be performed day of ureteroscopy</time_frame>
    <description>Fluid clarity was assessed by taking turbidity (cloudiness) measurements of renal fluid (in nephelometric turbidity units (NTU)) with a turbidimeter. The average of three measurements of turbidity was used at the fluid clarity measurement of each case, to supplement the ureteroscopic visualization measurement by surgeon rating. The study will last from the start to the completion of the ureteroscopy, i.e. the duration of the ureteroscopic evaluation.</description>
