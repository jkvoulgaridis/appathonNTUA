  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a feasibility study. It will assess areas of uncertainty relating to the
      implementation of an individualised exercise programme for patients with a recent kneecap
      dislocation. This will help determine if a future larger study is feasible, and inform the
      design and conduct of future research that would aim to optimise outcomes after a kneecap
      dislocation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to recruit 15 adult participants with a recent, first-time or recurrent
      kneecap dislocation, from an acute hospital. Participants will receive up to 6 physiotherapy
      sessions over 3 months. The investigator's exercise programme aims to improve leg muscle
      strength and facilitate a return to the participant's usual activities. This may include
      activities such as hopping and changing direction which differentiates it from other
      programmes. Participants will be required to perform the exercise programme 3 times a week
      independently. Strategies to increase adherence to the exercise programme will also be used.
      This study is part of a Masters in Clinical Research funded by the National Institute for
      Health Research

It will be administered as a patient completed questionnaire. Scores will be combined to give an index score, with higher scores indicating higher quality of life</description>

    <intervention_name>Individualised exercise</intervention_name>
    <description>The intervention will be comprised of up to 6, one-to-one physiotherapy sessions, over a maximum duration of 3 months. 1 or 2 extra sessions are allowed if deemed essential by the participant's physiotherapist. Less than 6 physiotherapy sessions can be agreed with the participant if they have achieved their goals. Throughout this time participants will be required to perform an exercise programme a minimum of 3 times per week. The exercise programme aims to increase leg muscle strength and facilitate a return to the participant's usual activities. It may include hopping and change of direction tasks if these are activities the participant would normally do. Behavioural change techniques to increase participant adherence to the exercise programme will also be used.</description>
