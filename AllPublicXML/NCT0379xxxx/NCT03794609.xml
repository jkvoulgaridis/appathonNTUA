      This is a registry study in children with achondroplasia, age 0-10 years, to be conducted at
      multiple clinical centers in several countries. Information collected will include in
      anthropometric characteristics, related symptoms, tests, &amp; treatments

      Children's information will be collected in the registry for a maximum of 5 years.

        It is assumed that each of the study sites will enroll approximately 10-15 children of both
        genders and of various ages (0-10 years old).

        The total number of children planned to be enrolled across all sites is approximately 200.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Written informed consent is obtained from the children's parent(s) / legal guardian(s)
             before any study-related activity is carried out

          2. The child is able to provide written informed assent, where this is required according
             to national legislation, before any study related activity is carried out

          3. The child has been diagnosed as having achondroplasia documented by clinical diagnosis

          4. The child is between 0 years and 10 years of age, inclusive, on the date of consent /
             assent

          5. The investigator has considered the family and prospective participating child being
             able to comply with the study procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The child has a diagnosis of hypochondroplasia or any short stature condition other
             than achondroplasia (eg, spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenital [SEDC],
             pseudoachondroplasia, trisomy 21)

          2. The child has any medical condition that may impact growth or where the treatment is
             known to impact growth, such as but not limited to hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism,
             insulin-requiring diabetes mellitus, autoimmune inflammatory disease (including celiac
             disease, systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE], juvenile dermatomyositis, scleroderma,
             and others), autonomic neuropathy, or inflammatory bowel disease

          3. Treatment in the previous 12 months prior to consent and assent with growth hormone,
             insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), anabolic steroids, or any other drug expected to
             affect growth velocity

          4. Any surgery that affects the growth plate of the long bones that is planned, or has
             occurred in the past 18 months

          5. Participation in any interventional study (investigational product or device) for
             treatment of achondroplasia or short stature

          6. Has had bone-related surgery impacting assessment of anthropometric measurements or is
             expected to have it during the study period. Children with previous limb-lengthening
             surgery may enroll if surgery occurred at least 18 months prior to the date of
             consent/assent and healing is complete without sequelae as determined by the
             investigator

          7. Has any condition that in the view of the investigator places the child at high risk
             of poor compliance with the visit schedule or of not completing the study.

          8. Any concurrent disease or condition that in the view of the investigator would
             interfere with study participation
