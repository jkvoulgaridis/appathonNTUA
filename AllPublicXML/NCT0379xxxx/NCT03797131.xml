  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical food study aims to explore the effect of KB195, a novel mixture of
      oligosaccharides, on the metabolism of nitrogen by the microbiome in patients with urea cycle
      disorders (UCDs). This will be done using a stable isotope to assess nitrogen metabolism in
      the blood, urine, and stool. The study will also assess the safety and tolerability of KB195
      in patients with UCDs.
