    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication of cardiac surgery, which seriously
      affects the postoperative complication rate and mortality of patients.Acute kidney injury
      occurs in 5-30% of patients after cardiac surgery, but severe acute kidney injury requiring
      dialysis is relatively rare.At present, the diagnosis of AKI is based on serum creatinine
      (Scr) or urine volume. However, the changes of serum creatinine value have hysteresis, and
      the increase of serum creatinine level lags behind kidney injury for 48 ~ 72 h.Some drugs can
      also affect creatinine levels.Urine volume is also affected by many factors.Due to the lack
      of sensitivity and specificity of SCr, it is very important to find and adopt new early AKI
      markers.Kidney is an important metabolic organ of human body. Different from cerebrovascular
      system, kidney lacks automatic regulation ability and is easily affected by perfusion
      flow.Previous experiments have shown that placing a multi-plane esophageal probe into the
      human stomach through the esophagus can monitor the changes of left renal blood flow before,
      during and after cardiovascular surgery extracorporeal circulation, and has good
      repeatability, which may become an effective means to monitor renal blood flow during
      cardiovascular surgery.

      In conclusion, this study intends to use esophageal ultrasound as a means to monitor renal
      blood flow, observe the changes of intraoperative renal hemodynamic indexes, and use KDIGO (
      Kidney Disease:Improving Global Outcomes)as the standard of renal injury to explore the
      correlation between intraoperative hemodynamic changes and postoperative AKI, providing a new
      perspective for the pathophysiological study of AKI after cardiopulmonary bypass.

      The mechanism of acute kidney injury after CPB has not been fully elucidated, and current
      studies suggest that the main mechanisms are as follows:

      (1) endogenous/exogenous nephrotoxic substances;(2) metabolic factors: mainly reflected in
      the preoperative status of patients, such as obesity, low body weight, etc.;(3) hemodynamic
      factors: hemodynamic instability is an important mechanism for further renal injury process
      such as ischemia reperfusion, which is mainly reflected in: a.preoperative and postoperative
      hypotension: cardiogenic shock caused by cardiac insufficiency and low cardiac
      displacement;Non-cardiogenic shock (vasoactive drugs/allergies/postoperative bleeding);b.
      hemodynamic instability of intraoperative intervention: deep anesthesia, intraoperative blood
      loss, CPB-related intraoperative low perfusion (long CPB time, low circulation flow, low mean
      arterial pressure in CPB), embolic release (atherosclerotic emboli/air emboli), aorta and
      distal arteriotomy;(4) neurohumoral system factors: hormones such as epinephrine,
      norepinephrine, renin and thyroxine change to varying degrees during cardiac surgery and CPB,
      thus affecting the body state and systemic blood vessels;(5) inflammation and oxidative
      stress.

      Kidney is an important metabolic organ of human body. Different from cerebrovascular system,
      kidney lacks automatic regulation ability and is easily affected by perfusion flow.For
      patients at high risk of postoperative acute kidney injury, appropriate intraoperative
      perfusion may reduce the incidence of postoperative acute kidney injury.

      Esophageal ultrasound was used as a means of monitoring renal blood flow to observe the
      changes in intraoperative renal hemodynamic indexes. Meanwhile, KDIGO was used as the
      standard for renal injury. AKI was divided into two groups according to whether postoperative
      AKI occurred, and the correlation between intraoperative hemodynamic changes and
      postoperative AKI in the two groups was discussed.It provides new ideas for the early
      diagnosis of postoperative acute kidney injury.
