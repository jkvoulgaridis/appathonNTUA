      The purpose of this study is to valuate the effectiveness of DentalVibe(DV) tool in pain
      reduction during local anesthetic injection compared to traditional injection without aid of
      DentalVibe in pediatric patients.

      This study is a crossover randomized controlled clinical trial where (N=60 ) children will be
      selected from the outpatient clinic of Pediatric Dentistry and Public Health Department,
      Faculty of Dentistry, Alexandria University after securing necessary consents. These children
      will be selected based on a need for local anesthesia for pulpotomy treatment on both sides
      of the mandible. All selected children will be randomly allocated into 2 groups. Group I
      (assigned to injection with the aid of DentalVibe tool), Group II(assigned to conventional
      injection). Each group will receive 2 mandibular nerve block injections with two different
      injection techniques, with 1-2 weeks apart as a washing out period. Mandibular nerve block
      injection will be either with vibration using DentalVibe at the injection side or topical
      analgesic (benzocaine 20%) gel will be applied before the injection of local anesthesia at
      first the appointment, and the alternative technique will be used at the second appointment .
      Injection with the aid of DentalVibe tool will act as the experimental group while the
      control group will be the use of topical analgesic (benzocaine 20%).

    <description>Pain will be assessed during local anesthesia injection by means of Wong-Baker faces scale. It consists of faces with different facial expression for happiness and pain and is scored from 0-5 as 0 is very happy and feels no pain and 5 is very painful</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective pain assessment after local anesthesia administration</measure>
    <time_frame>after performing all injections</time_frame>
    <description>After performing all the injections, pain reaction will be evaluated by two investigators independently using recorded video tapes by Face, Leg, Activity, Cry, Consolability Scale (FLACC).
The scale comprises the following parameters:
(1) Face, (2) Legs, (3) Activity, (4) Cry, and (5) Consolability. Each of the five categories is scored from 0 to 2, which results in a minimum score of 0 and maximum of 10. According to this scale 0 = relaxed and comfortable (no pain), 1-3 = mild discomfort, 4-6 = moderate pain, and 7-10 = severe discomfort or pain, A lower score represents less physical reaction than does a higher number.</description>

    <description>1 mL of Mepivacaine HCl 2%, 1/20000 Levonordefrin will be injected using a 27 gauge dental needle.
DentalVibe is a small, handheld cordless device that has a charging docking station. A demonstration of DentalVibe (DV) will be performed by putting it into direct contact with the children's nails before applying the device intraorally. Then, the device will be placed on the oral mucosa to enclose the injection site before administering local anesthesia and Potential subject-expectancy effects and pressure from the placement of DV will be controlled. The device will be turned on to stimulate the area of needle penetration. After 5 seconds of vibration, the needle will be inserted. The device will continue vibrating during needle insertion and anesthetic injection.</description>
