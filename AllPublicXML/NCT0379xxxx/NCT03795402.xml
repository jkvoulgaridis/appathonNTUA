        Participants with mild chronic plaque psoriasis vulgaris, defined as having a body surface
        area (BSA) greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 1 percent (%) and less than (&lt;) 10% (excluding
        palms, soles, face, scalp, and genitals), will be included in this study.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant has a history of chronic plaque psoriasis vulgaris for at least 6 months
             prior to the screening visit

          -  Participant has had stable psoriasis conditions for at least 3 months before screening
             (information obtained from medical chart or participant's physician, or directly from
             the participant)

          -  Participant has plaque psoriasis covering &gt;= 1% but &lt; 10% of his total BSA on Day 1

          -  For Group A: Participant has one psoriasis target lesion or individual lesions within
             the same anatomical region (excluding palms, soles, face, scalp, and genitals), with a
             target lesion severity score (TLSS) score of &gt;= 6 on Day 1 allowing the collection of
             three microneedle device samples and one biopsy sample

          -  For Group B: Participant has one psoriasis target lesion or individual lesions within
             the same anatomical region (excluding palms, soles, face, scalp, and genitals), with a
             TLSS score of &gt;= 6 on Day 1 allowing the collection of one microneedle device sample
             per visit (replicating the extraction on the same area at each visit) and one biopsy
             sample

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant is a female who is breastfeeding, pregnant, or who is planning to become
             pregnant during the study

          -  Participant has evidence of erythrodermic, pustular, predominantly guttate psoriasis,
             or drug-induced psoriasis

          -  Participant has a history of skin disease or presence of skin condition that, in the
             opinion of the investigator, would interfere with the sample collection or
             interpretation

          -  Participant is known to have immune deficiency or is immunocompromised

          -  Participant has a history of cancer or lymphoproliferative disease within 5 years
             prior to Day 1. Participants with successfully treated nonmetastatic cutaneous
             squamous cell or basal cell carcinoma and/or localized carcinoma in situ of the cervix
             are not to be excluded
