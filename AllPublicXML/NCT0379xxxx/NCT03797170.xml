  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Europe diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a rare disease whereas in Italy it is not.
      Approximately 40% of DLBCL patients has refractory disease or will relapse after initial
      response. In onco-hematology, a role for gut microbiota (GM) in mediating immune activation
      in response to chemotherapy, has been suggested. In this scenario, the Investigators
      hypothesized that GM could play an important role in DLBCL prognosis and response to
      treatment, establishing a connection between lifestyle and clinical response. The project is
      aimed to the study of the functional GM layout in association with specific patterns of
      treatment response in de novo DLBCL undergoing standard first line chemo-immunotherapy.
      Results may build the scientific basis to design new and personalized intervention strategies
      (both in treatment approach and in life-style recommendations), to enhance clinical response
      and reduction of disease refractoriness through modulation of the gut microbial ecosystem.

    <measure>GM dysbiosis assessment (bacterial DNA of gut microbiota in all patients)</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>dysbiosis index: the dysbiosis index relies on the calculation of the weighted ratio between health-promoting and disease-associated GM components
relative abundance of GM biomarkers of an eubiotic GM state: all GM dysbiotic states share a common feature, i.e. the depletion of strategic health-promoting GM components such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Lachnospiraceae. Thus, a GM dysbiotic state is determined by the assessment of a reduction of the abundance of these GM biomarkers below the thresholds characteristic of an eubiotc GM state.</description>

        Patients affected by diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) undergoing therapy with

          2. Patients affected by histologically confirmed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma

          3. Patients amenable for therapy with RCHOP (RCHOP is the standard first line therapy for
             DLBCL and it scheduled regardless of participation in present study).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Concomitant second malignancy, other than lymphoma.

          2. Previous anti-lymphoma therapy.

          3. Pregnancy or breastfeeding.

          4. Evidence of significant, uncontrolled concomitant diseases that could affect
