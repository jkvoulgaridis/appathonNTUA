  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The timeliness of routine childhood immunization should be an important component in
      measuring vaccination coverage rates especially in LMIC countries like Nigeria, yet this is
      overlooked. This study will determine the age- specific immunization timely uptake rates for
      the various vaccines covered in the routine childhood immunization and seek out factors that
      affect timely vaccine uptake among Nigerian children.

      This study will determine the extent of timely and complete routine childhood vaccination
      uptake in Nigeria. The investigators will also seek to understand the factors that influence
      timely/complete uptake and make recommendations. this study will also determine if the
      present immunization records system in Nigeria is capable of measuring timely immunization
      uptake.

    <measure>Age specific timely vaccination rate for all vaccines in routine vaccination schedule</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measure, age- appropriate immunization is defined as receipt of a scheduled vaccine dose within 30 days of the recommended age. Timeliness will be calculated using child health card data as at 31st December 2018. Descriptive statistics will be produced to describe the characteristics of the sample using frequencies and proportions. Descriptive outcome measures for each dose will be coded as either 'no delay'- age appropriately immunized, delay of 1-6 months' , 'delay greater than 6 months', vaccine received 'acceptably early' (within 30 days prior to when it was due), vaccines received 'too early' (within 30 days prior to when it was due) or vaccine dose not recorded.</description>
