  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial compared changes in Mexican-American, adolescent
      standardized body mass index (zBMI) from a school-based obesity intervention given zero, one,
      three, or five days a week.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Efficacious school-based interventions have been intensive making it difficult for
      interventions to be scaled. The more components there are to an intervention, typically the
      better the results. Instead of decreasing intensity via the removal of intervention
      components, this randomized controlled trial aimed to compare changes in Mexican-American
      adolescent standardized body mass index (zBMI) based on the number of days per week they
      received a multi-component intervention. Mexican-American middle school students (n=203) with
      overweight or obesity were recruited from an independent school district in Houston. Students
      were randomized to receive an obesity intervention with established efficacy zero (control),
      one, three, or five days/week. In each condition, 80% of intervention time was allocated to
      physical activity and 20% to nutrition. Directly measured height and weight were used to
      calculate zBMI.

    <description>The intervention consisted of nutrition lessons based on the traffic light diet, circuit-based physical activity, behavior modification techniques (token economy system, goal setting, self-monitoring), and parental involvement (materials sent home and monthly parent meetings). 80% of time was spent on physical activity and 20% was spent on nutrition. Behavior modification was incorporated into both physical activity and nutrition time. Specifically, instruction and activity time during PE class lasted approximately 40 minutes.</description>
