  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (diclofenac, kotorolac, piroxicam) opioids
      (petidine, tramadol, fentanyl), paracetamol and topical agents (EMLA, diclofenal gel), have
      been shown to be effective in the treatment of renal colic . NSAIDs are commonly used to
      treat renal colic, but they can reduce renal blood flow and cause kidney damage. In addition,
      there are limitations in use in cases such as gastrointerstinal ulcers, hepatic insufficiency
      and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Gastrointestinal complications (ulcers, reflux,
      etc.) may cause hypersensitivity reactions (allergy) and coagulation disorders. On the other
      hand, opioids may cause nausea, vomiting, hypotension, sedation, dizziness and even
      respiratory depression. In addition to these pharmacological agents, stair-stroke, Turkish
      bath, blanket or hot water bag and local warming are now used in the treatment of renal colic
      in traditional methods.

      Heat Wrap is an effective, natural solution designed to remove muscle pain with the help of
      heat and used regularly by physical therapists. The heat wrap is activated by air contact
      within a few minutes after its removal from its sheet and does not contain any drugs. It
      contains heat from the active iron particles in contact with air. After a few minutes of
      application, it begins to spread the natural, long-term (8 hours) heat by targeting the
      source of the pain. The patient satisfaction is high because it is odorless and thin.

      In the literature, considering the success of heat therapy in patients with renal colic (bath
      entrance, electric blanket heating) in this study we have aimed to evaluate the efficacy of
      alternative treatment with pain-relieving alternative treatments with little potential for
      side effects and to see its applicability in daily treatment plans.
