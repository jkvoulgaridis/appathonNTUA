  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intraoperative pathological diagnosis such as frozen section and imprint cytology is not
      routinely recommended in clinical practice because of time and accuracy concerns. Full-field
      optical coherence tomography (FF-OCT) is a new optical imaging technique that could generate
      sectioning tomogram from fresh tissue and provide close-to-pathology depiction of the
      morphological structure and pathological changes in minutes without conventional tissue
      preparation, slicing, and staining, and dynamic cell imaging (DCI) added the viability
      information of cells/tissue, which could be more important in cancer diagnosis. This study
      was to evaluate the feasibility and diagnostic value of FF-OCT and DCI in breast lesions and
      lymph node specimens during breast cancer surgery. We evaluated normal breast tissue, benign
      breast lesions, breast cancer and axillary lymph node specimens resected from patients
      undergoing breast surgery.

      Light-CT, a special-designed pathology-approximation system which is based on the lighting
      feature or dynamic feature of tissue and cells, is used to detect malignant cells or tissue
      in fresh specimens. Morphological structure and pathological changes could be captured in
      minutes, which implies a possible application in intraoperative diagnosis. In this study,
      fresh breast tissue, fat, benign breast lesions, breast cancer and axillary lymph node
      specimens are collected to assess the usefulness of Light-CT. During the in vitro
      examination, both FF-OCT and DCI images are obtained and stored. Imaging analysis would be
      performed in traditional imaging analysis like manner and an artificial intelligence aided
      approach as well.

    <description>Fresh specimen is trimmed into a block with a size not larger than 2.5 cm (Typically not larger than 1.5 cm). Prepared specimen is submitted to Light-CT tests. FF-OCT images are obtained to depict the structure information and DCI images are generated to collect the dynamic information of the cell and tissue. After the imaging detection, specimens are submitted for routine pathological diagnosis to obtain corresponding pathological images.</description>
