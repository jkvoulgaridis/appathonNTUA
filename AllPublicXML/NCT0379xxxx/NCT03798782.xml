  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates two methods of aortic heart valve replacement in adults aged 18-60, the
      Ross procedure versus conventional aortic valve replacement using a biologic or mechanical
      heart valve. The Ross procedure replaces a patient's diseased aortic valve with his/her own
      pulmonary valve and uses a donor valve in the pulmonary position which receives less stress
      than the aortic valve. Mechanical valves tend to form blood clots so they need long-term
      blood thinners that increase risk of bleeding and lower quality of life. Animal tissue valves
      reduce clotting and bleeding risks but wear out sooner and shorten patient life-span.

      Heart valves help control blood flow through the heart and, if diseased, may need to be
      replaced. After having a heart valve replaced, patients have a higher risk of death than
      people who have not had a valve replaced. In young adult patients, replacing the aortic heart
      valve with a mechanical valve halves their life-span compared to other people their age.
      Mechanical valves tend to form blood clots so they need long-term blood thinners that
      increase risk of bleeding and lower quality of life. Animal tissue valves reduce clotting and
      bleeding risks but wear out sooner and shorten patient life-span. An operation, called the
      Ross procedure, replaces a patient's diseased aortic valve with his/her own pulmonary valve
      and uses a donor valve in the pulmonary position which receives less stress than the aortic
      valve. The Ross procedure aims to improve valve durability with less clotting, avoiding use
      of blood thinners. Patients and physicians need a large, high-quality study comparing the
      Ross procedure and standard valve replacement to know if either approach is better.

      The investigators will perform a 3-year feasibility study in seven sites, in Canada and
      abroad, to test the study design and ability to do a larger, conclusive study comparing the
      impact of the Ross procedure to standard valve replacement on survival without valve-related
      life-threatening complications. Patients will be randomized, like flipping a coin, to receive
      the Ross or standard valve surgery. The goals are 1) to evaluate if the investigators can
      recruit 6 patients per site per year, 2) to test if the assigned procedure is performed in
      over 90% of study patients, and 3) to see how many mechanical vs. tissue valves are used in
      the standard valve group. Patients eligible but not enrolled in the trial will be asked if
      the investigators can collect some data on how they do after their surgery. If the
      investigators show the study is feasible, they will proceed to the full study and will
      include the feasibility patients in the full study.

    <measure>Full trial primary outcome - The rate of survival free of a composite of life-threatening valve-related complications (major bleeding, stroke or systemic thromboembolism, valve thrombosis, and operated-on valve reintervention)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through trial completion, estimated to be 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome is the rate of survival free of life-threatening valve-related complications (major bleeding, stroke or systemic thromboembolism, valve thrombosis, and operated-on valve reintervention) over duration of follow-up. Assessment of this composite over time is particularly important, as the Ross procedure may show initial benefit secondary to thromboembolic and bleeding reduction, however should the technique show high late rates of reoperation as suggested in some observational literature, the effect magnitude may change significantly over time.</description>

Systemic arterial embolism is an abrupt vascular insufficiency associated with evidence of arterial occlusion in the absence of other likely mechanisms. Clinical signs/symptoms must be consistent with embolic arterial occlusion, there must be clear evidence of abrupt occlusion of a systemic artery, with at least one type of supporting evidence (surgical report indicating evidence of arterial embolism, pathological specimens related to embolism removal, imaging evidence consistent with arterial embolism, or autopsy report).</description>

    <time_frame>Annually through trial completion, estimated to be 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 is a health related quality of life questionnaire that measure eight health domains and each survey provides psychometrically-based physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) scores. The domains are physical functioning, bodily pain, role limitations due to physical health problems, role limitations due to personal or emotional problems, emotional well-being, social functioning, energy/fatigue, and general health perceptions. The questionnaire is calibrated such that scored values of 50 represent the norm and higher scored values according to the scoring key represent a more favourable health state. A baseline score will be obtained prior to the patient's surgery and the SF-36 will be administered annually thereafter over the duration of patient follow-up.</description>
