  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to evaluate and compare the effect of the Pilates method
      associated with aerobic exercise and the traditional Pilates method on the blood pressure of
      hypertensive medicated women. In addition, we aim to analyze and compare the chronic effects
      of training on cardiac autonomic modulation, on cardiorespiratory fitness, functionality and
      quality of life.

      Subjects will be allocated randomly in three groups: (1) Traditional Pilates group, which
      will perform only exercises based on the traditional Pilates method, (2) Modified Pilates
      group, which will perform exercises based on the Pilates method alternated with active rest
      periods on treadmill ergometer, (3) Control group: will not perform any physical exercise
      during the trial period. The sessions will be performed two times a week, during 16 weeks.
      Subjects will be evaluated before and after 16 weeks of intervention.

    <time_frame>Change from baseline and at 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The ventilatory threshold will be measured by the cardiopulmonary exercise test.

    <measure>Analysis of the quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline quality of life at 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life will be analyzed by means of the questionnaire World Health Organization Quality Of Life/Bref (WHOQOL/bref). The questionnaire has twenty-six questions that involve different aspects of daily life and deal with four domains of quality of life: physical, psychological, environmental and social relations. The response is represented by scores ranging from one to five, with the worst score being one and the best score being five. The results of the domains have values between zero and one hundred, with the worst being the closest to zero and the best the closest to one hundred, thus, a value equal to 50 for a given domain can be considered median for that domain.</description>
