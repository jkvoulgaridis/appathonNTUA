    <textblock>
      Prevalence of alexithymia in multiple sclerosis (MS) is closed to 50% but is unknown in
      clinically isolated syndrome (CIS).The present study sought to characterize alexithymia in
      CIS patients and his link between psycho behavioral and cognitive disturbances.

      In this context, the objectives of the present study were to (a ) define the prevalence of
      alexithymia in CIS patients, (b ) to study this relation between psycho behavioral and
      cognitive disorders frequently encountered in MS.

      The aim to recruit 40 CIS patients with at least two subclinical lesions on brain MRI.
      Patients are tested only one month at least after steroids intake and after 6 weeks at least
      after any relapse. The control group include 40 right -handed participants; each of them are
      matched for age, gender, and education level with a CIS patient.

      The parameters to be evaluated are:

      The prevalence of alexithymia is assessed by The Toronto Alexithymia Scale TAS-20, a
      self-reported scale. The TAS-20 total score corresponds to global level of alexithymia, as
      the sum of these three subdomains: 1.Difficulties in Identifying Feelings (DIF); 2.
      Difficulties in Describing Feelings (DDF); 3. Externally Oriented Thinking (EOT).

      Standard neurological examination is performed by a neurologist using the Kurtzke Expanded
      Disability Status Scale (EDSS ).

      The standardized neuropsychological battery, named BCcogSEP, is administrated. The BCcogSEP
      is made of eight tests commonly impaired in MS. Fourteen scores were obtained and a score was
      considered impaired when it was inferior to 5th percentile range compared to the normal
      range. The number of impaired scores are considered and a cognitive impairment is considered
      when 4 scores are superior or equal to percentile 5th.

      For psychobehavioral assessments, the investigators estimated (a) depression (according to
      the Beck Depression Inventory; BDI (30)) and anxiety (according to the State-Trait Anxiety
      Inventory (31)); (b) apathy (according to the Lille Apathy Rating Scale (32)); (c) empathy
      (according to Interpersonal Reactivity Index; IRI).

    <description>alexithymia is defined according to TAS-20 (Toronto Alexithymia Scale) The Toronto Alexithymia Scale is a measure of deficiency in understanding, processing, or describing emotions. The current version has twenty statements rated on a five-point Likert scale. ( range : Strongly disagree/Disagree/ Neither agree nor disagree/ Agree/ Strongly agree)</description>

    <description>Psychobehavioral assessments use the following Tools :
We estimated depression according to the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) The BDI consisted of twenty-one questions about how the subject has been feeling in the last week. Each question had a set of at least four possible responses, ranging in intensity. (0) I do not feel sad/ (1) I feel sad./ (2) I am sad all the time and I can't snap out of it/ (3) I am so sad or unhappy that I can't stand it.
When the test is scored, a value of 0 to 3 is assigned for each answer and then the total score is compared to a key to determine the depression's severity. The standard cut-off scores were as follows:0-9: indicates minimal depression/ 10-18: indicates mild depression/ 19-29: indicates moderate depression/ 30-63: indicates severe depression.</description>
