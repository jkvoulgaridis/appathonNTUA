    <measure>Residual Effect on a Cognitive Test Battery Evaluated by Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 5</time_frame>
    <description>The SDMT is a widely used, paper-and-pencil assessment of complex scanning and visual tracking, requiring elements of attention, visuoperceptual processing, working memory, and cognitive/psychomotor speed. The test is viewed as a robust screening test for adult neuropsychological impairment and has been used to demonstrate worse cognitive functioning in patients with MDD. The test includes a coding key consisting of 9 abstract symbols, each paired with a number ranging from 1 to 9. Following the key, the participant is presented with randomly ordered symbols and is required to write the number corresponding to each symbol as fast as possible. The number of correct substitutions within 90 seconds is recorded by examiner-administered cognitive test battery.</description>

    <measure>Performance Score on a Cognitive Test Battery Evaluated by Trail Making Test Form B (TMT-B)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 5</time_frame>
    <description>The TMT-B measures divided attention and executive function (tracking and sequencing). The participant is instructed to draw a line to connect a set of 25 consecutively numbered and lettered circles, alternating sequentially between numbers and letters (that is, 1-A-2-B). The participant is instructed to work as quickly as possible while still maintaining accuracy. The TMT-B has acceptable reliability; reliability coefficients have typically been reported as exceeding 0.65. The TMT-B is sensitive to cognitive decline associated with MDD.</description>

    <measure>Residual Effect on Cognitive Function Measured by Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 5</time_frame>
    <description>The HVLT-R, a measure of verbal learning and memory, is a 12-item word list recall test. Administration includes 3 learning trials, a delayed recall (20-minute) trial, and a 24-word recognition list (including 12 target and 12 foil words). The test administrator reads instructions and word lists aloud, and records words recalled/recognized by the participant. Three learning trials are combined to calculate a total recall score learning, delayed recall, and recognition trials.</description>
