  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Body Image distortion is a key diagnostic feature for Anorexia Nervosa. Patients suffering
      from Anorexia Nervosa tend to perceive themselves as fatter than they are. This bias might be
      at the origin of a reinforcement of anorectic behavior which might alter medical care. The
      objective of this study is to identify neural correlates of self-recognition in Anorexia
      Nervosa. Patients are hypothesized to activate the self-recognition network when seeing
      images of a fatter body shape than their own.

      Patients suffering from Anorexia Nervosa and control subjects (matched by age and study
      level) are recruited in medical care facilities in Lille's Metropolis. They are asked to
      identify their body shape when being presented with 3 different stimuli, i.e.real (RBS),
      estimated (EBS) and neutral body shape (NBS), in a functional magnetic resonance imaging or
      functional MRI (fMRI) machine. While answering to this identification paradigm, we hoped to
      identify modifications in the self body-recognition network.
