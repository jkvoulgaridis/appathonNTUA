    <textblock>
      Non-vigorous infants enrolled in the MINVI trial will be approached for consent for ongoing
      data collection. As part of the data collection, an optional echocardiogram will be performed
      if the parent consents. The consent will have a check box to indicate if they consent to the
      additional test.

      Echocardiographic measurements will be performed on all infants at 12 hours +/-3 hours of age
      by our research sonographers who are blinded to infant randomization. Measurements will be
      taken according to a standard operating procedure to assess systemic blood flow, by superior
      vena cava (SVC) flow (ml/kg/min), right ventricular output (ml/kg/min), left ventricular
      output (LVO) (ml/kg/min), measures of left and right venitricular tissue Doppler and strain
      imaging. These measurements will be performed off line at a later time. Data will be entered
      into REDCap.

      If any structural abnormalities are found, the attending pediatrician will be notified of the
      abnormal echocardiogram. The consent will clearly state that this echo is not for diagnostic
      purposes. Any additional studies including an official complete echocardiogram and or
      cardiology consultation will be left to the discretion of the attending pediatrician, as
      he/she deems necessary

    <description>The delivering practitioner will place the newborn below the level of the incision (at the edge of the table) at C/S and a second team member will milk the cord four times. For vaginal delivery, the delivering obstetrician, midwife or perinatal provider will hold the infant against their body or place the infant on the mother's abdomen and the cord will be milked either four times by the obstetrical provider or by a second team member. For the cord milking procedure, the obstetrical provider will milk the entire length of umbilical cord over two seconds, repeating three additional times as described previously. This time is not significantly different from the time for ECC as we have demonstrated in our previous trials.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Early Cord Clamping</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>This will occur by clamping the umbilical cord as soon as possible. Since both ECC and UCM will occur after a brief assessment, it is important to note that the cord clamping time will be longer than in previously conducted preterm trials (average 20 seconds) which performed the intervention on all subjects regardless of whether or not they were vigorous. In all cases, the cord clamping time will be documented to ensure consistency.</description>

    <intervention_name>Umbilical Cord Milking</intervention_name>
    <description>At delivery, the umbilical cord is grasped, and blood is pushed toward the infant 4 times before the cord is clamped. This procedure infuses a placental transfusion of blood into the infant and can be done in 15-20 seconds.</description>
