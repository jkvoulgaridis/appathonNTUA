  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Body weight supported treadmill training (BWSTT) is an important rehabilitative choice for
      neurologically impaired subjects such as Parkinson's disease (PD). The aim of the study is to
      evaluate the effectiveness of different percentages BWSTT on gait, balance, quality of life
      and fatigue in moderate to advanced PD.

      Body weight supported treadmill training (BWSTT) is an important rehabilitative choice for
      neurologically impaired subjects such as Parkinson's disease (PD). The aim of the study is to
      evaluate the effectiveness of different percentages BWSTT on gait, balance, quality of life
      and fatigue in moderate to advanced PD. Thirty five patients were randomly assigned to one of
      the three groups according to the percentage unweighed: 0% BWSTT, 10% BWSTT and 20% BWSTT.
      All patients participated 30 minutes BWSTT sessions 5 days a week, for 6 weeks. Primary
      outcomes were 6 minute walk test (6MWT), Berg balance scale (BBS), Unified Parkinson's
      Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS); and secondary outcomes were Nottingham health profile (NHP),
      Fatigue Impact Scale (FIS) and Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) which were performed at the
      beginning and end of the rehabilitation.

    <measure>6 Minute Walk Test (6MWT)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Functional exercise capacity was assessed by distance walked in 6 minutes (6MWT). The patient was asked to walk as long as possible for 6 minutes on a 30 meters of marked and flat ground, at a self selected speed. 6MWT is a submaximal exercise test and can be used to assess treatment response .</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Berg Balance Scale (BBS):</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It contains 14 instructions and 0 - 4 points is given for each instruction according to the performance of the patients. 0 points are given when the patient totally could not do the activity while 4 points are given when the patient completes the activity independently.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS):</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It is used to follow the clinical status of PD. It consists of four main parts (totally 183 points): mentation, behavior and mood (UPDRS I: 16 points), activities of daily living (UPDRS II: 52 points), motor examination (UPDRS III: 92 points), treatment complications (UPDRS IV: 23 points).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Nottingham Health Profile (NHP):</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It contains 38 items that address pain, physical mobility, emotional reactions, energy, social isolation, and sleep dimensions. Higher scores indicate worse quality of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fatigue Impact Scale (FIS):</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This scale assesses the cognitive, physical and social effects of fatigue during the last one week in a total of 40 - item questionnaire (0 = no problem, 4 = maximum problem).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS):</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This scale assesses the severity of fatigue during the last one week in a total of 9 - item questionnaire (1 = strongly disagree, 7 = strongly agree). The total score ranges from 9 - 63, in which higher score means higher severity of fatigue .</description>
