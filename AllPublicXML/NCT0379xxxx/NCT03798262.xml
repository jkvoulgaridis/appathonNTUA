  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will investigate the effects of acute and sub-acute administration of
      gluten on mood, intestinal permeability, gastrointestinal symptoms and gut peptide levels in

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The effect of gluten acutely and sub-acutely on extraintestinal symptoms in HV measured on the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule</measure>
    <time_frame>At the beginning of test visit 0 (day 0), visit 1 (at day 15), test visit 2 (at day 20), after test visit 3 (at day 36), after test visit 4 (at day 41)</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline. Scores can be 'very slightly or not at all', 'a little', 'moderately', 'quite a bit', 'extremely'. Measured at day 0, day 15, day 20, day 36 and day 41.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The effect of gluten acutely and sub-acutely on extraintestinal symptoms in HV measured on the Profile of Mood State.</measure>

    <description>Change from baseline. Scores are measured on the Visual Analogue Scale. The scale is ranged 0 - 10, in which 0 no occurrence of the symptom and 10 a lot occurrence of the symptom. Measured at day 0, day 15, day 20, day 36 and day 41.</description>

    <description>Change in lipopolysaccharide-binding protein levels measured at day 0, day 21 and day 41.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Effect of acute and sub-acute gluten administration on Lipopolysaccharide levels in blood samples</measure>
    <time_frame>During test visit 0 (day 0), test visit 2 (at day 21), after test visit 4 (at day 41)</time_frame>
    <description>Change in lipopolysaccharide levels measured at day 0, day 21 and day 41.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Effect of acute and sub-acute gluten administration on gut microbiota composition (stool samples)</measure>
    <time_frame>After test visit 0 (day 0), day 13 and day 14, after test visit 1 (day 15), day 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20, two days before test visit 3 (day 34 and 35), day 36, 37, 38, 39, 40</time_frame>
    <description>Change in gut microbiota composition (compared to day 0) with focus on: Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, Enterobacteriaceae, E. coli; measured in stool samples. Analyses will provide an overall view of the gut microbiota composition.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Effect of acute and sub-acute gluten administration on cortisol awakening response (saliva samples)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day before test visit 1 (day 14), test visit 1 (day 15), test visit 2 (day 21), day before test visit 3 (day 35), test visit 3 (day 36) and test visit 4 (day 41)</time_frame>
