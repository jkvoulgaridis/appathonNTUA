    <textblock>
      This 2-year trial is intended to be used to study breast cancer patients through
      forward-looking generation design through collaboration between Chinese and Western medical
      teams. The whole study consists of 2 stages, stage I comprises a cross-sectional
      study-baseline and stage II is a cohort for outcome evaluation and follow-up study across a
      3-year period. To provide an empirical basis for combined TCM treatment in the Breast Cancer
      Research Team and to publish that as a reference for future TCM and Western medicine in
      integrative cancer treatment.

      Breast cancer is a major health issue for women worldwide and has increased exponentially in
      the last decades. Improved earlier detection combined with adjuvant systemic therapy is
      responsible for much of the reduction in cause-specific mortality from breast cancer.
      Chemotherapy after surgery can decrease the risk of recurrence and is often used as routine
      treatment in clinic. Because of the fact that a considerable number of patients seek for
      traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) during adjuvant chemotherapy, it is thus need to evaluate
      the correlation between TCM treatment and prognosis. The investigators design a single
      center, prospective cohort study began in November 2018 in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. A sample of 104
      participants diagnosed with early breast cancer was recruited from Breast Cancer Research
      Team and are followed up every 3 to 6 months till October 2023. Detailed information of
      participants includes general information, history of cancer, quality of life, side effects
      of chemotherapy and safety of treatment, body constitution of TCM and meridian energy
      analysis is taken face-to-face at baseline.
