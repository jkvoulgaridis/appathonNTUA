  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Smoking rates remain above 60% for individuals involved in the criminal justice system and
      contribute to elevated mortality rates in this population. Addressing smoking disparities
      among justice-involved individuals is a critical public health issue in Minnesota, one of a
      few states with rising incarceration rates. People who are incarcerated represent the
      intersection of multiple high-priority populations (disproportionately African-American,
      Native American, low-income, homeless, on Medicaid, and suffering from mental illness and
      substance use disorders). This study examines the impact of a smoking cessation intervention
      for individuals discharged from jail to the community on smoking abstinence. Participants
      will be randomized to either 1) guideline-based, in-person smoking cessation counseling
      during incarceration, telephone counseling after incarceration, and nicotine replacement, or
      2) enhanced treatment as usual. This study's findings will be used to develop a larger,
      multi-site study that is fully powered to measure longer-term health and smoking cessation
      outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Outcome assessments will be conducted for both arms at 1 week, 3 weeks, and 12 weeks post
      discharge from jail. During these assessments, seven-day point prevalence abstinence will be
      bio-verified with exhaled carbon monoxide, and self-reported general health, physical health,
      mental health, and substance use measures will also be obtained. The analysis is fully
      powered (i.e., power &gt; .8) to detect significant between group effects on the primary outcome
      (i.e., the longitudinal, between group effect on bio-verified seven-day point prevalence
      abstinence over the 3 weeks post discharge). All analyses will be conducted on the intent to
      treat sample and will utilize pre-specified logistic and linear regression models.
