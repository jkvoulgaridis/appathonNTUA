      The primary objective of this post-market study is to demonstrate that Oswestry disability
      index (ODI) score improved significantly at 12 months post-operatively as compared to
      baseline for each indication (degenerative spinal disease and deformity) in subjects with
      compromised bone quality, who will receive a surgical procedure requiring posterior
      stabilization and/or immobilization of one or more spinal segments using CD HORIZON®
      Fenestrated Screw Spinal System with Fenestrated Screw Cement.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in ODI (Oswestry Disability Index) at 12 months compared to baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Disability associated with thoracic/lumbar spine conditions will be assessed using the Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire, which yields the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Version 2.1a.This validated instrument is considered one of the principal condition-specific outcome measures used in the management of spinal disorders.
ODI is composed by 10 sections. Each section can be scored 0 to 5, 5 being the worst case. The score is calculated by summing the different sections and then doubling the total. Maximum score is 100.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in ODI from Baseline at 3 and 24 month visit from baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3, 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Disability associated with thoracic/lumbar spine conditions will be assessed using the Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire, which yields the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Version 2.1a. [23]. This validated instrument is considered one of the principal condition-specific outcome measures used in the management of spinal disorders.
ODI is composed by 10 sections. Each section can be scored 0 to 5, 5 being the worst case. The score is calculated by summing the different sections and then doubling the total. Maximum score is 100.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in VAS (Visual Analogue Scale) back and leg pain score at 3, 12, and 24 month from baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3, 12, 24</time_frame>
    <description>Levels of back pain and leg pain will be measured using the Visual Analogue Scales (VAS). Subjects will be asked to rate the amount of back pain and leg pain they have had in the last week, where 0 is no pain and 10 is the worst pain possible.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in EQ-5D 5L (European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions) at 3, 12, and 24 month from baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3, 12, 24 month</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D 5L (European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions) self-report questionnaire will be used to assess health-related quality of life status. The EQ-5D 5L questionnaire includes five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has five levels, reflecting &quot;no health problems,&quot; &quot;slight health problems,&quot; &quot;moderate health problems,&quot; &quot;severe health problems,&quot; and &quot;extreme health problems.&quot; The EQ-5D 5L will be used for calculating EQ-5D index score. The EQ-5D VAS will also be utilized to document the subject's self-rated overall health state on a 0 to 100 scale (0 = maximal health-related problems, 100 = minimal health-related problems).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of neurological success at 12-month visit</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Neurological status is based on 4 sections: motor, sensory, reflexes, and straight leg raising, each comprising several elements. Following scales will be used to evaluate neurological status: reflexes (0 = Absent or Trace, 1 = Hyper-reflexic, 2 = Normal), sensory function (Light Touch or Pin Prick L1 to S1), motor function (using 0-5 scores 0-5 whereas 0= Total Paralysis, 1 = Palpable or Visible Contraction, 2 = Active Movement, Gravity Eliminated, 3 = Active Movement, Against Gravity, 4 = Active Movement, Against Some Resistance and 5 = Active Movement, Against Full Resistance (full strength) and straight leg raise (positive = patient experiences radiating leg pain below the knee on elevating the leg between 15° and 70° with the knee extended, normal = no pain experienced).
Overall neurological success will be defined as maintenance or improvement in all sections for time period evaluated (each element must remain the same or improve).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of intraoperative cement extravasation/leakage.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The rate of intraoperative cement extravasation/leakage as directly assessed by the physician during the surgery or in the post-operative follow-up with imaging procedures.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Device and/or procedure related to adverse events through 24 months.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Device and/or procedure related adverse events will be collected through 24 months follow-up.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of secondary spinal surgeries at index and/or adjacent level(s), resulting from an AE up to 24 months after surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>When a patient requires additional surgery at the index and/or adjacent level(s), it can be an indicator of insufficient outcomes of the initial surgery.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Radiographic confirmation of stabilization of the pedicle screw instrumentation at 12-month visit.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The surgeon or hospital radiologist will review radiographs and or CT's to assess for evidence of instability of the pedicle screw instrumentation at 12 months. The following will be considered as signs of instrumentation instability:
Screw pullout
Screw loosening
Screw toggle</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Radiographic fusion at 12-month visit for those subjects where fusion was intended</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The surgeon or hospital radiologist will determine fusion status for those subjects where fusion is intended. The fusion assessment for each subject will be collected at 12 months, preferably by collecting a CT-scan, alternatively fusion may also be collected through X-rays.
Fusion status will be classified as the following: No fusion success, Fusion success, and Unable to determine. The criterion for fusion when assessed through a CT-scan is bony bridging and when assessed through X-rays the criteria bony bridging, no motion (&lt;4˚) in Flexion/Extension views, and integrity of the instrumentation (implanted devices). A partial fusion (not meeting these criteria) should be recorded as &quot;No fusion success&quot;.
For multi-level subjects, fusion success will be assessed for each level and overall fusion status will be defined as achieving fusion at all treated levels. If one level's fusion status could not be determined, then the subject level is considered unable to determine.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>For Deformity subjects only: Change in coronal and sagittal spinopelvic parameters from baseline at the 12-month visit.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Collection of spinopelvic parameters can show if patient's spine is balanced or not prior to and after surgery. Any evolution of parameters after the surgery can indicate a change in spinopelvic alignment or a mechanism of regulation/compensation due to an evolution of the spinal alignment. The following spinopelvic alignment parameters will be assessed in the deformity patients on standing, frontal and sagittal full spine X-ray:
Coronal alignment - Distance between C7 plumb line and the central sacral vertical line, and Coronal curve type
Sagittal alignment - Regional parameters: Thoracic Kyphosis (TK), Thoracolumbar kyphosis (TLK), and Lumbar lordosis (LL). Global parameter: Sagittal vertical axis (SVA)
Sagittal spinopelvic parameters: Pelvic Incidence (PI): Pelvic Tilt (PT) and Sacral Slope (SS)</description>
