  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to estimate the number of patients with cardiovascular disease and risk
      factors in patients who had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Simultaneously,
      this study also intends to obtain more information about the management of type 2 diabetes
      mellitus patients with established cardiovascular disease. This study is non-interventional,
      which means that will not require participant's further related visits or procedures. The
      study will collect the participant's clinical data from the current visit and, when
      applicable, within the last 3 years.
