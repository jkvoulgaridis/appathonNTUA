  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single center, prospective cohort study evaluates early cardiac dysfunction in adult
      survivors of childhood cancer. The hypothesis of this study is that cardiac dysfunction can
      be detected earlier when using speckle tracking echocardiography as novel echocardiographic
      technique compared to conventional echocardiography.

      Cardiovascular disease including cardiac dysfunction is the leading non-malignant cause of
      death in childhood cancer survivors. Early detection of cardiac dysfunction is important to
      identify those in need for medical intervention to improve outcome. This study invites adult
      childhood cancer survivors to a clinical appointment to the University Hospital Bern,
      Switzerland. A detailed, standardized cardiac assessment including conventional and novel
      echocardiographic techniques (speckle tracking) is performed. Cardiac dysfunction is
      evaluated in survivors who have had cardiotoxic cancer therapy with anthracyclines and/or
      chest radiation (high risk) and in survivors who have had chemotherapy other than
      anthracyclines (standard risk).

        This prospective cohort study is nested within the Childhood Cancer Registry (ChCR), a
        national, population-based cancer registry that includes all children and adolescents in
        Switzerland who were diagnosed with cancer at age 0-20 years. It includes patients
        diagnosed with leukemia, lymphoma, central nervous system tumors, and malignant solid
        tumours or Langerhans cell histiocytosis. Childhood cancer survivors have survived at least
        5 years from cancer diagnosis.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Registered in the ChCR

          -  Formerly treated at the Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University
             Children`s Hospital Bern

          -  Treated with any chemotherapy and/or chest radiation

          -  Survived ≥ 5 years since most recent cancer diagnosis (primary cancer, relapse(s),
             secondary cancer) at time of examination

          -  Diagnosed at age ≤ 20 years

          -  ≥ 18 years of age at time of study participation

          -  Resident in Switzerland

          -  Written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Study participants will be excluded if they do not meet the above mentioned inclusion
             criteria or refuse to participate in the study.
