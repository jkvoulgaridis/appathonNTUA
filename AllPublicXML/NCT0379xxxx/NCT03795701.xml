  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a single center, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled; parallel-group
      repeated measures design. Subjects will be randomly assigned to either Saxenda® or placebo
      group after baseline assessments. The study will consist of a 4-week partial dose period
      (Liraglutide 0.6mg, 1.2mg, 1.8mg, 2.4 mg) and a 12-week full-dose (Liraglutide 3.0 mg)
      period. The placebo group will administer equivalent volumes of the pre-filled solutions from
      pen-injector at the same time, using the same method during this period. The study proposes
      to identify factors contributing to early weight loss response in a Saxenda® treatment
      program. Specifically, the proposed experiments will help determine if Saxenda® changes brain
      functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Food Cue Reactivity (fMRI-FCR) and whether the
      magnitude of that change is associated with changes in behavioral and physiological variables
      (hunger, satiety, cravings and weight loss).
