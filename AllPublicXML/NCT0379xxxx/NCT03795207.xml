  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As in other solid tumours, increasing evidence indicates that patients diagnosed with a
      limited number of prostate cancer metastases, so-called oligometastases, have a better
      prognosis compared with patients with extensive metastatic disease.

      Survival of patients with three or fewer metastases was superior compared with patients with
      more than three lesions.

      The introduction of novel imaging modalities such as Fluorocholine (FCH), Fuciclovine or
      Ga-PSMA PET CT has increased the detection of oligometastatic prostate cancer (PCa)
      recurrence, potentially justifying the use of a metastasis-directed therapy with radiotherapy
      (RT).

      Based on several studies, SBRT is now considered as a strongly validated option in
      oligometastatic prostate cancer.

      It is increasingly understood that cancers are recognized by the immune system, and, under
      some circumstances, the immune system may control or even eliminate tumors.

      Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) is transmembrane protein that has been speculated to play a
      major role in suppressing the immune system during particular events.

      PD-L1 is expressed in a broad range of cancers. Based on these findings, an anti-PD-L1
      antibody could be used therapeutically to enhance antitumor immune responses in patients with
      cancer.

      Experimental data from multiple cancer models have provided cumulative evidence of an
      interaction of ionizing radiation with the systemic antitumor immunity and this has created
      several opportunities in the field.

      The oligometastatic setting appears to be the most relevant clinical situation to evaluate
      the immune response generated by radiotherapy and immune modifiers in patients with an intact
      immune system. The hypothesize is that Durvalumab will enhance immune response following SBRT
      targeting oligometastatic lesions. In this randomized 2:1 phase II trial of Stereotactic Body
      Radiation Therapy with or without durvalumab in oligometastatic hormone sensitive prostate
      cancer patients, Durvalumab will be started one month prior to SBRT to be able to evaluate
      PSA and immune response to the drug. It will be combined with SBRT and then given adjuvantly
      for a total of 12 months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Written informed consent obtained from the patient prior to performing any
             protocol-related procedures, including screening evaluations

          2. Age &gt; or = 18 years at time of study entry

          3. Histologically proven diagnosis of prostate cancer (PCa)

          4. PCa patients with a biochemical recurrence &quot;Rising PSA&quot; following treatment with
             curative intent (radical prostatectomy, primary radiotherapy or a combination of both)
             as defined by the EAU guidelines.

          5. A maximum of 5 bone or lymph node metastases, seen only on FCH-PET CT or Ga-PSMA PET
             CT, not seen on conventional imaging assessments (bone scan or thorax, abdomen and
             pelvis CT scan).

          6. WHO performance state 0-1

          7. Controlled primary tumor. In case the PSA &gt; 0,2 ng/ml in the postoperative setting
             patients are eligible if a multiparametic MRI or PET scan of the prostate bed rules
             out a local relapse.

             Patients after primary radiotherapy should undergo MRI of the prostate according to
             the European Society of Urogenital Radiology (ESUR) guidelines to rule out local
             relapse. In case of a suspicious lesion, a biopsy should confirm local recurrence and
             patients should be referred for local salvage prostatectomy when distant metastases
             are ruled out. If MRI rules out local relapse, patients are eligible.

          8. If ADT has been previously administered to the patient, a minimum of 12 months must
             have elapsed between the predicted duration of the last injection and inclusion of the
             patient in the study. For this category of patients, serum testosterone has to be
             higher than 8.5 nmol/l prior to inclusion.
