  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare E7389 versus capecitabine in patients with locally
      advanced or metastatic breast cancer who are refractory to the most recent chemotherapy. This
      is an open-label, randomized, two-parallel arm study. Patients will be randomized to receive
      either E7389 or capecitabine on a one-to-one ratio.

    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From date of randomization until date of death from any cause, assessed up to data cutoff date of 12 Mar 2012, or up to approximately 6 years</time_frame>
    <description>OS was measured from the date of randomization until the date of death from any cause, or the last date the participant was known to be alive. Participants who were lost to follow-up or who were alive at the date of data cutoff were censored. The censoring rules for OS were as follows: 1) if the participant was still alive at data cutoff, the date of data cutoff was considered the end date, and 2) if the participant was lost to follow-up before data cutoff, the date they were last known to be alive was considered the end date. Participants who survived past the end of the study were counted as in the full study period. If death occurred after data cutoff, the end date was to be censored at the time of data cutoff.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From date of randomization to the date of disease progression or death (whichever occurred first), assessed up to data cutoff date of 12 Mar 2012 or up to approximately 6 years</time_frame>
    <description>PFS was defined as the time (in days) from the date of randomization to the date of the first sign of disease progression based on Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 (v 1.1) or date of death, regardless of cause. Disease progression was measured by computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed on lesions targeted at baseline for tumor assessment. Disease progression (as assessed by independent review of the imaging scans) per RECIST v 1.1 was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of the target lesions (taking as reference the smallest sum on study, including the baseline sum if that is the smallest), and an absolute increase of at least 5 millimeter (mm). Note that the appearance of one or more new lesions was also considered as disease progression.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Global Health Status/Quality of Life (QoL) Measured by European Organization for the Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Core Questionnaire Scores Based on Core 30 Items (EORTC-QLQ-C30) at Week 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>EORTC-QLQ-C30:cancer-specific instrument with 30 questions to assess the participant QoL. First 28 questions used to evaluate 5 functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, social), 3 symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain) and other single items(dyspnoea, appetite loss, insomnia, constipation, diarrhea, financial difficulties). Each of these 28 questions assessed on 4-point scale(1=not at all, 2=a little, 3=quite a bit, 4=very much); functional scales: higher score=better level of functioning; symptom scale: higher score=more severe symptoms; for single items: higher score= more severe problem. Last 2 questions used to evaluate global health status (GHS)/QoL. Each question was assessed on 7-point scale (1=very poor to 7=excellent). Scores averaged, transformed to 0-100 scale; higher score=better quality of life/better level of functioning.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in European Organization for the Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Core Questionnaire Scores Based on Breast Cancer Specific 23 Items (EORTC-QLQ- BR 23) at Week 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>EORTC-QLQ-BR23:disease-specific module for breast cancer developed as a supplement for the EORTC-QLQ-C30 to assess quality of life of participants with breast cancer. The scores from 23 items of QLQ-BR23 included functional scales (body image, sexual functioning, sexual enjoyment, future perspective), symptom scales (systemic therapy side effects, breast symptoms, arm symptoms, upset by hair loss). Each item was rated on a scale of 1 to 4 to record level of intensity (1= not at all, 2= a little, 3= quite a bit, 4= very much) within each scales. Scores averaged and transformed to 0-100 scale. High score indicated high/better level of functioning/healthy functioning. Negative change from Baseline indicated deterioration in QOL and positive change from Baseline indicated an improvement in QOL.</description>

    <time_frame>From date of randomization until date of first documentation of CR or PR, assessed up to data cutoff date of 12 Mar 2012 or up to approximately 6 years</time_frame>
    <description>ORR was defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 (v 1.1). CR is defined as disappearance of all target legions and non-target lesions. All pathological lymph nodes (whether target and non-target), must have reduction in their short axis to less than 10 mm. PR is defined as at least 30% decrease in the sum of the long diameter LD (hereafter referred to as sum of LD) of all target lesions, as compared with Baseline summed LD.</description>

    <measure>Duration of Response (DOR): Independent Review</measure>
    <time_frame>From first documented CR or PR until date of recurrent or progressive disease or death, assessed up to data cutoff of date of 12 Mar 2012 or up to approximately 6 years</time_frame>
    <description>DOR was defined as the time from first documented CR or PR until disease progression or death from any cause for those participants with a confirmed PR or CR measured by RECIST v1.1. CR defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions. All pathological lymph nodes(whether target and non-target), must have reduction in their short axis to less than 10 mm. PR defined as at least 30% decrease in the sum of the long diameter LD (hereafter referred to as sum of LD) of all target lesions, as compared with Baseline summed LD.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Pain Intensity by Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Until 30 Days After the Last Dose of Study Drug</measure>
    <time_frame>First dose of study drug (Baseline) up to 30 days after last dose of study drug (up to approximately 6 years 3 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Pain intensity was measured by marking a single vertical line that crosses a 1-100 mm unmarked VAS scale. The left-end of the visual analog scale was labelled &quot;least possible pain&quot; and the right-end of the visual analog scale was labelled &quot;worst possible pain&quot;. The pain rating ranged from 0 to 100, with a higher score indicating more pain. A negative change score indicated improvement.</description>

        <title>Overall Survival (OS)</title>
        <description>OS was measured from the date of randomization until the date of death from any cause, or the last date the participant was known to be alive. Participants who were lost to follow-up or who were alive at the date of data cutoff were censored. The censoring rules for OS were as follows: 1) if the participant was still alive at data cutoff, the date of data cutoff was considered the end date, and 2) if the participant was lost to follow-up before data cutoff, the date they were last known to be alive was considered the end date. Participants who survived past the end of the study were counted as in the full study period. If death occurred after data cutoff, the end date was to be censored at the time of data cutoff.</description>

        <title>Progression Free Survival (PFS)</title>
        <description>PFS was defined as the time (in days) from the date of randomization to the date of the first sign of disease progression based on Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 (v 1.1) or date of death, regardless of cause. Disease progression was measured by computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed on lesions targeted at baseline for tumor assessment. Disease progression (as assessed by independent review of the imaging scans) per RECIST v 1.1 was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of the target lesions (taking as reference the smallest sum on study, including the baseline sum if that is the smallest), and an absolute increase of at least 5 millimeter (mm). Note that the appearance of one or more new lesions was also considered as disease progression.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Global Health Status/Quality of Life (QoL) Measured by European Organization for the Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Core Questionnaire Scores Based on Core 30 Items (EORTC-QLQ-C30) at Week 6</title>
        <description>EORTC-QLQ-C30:cancer-specific instrument with 30 questions to assess the participant QoL. First 28 questions used to evaluate 5 functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, social), 3 symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain) and other single items(dyspnoea, appetite loss, insomnia, constipation, diarrhea, financial difficulties). Each of these 28 questions assessed on 4-point scale(1=not at all, 2=a little, 3=quite a bit, 4=very much); functional scales: higher score=better level of functioning; symptom scale: higher score=more severe symptoms; for single items: higher score= more severe problem. Last 2 questions used to evaluate global health status (GHS)/QoL. Each question was assessed on 7-point scale (1=very poor to 7=excellent). Scores averaged, transformed to 0-100 scale; higher score=better quality of life/better level of functioning.</description>

        <description>EORTC-QLQ-BR23:disease-specific module for breast cancer developed as a supplement for the EORTC-QLQ-C30 to assess quality of life of participants with breast cancer. The scores from 23 items of QLQ-BR23 included functional scales (body image, sexual functioning, sexual enjoyment, future perspective), symptom scales (systemic therapy side effects, breast symptoms, arm symptoms, upset by hair loss). Each item was rated on a scale of 1 to 4 to record level of intensity (1= not at all, 2= a little, 3= quite a bit, 4= very much) within each scales. Scores averaged and transformed to 0-100 scale. High score indicated high/better level of functioning/healthy functioning. Negative change from Baseline indicated deterioration in QOL and positive change from Baseline indicated an improvement in QOL.</description>

        <description>ORR was defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 (v 1.1). CR is defined as disappearance of all target legions and non-target lesions. All pathological lymph nodes (whether target and non-target), must have reduction in their short axis to less than 10 mm. PR is defined as at least 30% decrease in the sum of the long diameter LD (hereafter referred to as sum of LD) of all target lesions, as compared with Baseline summed LD.</description>

CR is defined as disappearance of all target legions and non-target lesions. All pathological lymph nodes (whether target and non-target), must have reduction in their short axis to less than 10 mm. PR is defined as at least 30% decrease in the sum of the long diameter LD (hereafter referred to as sum of LD) of all target lesions, as compared with Baseline summed LD.</description>

        <title>Duration of Response (DOR): Independent Review</title>
        <description>DOR was defined as the time from first documented CR or PR until disease progression or death from any cause for those participants with a confirmed PR or CR measured by RECIST v1.1. CR defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions. All pathological lymph nodes(whether target and non-target), must have reduction in their short axis to less than 10 mm. PR defined as at least 30% decrease in the sum of the long diameter LD (hereafter referred to as sum of LD) of all target lesions, as compared with Baseline summed LD.</description>
        <time_frame>From first documented CR or PR until date of recurrent or progressive disease or death, assessed up to data cutoff of date of 12 Mar 2012 or up to approximately 6 years</time_frame>

        <description>Pain intensity was measured by marking a single vertical line that crosses a 1-100 mm unmarked VAS scale. The left-end of the visual analog scale was labelled &quot;least possible pain&quot; and the right-end of the visual analog scale was labelled &quot;worst possible pain&quot;. The pain rating ranged from 0 to 100, with a higher score indicating more pain. A negative change score indicated improvement.</description>
