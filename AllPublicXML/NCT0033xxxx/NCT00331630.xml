      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as Abraxane, work in different ways to stop the
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.
      Lapatinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for their
      growth. Giving Abraxane together with lapatinib may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving Abraxane together with lapatinib
      works in treating patients with stage I, stage II, or stage III breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the clinical response rate, as measured by clinical exam and imaging studies,
           in patients with stage I-III breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant Abraxane in
           combination with lapatinib.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the pathologic complete response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Correlate proliferation (Ki67), apoptosis (cleaved caspase-3), and angiogenesis (vW,
           CD34) markers, measured before and after treatment, with tumor response in these
           patients.

        -  Conduct other correlative studies, including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR),
           HER2/neu, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and transforming growth factor (TGF-β),
           before and after treatment with this regimen to assess tumor response in these patients.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups.

        -  Group 1: The first 10 patients receive Abraxane IV over 30 minutes on day 1 and oral
           lapatinib once daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 courses in the
           absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Group 2: The next 20 patients receive Abraxane and lapatinib (at a higher dose) as in
           group 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo blood collection and tumor biopsies periodically for correlative biomarker
      studies.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued to this study.

    <description>cRR measured by RECIST for target lesions assessed by clinical exam+ mammogram+ ultrasound (US). cRR is defined as number of patients who's best response in any of the assessments (clinical exam/mammogram/US) is CR+PR. Response will be defined as one of the following in either clinical exam, mammogram or US: Complete Response (CR)-Disappearance of all target lesions. Partial Response (PR)&gt;=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum.
Stable Disease-neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for Partial disease nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease, taking as reference the smallest sum LD while on study.
Progressive Disease &lt;=20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions.</description>

    <description>Pathologic Complete Response (pCR) will be assessed by breast biopsy at baseline and after 4 cycles of study treatment (1 cycle = 21 days) and at surgery.

    <description>Correlation of proliferation (Ki67) will be assessed by breast biopsy at baseline and after 4 cycles of study treatment (1 cycle = 21 days). Ki67 scoring was performed based on degree of staining (0= no staining, 1=weak nuclear staining, 2=moderate nuclear staining, 3=strong nuclear staining).

    <description>Apoptosis/cleaved caspase-3 (CC3) will be assessed by breast biopsy at baseline and after 4 cycles of study treatment (1 cycle = 21 days). Scoring was based on the degree of staining (0=more than 90% of tumor cells with no staining, 1= more than 90% of tumor cells have weak staining, 2= more than 90% of tumor cells have moderate staining, 3= more than 90% of tumor cells have strong staining).

    <description>Angiogenesis (vW, CD34) markers will be assessed by breast biopsy at baseline and after 4 cycles of study treatment (1 cycle = 21 days). Expressions were analyzed by light microscopy in invasive breast cancer regions.

        <description>Correlation of proliferation (Ki67) will be assessed by breast biopsy at baseline and after 4 cycles of study treatment (1 cycle = 21 days). Ki67 scoring was performed based on degree of staining (0= no staining, 1=weak nuclear staining, 2=moderate nuclear staining, 3=strong nuclear staining). Ki67 scores were counted on a maximum of 10 randomly selected x40 high-power fields with an eyepiece grid of 10x10 squares containing representative sections of tumor and calculated as percentage of positively stained cells to total tumor cells (Percent Score method) Ki67 labeling Index (LI) as assessed by counting a maximum of 1,000 malignant cells at x400 magnification.</description>

weak staining less than 1% of tumor cells
= medium staining in 1-10% of tumor cells/weak staining in less than 1% of tumor cells
