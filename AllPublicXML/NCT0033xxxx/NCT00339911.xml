  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      The purpose of this protocol is to establish a centralized repository for the collection and
      distribution of samples (either blood, buccal mucosal cells, semen, urine, or nail clippings)
      from paid, healthy volunteer donors for in vitro research conducted by NCI Frederick
      Investigators.

      Objectives:

      Research uses of normal donor samples obtained through this protocol will include but not be
      limited to genotype analysis, immune function studies, drug screening, vaccine development,
      method development, quality control testing of reagents, and the propagation of infectious
      agents, including HIV.

      Although samples may be used to screen for genetic polymorphisms, this protocol will not be
      used to conduct genetic screening, or other types of studies, specifically designed to reveal
      information of known clinical relevance or implication. Further, Investigators wishing to
      recontact donor(s) for repeated samples when preliminary work has given rise to a research
      question of potential clinical relevance will seek IRB guidance on whether a separate,
      specific protocol should be initiated.

      Eligibility:

      Healthy FCRDC employees will be recruited. Potential donors will be excluded if screening
      indicates exposure to HIV, HTLV or Hepatitis C virus or Hepatitis B virus infection.

      Study Design:

      Samples provided to Investigators will be either anonymous or coded, depending on the
      specific need.

      Codes will be securely maintained and under no circumstances will donor identity be released
      to Investigators.

      The investigational nature of the studies in which their specimens will be used, and the
      risks and discomforts of the donation process will be carefully explained to the donors, and
      signed informed consent documents covering study participation and HIV testing will be
      obtained.

      Donors will receive financial compensation for their time, discomfort and inconvenience
      according to an established schedule; compensation for blood donation is based on the volume
      donated.

      Investigators requesting to participate in the Research Donor Program (RDP) by receiving
      samples for research use will be required to submit a written memo of request, briefly
      describing the nature of the research and providing assurance that samples provided through
      this protocol will be used solely for in vitro research.

      Whole blood will be collected by the standard phlebotomy technique of venipuncture of forearm
      veins.

      Buccal mucosal cells will be collected by use of a sterile swab or brush or after oral rinse.
      Semen will be collected by self-masturbation at the donors homes.

      Urine and nail clippings can be collected either in donors homes or at OHS.

      Background:

      The purpose of this protocol is to establish a centralized repository for the collection and
      distribution of samples (either blood, buccal mucosal cells, semen, urine, or nail clippings)
      from paid, healthy volunteer donors for in vitro research conducted by NIH investigators
      located at NCI-Frederick and Ft. Detrick.

      Objectives:

      Research uses of normal donor samples will include, but are not limited to, genotype
      analysis, immune function studies, drug screening, vaccine development, method development,
      quality control testing of reagents, and propagation of infectious agents, including HIV.

      Eligibility:

      Healthy NCI-Frederick employees and other NIH staff located at Ft. Detrick will be recruited.
      Potential donors will be excluded if screening indicates exposure to HIV, HTLV, Hepatitis C
      or Hepatitis B virus infection.

      Study Design:

      Investigators requesting to participate to the Research Donor Program (RDP) by receiving
      samples for research use will be required to submit a written memo of request, briefly
      describing the nature of the research and providing assurance that samples provided through
      this protocol will be used solely for in vitro research.

      These Investigators will receive samples that will be either anonymous or coded, depending on
      the specific need.

      Codes will be securely maintained and under no circumstances will donor identity be released
      to Investigators.

      Donors will receive financial compensation for their time, discomfort and inconvenience
