      This study will determine the effectiveness of oral risperidone versus long-acting injectable
      risperidone in treating people with first-episode schizophrenia.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia is a severely disabling brain disorder. People with schizophrenia often
      experience hallucinations, delusions, thought disorders, and movement disorders. Proper
      treatment of first-episode schizophrenia may increase the chances of controlling disease
      progression on a long-term basis. People experiencing their first episode of schizophrenia
      are more responsive to treatment than those with chronic schizophrenia, but are also more
      susceptible to adverse treatment side effects. Atypical antipsychotic medications have been
      shown to produce fewer adverse side effects than older &quot;typical&quot; antipsychotics. Risperidone
      is a type of atypical antipsychotic medication that is used to control the symptoms of
      schizophrenia. This study will determine the effectiveness of oral risperidone versus
      long-acting injectable risperidone in treating people with first-episode schizophrenia.

      Participants in this open label study will be randomly assigned to receive either orally
      administered risperidone or long-acting risperidone administered via injection. Participants
      assigned to oral risperidone will receive medication in doses that are determined to be
      optimal by the study psychiatrist. Participants assigned to long-acting risperidone will
      receive an injection of risperidone once every 2 weeks. Dosages will begin at 25 mg and will
      be adjusted as necessary to achieve the optimal dosage. Following 2 to 3 months to achieve
      outpatient risperidone dosage stabilization, the randomized medication conditions will begin
      and participants will be monitored for 1 year. Study visits will occur once weekly throughout
      the study. They will include group therapy meetings focused on everyday living skills; family
      education about schizophrenia; assessments of medication response; and individual meetings
      with a case manager for counseling and evaluations of schizophrenia symptoms.

    <measure>Exacerbation or Relapse of Psychotic Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Occurrence after randomization and until end of study participation (up to 12 mos.)</time_frame>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Return to Work or School (SAS Work Section)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured from Baseline to Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Social Adjustment Scale records the return to work or school and the number of weeks in work or school during each 3-month period. For this outcome, outcome as dichotomized as 0 if an individual did not return to work or school and 1 if they did return to competitive work or regular school enrollment.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Maintenance of Work/School Attendance (SAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured from Baseline to Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>Measured as the number of weeks in which a participant has competitive employment or attends regular school courses. Possible range is 0 to 52 weeks.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Global Functioning Scale: Role</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured from Baseline to Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>Change on a 10-point scale of work/school functioning. Scale range is from 1 (extreme role dysfunction) to 10 (superior role functioning). Measured by subtracting the baseline rating from the rating at 12 months.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) Overall Composite T Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at baseline and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The MCCB Overall Composite T score is computed by the MCCB Computer Scoring Program from the raw scores for 10 individual cognitive tests. The mean for the general population of comparable age and sex is 50 with a standard deviation of 10. Higher scores indicate better cognitive functioning. The outcome measure was the change from baseline to 12 months, calculated as 12-month T score minus baseline T score. Higher values indicate better outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Emotional Reactivity on Psychophysiological Measures</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured from Baseline to Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>Electrodermal reactivity to pictures of negative versus neutral stimuli was the initially proposed measure. Larger skin conductance increases in response to negative pictures compared to neutral pictures would indicate stronger emotional reactivity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Retention in Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Number of days on the randomized medication before being switched to a different antipsychotic medication or dropping out of the medication trial. Possible range is 0 to 365, with higher numbers indicating better retention in treatment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Awareness of Illness, as Assessed by the Scale to Assess Unawareness of Mental Disorder-Revised (SUMD-R)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Rating scale based on clinician's interview of patient to determine level of lack of awareness of having a mental disorder. Range is from 1 (Aware) to 5 (Unaware), so lower scores indicate better outcome.</description>
