    <textblock>
      This is an extension study to Tercica study MS301 (NCT00125164) and is intended to collect
      long term safety and efficacy data on the continued use of recombinant human insulin-like
      growth factor-1 (rh IGF-1) in children and adolescents treated for primary IGF-1 deficiency
      (IGFD). The secondary objective is to use the data collected to learn more about the
      relationship of IGF-1 exposure to the promotion of normal growth and pubertal development.

      Primary IGFD is a term that has been used to describe patients with intrinsic cellular
      defects in GH action. In this protocol, subjects that have completed one year of mecasermin
      treatment on Tercica protocol MS301 (NCT00125164) will be allowed to enroll in this extension
      study. All subjects were planned to receive treatment.

      This is a Phase IIIb open-label, multi-center, parallel dose, extension study conducted in
      approximately 40 centers across the United States.

    <measure>Height Velocity During BID Dosing Period</measure>
    <time_frame>At Years 1, 2 and 3 in BID dosing period.</time_frame>
    <description>Height was measured standing, without shoes, as the average of 3 measurements by the same observer identical technique with a Harpenden or other wall-mounted stadiometer at baseline and each study visit up to 3 years. Height velocity (during any interval of time (annualised) is computed as (height on date 2 - height on date 1)/(age on date 2 - age on date 1) where height is expressed as centimetres so that height velocity is expressed as centimetres per year (cm/yr). Height velocity is presented for subjects completing each year of BID treatment (i.e. Year 1 [0-1 years], Year 2 [1-2 years], Year 3 [2-3 years]).</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Height Standard Deviation (SD) Score During BID Dosing Period</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and Years 1, 2 and 3 in BID dosing period.</time_frame>
    <description>Height was measured standing, without shoes, as the average of 3 measurements by the same observer using identical technique with a Harpenden or other wall-mounted stadiometer at baseline and each study visit up to 3 years. Height SD score was calculated using the National Center for Health Statistics 2000 data as provided by the Center for Disease Control. Mean change from baseline in height SD score is presented for all subjects completing each year of BID treatment (i.e. Year 1 [0-1 years], Year 2 [1-2 years], Year 3 [2-3 years]).</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Body Mass Index (BMI) SD Score During BID Dosing Period</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and Years 1, 2 and 3 in BID dosing period.</time_frame>
    <description>BMI SD score was calculated using the National Center for Health Statistics 2000 data as provided by the Center for Disease Control. Mean change from baseline in BMI SD score is presented for all subjects completing each year of BID treatment (i.e. Year 1 [0-1 years], Year 2 [1-2 years], Year 3 [2-3 years]).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Bone Age During BID Dosing Period</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and Years 1, 2 and 3 in BID dosing period.</time_frame>
    <description>Radiographs of the left hand and wrist were taken on an approximately annual basis for determination of bone (skeletal) age. The films were sent to a central facility for standardised evaluation. Mean change from baseline in bone age is presented for all subjects completing each year of BID treatment (i.e. Year1 [0-1 years], Year 2 [1-2 years], Year 3 [2-3 years]).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Predicted Adult Height During BID Dosing Period</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and Years 1, 2 and 3 in BID dosing period.</time_frame>
    <description>Predicted adult heights were estimated using the Roche-Wainer-Theissen method which takes into account changes in age, height and bone age. Mean change from baseline in predicted adult height is presented for all subjects completing each year of BID treatment (i.e. Year 1 [0-1 years], Year 2 [1-2 years], Year 3 [2-3 years]).</description>

    <description>All subjects entering MS306 began recombinant human insulin-like growth factor-1 (rhIGF-1) twice a day (BID) treatment. Each subject treated in MS301 had an MS306 starting dose that was based on their dose at the completion of MS301 (i.e. subcutaneous injections of rhIGF-1 at 40, 80, or 120 micrograms [μg]/ kilogram [kg] BID).
MS301 untreated control subjects were randomised in MS306 in a 1:1 ratio to a dose of either 80 or 120 μg/kg rhIGF-1 BID.
Following Protocol Amendment 1, all subjects received either 80 or 120 μg/kg rhIGF-1 BID until the implementation of Protocol Amendment 2.
Following Protocol Amendment 2, all subjects were first switched to receive subcutaneous injections of 160 μg/kg rhIGF-1 once a day (QD), followed by individual dose-escalation first to 200 μg/kg rhIGF-1 QD and subsequently to a targeted maximum dose of 240 μg/kg rhIGF-1 QD. Subjects were treated QD until the early termination of the study.</description>

    <description>Patients from untreated arm for prior study MS301 (NCT00125164) were randomized to a dose of either 80 or 120 mcg/kg twice daily. For patients receiving active treatment in previous study MS 301 (NCT00125164), they started on a dose of 80 or 120 mcg/kg twice daily based on the dose reached at end of the previous study. Following a protocol amendment in May 2009, all patients were switched to once daily doses of 160 µg/kg, escalated to a targeted maximum dose of 240 µg/kg.</description>

      <recruitment_details>All subjects that completed study MS301 (NCT00125164) were eligible to enter this Phase 3b, open-label, extension study in prepubertal and pubertal male and female subjects with growth failure associated with primary insulin-like growth factor-1 deficiency (IGFD). This study (MS306) was terminated early by the sponsor on 01 December 2009.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>As subjects entered MS306 whilst MS301 was continuing, dosages were adjusted in MS306 after MS301 data became available. Baseline study data for MS306 were taken from the data collected for Visit 9 (Month 12) of study MS301.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Height Velocity During BID Dosing Period</title>
        <description>Height was measured standing, without shoes, as the average of 3 measurements by the same observer identical technique with a Harpenden or other wall-mounted stadiometer at baseline and each study visit up to 3 years. Height velocity (during any interval of time (annualised) is computed as (height on date 2 - height on date 1)/(age on date 2 - age on date 1) where height is expressed as centimetres so that height velocity is expressed as centimetres per year (cm/yr). Height velocity is presented for subjects completing each year of BID treatment (i.e. Year 1 [0-1 years], Year 2 [1-2 years], Year 3 [2-3 years]).</description>

          <description>All subjects entering MS306 began recombinant human insulin-like growth factor-1 (rhIGF-1) BID treatment. Each subject treated in MS301 had an MS306 starting dose that was based on their dose at the completion of MS301 (i.e. subcutaneous injections of rhIGF-1 at 40, 80, or 120 μg/kg BID).
MS301 untreated control subjects were randomised in MS306 in a 1:1 ratio to a dose of either 80 or 120 μg/kg rhIGF-1 BID.
Following Protocol Amendment 1, all subjects received either 80 or 120 μg/kg rhIGF-1 BID until the implementation of Protocol Amendment 2.
Following Protocol Amendment 2, all subjects were first switched to receive subcutaneous injections of 160 μg/kg rhIGF-1 QD, followed by individual dose-escalation first to 200 μg/kg rhIGF-1 QD and subsequently to a targeted maximum dose of 240 μg/kg rhIGF-1 QD. Subjects were treated QD until the early termination of the study.</description>
