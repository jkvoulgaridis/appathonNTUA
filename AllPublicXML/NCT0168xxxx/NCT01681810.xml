  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is being conducted to examine the effects of daily inorganic nitrite
      treatment on the cardiometabolic and hormonal disturbances observed in overweight/obese
      adults with the metabolic syndrome and high blood pressure. Ultimately, oral nitrite therapy
      may have a major impact on the prevention and treatment of both diabetes and cardiovascular
      disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death in the United States and worldwide.
      Several studies have demonstrated that fruit and vegetable rich diets significantly reduced
      blood pressure and reduced the risk of ischemic stroke and cardiovascular disease in general,
      the exact mechanisms remain poorly understood. Preclinical and clinical research over the
      last decade has revealed the important vasoprotective effects of nitrates and nitrites with
      regards to reduction in blood pressure, vascular inflammation and endothelial dysfunction.
      More recent findings suggest that inorganic nitrate and nitrite therapy may be involved in
      the regulation of glucose-insulin homeostasis.

      For this reason, development of an oral formulation of nitrite salt represents a rational
      avenue of exploration for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, whereby nitrite would
      ensure rapid acting effects upon absorption which can be further oxidized to nitrate via the
      enterosalivary circulation pathway. In this pathway, about 25% of circulating nitrate is
      concentrated in the saliva and reduced to nitrite by commensal mouth bacteria with nitrate
      reductase enzymes. The proposal is the first human study to investigate the inorganic nitrite
      effects (in any form) on insulin sensitivity in a patient population. This is the second
      human trial using orally delivered nitrite (previously as aqueous solution).

      In the initial phase of the study, step up dosing and frequency of oral sodium nitrite to 40
      mg three times daily occurred with no serious adverse events. After three subjects completed
      the study intervention on sodium nitrite 20 mg three times daily for 2 weeks followed by 40
      mg three times daily for the remaining 10 weeks with no serious adverse events, all subjects
      in this current phase of the trial (n=20) began the 12-week study intervention with 40 mg
      three times daily. At the same time, in person monitoring visits (which included brief
      physical exams, directly observed nitrite dosing, secondary outcome measure assessment of
      methemoglobin level and blood pressure, interval histories, medication compliance review,
      symptom review and dispensing of study drug) were spaced from weekly intervals to subjects
      alternating weekly in person visits with phone visits.

    <measure>Change in Insulin Stimulated Glucose Disposal Over 12 Week Study Period</measure>
    <time_frame>measured at 0 (baseline) and at 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in insulin stimulated glucose disposal was assessed during the 4-hour hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp at end of the 12 weeks and was compared to baseline (pre-nitrite). Insulin stimulated glucose disposal (mg/min) was calculated in the final 20 minutes of the 4-hour clamp at steady state and expressed as mg per kg lean body mass (as measured by DEXA) per minute. HumuLIN R regular insulin was infused at a rate of 40 microUnits/m2/min. A non-radioactive glucose isotope dilution (Isotec, Inc) was delivered as a primed, then constant infusion of the 98+% enriched stable isotope of D-glucose [6,6-D2] (0.22 umol x kg-1, 17.6 umol x kg-1 prime). Plasma glucose was clamped between 85-95 mg/dL with a variable infusion of 20% dextrose in water. The rate of dextrose infusion was adjusted based on arterialized plasma glucose measurements obtained every 5 minutes.</description>

    <time_frame>measured at 0 (baseline) and bi-weekly over 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Peak change in systolic blood pressure (SBP) on sodium nitrite compared to baseline. Subjects performed bi-weekly blinded automated blood pressures with a Dinamap DPC200X (GE Medical Systems Information Technology) in triplicate at study visits beginning 30 minutes after directly observed nitrite dosing. Five minute intervals were maintained between measurements while in the supine position with legs uncrossed and sitting upright in a hospital bed in a quiet room.

        <title>Change in Insulin Stimulated Glucose Disposal Over 12 Week Study Period</title>
        <description>Change in insulin stimulated glucose disposal was assessed during the 4-hour hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp at end of the 12 weeks and was compared to baseline (pre-nitrite). Insulin stimulated glucose disposal (mg/min) was calculated in the final 20 minutes of the 4-hour clamp at steady state and expressed as mg per kg lean body mass (as measured by DEXA) per minute. HumuLIN R regular insulin was infused at a rate of 40 microUnits/m2/min. A non-radioactive glucose isotope dilution (Isotec, Inc) was delivered as a primed, then constant infusion of the 98+% enriched stable isotope of D-glucose [6,6-D2] (0.22 umol x kg-1, 17.6 umol x kg-1 prime). Plasma glucose was clamped between 85-95 mg/dL with a variable infusion of 20% dextrose in water. The rate of dextrose infusion was adjusted based on arterialized plasma glucose measurements obtained every 5 minutes.</description>

Subjects performed bi-weekly blinded automated blood pressures with a Dinamap DPC200X (GE Medical Systems Information Technology) in triplicate at study visits beginning 30 minutes after directly observed nitrite dosing. Five minute intervals were maintained between measurements while in the supine position with legs uncrossed and sitting upright in a hospital bed in a quiet room. The final 2 of 3 DBP measurements were averaged.</description>
