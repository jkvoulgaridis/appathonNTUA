  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a cluster randomized trial to evaluate the effectiveness of integrated care centers
      (ICC) to improve access to HIV testing, prevention services, and treatment among high-risk
      populations of injection drug users (IDU) and men who have sex with men (MSM) in India. We
      will collect baseline ethnographic and survey data from approximately 27 IDU or MSM sites in
      India. We will use baseline data to select 22 sites for the trial (12 IDU and 10 MSM) and to
      stratify sites according to key baseline characteristics. We will perform stratified
      randomization to assign sites to either the ICC intervention or to standard services. ICCs,
      which will be either IDU or MSM-focused, will provide an accepting atmosphere in which
      members of vulnerable groups can drop-in, receive rapid HIV voluntary counselling and
      testing, risk reduction counseling and services, and antiretroviral therapy. ICCs will be
      scaled-up from existing governmental or non-governmental organizations and services provided
      at ICCs will be supported by the National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) of India. After
      providing services in communities for two years, we will conduct an evaluation survey (with
      biological and behavioral measures) of approximately 1000 subjects in the target populations
      in each of the 22 study sites. Integrated care centers have the potential to improve access
      to HIV prevention and treatment services among vulnerable, high-risk populations.
