  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall contribution of this study is to increase the knowledge of the efficacy of
      strength and aerobic exercise on knee related quality of life, knee pain, and physical
      function in patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA). Knee OA is one of the most important
      diseases within musculoskeletal conditions affecting a considerable number of people
      worldwide. This randomized controlled trial will involve one intervention group delivered
      strength exercises compared to another intervention group delivered aerobic exercise
      (ergometer cycling). The two intervention groups will be compared to a control group
      undergoing usual care. Cost-effectiveness analysis will be performed comparing the three
      groups. The study is funded from The Research Council of Norway.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Knee-related quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Primary outcome for the study will be the quality of life subscale of the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) (0-100 scale). 0 is very poor knee-related quality of life, while 100 indicates normal knee-related quality of life.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Knee function</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The KOOS is a self-administered knee-specific questionnaire containing 5-item Likert scales on pain, other symptoms, activities of daily living (ADL), function in sports and recreation and knee-related quality of life (QOL). Each scale goes from 0-100, 0 indicating worse function and 100 representing normal function.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health-related quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Euro Quality of life 5 dimensions 5 level (EQ-5D-5L) will be used to measure health related quality of life. It comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. The EuroQol (EQ) Visual analogue scale (VAS) records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale. This can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome that reflects the patient's own judgement. The scores on these five dimensions can be presented as a health profile or can be converted to a single summary index number (utility) reflecting preferability compared to other health profiles.</description>

    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Conventional x-rays will be used to assess radiographic progression of osteoarthritis</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Isokinetic muscle strength</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Isokinetic muscle strength will be measured in a Biodex6000 machine. The participants sit in a standardised position and flex/extend their knees at 60 degrees/second. The peak torque value of the five repetitions is recorded.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>VO2max is measured using an incremental ramp test procedure on a stationary bike, designed to achieve supramaximal workloads within ~4-6 min. The workload was increased by 25 watts every 30 second to total exhaustion.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Self-efficacy for pain</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Arthritis self-efficacy scale (ASES) was included to measure self-efficacy for pain. A modified version of ASES containing 11 questions regarding the patient's certainty to perform various tasks related to pain and symptoms, where each item is rated from 1 (very uncertain) to 5 (very certain) was used.</description>

    <description>The aerobic exercise group will cycle on an ergometer bicycle 2-3 times a week for 12 weeks on moderate loading. The loading will be controlled by a heart rate monitor and is defined as 75% of maximal heart rate (calculated with formula for maximal heart rate reserve).</description>

    <description>The strength training will be delivered 2-3 times per week for 12 weeks, 5-8 repetitions maximum in 3 series. The patients must warm up 5 minutes on an ergometer cycle. The following muscle groups will be trained: Quadriceps and hamstrings, hip muscles (abductors and extensors), calf muscles. A home exercise program will be delivered including one leg exercises and balance exercises. Progression will follow a 2+ principle. For instance, when the study participant is able to perform 2 more repetitions, more loads are required.</description>
