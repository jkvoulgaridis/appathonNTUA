    <textblock>
      This study is comprised of two portions: a Phase 1 portion and a Phase 2 portion. The Phase 1
      portion is a single-country, non-randomized, open label, clinical trial which will evaluate
      the safety, tolerability, preliminary efficacy, and PK profile of PD-0332991 as a single
      agent in Japanese patients with advanced solid tumors, and PD-0332991 in combination with
      letrozole in the first-line treatment of Japanese patients with ER(+) HER2(-) ABC. The Phase
      2 portion is a single-country, non-randomized, open-label, single-cohort, multi-center
      clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PD-0332991 in combination with
      letrozole for the first-line treatment of postmenopausal Japanese patients with ER(+) HER2(-)
      ABC.

PD was defined using RECIST v1.1, as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions.</description>

    <description>PFS was defined as the time from first dose of study treatment to the date of the first documentation of objective progression of disease (PD) or death due to any cause in the absence of documented PD, whichever occurs first.

    <description>DC: CR, PR or stable disease (SD) for &gt;=24 weeks according to RECIST version (v)1.1 recorded in time period between first dose of study treatment and disease progression or death to any cause. CR: disappearance of all target lesions with exception of nodal disease. All target nodes reduced to normal size (short axis &lt;10 mm). PR: &gt;=30% decrease in sum of longest dimensions of target lesions taking as a reference baseline sum longest dimensions. SD was defined as not achieving an OR with confirmed CR or PR according to RECIST v1.1, as determined by investigators, relative to response evaluable population, but remained stable for at least 24 weeks after first dose, then best overall response for such a participant was considered as stable disease. PD was defined using RECIST v1.1 as a 20% increase in sum of longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or appearance of new lesions.</description>

        <description>AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. An AE was considered treatment emergent if occurred for the first time after the start of study treatment or occurred prior to the start of treatment but increased in NCI CTCAE version 4.0 grade during study treatment period. AE severity was defined to be the maximum toxicity grade of the TEAEs experienced by the participants during the study. AE was assessed according to severity as: Grade 1 (mild AE), Grade 2 (moderate AE), Grade 3 (severe AE), Grade 4 (life-threatening consequences) and Grade 5 (death related to AE).</description>

        <description>The functional assessment of cancer therapy (FACT) is a modular approach to assess participant's health-related quality of life. FACT-B total score was derived from the sum of these 5 sub-scale scores: physical well-being, social/family well-being and functional well-being (all 3 sub-scales consisting of 7 items ranging from 0 to 28, where higher scores indicating better quality of life), emotional well-being (consists of 6 items and ranging from 0 to 24, where higher scores indicating better quality of life, and a breast cancer subscale (consists of 9 items and ranging from 0 to 36, where higher scores indicating better quality of life). Each individual item was rated on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from 0 (not at all good) to 4 (very well), where higher scores indicating better quality of life. FACT-B total score range was of 0 (not at all good) to 144 (very well), where higher scores indicating better quality of life.</description>

          <description>The functional assessment of cancer therapy (FACT) is a modular approach to assess participant's health-related quality of life. FACT-B total score was derived from the sum of these 5 sub-scale scores: physical well-being, social/family well-being and functional well-being (all 3 sub-scales consisting of 7 items ranging from 0 to 28, where higher scores indicating better quality of life), emotional well-being (consists of 6 items and ranging from 0 to 24, where higher scores indicating better quality of life, and a breast cancer subscale (consists of 9 items and ranging from 0 to 36, where higher scores indicating better quality of life). Each individual item was rated on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from 0 (not at all good) to 4 (very well), where higher scores indicating better quality of life. FACT-B total score range was of 0 (not at all good) to 144 (very well), where higher scores indicating better quality of life.</description>

        <description>FACT is a modular approach to assess participant's health-related quality of life. FACT-G total score was derived from the sum of these 4 sub-scale scores: physical well-being, social/family well-being and functional well-being (all 3 sub-scales consisting of 7 items ranging from 0 to 28, where higher scores indicating better quality of life), emotional well-being (consists of 6 items and ranging from 0 to 24, where higher scores indicating better quality of life). Each individual item was rated on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from 0 (not at all good) to 4 (very well), where higher scores indicating better quality of life. FACT-G total score range was of 0 (not at all good) to 108 (very well), where higher scores indicating better quality of life.</description>

        <description>FACT is a modular approach to assess participant's health-related quality of life. TOI total score was derived from the sum of the 3 sub-scale scores: physical well-being, functional well-being (both sub-scales consisting of 7 items ranging from 0 to 28, where higher scores indicating better quality of life) and breast cancer subscale (consists of 9 items and ranging from 0 to 36, where higher scores indicating better quality of life). Each individual item was rated on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from 0 (not at all good) to 4 (very well), where higher scores indicating better quality of life. TOI total score range was of 0 (not at all good) to 92 (very well), where higher scores indicating better quality of life.</description>
