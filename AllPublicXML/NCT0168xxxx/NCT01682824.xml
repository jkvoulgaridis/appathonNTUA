    <textblock>
      This trial studies how the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire works in measuring eating
      behavior in adolescent and young adult survivors of central nervous system (CNS) tumors. The
      Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire is comprised of three factors, including cognitive
      restraint, uncontrolled eating, and emotion eating. The Eating Questionnaire - Ecological
      Momentary Assessment method measures a patient's recent experiences and behavior, such as
      eating behavior, as they continue their daily living. Giving the Three-Factor Eating
      Questionnaire and the Eating Questionnaire - Ecological Momentary Assessment may help
      researchers measure eating behaviors more effectively in adolescent and young adult survivors
      of CNS tumors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES I. Evaluate whether the factor structure of the adapted Eating
      Questionnaire-Ecological Momentary Assessment (EQ-EMA), which has been modified for real time
      assessment, will be similar to the factor structures for cognitive restraint (CR) and
      uncontrollable eating (UE) factors assessed by the Three Factor Eating Questionnaire-R18v2
      (TFEQ-R18v2) in a sample of adolescent and young adult (AYA) survivors of childhood central
      nervous system (CNS) tumors in the United States (US).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES I. To validate the original TFEQ-R18v2 in a sample of AYA survivors of
      childhood CNS tumors in the US.

      II. To determine the association of the original TFEQ-R18v2 with self-reported body mass
      index (BMI).

      III. To determine the association of the original TFEQ-R18v2 with fruits and vegetables,
      fiber, and fat intake.

      IV. To determine the association of EQ-EMA with self-reported BMI. V. To determine the
      association of EQ-EMA with fruits and vegetables, fiber, and fat intake.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients complete the TFEQ-R18v2 questionnaire, a dietary intake assessment, and the
      EQ-EMA questionnaire online.

      GROUP II: Patients complete the EQ-EMA questionnaire, a dietary intake assessment and the
      TFEQ-R18v2 questionnaire.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adolescent or young adult (AYA) who has survived a primary CNS tumor

          -  Has been off therapy without relapse for at least 6 months

          -  Able to speak, write, and read in English

          -  Has access to the internet

          -  Has telephone access

          -  Currently lives in the United States

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Is in foster care

          -  Is experiencing severe cognitive impairments that do not allow them to engage in basic
             conversations (excluding individuals who may experience severe cognitive impairments
             because participants will need to provide assent [if &lt; 18 years old] or consent [if &gt;=
             18 years old] and will need to have the ability to independently complete the
             TFEQ-R18v2, Multifactor screener, and EQ-EMA. Through the phone screening conducted by
             the M D Anderson Cancer Center [MDACC] graduate research assistant [GRA], a person is
             determined to not be severely cognitive impaired if the participant is able to respond
             to basic questions such as their age, whether or not they have internet access, and
             telephone.)

          -  Is incarcerated at the time of enrollment
