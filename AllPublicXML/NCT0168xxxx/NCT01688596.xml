  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess if injection of local anesthetic to the
      laparoscopic trocar sites after a hysterectomy will make a difference in a patient's pain
      after surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The growing interest in minimally invasive gynecologic surgeries have increased the number of
      patients undergoing laparoscopic hysterectomies. Although many patients are being discharged
      home the same day of surgery, majority of patients complain of immediate postoperative pain
      after a laparoscopic hysterectomy. Since postoperative pain is usually transient and improves
      over a short period of time, infiltration of local anesthetic to trocar insertion sites might
      alleviate the patient's discomfort during the recovery period. Immediate post-operative pain
      relief further facilitates early discharge and faster patient recovery.

      Published data regarding the effects of preemptive port site local anesthesia in gynecologic
      operative laparoscopy have been limited and controversial. Visceral pain control through
      afferent nerve block could minimize pain perception especially during the first postoperative
      hours. This study aims to assess the influence of infiltration of local anesthetic to trocar
      insertion sites after laparoscopic hysterectomy on postoperative pain.

    <description>Postoperative pain is measured on day of surgery after trocar incisions are closed and injected with local anesthetic. Postoperative pain is evaluated with the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) at 4 hrs after the surgery. The Numerical Rating Scale is a scale from 0 to 10 that measures pain severity, where 0 equates to &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 equates to &quot;unable to move&quot;.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are scheduled for a laparoscopic hysterectomy for benign indications at
             the Department of Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology's Division of Minimally Invasive Surgery at
             Milton S. Hershey Medical Center will be included.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        <description>Postoperative pain is measured on day of surgery after trocar incisions are closed and injected with local anesthetic. Postoperative pain is evaluated with the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) at 4 hrs after the surgery. The Numerical Rating Scale is a scale from 0 to 10 that measures pain severity, where 0 equates to &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 equates to &quot;unable to move&quot;.</description>

All incisions 8 mm and greater are injected with 10 cc while all incisions 5 mm or less are infiltrated with 5 cc.
