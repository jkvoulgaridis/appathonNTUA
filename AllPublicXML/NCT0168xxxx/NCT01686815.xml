  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to utilize state of the art procedures such as the frequently sampled
      intravenous glucose tolerance test (FSIVGTT), Bergman's Minimal Model Analysis, lipoprotein
      analysis, and DEXA scans to demonstrate that a newer agent, iloperidone, is devoid of the
      metabolic abnormalities associated with other atypical antipsychotic treatments, namely
      olanzapine and risperidone, and offers an advantage over these other agents.

      This one-month research study examines how Fanapt® (iloperidone), Zyprexa® (olanzapine), or
      Risperdal® (risperidone) affect glucose metabolism in patients with schizophrenia,
      schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, psychosis NOS,
      delusional disorder or paranoid disorder. This study requires 3 research visits and includes
      a physical exam, medical history, vitals, an EKG, cognitive testing, psychological rating
      scales, a DEXA scan, a nutritional assessment, a 3-hour intravenous glucose tolerance test
      (IVGTT) and a fasting blood draw.
