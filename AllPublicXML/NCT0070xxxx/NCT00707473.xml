      This phase II trial studies how well docetaxel, cisplatin and fluorouracil work in treating
      patients with previously untreated stage II-IV nasal cavity and/or paranasal sinus cancer.
      Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, cisplatin and fluorouracil, work in different
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from
      dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the clinical/radiographic complete and partial response rate after induction
      chemotherapy with docetaxel, cisplatin and fluorouracil (TPF).

      II. To improve local tumor control to 80% at 2 years.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES I. Disease specific-survival and overall survival rates. II. Organ
      preservation (orbital, maxillary, cranial) rate. III. Patterns of treatment failure (local,
      regional, and distant). IV. Acute and late treatment-related toxicity. V. The effect of
      treatment on Quality of Life with and without surgery (i.e., M. D. Anderson Symptom Inventory
      [MDASI], M. D. Anderson Dysphagia Inventory [MDADI], Xerostomia Questionnaire, Performance
      Status Scale for Head &amp; Neck Cancer Patients [PSS-HN], etc.).

      VI. To evaluate the effects of induction chemotherapy on biological markers that could serve
      as surrogates for response and predictors of long-term outcome.

      OUTLINE:

      INDUCTION CHEMOTHERAPY: Patients receive docetaxel intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on day 1,
      cisplatin IV over 30-180 minutes or carboplatin IV on day 1, and fluorouracil IV continuously
      on days 1-4. Cycles repeat every 3 weeks for up to 2 cycles in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients who achieve complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) receive 1 additional
      course of treatment and undergo chemoradiotherapy over 6-7 weeks. Patients who have stable
      disease (SD) or progressive disease (PD) to induction therapy, or less than a complete
      response to chemoradiotherapy undergo surgery and radiation therapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years,
      every 4 months for 1 year and every 6 months for 2 years.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have a confirmed (by a MD Anderson Cancer Center [MDACC] pathologist)
             cytologic or histological diagnosis of locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma,
             poorly differentiated carcinoma, or sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma of the nasal
             cavity and/or paranasal sinuses.

          -  Stage II-IV disease; tumor (T) 2-4, node (N) any, metastasis (M) 0. Measurable disease
             is required with the following criteria: Measurable lesions can be accurately
             measured, with at least one diameter &gt;= 1.0 cm by spiral computed tomography (CT) scan
             or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Lesions can be bidimensionally measurable or
             unidimensionally measurable. Every effort should be made to measure lesions in two
             dimensions. Measurable disease is present if the patient has one or more measurable
             lesions. Non-measurable lesions/disease are all other lesions, including small lesions
             (those with measurements &lt; 2.0 cm; or &lt; 1.0 cm with spiral CT).

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (PS) 0-1.

          -  Absolute peripheral granulocyte count (AGC) of &gt;= 1500 cells/mm^3.

          -  Platelet count of &gt;= 100,000 cells/mm^3.

          -  Total bilirubin =&lt; upper limit of normal (ULN). If the patient has a history of
             Gilbert's Syndrome, check direct and indirect bilirubin. If in the judgment of the
             attending medical oncologist it is safe to treat the patient, the patient will be
             considered eligible for this criteria.

          -  Alkaline phosphatase =&lt; 2 x ULN. If in the judgment of the attending medical
             oncologist it is safe to treat the patient, the patient will be considered eligible
             for this criteria.

          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) =&lt; 2 x ULN. If in
             the judgment of the attending medical oncologist it is safe to treat the patient, the
             patient will be considered eligible for this criteria.

          -  Hemoglobin &gt;= 10.0g/dL.

          -  Per MDACC creatinine clearance (CrCl) guidelines, patients must have a creatinine
             clearance &gt; 50 ml/min determined by 24 hour collection or nomogram

          -  Patients should have uncontrolled intercurrent illness, which in the opinion of the
             attending medical oncologist, would render the patient unsuitable for the study (i.e.,
             preclude safe administration of the prescribed chemotherapy treatment).

          -  Women of child bearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy
             test (i.e., minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of human chorionic
             gonadotropin [HCG]), within 72 hours prior to the start of study treatment. Should a
             woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in the study, she
             should inform her treating physician(s) immediately.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written Informed Consent Document
             (ICD). In the event that non-English speaking participants are eligible for this
             study, a short form (if applicable) or an ICD in their language, will be utilized and
             completed in accordance with the MDACC Policy For Consenting Non-English Speaking
             Participants.

          -  Willingness to undergo MDACC Audiology and Ophthalmology Assessment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence of distant metastases (below the clavicle) by clinical or radiographic
             measures.

          -  Pre-existing peripheral neuropathy Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
             (CTCAE) grade 2 or worse.

          -  Pre-existing bilateral sensorineural hearing loss at &gt; 90dB at any frequency from
             250-8000Hz as assessed by a comprehensive audiometric evaluation for patients
             receiving cisplatin. This criteria will not apply to patients receiving carboplatin.

          -  Prior chemotherapy (i.e., as administered strictly for cancer treatment) within the
             previous 3 years. Use of chemotherapy agents for non-cancer treatment purposes (i.e.,
             arthritis treatment, etc.) are excluded from this criterion.

          -  Prior radiotherapy to the paranasal sinus region or the upper neck (i.e., prior
             radiotherapy to another disease site is acceptable).

          -  Initial surgical resection of the paranasal sinuses or nasal cavity region rendering
             the patient clinically and radiologically disease free.

          -  Simultaneous primary invasive cancers or patients currently receiving any other
             investigational agents at time of study enrollment. Patients may have received
             investigational agents in the past. No washout time period is required.

          -  Patients with a past history of malignancy that were treated less than 3 years and
             have not remained disease free for the past 3 years. (Patients with non metastatic
             skin cancers will be eligible).

          -  Men and women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) who are unwilling or unable to use an
             acceptable method to avoid pregnancy for the entire study period and for up to 3
             months after the study. Subjects who are men must also agree to use effective
             contraception. Note: WOCBP must be using an adequate method of contraception
             throughout the study and for up to 3 months after the study. Adequate methods of
             contraception will include (oral, injectable, or implantable hormonal contraceptive;
             tubal ligation; intra-uterine device; barrier contraceptive with spermicide; or
             vasectomized partner).

          -  Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.

          -  Patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity reaction to docetaxel or other
             drugs formulated with polysorbate 80.

          -  Patients with a known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
