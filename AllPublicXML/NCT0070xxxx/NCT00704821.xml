  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) is important for tumor growth in advanced
      cancer. It is known that tumors make a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor
      (VEGF). VEGF stimulates the formation of blood vessels that supply the tumor with nutrients
      and oxygen. PTC299 is an oral investigational new drug that has been shown to decrease
      production of VEGF in animal models of human cancer. In these animal models, oral PTC299
      administration decreases VEGF levels in the tumor and in the bloodstream, decreases blood
      vessel numbers in the tumor, and significantly slows or halts tumor growth. When given in
      combination with the chemotherapeutic drug, docetaxel, PTC299 increases the antitumor
      activity over use of docetaxel alone. Safety studies in research animals indicate good
      tolerability at doses and drug levels that are higher than those planned for the clinical
      studies. Results from Phase 1a studies in healthy volunteers indicate that PTC299 achieves
      levels of PTC299 in the bloodstream that are known to be active in animal models of human
      cancer. This Phase 1b study is designed to test the hypothesis that PTC299 will be tolerable
      and will show evidence of anti-VEGF and antitumor activity when administered orally to
      participants with cancer.

      The study will be conducted in 3 stages. In Stage 1 of the study, successive groups of 3 to 6
      participants will receive progressively higher PTC299 dose levels; in this stage, treatment
      will be given in repeated 6-week cycles consisting of 4 weeks of oral PTC299 twice per day
      followed by a 2-week, no-drug period. In Stage 2, additional groups of 3 to 6 participants
      will be enrolled at tolerable dose levels to receive treatment in repeated 6-week cycles
      consisting of oral PTC299 administered 2 or 3 times per day continuously (that is, without
      the 2-week no-drug period as in Stage 1). In Stage 3, additional groups of 3 to 6
      participants will be enrolled at tolerable dose levels to receive treatment in repeated
      3-week cycles consisting of oral PTC299 administered 2 or 3 times per day continuously in
      combination with docetaxel (75 milligrams/meter squared [mg/m^2] intravenously [IV] every 3
      weeks). All planned dose levels in all stages are expected to achieve circulating blood
      levels of PTC299 known to be active in animal models of human cancer. Treatment for each
      participant can continue as long as the therapy appears to be safely offering tumor control
      to that participant. Up to 76 evaluable participants will be accrued across the 3 stages.

    <description>In Stage 1, PTC299 will be given orally twice a day (BID) each day at about the same time each day for the first 28 days of each cycle. Each cycle will constitute a 4-week (28 days) period followed by a ≥2-week (14-day) washout period. Participants will be assigned to 0.3 milligrams (mg)/kilograms (kg)/dose BID, 0.6 mg/kg/dose BID, or 1.2 mg/kg/dose BID sequentially based on safety evaluations by the Sponsor's medical monitor in Cycle 1. Treatment cycles can continue if therapy appears to be safely offering tumor control to participant.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>In Stage 2, PTC299 will be given BID or 3 times a day (TID) orally each day at about the same time each day; therefore, 84 (for BID) or 126 (for TID) doses of PTC299 will be delivered during the 6-week (42-day) period in each cycle. Each participant will be assigned to 100 mg/dose BID, 100 mg/dose TID, 120 mg/dose TID, 160 mg/dose TID, or 200 mg/dose TID sequentially based on safety evaluations by the Sponsor's medical monitor in Cycle 1. Treatment cycles can continue if therapy appears to be safely offering tumor control to participant.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Stage 3</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>In Stage 3, PTC299 will be given BID or TID (for total of 42 [for BID] or 63 [for TID] doses) orally about same time per day starting on Day 1 in each 3-week (21-day) cycle. Starting dose will be 1 dose level below maximum tolerated dose (MTD) from Stage 2 or 80 mg/dose BID if 100 mg/dose TID in Stage 2 exceeds MTD. Dose escalation will be based on safety evaluations by Sponsor's medical monitor in Cycle 1. Treatment cycles can continue if therapy appears to be safely offering tumor control to participant. Participants will also receive docetaxel as a 1-hour IV infusion on Day 1 per cycle at starting dose of 75 mg/m^2 with body surface area calculation based on body weight. Dose will be sequentially reduced to 60 and 50 mg/m^2 in participants with a docetaxel-related dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). Participants will be medicated with oral corticosteroids with docetaxel administration. Recommended dose is 8 mg BID dexamethasone for 3 days starting 1 day prior to docetaxel administration.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Stage 4</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>In Stage 4, PTC299 will be given orally each day continuously starting on first day of each cycle at about same time per day; so, 42 doses of PTC299 will be delivered for 3 weeks (21-day) in Cycle 1 (BID dosing), and 84 doses will be delivered for 3-weeks (21-day) in Cycle 2 and beyond (TID dosing). For Cycle 1, participants will be assigned to 600, 800, or 1000 mg/dose BID sequentially based on safety evaluations by Sponsor's medical monitor at enrollment. For Cycle 2 and beyond, participants will receive PTC299 160 mg/dose TID. During Cycle 1, Cohort 1 participants will eat a meal containing of ≤15 grams (g) of dietary fat and Cohort 2 participants will eat a meal containing of ≤25 g of dietary fat prior to each dose of PTC299. If ≤2 of 6 participants had experienced DLT during Cycle 1 in either diet plan, then the dose will be escalated to 800 mg BID in Cohort 3 at the optimal diet. Treatment cycles can continue if therapy appears to be safely offering tumor control to participant.</description>
