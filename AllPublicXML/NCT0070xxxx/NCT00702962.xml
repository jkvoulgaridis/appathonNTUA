  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Phase I portion of the study is to assess the maximum tolerated dose of vorinostat when
      combined with carboplatin plus etoposide. The Phase II portion is to determine
      progression-free survival among patients with extensive disease small cell lung cancer
      receiving carboplatin plus etoposide with vorinostat.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vorinostat inhibits growth and induces apoptosis in various human carcinoma cells.
      Furthermore, it affects the expression of various genes that are necessary for proliferation
      of cancer cells. Vorinostat also appears to block angiogenic signaling. Pre-treating four
      human cancer cell lines (including a brain tumor line) with vorinostat increased the killing
      efficiency of etoposide, ellipticine, doxorubicin, or cisplatin, but not of the topoisomerase
      I inhibitor camptothecin 13. Topoisomerase II is a ubiquitous nuclear enzyme that is involved
      in DNA replication, transcription, chromosome segregation, and apoptosis. It is the target
      for several anti-cancer drugs including etoposide. Treatment with HDAC inhibitors induces
      expression of topoisomerase II in cancer cells and enhances the sensitivity to etoposide 14.

      Early phase clinical trials have demonstrated single agent anti-cancer activity with
      vorinostat. In our study, combination of vorinostat with carboplatin and paclitaxel,
      demonstrated promising anticancer activity against NSCLC, including histological subsets of
      patients whose tumors demonstrated neuroendocrine differentiation 8. For all these reasons,
      vorinostat is a rational choice to combine with the regimen of carboplatin and etoposide for
      evaluation in patients with SCLC-ED.

    <time_frame>2 years, not analyzed</time_frame>
    <description>To estimate the maximum tolerated dose of vorinostat using a traditional dose escalation schedule (&quot;3 + 3 design). MTD is determined by assessing for specific predefined dose limiting toxicities. A starting dose of vorinostat 200mg was combined with carboplatin and etoposide. Dose escalation went in increments of 100mg (i.e. 300mg, 400mg).</description>

    <time_frame>2 years, not analyzed</time_frame>
    <description>Eligibility limits the study population to those who have measurable disease pre-treatment. This secondary outcome measure was intended to objectively evaluate disease response and survival rate in recipients of the investigational medication regimen. Disease response was performed using standard diagnostic imaging. Tumor markers and cytology may be used to support the imaging results. Objective response rate was defined as progression-free survival (PFS) among treatment recipients. PFS, is defined as time (in months) from entry to clinical evidence of disease progression or death without progression. The clinical trial closed prematurely due to low accrual. For this reason, an analysis of this secondary objective would not be meaningful. No analysis done.</description>

    <description>Study originally a Phase I standard dose escalation of the study medication Vorinostat with sequential cohorts of 3-6 participants entered to 3 dose levels (200mg, 300mg, 400mg). Dose escalation stopped after participant 1 on dose level 2 due to recently published research identifying an appropriate dosing regimen. A set dose was then to be administered to all subsequent participants. This regimen (a &quot;cycle&quot;) consisted of Vorinostat on Day 1 through Day 4, Carboplatin AUC 6 on Day 3, and Etoposide 100 mg/m2 on Day 3 through Day 5. Treatment cycles were repeated every 21 days (3 weeks) for 4 cycles total.</description>

        <description>Eligibility limits the study population to those who have measurable disease pre-treatment. This secondary outcome measure was intended to objectively evaluate disease response and survival rate in recipients of the investigational medication regimen. Disease response was performed using standard diagnostic imaging. Tumor markers and cytology may be used to support the imaging results. Objective response rate was defined as progression-free survival (PFS) among treatment recipients. PFS, is defined as time (in months) from entry to clinical evidence of disease progression or death without progression. The clinical trial closed prematurely due to low accrual. For this reason, an analysis of this secondary objective would not be meaningful. No analysis done.</description>

Participants in Phase II received a &quot;cycle&quot; consisting of the NCI recommended Vorinostat dose with Carboplatin 6 AUC and Etoposide 100 mg/m2. Treatment cycles were repeated every 3 weeks. A maximum of 4 cycles were administered. A total of 35 participants were required for Phase II analysis. The Phase II study closed prematurely due to low accrual.

Initial dose at 200mg, then 300, to a max of 400 mg. The first cohort at 200 mg did well with no dose limiting toxicities. After the enrollment of the 1st participant into cohort 2, the Phase I study was prematurely closed as concurrent NCI publications had established appropriate dose levels. The phase I portion was closed after the first 3 participants. Analysis of the objectives is not applicable due to premature closing.</description>
