  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Liver disease in the morbidly obese is thought to occur due to the long-term presence of fat
      deposits in the liver, resulting in inflammation and scarring of the liver over time, which
      reduces liver function. However, many of these patients are unaware that their liver is
      damaged. There is currently no consensus regarding what the long-term effects of gastric
      bypass surgery are on pre-existing liver disease in morbidly obese patients. This study will
      determine the long-term effects on the liver after this type of surgical procedure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Before or on the day of surgery liver function will be determined using the DDG-2001
      Analyzer. This monitor is able to detect the concentration of a dye called indocyanine green
      dye (ICG) when present in the blood stream. A dose of 0.5 mg/kg of ICG will be injected into
      an IV in the arm. Over approximately fifteen minutes the DDG-2001 Analyzer will determine how
      quickly the liver removes the dye ICG from the blood stream. This value represents how well
      the liver is functioning. Blood samples are drawn before injection of ICG to measure liver
      function using standard liver function tests.

      This same routine for injecting ICG and obtaining blood for routine liver function tests will
      happen one more time, after surgery, once the subject has lost a significant amount of the
      original weight (60% of excess weight). This amount of weight loss typically occurs between
      12 to 18 months after gastric bypass surgery. This second ICG measurement will occur during
      an outpatient follow-up visit to CCF.

      A biopsy will be taken from the liver during surgery. A second biopsy taken after the 60%
      weight loss will be compared to determine the effect of this surgery on the liver.

    <description>To assess the liver function change from before surgery to the time when they lost 60% of their preoperative excess weight or weight loss had plateaued after this procedure (after the procedure minus versus before the procedure). ICG-k value is the slope of the decay curve of the serum ICG clearance graph, which is used to assess the liver function as it represents the rate of disappearance of ICG from blood as the liver exclusively distracts it. The lower k value means a lower rate of ICG clearance, indicating a worse liver function.</description>

    <description>To compare the distribution of NAS steatosis stage from before surgery to when patients lost 60% of their preoperative excess weight or weight loss had plateaued. The NAFLD activity score (NAS) from the NASH clinical Clinic Research Network is the unweighted sum of scores for steatosis, lobular inflammation, and ballooning hepatocyte degeneration, and ranges from zero to eight points. The histological reporting for grading steatosis was based on a scale of 0 to 3, with 0 being no steatosis (&lt;5%), 1 being mild steatosis (involving 5-33% of the biopsy specimen), 2 being moderate steatosis (involving 34-66% of the specimen), and 3 being severe (involving &gt;66%).</description>

          <description>Before the treatment of RYGB surgery, eligible patients had preoperative liver function assessment including biochemical testing: AST, ALT, ALK, total bilirubin, albumin, and prothrombin (PT). During RYGB, a core liver biopsy was conducted. Serum lipid profiles and HbA1c values were medially optimized. Patients were asked to refrain from alcohol use for several preoperative days and discontinue hepatotoxic medications. Once patients lost 60% of their preoperative excess weight or weight loss had plateaued after RYGB surgery, they were reassessed on liver function(same as preoperative) and histology. Patients who had stable weight loss and were found to have clinically important liver damage as determined by liver biopsy at the time of RYGB were offered with repeat percutaneous ultrasound-guided liver biopsies after RYGB.</description>

        <description>AST was measured before RYGB surgery and was used to fit a univariate logistic model to predict clinically asymptomatic but significant fatty liver, including NASH and NASH plus fibrosis. The AUC (area under the curve) of the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was calculated with a 99.4% confidence interval. The x-axis of ROC is the false positive rate (%) and the y-axis is the true positive rate (%). The AUC value of ROC represents the performance of diagnostic measures/models, the higher value means better performance in general. The range of AUC is from 0 to 1.0 (perfect performance).</description>

        <description>ALK was measured before RYGB surgery and was used to fit a univariate logistic model to predict clinically asymptomatic but significant fatty liver, including NASH and NASH plus fibrosis. The AUC (area under the curve) of the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was calculated with a 99.4% confidence interval. The AUC (area under the curve) of the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was calculated with a 99.4% confidence interval. The x-axis of ROC is the false positive rate and the y-axis is the true positive rate. The AUC of ROC represents the performance of diagnostic measures/models, the higher score means better performance in general. The range of AUC is from 0 to 1.0.</description>

            <description>Before the treatment of RYGB surgery, eligible patients had preoperative liver function assessment including biochemical testing: AST, ALT, ALK, total bilirubin, albumin, and prothrombin (PT). During RYGB, a core liver biopsy was conducted. Serum lipid profiles and HbA1c values were medially optimized. Patients were asked to refrain from alcohol use for several preoperative days and discontinue hepatotoxic medications. Once patients lost 60% of their preoperative excess weight or weight loss had plateaued after RYGB surgery, they were reassessed on liver function(same as preoperative) and histology. Patients who had stable weight loss and were found to have clinically important liver damage as determined by liver biopsy at the time of RYGB were offered with repeat percutaneous ultrasound-guided liver biopsies after RYGB.</description>

            <title>Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB)</title>
            <description>Before the treatment of RYGB surgery, eligible patients had preoperative liver function assessment including biochemical testing: AST, ALT, ALK, total bilirubin, albumin, and prothrombin (PT). During RYGB, a core liver biopsy was conducted. Serum lipid profiles and HbA1c values were medially optimized. Patients were asked to refrain from alcohol use for several preoperative days and discontinue hepatotoxic medications. Once patients lost 60% of their preoperative excess weight or weight loss had plateaued after RYGB surgery, they were reassessed on liver function(same as preoperative) and histology. Patients who had stable weight loss and were found to have clinically important liver damage as determined by liver biopsy at the time of RYGB were offered with repeat percutaneous ultrasound-guided liver biopsies after RYGB.</description>

          <title>Diagnostic Accuracy-multiple Factor</title>
          <description>We also built a multivariable model using all preoperative liver function tests and ICG k clearance values to predict NASH (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis) from pre-RYGB values. AUC was used to assess the prediction performance of those multiple factors. The AUC (area under the curve) of the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was calculated with a 95% confidence interval. The x-axis of ROC is the false positive rate (%) and the y-axis is the true positive rate (%). The AUC value of ROC represents the performance of diagnostic measures/models, the higher value means better performance in general. The range of AUC is from 0 to 1.0 (perfect performance).</description>
