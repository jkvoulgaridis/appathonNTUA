  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study attempts to evaluate a histamine analog long used for the treatment of Meniere's
      disease, betahistine, that shows promise in reversing the antihistaminergic effects thought
      to be involved in antipsychotic induced weight gain.

      Hypothesis to be tested:

      A. Patients who have gained a developmentally inappropriate amount of weight on
      antipsychotics (AP) will see their weight and BMI decrease with betahistine augmentation as
      compared to placebo augmentation.

      B. Betahistine augmentation in AP treated patients will increase levels of satiety in a
      standardized meal situation and decrease caloric intake as compared to placebo augmentation.

      C. Metabolic effects of betahistine augmentation in AP treated patients will be reflected in
      differences in waist circumference, hip circumference and waist hip ratios D. Betahistine
      augmentation in this population will lead to decrease in fasting glucose-lipid lab values
      related to the development of metabolic syndrome as compared to placebo augmentation

      Subjects for this study were adolescents and adults from age 12 to age 59. Subjects were
      individuals who have been psychiatrically stabilized on first or second generation
      antipsychotic medication, and have gained substantial weight during their treatment. Subjects
      were excluded if they have asthma, peptic ulcer disease (diseases which may be exacerbated by
      a histamine analog) or are prescribed medications known to affect body composition or
      metabolism other than those currently being studied. Subjects were randomized to receive
      either betahistine or placebo at a 1:1 ratio.

It is a Visual Analogue Scale, where a line is drawn of 10 cm long with the statement beneath the line&quot; How Hungry do you feel '. The subject places an X on the line. The measurements, the number of centimeters from the start of the line (&quot;O&quot;), indicate the amount of hunger. The higher the cm number the higher the feeling of hunger. The measure reported is the difference in this scale reading in cm from after the test meal to before consuming the test meal. The number (mean, s.e.m) presented is the analysis of covariance model estimated difference score at the end of study, with the covariate of the same score at baseline.</description>

          3. The patient has a BMI of 30 or more and has gained 10 lbs or more in the past 8 months
             while being treated with antipsychotic medications.

          4. The patient has a BMI of 35 or greater at the current time, and his chart shows a
             history of consistent weight gain over the past 1 to 3 years during treatment with
             antipsychotics.

             Exclusion Criteria:

               -  Subjects will be excluded if they have asthma, peptic ulcer disease (diseases

                  medications known to affect body weight or glucose-lipid metabolism, such as

                  reduction. Subjects who are currently treated with metformin, for less than 6
                  months and have shown recent weight change on metformin. Patients on thyroid
                  replacement therapy or lipid-lowering agents whose dosage has changed by more
                  than 50 % in the past month will be excluded. If they are relatively stable doses
                  of these medications they will not be excluded. Patients who are on lipid
                  lowering medication, thyroid replacement medication, or diabetes medication,

        <title>Change in Appetite Hunger</title>
        <description>Least Squares estimated change in appetite hunger from end of study minus baseline.The scale used has no specific name. It is a Visual Analogue Scale, where a line is drawn of 10 cm long with the statement beneath the line&quot; How Hungry do you feel '. The subject places an X on the line. The measurements, the number of centimeters from the start of the line (&quot;O&quot;), indicate the amount of hunger. The higher the cm number the higher the feeling of hunger. The measure reported is the difference in this scale reading in cm from after the test meal to before consuming the test meal. The number (mean, s.e.m) presented is the analysis of covariance model estimated difference score at the end of study, with the covariate of the same score at baseline.</description>
