  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to evaluate the safety and the clinical activity of MAGE-A3
      Antigen-Specific Cancer Immunotherapeutic in patients with unresectable and progressive
      metastatic cutaneous melanoma.

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    The study was terminated early due to difficulties in recruiting subjects, not following
    concerns for the safety or absence of clinical activity in patients.

    <description>The assessment was made as per the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0, where Grade refers to the severity of the AE. The CTCAE version 3.0 displays Grades 1 through 5 with unique clinical descriptions of severity for each AE, as follows: Grade 1 = Mild AE; Grade 2 = Moderate AE; Grade 3 = Severe AE; Grade 4 = Life-threatening or disabling AE; Grade 5 = Death related to AE.</description>

    <description>Patients received 4 cycles of MAGE-A3 product as follows:
Cycle 1: 6 doses, each given at a 2-week interval,
Cycle 2: 6 doses, each given at a 3-week interval
Cycle 3: 4 doses, each given at a 6-week interval
Cycle 4: 4 doses, each given at a 3-month interval followed by 4 doses, each given at a 6-month interval.
The MAGE-A3 product was administered intramuscularly in the deltoid or lateral regions of the thighs, alternately on the right and left sides.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female patient with histologically proven, measurable metastatic cutaneous
             melanoma, and with documented progressive disease within the 12 weeks before the first
             administration of study treatment.

          -  Written informed consent has been obtained from the patient before the performance of
             any protocol-specific procedure.

          -  Patient is &gt;= 18 years of age at the time of signature of the informed consent.

          -  The patient's tumor shows expression of MAGE-A3 gene

          -  ECOG performance status of 0 or 1.

          -  The patient has normal organ functions

          -  If the patient is female, she must be of non-childbearing potential, or if she is of
             childbearing potential, she must practice adequate contraception for 30 days prior to
             administration of study treatment, have a negative pregnancy test and continue such
             precautions during all study treatment period and for 2 months after completion of the
             injection series.

          -  In the view of the investigator, the patient can and will comply with the requirements
             of the protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient has at any time received systemic (bio-)chemotherapy (except for isolated
             limb perfusion, as long as this was performed at least 4 weeks before first study
             treatment administration).

          -  The patient is scheduled to receive any anti-cancer specific treatment, including
             radiotherapy, immunotherapy, chemotherapy and immunomodulating agents.

          -  The patient requires concomitant treatment with systemic corticosteroids, or any other
             immunosuppressive agents.

          -  The patient received any cancer immunotherapeutic containing a MAGE-A3 antigen or any
             cancer immunotherapeutic for his/her metastatic disease.

          -  The patient has received any investigational or non-registered drug or vaccine other
             than the study medication within the 30 days preceding the first ASCI injection or it
             is planned that (s)he will receive such a drug during the study period.

          -  The patient has (or has had) previous or concomitant malignancies at other sites,
             except effectively treated malignancy that is considered by the investigator highly
             likely to have been cured.

          -  History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of
             the study investigational product.

          -  The patient has an autoimmune disease such as, but not limited to, multiple sclerosis,
             lupus, and inflammatory bowel disease. Patients with vitiligo are not excluded.

          -  The patient has a family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency.

          -  The patient is known to be positive for the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).

          -  The patient has psychiatric or addictive disorders that may compromise his/her ability
             to give informed consent, or to comply with the trial procedures.

          -  The patient has concurrent severe medical problems, unrelated to the malignancy, that
             would significantly limit full compliance with the study or expose the patient to
             unacceptable risk.

          -  For female patients: the patient is pregnant or lactating.
