  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well bortezomib and vorinostat work in treating patients with
      recurrent mantle cell lymphoma or recurrent and/or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.
      Bortezomib and vorinostat may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a multicenter, non-randomized phase 2 trial using a Simon two-stage design with 3
      cohorts.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimate the response rates of mantle cell and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas to
      bortezomib and vorinostat combination therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the safety and tolerability of the study regimen. II. Observe progression-free
      survival and response durations. III. Observe the relationship between pretreatment lymphoma
      cell nuclear v-rel reticuloendotheliosis viral oncogene homolog A (relA) and response.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive vorinostat orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-5 and 8-12. Patients also
      receive bortezomib intravenously (IV) over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Courses
      repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

    <description>Participants receive vorinostat orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-5 and 8-12. Participants also receive bortezomib intravenously (IV) over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Vorinostat precedes bortezomib on days of concurrent administration. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression - or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study therapy, participants are followed periodically.
Treatment arm consists of 3 cohorts, all receiving the same treatment:
A: Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) - with no prior bortezomib.
B: Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) - with no prior bortezomib.
C: Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) - with no prior bortezomib.</description>
