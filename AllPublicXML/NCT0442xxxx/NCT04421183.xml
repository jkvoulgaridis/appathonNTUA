  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertensive diseases of pregnancy are one of the most frequently encountered reasons for
      maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. The excretion of high levels of mucoprotein
      takes part in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia through restraining trophoblast invasion. This
      study aimed to investigate levels of serum mucoprotein three in hypertensive diseases of
      pregnancy. This study included a total of eighty cases that 20 normal pregnancy, 20
      gestational hypertension, 20 preeclampsia, and 20 HELLP syndrome patients from June 2010-
      January 2011.

      Hypertensive diseases of pregnancy are one of the most frequently encountered reasons for
      maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. The excretion of high levels of mucoprotein
      takes part in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia through restraining trophoblast invasion. This
      study aimed to investigate levels of serum mucoprotein three in hypertensive diseases of
      pregnancy. This study included a total of eighty cases that 20 normal pregnancy, 20
      gestational hypertension, 20 preeclampsia, and 20 HELLP syndrome patients from June 2010-
      January 2011. This is the first study measuring levels of serum mucoprotein three in
      gestational hypertensive disease. MUC3 levels showed a distinctive increase in hypertensive
      diseases of pregnancy compared with the pregnant control group. As a result, it is found that
      plasma mucoprotein 3 levels increase as the severity of hypertensive diseases of pregnancy
      increases; and plasma mucoprotein 3 could be a precursor for the evaluation of the severity
      of the disease.

    <description>The blood samples required for the study were obtained from samples taken into a heparinized tube. Maternal blood samples were taken at the time of diagnosis in patients with preeclamptic - eclamptic, gestational hypertension and HELLP syndrome before starting any treatment when they apply for delivery in normal pregnant women. After the blood samples were centrifuged at Eppendorf Centrifuge-5084R at 3000 G for 10 minutes, the serum was separated. Some of the serum collected were placed in a 1.5 cc Eppendorf tube and stored at -80 ˚C in the medical cooler (Ariston) in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology.</description>

    <description>After collecting all serum samples (80 pieces), they were dissolved at room temperature and MUC3 (Human Mucin 3, MUC3 ELISA Kit) level was measured in serum samples with the help of commercial ELISA kits. The measurement technique principle is given below.Mucoprotein content in serum was determined in ng/ml with the help of a special ELISA kit system and elements for mucoprotein 3.</description>
