  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The sexual health is considered as a state of physical, mental and social well-being in
      relation to sexuality that requires a positive and respectful approach to sexuality, as well
      as the possibility of having pleasant and safe sexual experiences, free from all coercion,
      discrimination and violence. However, lack of family planning, having unprotected sex,
      unwanted pregnancies, abortions, Sexually Transmitted Infections, lack of acceptance of
      sexual identity, sexism, having multiple sexual partners and having sex under the influence
      of alcohol and drugs are some of the main elements that alter the well-being of people's
      sexual health, especially in the young population. In this sense, different organizations
      have pointed out the importance of promoting in young people strategies related to providing
      an adequate level of knowledge in sexual health from a perspective of the exercise of sexual
      rights to reduce alterations in risky sexual practices and it has been identified that the
      school environment can be the ideal space for a health services approach to this age group to
      strengthen their well-being and ensure their development during adulthood. However, the
      sexual health interventions traditionally implemented by the health services are usually
      aimed mainly at transmitting knowledge about the benefits of condom use, sexually transmitted
      diseases and unwanted pregnancies and violence, excluding other elements that make up the
      sexual health and making use of conventional educational strategies through print media or
      short educational sessions, which causes little interaction between health personnel and
      users that consolidates the purpose of the interventions. That said, the implementation of a
      socio-educational intervention in sexual health that promotes sexual rights, positive
      attitudes towards sexuality and the prevention of risky sexual behaviors articulated in a
      model of a life project that motivates them to achieve the ideal stage of life for starting a
      family in a healthy way through family planning, can promote the strengthening not only of
      their sexual health but also their well-being for their future development as adults.
