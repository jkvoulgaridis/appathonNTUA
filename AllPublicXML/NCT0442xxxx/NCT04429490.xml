  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic adenocarcinoma represents more than 90% of pancreatic neoplasms. Around 14000 new
      cases of pancreatic adenocarcinoma are being diagnosed each year in France and about 8.6% in
      Grand Est region. National incidence has doubled for men and tripled for women between 1982
      and 2012. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is the deadliest digestive cancer, with only 7 to 8% all
      stages 5-year survival. It will become the second deadliest in Europe, behind
      bronchopulmonary cancer.

      Several risk factors have been identified such as diabetes, tobacco, chronic pancreatitis or
      obesity. However, a mismatch exists between incidence forecasts and actual risk factors
      knowledge. Several hypothesis plead for an environnemental cause.

      Plant protection products oncogenetic effects are known and have been proved to be
      responsible for tumors, including haematological malignancies. Its role in pancreatic
      carcinogenesis is still poorly studied and show heterogeneous results. They do not allow to
      conclude for causality. Organochlorines is a specific subset of plant protection product that
      store in lipids during lifetime.

      The aim is to study association between organochlorine concentration in adipose tissue with
      pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

    <textblock>
      Unicentric prospective case control study comparing organochlorine levels including patients
      diagnosed with a pancreatic adenocarcinoma undergoing a surgery allowing to collect an
      adipose tissue sample (10g).

      Controls are adults with no pancreatic cancer (excluded by a 6 months old computed tomography
      excluding the probability of a pancreatic neoplasm), paired with cases upon age and body mass
      index, with a scheduled surgical procedure allowing to collect an adipose tissue sample
      without extending procedure length.
