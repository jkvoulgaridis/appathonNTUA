  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was a Phase 1, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised study of very low dose
      LSD. Healthy volunteers aged 55 to 75 years with no use of LSD in the past 5 years were
      screened within 28 days of randomization. Subjects who met all inclusion and no exclusion
      criteria and provided written informed consent were randomised a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive 6
      doses of 5 µg, 10 µg, or 20 µg LSD or placebo, at 4-day intervals for 21 days (on Study Days
      1, 5, 9, 13, 17, and 21). A follow-up visit was conducted approximately 4 weeks after the
      last dose of LSD. A total of 48 subjects were enrolled.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The magnitude of the effect of LSD was explored across specific PD measures.

      These included:

        -  Cognition and affect, including evaluation of memory, temporal perception, executive
           function, and learning

        -  Subjective effects

        -  Proprioception and balance

             acute administration of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or
             haloperidol, or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) or monoamine
             oxidase inhibitors.

          3. Subject is taking OTC doses of 5-HT or St John's Wort or Ayahuasca (which contains
