  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this research is to investigate the bioavailability of curcumin
      (CURC) and ursolic acid (UA) in a phase I clinical trial in healthy men and obtain biological
      material for bioavailability analysis.

      Once a subject is consented and assigned to a cohort, the subject may undergo a digital
      rectal exam (DRE) and rectal swab fecal collection and provide research blood (including CBC
      and CMP safety labs) and urine. Medical history data will be collected and reviewed. The PI
      and/or study staff will provide supplement administration and supplement diary education
      prior to the subject starting their dose of UA, CURC, or UA and CURC combination.
      Pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) assessments will be collected at pre-dose and 6
      and 24 hours after the first dose. Urine will also be collected at pre dose and 24 hours post
      dose. The dosing period will be for a total of 2 weeks (Â± 3 days). On the last day of dosing,
      subjects will attend a research only visit at which the subject may undergo a digital rectal
      exam (DRE) and rectal swab fecal collection and provide research blood and urine. At this
      time, the subject's supplement diary will be reviewed and a safety/AE assessment will be
      completed. In addition, research CBC and CMP safety labs will be collected. If a subject
      initially enrolled in Cohort 1 or 2 decides to continue in Cohort 3, the subject will undergo
      a wash out period of at least 4 weeks and repeat all study procedures for Cohort 3.
