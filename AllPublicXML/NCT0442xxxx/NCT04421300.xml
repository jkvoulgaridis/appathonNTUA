      The study is designed to: Test the hypothesis that smile exercise is an effective treatment
      for Dry Eye Disease (DED) . Better understand the status of emotion, quality of sleep and
      life in DED patient by describing and evaluating a comprehensive set of features and
      treatment over 2 months of observation in a well-characterized group of patients.
