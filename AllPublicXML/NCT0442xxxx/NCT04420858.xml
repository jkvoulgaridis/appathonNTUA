      The investigators propose a randomized controlled trial to assess baseline maternal knowledge
      of and attitudes toward commercial prenatal genetic testing laboratories' genetic privacy

      The investigators propose a randomized controlled trial to assess baseline maternal knowledge
      of and attitudes toward commercial prenatal genetic testing laboratories' genetic privacy
      practices, and to determine whether a brief educational intervention alters these attitudes.
      Pregnant women undergoing specialized fetal anatomic ultrasound surveys at Women and Infants'
      maternal fetal medicine prenatal diagnostic imaging centers will be recruited to participate.
      Volunteers will be randomized to receive either standard education about prenatal genetic
      testing or standard education plus additional education about federal genetic privacy
      protections. Next, the participants view the educational materials to which they were
      randomized. Finally, all volunteers will take the same survey, which will assess baseline
      demographic variables as well as their knowledge of and attitudes toward broad sharing of
      data obtained from prenatal genetic testing. Once finished with the survey, volunteers will
      have completed their participation in this study.
