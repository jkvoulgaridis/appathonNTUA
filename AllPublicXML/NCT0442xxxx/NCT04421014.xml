  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      In Alzheimer s disease (AD) the brain cannot use glucose as a fuel. The brain can use ketones
      as a fuel instead of glucose. Researchers want to test a supplement, HVNM Ketone Ester (KE).
      It may improve brain metabolic function and cognition in normal people and, perhaps, down the
      road, in patients with AD.

      Objective:

      To study the change in brain ketone levels in people after 28 days of taking HVMN KE compared
      with baseline and placebo. Also, to study changes in cognitive performance.

      Eligibility:

      People 55 years old or older with metabolic syndrome and no cognitive impairment

      Design:

      Participants will have 4 visits.

      Participants will be screened at Visit 1 with:

      Medical history

      Physical exam

      Blood and urine tests

      Cognitive testing

      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either the study supplement or a placebo
      with same amount of calories. Neither they nor the researchers will know which they receive.

      Visit 2 will include repeats of some screening tests. It will also include:

      Stool sample (brought from home)

      MRI/MRS: Participants will lie on a table that slides in and out of a scanner. A coil will be
      placed over their head. They may be asked to perform leg exercises.

      First dose of study supplement or placebo

      About 2 weeks after Visit 2, Visit 3 will include blood and urine tests and a questionnaire.

      About 2 weeks after Visit 3, Visit 4 will include repeats of the Visit 2 tests.

      Participants will drink the study supplement or placebo 3 times per day during the study.
      They will keep a daily log of each dose. They will bring the log to Visits 3 and 4.

      Participants will by contacted by phone once per week during the study to see how they are
      doing.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that supplementation with a ketone ester drink [HVMN Ketone Ester (KE)]
      compared to placebo, in cognitively intact adults 55 years old with Metabolic Syndrome
      (Mets), will (i) increase peripheral and brain ketone levels [primarily f3-hydroxybutyrate
      (BHB) and secondarily acetoacetate (AcAc)], (ii) improve neuronal/astrocytic insulin
      resistance (IR) and induce a change in neuronal/astrocytic metabolism as reflected on blood
      Extracellular Vesicle (EV) biomarkers, (iii) improve cognitive performance, (iv) boost
      mitochondrial function in muscle, and (v) change gut microbiome. These effects will be
      examined acutely, after single (NotEqual) dose administration, and chronically, after 28 days
      on the supplement x 3 times per day. The changes in EV biomarkers and cognition will be
      associated with the elevation of ketones in brain. The study will involve a Screening Visit
      and three additional Visits to assess acute effects, compliance and chronic effects,
      respectively.

    <description>The main ingredient of HVMN Ketone Ester [(R)-3- hydroxybutyl (R)-3- hydroxybutyrate)] is regulated as GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe) substance by the FDA (https://www.accessdata .fda.gov/ scripts/ fdcc/index.cfmset=GRASNotices&amp;amp;id=515). The HVMN KE compound is already being sold in the market as a ketogenic supplement and is especially popular among athletes, such as cyclists (sold by the official website of the company (https://hvmn.com/ketone-ester) and in a popular selling website (https://www.amazon.com/HVMN (NotEqual)Ketone-Pocket-Sized (NotEqual)Sugar-Free (NotEqual)Performance/dp/ B07CTP3XST). The dose and formulation (25 g of KE contained in 65 ml of the drink HVMN KE), daily scheme (3 times daily) and total duration (28 days) are identical to a previous safety human study.</description>

             osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and/or fibromyalgia.

        5.3 INCLUSION OF VULNERABLE PARTICIPANTS

          -  Children: No inclusion is planned. This study aims to investigate the effects of aging
             55 years old) on brain metabolism, therefore inclusion of children is inappropriate
             with respect to the purpose of the research.

          -  Pregnant Women, Fetuses, or Neonates: No inclusion is planned. We will exclude women,
             fetuses or neonates with respect to the health of participants, specifically, due to
             the risk associated with the MRI procedure and the unknown effects of the ketone ester
             supplement.

          -  Prisoners: No inclusion is planned. This study involves several visits to the NIA
             Clinical Unit, which prisoners are unable to perform. Therefore, inclusion of
             prisoners is inappropriate with respect to the purpose of the research.

          -  Decisionally Impaired Adults: No inclusion is planned. Cognitive intact status will be
             ascertained at baseline based on Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) of 0, and Montreal
             Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) &gt; 26, since the main objective of the study is to study a
             population of cognitively intact individuals. Therefore, inclusion of decisionally
             impaired adults is inappropriate with respect to the purpose of the research.
             Moreover, participants are not expected to become decisionally impaired over the
             course of the study.

          -  NIH Employees: We intend to include NIH staff (to include NIH contractors and special
             volunteers, guest researchers and trainees) in this study. The staff will be invited
             to participate through standard recruitment efforts. Participation will be voluntary
             and neither participation nor refusal to participate will have an effect, either
             beneficial or adverse, on the participant s employment or position at NIH. We will
             follow the Guidelines for the Inclusion of Employees in NIH Research Studies and will
             give each employee a copy of the NIH information sheet on Staff Research Participation
             per NIH OHSRP SOP 14F.4: Research Involving NIH Staff as Subjects.

          -  Neither participation nor refusal to participate will have an effect, either
             beneficial or adverse, on the participant s employment or work situation.

          -  The NIH information sheet regarding NIH employee research participation will be
             distributed to all potential subjects who are NIH employees.

          -  The employee subject s privacy and confidentiality will be preserved in accordance
             with NIH Intramural policies, which define the scope and limitations of the
             protections.

          -  Subjects that are employees/staff will be consented in the usual manner. The inclusion
             of employees or staff is not anticipated to affect the research outcome; therefore, if
             the subject is a co-worker (including a supervisor, subordinate or coworker) the
             subject may be consented by another co-worker and/or subordinate.The study PI will not
             be involved in the consenting of employees or staff.

          -  Other vulnerable populations: No inclusion is planned.
