  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of the study is to determine if treatment of a Major Depressive Disorder
      (MDD) improves the outcomes of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). We showed that MDD
      is present in 25% of CKD patients and independently associated with progression to End-Stage
      Kidney Disease, hospitalization, and death. Depression is also associated with lower quality
      of life (QOL), fatigue, poor sleep, and non-adherence to diet and medications. However,
      evidence for efficacy and tolerability of commonly-used antidepressant medications or
      nonpharmacologic treatments are limited in CKD patients. Our group was the first to conduct a
      double-blind randomized controlled trial for MDD treatment in 201 patients with non-dialysis
      CKD, and showed that sertraline, a commonly used selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor
      (SSRI), was no more efficacious than placebo for improving depressive symptoms. It becomes
      imperative to test novel strategies to treat MDD in CKD. We propose to compare with a control
      group, the efficacy and tolerability of two novel treatment strategies - (1) Behavioral
      Activation Teletherapy (BAT) for 16 weeks, with the addition of bupropion, a non-SSRI
      antidepressant, at 8 weeks for patients whose depression has not remitted (non-remitters);
      and (2) bupropion for 16 weeks, with the addition of BAT at 8 weeks for non-remitters. In Aim
      1, we will investigate the efficacy and tolerability of these 2 strategies vs. control for
      improvement in a primary endpoint of depressive symptoms in 201 patients (67 per group) with
      non-dialysis CKD stages 3b-5 and MDD at 2 sites, randomized 1:1:1 to either strategy or a
      control group of Clinical Management plus placebo. We hypothesize that either approach vs.
      control will result in a minimal clinically important difference of 2 points improvement in
      depressive symptoms, as ascertained blindly by the Quick Inventory of Depressive
      Symptomatology. In Aim 2 we will investigate the efficacy and tolerability of 8 weeks of (1)
      single-blind BAT plus placebo or (2) double-blind bupropion plus Clinical Management vs.
      control for improvement in depressive symptoms. In Aim 3, we will compare the efficacy of
      these 2 treatments strategies vs. control for improvement in CKD patient-centered outcomes
      including a. adherence to medications and healthcare visits; b. fatigue; c. sleep; and d.
      overall functioning. A clinical trial is urgently needed to address the evidence gap that
      exists for MDD treatment in CKD patients.

      Aim 1. Compare the efficacy and tolerability of two 16-week strategies vs. control for
      treatment of CKD patients with MDD starting with (1) BAT or (2) bupropion, each augmented to
      a combination of both in non-remitters. Primary hypothesis: Treatment with either strategy
      will improve depression (primary endpoint) and be tolerable.

      Patients with non-dialysis stages 3b-5 CKD and MDD (N=201) will be randomized 1:1:1 to 16
      weeks of:

      Strategy 1: Single-blind BAT plus placebo, augmented in non-remitters at 8 weeks with
      single-blind bupropion; Strategy 2: Double-blind bupropion plus single-blind Clinical
      Management (CM) attention control, augmented in non-remitters at 8 weeks with single-blind
      BAT; Control: CM attention control plus placebo. There will be &gt;80% power to detect a minimal
      clinically important difference (MCID) of 2 points on the Quick Inventory of Depressive
      Symptomatology between each intervention and control, assuming a 14% attrition rate.

      Exploratory aim (a): Explore if remote access to therapy via internet vs. travel to clinic
      affects treatment efficacy.

      Aim 2. Investigate efficacy and tolerability of 8 weeks (Phase 1) of (1) BAT plus placebo or
      (2) bupropion plus CM, vs. control, for improvement in depression. Secondary hypothesis:
      Treatment with 8 weeks of BAT or bupropion will improve depression. There will be 80% power
      to detect a MCID of 2 points between each arm and control, assuming 10% attrition.

      Exploratory aims:

      (a) Investigate whether patient preference for BAT vs. drug affects treatment efficacy; (b)
      compare efficacy of each combination in Phase 2 with control; (c) compare change from
      baseline in plasma C-reactive protein in drug vs. BAT or control arms.

      Aim 3. Investigate the efficacy of these two 16-week treatment strategies vs. control for
      improvement in CKD patient-centered outcomes including: (a) adherence to medications and
      healthcare visits; (b) fatigue; (c) sleep; (d) overall functioning. Secondary hypothesis:
      Treatment with either strategy will result in clinically meaningful improvements in
      adherence, fatigue, sleep and overall functioning in patients with CKD.

    <masking_description>Those eligible will be randomized via a computerized random number generator 1:1:1 to BAT, bupropion, or control, using block randomization, stratified by site and CKD stage (3b, 4, or 5). Randomization assignment will be obtained via the secure study web portal hosted at UTSW. As in previous trials that involve therapy for MDD, it is challenging to double-blind aspects of this study that involve BAT. However, we have made every effort to maintain blind as much as possible. Bupropion for Strategy 2 and double-blind matching placebo for the control arm will be administered by concealed allocation. Participants in Strategy 1 will receive matching placebo by single-blind allocation. Although it is impossible to conceal the allocation of the BAT to the research team, it is intended for the participants to remain single-blinded to BAT vs. CM. Using Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing, the same assessor, blinded to interventions, will assess outcomes for both sites.</masking_description>
