    <textblock>
      This phase III trial studies how well a telehealth self-management program works in improving
      survivorship care and outcomes in stage I-III non-small cell lung cancer or colorectal cancer
      survivors. Survivor self-management program focuses on coaching patients on follow-up care
      after cancer treatments. Participating in the program may improve knowledge and confidence
      about follow-up care, communication with cancer care and primary care doctors, and quality of
      life after cancer treatment in non-small cell lung cancer or colorectal cancer survivors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the efficacy of the intervention on care coordination, communication, and
      primary care provider (PCP) knowledge, comparing the intervention and attention control arms
      at 4 and 8 months post-accrual.

      II. Determine the efficacy of the intervention on survivor outcomes, comparing the
      intervention and attention control arms at 4 and 8 months post-accrual.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Assess the reach, efficacy, adoption, implementation, and maintenance (RE-AIM) of the
      intervention.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I (SURVIVOR SELF-MANAGEMENT): Patients receive a personalized care plan/resource manual.
      Patients also participate in 5 telehealth sessions with a nurse over 60 minutes each for 4
      months (months 1-4) about self-management skills building, then 3 maintenance telehealth
      sessions with a nurse over 60 minutes each for 3 months (months 5-7) for additional
      self-management skills building support. A copy of patient's care plan is also sent to their
      PCP.

      ARM II (ATTENTION CONTROL): Patients receive an American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)
      care plan. Patients also participate in 5 telehealth sessions with a nurse over 60 minutes
      each for 4 months (months 1-4) to review a handbook about life after cancer treatment, then 3
      monthly telehealth sessions with a nurse over 60 minutes each for 3 months (months 5-7) to
      answer questions about the handbook. A copy of the ASCO care plan is also sent to their PCP.

      After study initiation, patients are followed up at 4 and 8 months.

    <description>To test the short and long term effects of the intervention on care coordination (timely appointments and care, use of information to coordinate care, support in managing treatment effects, provides timely information, involvement of family and friends), a 2x2x2 repeated measures analysis of covariance in which the within groups variables are care coordination scores as measured by the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems Cancer Care Survey at baseline. The between groups measures are the comparisons between 1) study arms, attention control versus intervention, and 2) cancer type, non-small cell lung cancer versus colorectal cancer, with at minimum the baseline care coordination score serving as a covariate. Other covariates may be added to the model pending results of the preliminary analysis.
