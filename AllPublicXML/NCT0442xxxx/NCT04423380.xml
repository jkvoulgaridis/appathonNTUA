  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to determine the safety profile of SH3051 in subjects with advanced
      solid tumors. The second objective is to evaluate the PK profile and preliminary efficacy of
      SH3051 solid tumors.

      This is a phase I, open-label study to assess the safety,tolerability, pharmacokinetics and
      preliminary efficacy of SH3051 capsule, a small molecule inhibitor of type I transforming
      growth factor-β(TGF-β) receptor serine/threonine kinase, in patients with advanced solid
      tumors.
