      Introduction and purpose: There are studies in the literature that associate oxytocin level
      with postpartum depression. This study was carried out to investigate the relationship
      between oxytocin levels measured during pregnancy and postpartum depression symptoms.

      Method: The study was conducted with 70 women who met the research criteria. Data collection
      was done in two interviews. The first meeting is 30-38 at the week of gestation, the second
      interview is 4-12 at the week of postpartum. It was done between weeks. In each interview, a
      data collection form was applied first and then a saliva sample was taken. Data collection
      form; The questions prepared by the researchers consisted of the Edinburgh Postnatal
      Depression Scale (EPDS) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). The data were analyzed using
      SPSS 22.0 program and the significance value was taken as p &lt;0.05.

        Based on the study conducted by Eapen et al. (2014), for the relationship between oxytocin
        and postpartum depression symptoms, based on the correlation coefficient for the periods
        during and after pregnancy; For r = -0.35, a minimum sample size of 61 with 5% error and
        80% power has been determined. Since there may be a quit situation during the study, the
        sample size was determined as 67 by expanding it with a share of 10%.
