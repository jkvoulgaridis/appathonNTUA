    <textblock>
      The goal of HeadSMART II (HEAD injury Serum markers and Multi-modalities for Assessing
      Response to Trauma II) is to develop an In-Vitro Diagnostic, the BRAINBox TBI test, to aid in
      the diagnosis and prognosis of patients with mild traumatic brain injury, by incorporating
      blood biomarkers, clinical assessments, and tools to measure associated neurocognitive
      impairments.

      This study proposes to collect data using a multi-modality approach including blood
      biomarkers, clinical assessments, neurocognitive performance, and neuropsychological
      characteristics, to identify subjects with a mild Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and their
      likelihood of chronic symptoms.

      This is an observational study with an expectation of enrolling up to 2000 subjects. These
      subjects will include the intended use population, subjects presenting to the Emergency
      Department or Urgent Care with a blunt head trauma. Data will be collected across four time
      points, T=0, 14 days, 30 days and 90 days, to allow for building and validating the
      algorithms for both diagnosis and prognosis claims.

      Control populations, healthy and trauma only (no head trauma) will be included for assay
      development. Data will be collected for these groups at T=0 and 14 days (trauma control
      only).
