  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Biosimilars represent great potential in cost saving and reinvestment opportunities in
      healthcare. Biosimilars of adalimumab appear to be clinically equivalent to the reference
      product in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. No data are currently available
      in IBD patients. Real-life data are needed.

      Minimizing the switch back is another clinical challenge in the current area of biosimilars.
      The primary objective of Rhoneswitch is to describe the magnitude of patient's switch back
      defined as a deterioration of symptoms without objective identification of disease activity,
      12 months after the switch from ada originator Humira®.

      The primary endpoint is to assess the percentage of patients who switch back to originator
      therapy Humira® 12 months after switching from ada Humira® to ada Bs: Amgevita® ,Hulio®,
      Hyrimoz® or Imraldi® in IBD patients without any objective markers of inflammation.

      The subject will be include during usual hospital consultation after reviewing
      inclusion/exclusion criteria and obtain non opposition. Data will be collected during 3 usual
      hospital consultations: at month 3, month 6, and month 12. The end of study will be at month
      12 or at premature termination.

      Questionnaires will be done in addition during all usual hospital consultations.
