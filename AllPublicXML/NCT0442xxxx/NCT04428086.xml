    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study was to assess investigate the pharmacokinetic effects of
      Apatinib on Rosuvastatin or Metformin.

      The secondary objective of the study was to assess the safety of Apatinib alone or

             that affect gastric acid secretion, or Chinese herbal medicines within 2 weeks before
             the first dose; use the drug that is metabolic enzyme CYP3A inducer within 4 weeks
             before the first dose
