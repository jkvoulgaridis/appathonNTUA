      This study will confirm the efficacy and safety in the clinical setting after the launch of
      the GORE® VIABAHN® stent graft (hereafter referred to as &quot;Viabahn&quot;) for the treatment of
      patients with stenosis or occlusion at the venous anastomosis of synthetic arteriovenous
      access graft.

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any unfavorable or unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory changes), symptom, or illness associated with the use of a medical device. Unless worsening of severity or increasing of incidence during the surveillance, the primary disease of the patient is not considered an adverse event.</description>
