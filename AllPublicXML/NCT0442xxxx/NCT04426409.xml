  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nasotracheal intubation is one of the anesthetic procedures required for oral surgery. It
      allows the surgeon easier access to the surgical site than the orthotracheal intubation.
      Therefore, nosotracheal intubation is commonly used for general anesthesia for oral and
      maxillofacial surgery and dental treatment. However, nasotracheal intubation can damage the
      nasal mucosa in the course of the tube passing through the nostrils, causing epistaxis which
      is reported as the most common side effect.

      In order to reduce these side effects, heating of the tube and use of a tube lubricant
      immediately before intubation have been recommended in children. However, research on whether
      the dry state of the mucosa itself contributes to the development of epistaxis is limited. A
      study in adults reported that pretreatment of the ointment on the mucosa reduced the damage
      to the mucosa. However, its effect on the incidence of epistaxis in children has not been
      studied.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of pretreatment of nasal ointment on
      epistaxis of nasotracheal intubation in children.
