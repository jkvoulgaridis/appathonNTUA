             have been stopped at least six months before entry into the study;

          -  Prior treatment with dose superior or equal to 120 mg per month of lanreotide;

          -  Prior treatment with cabozantinib;

          -  Prior treatment with any other tyrosine kinase inhibitors or anti-VEGF angiogenic
             inhibitors is permitted. Prior treatment with non-VEGF-targeted angiogenic inhibitors
             such as Everolimus is permitted;

          -  Patients who stopped Everolimus or tyrosine kinase inhibitors or anti-VEGF angiogenic
             inhibitors treatment less than 4 weeks prior to the start of the study;

          -  Patients with concomitant treatment with Interferon;

          -  Patients previously treated with chemotherapy, loco-regional therapy (e.g.,
             chemoembolization) or interferon with last administration less than 4 weeks prior to
             the start of the study or with toxicity not resolved to less or equal grade 1 at the
             start of the study;

          -  PRRT therapy with last administration less than 6 months prior to inclusion in the
             study or with toxicity not resolved to less or equal grade 1 at the start of the
             study;

          -  diagnosis of any second malignancy within the last 5 years, except for adequately
             treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, or in situ carcinoma of the cervix

          -  history of any one or more of the following cardiovascular conditions within the past
             6 months: cardiac angioplasty or stenting, myocardial infarction, unstable angina,
             coronary artery bypass graft surgery, symptomatic peripheral vascular disease, Class
             III or IV congestive heart failure, as defined by the New York Heart Association (NYHA
             see Appendix II);

          -  prolongation of QT interval: Cabozantinib should be used with caution in patients with
             a history of QT interval prolongation, patients who are taking antiarrhythmics, or
             patients with relevant pre-existing cardiac disease, bradycardia, or electrolyte
             disturbances (e.g., hypokaliemia, family history of long QT Syndrome). Corrected QT
             interval calculated by the Fridericia formula (QTcF) 500 ms within 28 days before
             registration should be shown. Only subjects with a baseline QTcF 500 ms are eligible
             for the study.

        Note: If the QTcF was &gt; 500 ms in the first ECG, a total of 3 ECGs were to be performed. If
        the average of these 3 consecutive results for QTcF was ≤ 500 ms, the subject met
        eligibility in this regard.

          -  history of aneurysms and arterial dissections. The use of VEGF pathway inhibitors in
             patients with or without hypertension may favor the formation of aneurysms and / or
             arterial dissections. Before starting cabozantinib, this risk must be carefully

             history of thromboembolic events (including pulmonary embolism) or untreated deep
             venous thrombosis (DVT) within the past 6 months. Note: Subjects with recent DVT who
             have been treated with therapeutic anti-coagulating agents for at least 6 weeks are
             eligible;

          -  concomitant anticoagulation at therapeutic doses with oral anticoagulant (eg.
             Warfarin, direct thrombin and factor 10a inhibitors) or platelet inhibitors (eg.
             clopidogrel);

          -  major surgery or trauma within 28 days prior to study entry; the presence of any
             non-healing wound, fracture, or ulcer (procedures such as catheter placement are not
             considered to be major surgery);

          -  known brain metastases or cranial epidural disease unless adequately treated with
             radiotherapy and/or surgery (including radiosurgery) and stable for at least 3 months
             before the start of the study. Eligible subjects must be neurologically asymptomatic
             and without corticosteroid treatment at the time of inclusion;

          -  With the exclusion of inhaled steroids, chronic treatment with corticosteroids with
             dose superior of 10 mg/day methylprednisolone equivalent must be avoided;

          -  evidence of active bleeding or bleeding diathesis and/or clinically-significant GI
             bleeding within 6 months before the first dose of study treatment; 3 months for

             vessels;

          -  patients with GI disorders associated with a high risk of perforation or fistula
             formation;

          -  major surgery within 2 months before to registration. Complete healing from major
             surgery must have occurred 1 month before registration. Complete healing from minor
             surgery (eg, simple excision, tooth extraction) must have occurred at least 7 days
             before registration. Subjects with clinically relevant complications from prior
             surgery are not eligible

          -  subjects with clinically relevant ongoing complications from prior radiation therapy

          -  positive test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or acquired immunodeficiency
             syndrome (AIDS) related illness;

          -  patients with complicated, symptomatic untreated lithiasis of the bile ducts;

          -  any serious and/or unstable pre-existing medical, psychiatric, or other conditions

             compliance to study procedures;

          -  previous or ongoing treatment (except for adjuvant therapies) with any of the
             following anti-cancer therapies: chemotherapy, immunotherapy, target therapies,

             drug (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of cabozantinib plus lanreotide;

          -  inability to swallow tablets;

          -  rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or

             excipients of the study treatment formulations;

          -  concomitant use of strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 (i.e. information reported in session
             4.5 of the protocol)
