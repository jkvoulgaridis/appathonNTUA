  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-compaction cardiomyopathy (NCCM) is a heterogeneous, poorly understood disorder
      characterized by a prominent inner layer of loose myocardial tissue, and associated with
      heart failure, stroke, severe rhythm irregularities and death. For a growing population
      diagnosed with NCCM there is a need for better risk stratification to appropriately allocate
      (or safely withhold) these impactful preventive measures. The goal of this international
      consortium is to improve care of patients with non-compaction cardiomyopathy. We hypothesize
      that comprehensive analysis of clinical, genetic, structural and functional information will
      improve risk stratification. In addition, we hypothesize that detailed structural analysis
      will allow for differentiation of pathological and benign patterns of non-compaction. In a
      large cohort of adult patients with suspected NCCM we will perform in-depth phenotyping,
      including clinical information, pedigree data, genetics, echocardiography and MRI, and follow
      patients for up to 3 years. We will apply machine-learning based analytics to develop
      predictive models and compare their performance to currently used models and treatment
      criteria. Secondly, in a subset of patients we will perform high-resolution cardiac CT for
      detailed structural characterization of the myocardial wall. We will investigate associations
      between myocardial structure and regional contractile function, as assessed by echo and MRI.
      The aim of this proposal is to identify a structural signature associated with pathological
      non-compaction and improve developed risk prediction models. Discovery of pathological
      structural signatures through innovative imaging techniques, in relation to myocardial
      contractility, will advance our understanding of NCCM.

      After enrollment, blood will be drawn via venipuncture. The blood samples (35cc in total)
      will be centrifuged (15 minutes at 3500 RPM), after which the plasma, serum, red cells and
      buffy coat will be aliquoted from the vacutainers into color-coded vials. In addition to
      standard EDTA tubes we may include a CPT or PAX tube for more extensive analytics, or an
      Oragene tube for remote saliva collection. The aliquots and tubes will be stored at -70⁰C.
      The samples will remain at the site until analysis.
