      Background: Low back pain (LBP) is a common, huge health and socioeconomic health problem
      that affects physiological functions and reduces work efficiency in nurses.

      Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of low-level laser acupuncture combined
      with acupressure (LAA) on pain intensity, pain interference and life dysfunction in hospital
      nurses with LBP.

      Methods: This single-blinded randomized controlled trial enrolled a convenience sample of
      nurses from one teaching hospital. Seventy-six participants were randomly assigned to the LAA
      group (n=38) receiving low-level laser acupuncture and auricular acupressure for four weeks,
      and a control group (n=38) receiving a similar intervention but without laser energy and
      acupressure. Data were collected using the Short Form of the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI-SF)
      and Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RDQ) at three time points: baseline before the
      intervention, and Week 2 and Week 4 during the intervention.

      The enrollment criteria were age more than 20 years, low back pain with visual analogue scale
      (LBP_VAS) ≧3, no regular treatment for low back pain within six weeks, and willing to
      participate in this study. Exclusion criteria were open wounds on lower back, tumor on the
      back, ankylosing spondylitis, previous lumbar surgery, coagulopathy or bleeding tendency, or
      pregnancy.

    <description>Primary pain outcomes were measured by the Chinese version of the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF), which consists of 11 items to measure pain intensity and interference with functionality. Regarding pain severity, 4 items allow patients to rate their pain experience in the past 24 hours or one week at its average, worst, and least levels, as well as their pain experience now, on an 11-point Likert-type scale (0 = no pain, 10 = most severe pain).</description>

    <time_frame>Data were collected using the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RDQ) : baseline before the intervention, and the change from life dysfunction at 1 month.</time_frame>
    <description>Secondary outcomes were aspects of life dysfunction as measured by the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ), which measures disability in daily life due to LBP. This questionnaire consists of 24 items, each one a statement that the patient is asked to indicate whether this statement applies to him/her.</description>

    <description>A 4-week LAA intervention included low-level laser acupuncture and auricular acupressure. Six acupuncture points were selected, and three auricular points. Participants received laser acupuncture on the six selected acupuncture points bilaterally twice a week for 4 weeks. A seed was taped onto each of the three points of the unilateral ear (initially, the left ear), where it remained for five days. Pressing on each of the seeds for one minute three times a day was required, but the stimulation intensity was adjusted depending on the participant's individual tolerance. After five days, the seed was removed, and a new seed was taped on the other ear.</description>

    <description>Participants received laser acupuncture on the six selected acupuncture points bilaterally twice a week for 4 weeks. A seed was taped onto each of the three points of the unilateral ear (initially, the left ear), where it remained for five days. Pressing on each of the seeds for one minute three times a day was required, but the stimulation intensity was adjusted depending on the participant's individual tolerance. The de qi sensation appears to be an established intervention efficacy indicator during auricular acupressure. After five days, the seed was removed, and a new seed was taped on the other ear.</description>
