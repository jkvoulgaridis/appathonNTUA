  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the effectiveness of manual therapy plus cervical
      stabilization exercise compared to manual therapy alone on balance, proprioception, and neck
      muscle morphology in chronic neck pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neck pain is defined as pain and/or stiffness localized to the dorsal area of the area
      between the condyle of the occiput and the third thoracic vertebra. Chronic neck pain (CNP),
      defined as persistent pain lasting three or more mounts, causes disability and a reduction in
      life quality. Balance disorders or postural instability, a deficit in proprioception, changes
      in muscle recruitment, a decrease in dimension of deep cervical muscle, and an increase in
      stiffness of superficial neck muscle may lead to pain in patients with CNP. Both manual
      therapy and exercise have favorable effects on management with CNP. According to our
      knowledge, no study has investigated the effects of manual therapy plus cervical
      stabilization exercise on balance, proprioception, and neck muscle morphology in CNP, yet.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Balance</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline at 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The balance will be evaluated with Biodex BioSwayTM Balance Evaluation System. It reliably measures the patient's ability to balance on soft and/or hard ground.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proprioception</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline at 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Proprioception will be assessed with dual digital inclinometer. The feet of the inclinometers will be placed as simultaneously as possible over the head of the patients and the cervical seventh vertebra. Firstly, patients will be asked to move their heads forward as possible as from the neutral position and then they will try to find neutral position from reached position. The angle on digital display of inclinometer will be recorded as degree. Each test will be repeated 3 times and the average deviation error score will be recorded.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Muscle morphology</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline at 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The thickness and stiffness of the neck muscles will be evaluated by a specialist radiologist with real-time ultrasonography. It is a reliable, valid and, non-invasive method that provides an assessment of muscle morphology. Measurements will be made by using the Logiq S7 / Expert ultrasound device. The cross-sectional area of deep neck muscle with sonography, the stiffness of the superficial muscles with elastography were assessed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline at 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The pain intensity will be assessed with the Visual Analog Scale, which consists of a horizontal line of 10 cm in length. For pain level assessment, &quot;0&quot; defines &quot;no pain&quot; and &quot;10&quot; defines &quot;unbearable pain''. The participants will be asked to mark the intensity of their pain level.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disability level</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline at 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The disability level will be measured with the Turkish version of Neck Disability Index (NDI). It consists of 10 sections which include the severity of pain, personal care, lifting, reading, headache, concentration, work-life, driving, sleeping and leisure activities. There are 6 responses for each section, scored 0 (no pain and no functional limitation) and 5 (worst pain and maximum limitation). The total score ranges from 0 to 50. Patients will be asked to select the most appropriate option for each section.</description>

    <description>Cyriax's mobilization techniques will be applied as manual therapy. Before the mobilization, soft tissue mobilization techniques will be applied to relieve muscular spasm and preventing the patient' s anxiety. Bringing, manual traction, manual traction with rotation, manual traction with anterior-posterior gliding and lateral gliding mobilization techniques will be applied. Appropriate mobility techniques will be selected according to the complaints and symptoms of the patients. Cervical mobilization applications will take an average of 15-20 minutes.</description>

    <intervention_name>Cervical Stabilazation Exercise (CSE)</intervention_name>
    <description>The CSE program aims to maintain a neutral spine position and activate deep cervical muscles during exercises. It is performed in stages with gradual progression according to the stages of motor learning and sensory-motor integration, namely, static, dynamic, and functional. The program will start with postural training and then the cervical bracing technique with the activation of deep neck flexors for CSE was performed. The patients will be asked to maintain a neutral spine during the exercises and throughout the day as much as possible. The difficulty and variety of exercises will be increased weekly. It will be carried out 2 days a week for 6 weeks (12 sessions) by the supervisor physiotherapist.</description>
