  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The automatic fusion of the ultrasound with a cone-beam CT volume will guide the positioning
      of the electrodes, despite the visibility of the tumor in ultrasound, in patients treated
      with irreversible electroporation in the interventional radiology room at Avicenna Hospital
      for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The objective is to evaluate the primary success rate of
      the automatic cone-beam CT fusion procedure and ultrasound, regardless of the tumor's
      visibility status in ultrasound.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Percutaneous removal of hepatic tumours allows curative treatment using a range of techniques
      such as radiofrequency ablation, microwave, cryoablation or, more recently, irreversible
      electroporation. These treatments require the introduction of one or more electrodes into or
      around the areas to be treated. This insertion phase requires that the practitioner has a
      means of continuously visualizing the area to be treated and the position of the electrodes.

      The reference modality for the treatment of hepatic tumours by ablation is ultrasound. The
      scanner is the conventional alternative recommended in case of invisibility of the target in
      ultrasound.

      When the target is not clearly visible in ultrasound, advanced multimodal image fusion
      applications can allow the practitioner to overcome this difficulty. This fusion is made
      possible by tracking the movement of the ultrasound probe in relation to the patient using an
      electromagnetic navigation system, and by alignment between the ultrasound system and the
      fused volume.

      This alignment can be done manually or automatically using a specific marker placed on the
      patient's skin, called an &quot;Active Tracker&quot;.

      The &quot;INTERACT Active Tracker&quot; functionality will also simplify the registration process by
      providing automatic pre-registration.

      The purpose of this study is to prospectively evaluate the primary success of patients
      treated at Avicenna Hospital for HCC by irreversible electroporation using this fusion
      technique. The hypothesis of the study is that this image fusion makes it possible to improve
      the location of the lesions to be treated and to allow treatment by percutaneous ablation of
      lesions that are not very visible under ultrasound alone.

      This study will also assess the time and accuracy savings when an automatic fusion solution
      between ultrasound and cone-beam (CB) CT is used, compared to manual alignment.

    <time_frame>At 1 month on post-operative imaging</time_frame>
    <description>Primary success is assessed on the control MRI or CT performed one month after the first IRE (Irreversible Electroporation) ablation procedure targeting a given tumor. It is defined by the absence of visible recurrence at 1 month on post-operative imaging. In the case of a partial response, a % of active tumor will be evaluated.</description>

    <time_frame>The day of the operation</time_frame>
    <description>The ultrasound visibility of the tumor is evaluated by an ordered discrete variable defined as follows:
0: Not identifiable with or without merging
identifiable with the help of fusion, tumor boundaries are poorly defined
identifiable with the help of fusion, the limits of the tumour are clearly visible
identifiable without fusion, tumor boundaries are poorly defined
identifiable without fusion, the limits of the tumour are clearly visible</description>

    <description>The accuracy of the automatic alignment judged on the ultrasound measurement of the distance from the center of the target seen in ultrasound to that segmented on the pre-therapeutic CBCT is evaluated by comparison with the accuracy of the manual alignment recorded on a series of patients treated when the new function was not available</description>

    <measure>Evaluate the secondary and third-party therapeutic effectiveness rate of the procedures.</measure>
    <time_frame>The day of the operation</time_frame>
    <description>The failure rate of the Interact Active Tracker automatic alignment is evaluated by the number of procedures where this function is not functional for any reason. Throughout the procedure, the number of times the operator will have to correct the alignment with new anatomical landmarks will be counted. Any failure of the automatic merge will be recorded.</description>

For each tumour, the number of ablation procedures required to achieve a complete MRI response within one month of the last ablation session will be recorded. For patients requiring more than one treatment, only treatments performed over the duration of the study should be included.</description>
