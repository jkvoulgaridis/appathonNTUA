    <measure>Evaluate the relative potency CT-P39 compared to EU-approved Xolair</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline in Weekly Itch Severity Score(ISS7) at Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The relative potency of CT-P39 to the Xolair is defined as the dose of CT-P39 that produces the same biological response as one unit of the dose of the Xolair. The biological response will be estimated by the change from baseline in Weekly Itch Severity Score(ISS7) at Week 12. Since the 2 treatments will be compared at the same 2-dose levels (300 mg and 150 mg), a 4 point assay will be used to calculate the relative potency and its CI.</description>

    <time_frame>Week 8 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>The ISS will be recorded on scale of 0 (none) to 3 (severe) points. The daily ISS is the average of the morning and evening scores and the ISS7 is the sum of the daily ISS over 7 days</description>

    <measure>Dose response in terms of efficacy [Urticaria Activity Score(UAS)]</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8, 12, and 24</time_frame>

    <description>Change from baseline in the overall Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) score. Patients will rate their dermatology symptoms as well as the impact of their skin condition on various aspect of their lives. Each question is scored from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much). Overall score, on scale of 0 to 30.</description>

    <description>Change from baseline in the overall Chronic Urticaria Quality of Life Questionnaire (CU-Q2OL) score. Patients will rate their CSU symptoms and the impact of their CSU on various aspects of their lives. Each question is scored from 1 (not at all) to 5 (extremely), and overall raw score, on a scale of 23 to 115</description>
