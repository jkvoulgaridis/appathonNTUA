  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a global, Phase 1/2, multicenter, open-label study. The clinical study will include
      of Phase 1: Dose Escalation (non-randomized, dose finding study) and Phase 2: Dose Expansion
      (randomized efficacy exploration). For Phase 1, the purpose of this study is to assess the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD), recommend phase 2 dose (RP2D), preliminary efficacy, and safety
      of selinexor in combination with SoC therapy for newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme
      (GBM) (nGBM) or recurrent GBM (rGBM). The study will independently evaluate 3 different
      combination regimens in 3 treatment arms in participants with nGBM
      O6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase [MGMT] promotor unmethylated [uMGMT] disease in Arm A,
      MGMT methylated [mMGMT]) in Arm B, and participants with rGBM regardless of MGMT status in
      Arm C. The second phase of the study will compare selinexor+SoC treatments versus SoC
      treatment alone in the three treatment Arms.
