  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Increase in the consumption of analgesics observed in many countries with a mediatic crisis
      resulting in an increasingly frequent wish of patients to wean themselves from opiates. A
      recent update (B. Rolland 2017) suggests that upon initiation of an opioid analgesic
      treatment, the patient should be informed of the risk of opioid dependence and misuse. There
      is no clearly validated decay scheme in the event of dependence in patients with Chronic
      Non-Cancer Pain.

      Hypotheses:

        -  Possibility of a rapid decrease in opioid analgesic treatments at DCNC sensitized to the
           risk of DOP and MOP. (Protocol implemented: Multidisciplinary assessment, workshops and
           information sheet on chronic pain, treatments and risk of DOP, pharmacological and
           nonpharmacological adaptation)

        -  Highlight the need for additional information from patients and prescribers on the risk
           of DOP and MOP in DCNC.

      Main objective: Check if the rapid to semi-rapid regimen (- 25 to -60% dosage in 5 days of
      HDS) of opioid analgesics, without the use of methadone or buprenorphine agonists, in the
      case of DCNC at the CETD in Montpellier is efficient in the medium term (6 months).

      Secondary objective:

        -  With our inclusion questionnaire we wanted to check if the patients had been made aware
           of the risk of opiate dependence and misuse.

        -  Detect the conditions of prescriptions that can promote the misuse of opiates.

        -  Evaluating the different components of residual pain at 6 months (type, intensity,
           anxiety component and depression, function).

    <description>The data retrieved from the patient will be encrypted and there will also be written data or written in binary form. They will be used to create an Excel table which allows me to list the data on D1 then on M + 3 then on M + 6 in order to evaluate the evolution of these data over a time interval of 6 months and this is which will be used as support in my thesis in pharmacy.</description>
