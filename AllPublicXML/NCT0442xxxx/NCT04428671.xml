  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies how well cemiplimab before and after surgery works in treating
      patients with high risk cutaneous squamous cell cancer. Immunotherapy with monoclonal
      antibodies, such as cemiplimab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may
      interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving cemiplimab before
      surgery may improve risk of the cancer returning in patients with high risk cutaneous
      squamous cell cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To establish the pathologic response rate of neoadjuvant cemiplimab in cutaneous squamous
      cell carcinoma (cSCC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To document the local recurrence rate of high-risk cSCC treated with adjuvant cemiplimab.

      II. To document the systemic recurrence rate of high-risk cSCC treated with adjuvant
      cemiplimab.

      III. To document the 6-month, 12-month, 2-year overall survival (OS), recurrence-free
      survival (RFS) for patients with high risk cSCC.

      TERTIARY/EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the immune profile of fresh tumor tissue, blood in patients with cSCC treated
      with cemiplimab.

      OUTLINE:

      NEOADJUVANT PHASE: Prior to standard of care surgery, patients receive cemiplimab
      intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 3
      cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ADJUVANT PHASE: Within 2-6 weeks after completion of standard of care radiation therapy (or
      surgery if no radiation therapy), patients receive cemiplimab IV over 30 minutes on day 1.
      Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 18 cycles in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 12 weeks for 2 years,
      every 6 months for the next 3 years, and then annually for up to 10 years.

    <description>Defined as the number of complete and partial responses divided by the total number of patients, as assessed by pathology. Pathological complete response (pCR) (no viable tumor) or pathological partial response (pPR) (less than 50% viable tumor) as well as near pCR (less than 10% viable tumor) in the tumor bed will be documented by pathology from the resection specimen. Pathologic response rate will be summarized using frequency and percentage, and a 95% exact confidence interval will be reported using the Clopper-Pearson method.</description>

    <measure>Change in immune system biomarkers</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline up to 10 years post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Pre- and post-surgery assessments of biomarkers extracted from tissue and blood samples will be summarized using frequencies and percentages for categorical variables, and mean, median, standard deviation, and range for numeric variables. Pre- versus (vs.) post-surgery values will be compared using paired t-tests or McNemar's tests, where appropriate. Biomarkers extracted from blood samples will also be collected at progression or completion of adjuvant therapy. In those cases, mixed models with a random intercept will be explored to assess the impact of time on change in biomarker status. Change in biomarker will be compared across response (yes/no) using two-sample t-tests or Mann Whitney U tests, where appropriate, and the and the impact of pre-surgery, post-surgery, and change in biomarker will be compared across survival endpoints using log-rank tests and univariate Cox proportional hazards models.</description>

             oophorectomy or has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive
             months (if age &gt;= 55 years); if the female subject is &lt; 55 years and she has been
             naturally postmenopausal for &gt;= 1 year her reproductive status has to be verified by
             additional lab tests (&lt; 20 estradiol OR estradiol &lt; 40 with follicle stimulating
             hormone [FSH] &gt; 40 in women not on estrogen replacement therapy)

          -  Evidence of a personally signed informed consent indicating that the subject is aware
             of the neoplastic nature of the disease and has been informed of the procedures to be
             followed, the experimental nature of the therapy, alternatives, potential risks and
             discomforts, potential benefits, and other pertinent aspects of study participation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Determined not to be a surgical candidate due to medical co-morbidities or extent of
             disease
