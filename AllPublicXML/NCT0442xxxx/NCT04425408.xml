  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a randomized cross over trial assessing the efficacy of two different
      positional therapies for positional obstructive sleep apnea (POSA).

      The effectiveness of the two different therapeutic devices (Positional pillow and vibrating
      belt) in reducing the time spent sleeping supine, and therefore at risk of apnoeas, will be
      evaluated consecutively in 52 subjects with a de novo diagnosis of positional sleep apnoea.

      The subjective quality of sleep will also be evaluated prior to treatment and following the
      use of each separate device by means of a &quot;Quality of sleep questionnaire&quot;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with a de novo diagnosis of positional sleep apnoea on a polysomnography performed
      in our sleep lab will be asked to participate to the study. They should fulfill the Mador
      definiton of POSA.

      A home recording of sleep position with Somnibel Pro will be conduted for 2 consecutive
      nights. In case of confirmation of supine sleep at home (Mean supine sleep &gt;30% of total
      sleep time) the patient will be asked to use two different positional therapy devices
      consecutively (Positional pillow and vibrating belt), 3 nights each, in a random order, with
      concomitant recording of sleep position with the Somnibel Pro. Global satisfaction
      questionnaire will be assessed by a simple visual analogic scale (is it easy to use? Is it
      confortable? Is it efficient on snoring? Is it efficient on sleep apnea? Would you pay for
      such treatment? Willingness to use it on a long-term basis?) The subjective sleep quality
      will also be assessed by means of &quot;Sleep quality questionnaire&quot;, prior to commencing
      treatment, and consecutively after 3 nights on each individual therapy.

      Statistical analysis:

      Efficacy of Positional pillow (Posiform) and vibrating belt (Somnofit) Percentage sleep on
      back on treatment will be compared to mean percentage sleep on back without treatment, at
      home, for both devices. Comparison on surrogate AHI based on diagnostic polysomnography, with
      and without each device. Global satisfaction with the devices will also be compared between
      devices.

      The sleep quality will be compared on the two devices using the &quot;Sleep quality
      questionnaire&quot;.

      The sample size of 52 subjects (26 in each arm), has been calculated to obtain a power of 90%
      and allow a drop out rate of 10%.
