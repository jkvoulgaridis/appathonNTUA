  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is the 4th LMB study by the French African Pediatric Oncology Group (GFAOP). The study
      hopes to be able to evaluate children earlier with stage I and II disease and to evaluate
      treatment response earlier so that the units can decide if a change in treatment is
      necessary, it is also hoped to provide an intensification of treatment for the stage IV
      disease.

      This is the 4th Burkitt's Lymphoma (LMB) study by the GFAOP group. This study hopes to
      include at least 14 Sub Saharian countries some of whom have never participated in a LMB
      study. The evaluation of improvement in early diagnosis should be possible in this study. The
      study hopes to be able to evaluate children earlier, with stage I and II disease and to
      evaluate treatment response earlier so that the units can decide if a change in treatment is
      necessary, it is also hoped to provide an intensification of treatment for children with a
      stage IV disease.
