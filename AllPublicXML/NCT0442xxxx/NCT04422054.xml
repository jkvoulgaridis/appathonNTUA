  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aneurysm diameter is an important risk for rupture and related death in affected patients.

      This study will evaluate whether aneurysms size may even influence post procedural outcomes
      both in open surgical repair and in end-vascular aneurysm repair.

      We will retrospectively review clinical data of operated patients with abdominal aortic
      aneurysm. We will consider both open surgical repair and endovascular aneurysm repair
      procedures in order to assess the influence of aneurysm size at the time of intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since the publication by Szilagyi et al, size of aneurysms has been recognized as the
      predominant risk factor for rupture. In fact, a low risk is associated with small aneurysms,
      an intermediate risk with medium-sized aneurysms, and dramatically an increased risk with
      large aneurysms. Current guidelines suggest that the threshold diameter for aneurysm surgery
      being 5.5 cm for male patients and 5.0 cm for female patients, as measured on the largest
      section of the aneurysm.

      The correlation aneurysm diameter may also have an impact on early and late postoperative
      outcomes both for open surgery and endovascular surgery. The study by Peppelenbosch N et al.
      showed that size differences were strongly associated with adverse outcomes during follow-up
      of patients that underwent endovascular aneurysm repair.

      The aim of this is to assess the influence of aneurysm size on the early and late outcomes of
      open surgical repair (OSR) and endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) of abdominal aortic
      aneurysms (AAA).

      Preoperative patient characteristics, comorbid conditions, aneurysm anatomy and diameters
      will be retrospectively reviewed in order to correlate with the results of the procedures
      (OSR and EVAR) and with adverse outcome that may have been occurred during follow up.
