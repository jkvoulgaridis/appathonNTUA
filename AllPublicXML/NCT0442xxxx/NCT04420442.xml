  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-suicidal self-inflicted (NSSI) scars can act as a physical reminder of previous
      self-inflicted self-harm, thereby not only worsening the symptoms of depression and
      self-doubt but also leading to recurrent self-infliction and social exclusion. Several
      different treatment options exist to alter the appearance of NSSI scars like pulsed-dye laser
      therapy (PDL), non-ablative fractional laser therapy, dermabrasion or elliptical excision.
      However, none of these treatment options can completely diminish the scars. In the majority
      of cases, the unique scar pattern of NSSI scars and in addition to that the &quot;reminder&quot;
      remains. In contrast to regular scar revisions, the aesthetical appearance is not the most
      important outcome parameter as the main focus of the surgical treatment is destigmatization.
      The surgical transformation of the scar into a burn-like scar could change the
      scar-perception of the society and the patient, thereby improving the patient's quality of
      life and body perception. Surgical resection with preservation of the subcutaneous tissue
      followed by consecutive reconstruction with a bilayer dermal regenerative matrix (IntegraTM)
      and split skin grafts might represent a promising and novel therapeutic approach. The
      hypothesis is that by surgically transforming the non-suicidal self-inflicted scars into a
      burn-like scar the patient's body and scar perception will be positively altered and the
      stigmatization by the society reduced.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-suicidal self-injury behaviour describes behaviour in patients, who have no intention to
      commit suicide. This can be performed in many different ways, e.g., automutilation through
      burning, scratching, or hitting. Often this behaviour results in deep scars and
      disfigurements. The prevalence of patients with NSSI scars is estimated to be 13.4% in
      adolescents and 5.5% in adults. Non-suicidal behaviour is often associated with other
      psychological diseases like personality disorders, character disorders of the Borderline
      type, anxiety, and substance abuse disorders. In these cases, usually, interdisciplinary
      therapy concepts are needed. A major problem is that the scars due to its constant
      confrontation can induce repetitive non-suicidal self-injury behaviour. Furthermore, the
      image of the NSSI scars leads to stigmatization by society and in addition to that to a
      withdrawal from society by the patients. Hence, the need for adequate treatment of the NSSI
      scars to relief the burden of stigmatization for the patients is immense. At the moment,
      non-invasive therapies like pulsed-dye laser therapy (PDL) and non-ablative fractional laser
      therapy, as well as minimal-invasive therapies like dermabrasion or elliptical excision offer
      one possible option, but the undoubted cause of the scar remains visible. At the moment only
      case studies exist which describe the beneficial effect of surgical resection followed by
      consecutive reconstruction with a dermal regenerative matrix and split skin grafts. These
      studies have evaluated the aesthetic outcome and briefly assessed the well-being of the
      patients. However, currently, no study exists investigating the effect of the two-step
      surgical procedure on body perception and the psychological outcome in general. The overall
      goal of the described study is to establish a therapy concept for patients who suffer from
      constant confrontation with their NSSI scars. Stigmatization by the society and by the
      patients themselves, body perception, quality of life, and scar perception will be evaluated
      over the study period of 36 months. Furthermore, the scar itself will be assessed using a
      cutometer and the scar image will be evaluated using the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment
      Scale.

      The data analyses will be performed with SPSS, version 20.0, SPSS Inc. Chicago, USA. For the
      normally distributed values, the paired T-test will be used. Not normally distributed values
      will be analysed by the Wilcoxon signed-rank Test. The significance level will be set at
      p&lt;0.05.

    <measure>body perception - Multidimensional Body Self Relations AS Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>36 months</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire consists of 34 items that consists of 5 subscales. The items are rated on a 5 point likert scale. High scores indicate an increased dissatisfaction with body appearance and low scores indicate satisfaction with the body appearance. MBSRQ-AS subscale scores are the means of the constituent items after reversing contra-indicative items (i.e., 1 = 5, 2 = 4, 4 = 2, 5 = 1).</description>

    <measure>scar perception- Questionnaire for the evaluation of scar perception after burn trauma (FKBB)</measure>
    <time_frame>36 months</time_frame>
    <description>The questionnaire consists of 23 items and three introduction questions. The maximum score of each item is 5 (good body perception) and the lowest score is 1 (bad body perception). The overall score is calculated through the mean of the whole scale. The three introduction questions have a score of 0 (bad body perception) and 10 (good body perception). The questions are not part of the overall result, they are needed for the overall body acceptance and thereby for calculating the correlation between body perception and acceptance.</description>

    <measure>stigmatization - Stigma Stress Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>36 months</time_frame>
    <description>This scale consists of two subscales. Each subscale consists of 4 items. The maximum score of each subscale is 28 and the minimum score is 4. The first subscale analyses the perceived stigma-related harm and the second subscale analyses the perceived coping resources. For analyzing the level of stigma stress the difference between the two subscales is calculated (harm minus coping - from -6 to +6). Higher scores are associated with higher levels of stigma stress.</description>
