  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective data collection of treatment outcome for newly diagnosed
      oligometastatic breast cancers with 1-3 bone metastases. Eligible patients will be identified
      from the weekly Breast MDC. Patients will receive the recommended systemic and local
      treatment (including metastases directed SBRT) according to our clinical practice
      guidelines.Patients will be followed according to our routine with clinical and radiologic
      assessment. It is preferred that the same imaging method that was used to originally detect
      the metastases be used in follow-up assessments. The first imaging for SBRT sites will be
      three months post SBRT and every three months for the first year, every 6 months for the
      second year, then annually. Response and progression for these metastases will be evaluated
      using the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline (version
      1.1). Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions is
      used in the RECIST criteria. If functional imaging (bone scan, PET) were used at staging,
      changes in the uptake will be used in follow up scans to determine response to treatment and
      progression. As for SBRT related morbidities, we will use the Common Terminology Criteria for
      Adverse Events (CTCAE v5) for toxicity reporting and scoring.

    <description>This is a prospective study of breast bone only oligometastases (up to three sites). Following systemic treatment and primary tumor control, patients will receive SBRT to all metastatic sites. Data on toxicities and oncological outcomes will be collected for future analysis. There will be no change in the standard systemic therapy nor the local therapy of the primary tumor.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Women &gt;18 years old with a pathologically proven breast cancer who present with 1-3
             bone metastases will be included.

          -  Metastases need to be confirmed pathologically if possible, otherwise two different
             imaging modalities (CTor MRI and bone scan or PET) are needed to confirm metastases.

          -  Patients should be able to receive the recommended local and systemic treatment and
             the primary tumor must be controlled at time of SBRT.

          -  Maximum diameter of individual metastasis metastasis in any dimension â‰¤ 5 cm; and must
             be &gt;5 cm away from each other (defined as Edge to Edge of tumor).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Non bone metastatic breast cancers

          -  Prior history of radiotherapy to same sites of SBRT

          -  Pathologic fractures of involved bones

          -  Contraindications to radiotherapy including pregnancy and connective tissue disease.

          -  Patients with impaired cognitive functions.
