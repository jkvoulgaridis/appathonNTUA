      This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of PRV-015 in adult patients with
      non-responsive celiac disease (NRCD) who are on a gluten-free diet (GFD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PRV-015-002b is a Phase 2b, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group
      study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 3 dose regimens of PRV-015 in adult patients
      with NRCD who are on a GFD.

      Eligible subjects include male or female adults, 18 to 70 years of age, with a diagnosis of
      celiac disease and have followed a GFD for at least 12 consecutive months, yet continue to
      experience symptoms.

      Study drug (1 of the 3 doses of PRV-015 or placebo) will be administered in a double-blind
      fashion, followed by a safety follow-up period.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A diagnosis of celiac disease by intestinal biopsy

          -  Following a GFD for at least 12 consecutive months

          -  Must have detectable (above the lower limit of detection) serum celiac-related
             antibodies

          -  Must have human leukocyte antigen DQ (HLA-DQ) typing consistent with celiac disease
             (DQ2 and/or DQ8)

          -  Subjects must have had at least one of the following symptoms at least once per week
             during the month before screening: diarrhea, loose stools, abdominal pain, abdominal
             cramping, bloating, or gas.

          -  Body weight between 35 and 120 kg

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Current diagnosis of any severe complication of celiac disease, such as refractory
             celiac disease type 1 (RCD-I) or RCD-II, enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma
             (EATL), ulcerative jejunitis, or gastrointestinal (GI) perforation

          -  Diagnosis of any chronic, active GI disease other than celiac disease

          -  Presence of any active infection

          -  Selective immunoglobulin A (IgA) deficiency, defined as having undetectable levels of
             IgA

          -  Known or suspected exposure to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection in the 4
             weeks before screening

          -  Administration of a live vaccine within 14 days prior to randomization and the first
             administration of study drug

          -  History or presence of any clinically significant disease that, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, may confound the subject's participation and follow-up in the clinical
             trial or put the subject at unnecessary risk

          -  Females who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant during the study period, or
             who are currently breastfeeding
