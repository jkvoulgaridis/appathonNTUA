  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to obtain implant survivorship and clinical outcomes data for
      the commercially available MPS-Flex® Total Knee Joint Prostheses used in primary total knee
      arthroplasty (TKA).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective and prospective, multi-centre, post-market clinical follow-up study
      involving orthopedic surgeons skilled in TKA and experienced implanting the devices included
      in this study. Patient demographic and operative information will be collected
      retrospectively. Postoperative clinical outcome, radiographic assessment and adverse events
      will be collected prospectively starting from the first year of postoperative follow up
      visit.

      All study subjects have undergone routine preoperative clinical evaluations prior to their
      THA, and implanted MPS-Flex® Total Knee Joint Prostheses in accordance to indications and
      intended use, and appropriate surgical technique(s) will be invited to participate in the
      study at their first year of postoperative follow up visit, and sign ICF.

    <description>EQ-5D is a standardized measure of health-related quality of life states consisting of 5 dimensions, namely mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. The EQ-5D-3L version was used in the study. Each dimension has 3 responses recording 3 levels of severity (no problems/some or moderate problems/extreme problems). The responses to the EQ-5D dimensions are used to obtain a single EQ-5D index value where 1 represents full health and 0 represents death. The questionnaire also includes a vertical, visual analogue scale (EQ VAS) for the respondents to record their self-rated health where the 2 extreme end of the scale are labelled as 'Best imaginable health state' and 'Worst imaginable health state' respectively.</description>

        The study population for primary statistical analysis will consist of patients who have
        already underwent their surgery with MPS-Flex® Total Knee Joint Prostheses for their
        primary TKA and satisfy eligibility criteria outlined in this section. In order to avoid
        potential selection bias, each investigator will offer study participation to each
        consecutive eligible patient presenting as a candidate for primary TKA using the MPS-Flex®
        Total Knee Joint Prostheses.
