  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study to develop and test a novel protocol to reduce physical and
      psychological vulnerabilities that contribute to treatment intolerance and treatment-related
      morbidity and mortality among hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) patients. When the
      participant enrolls in this study, they will be asked to participate in acceptance and
      commitment therapy (ACT) as well as complete in-person physical function tests and a
      cognitive test. They will also receive training on how to use iOS devices (e.g. iPad, iPhone)
      and activity trackers (e.g. Apple Watch), which will be provided to them during the duration
      of study participation. The study team will ask you to complete multiple surveys about
      emotional and cognitive function, diet and social support, and ask the participant to provide
      feedback about the treatment (e.g., what they liked or did not like). The study team will
      also ask the participant to provide stool samples for analysis of the bacteria in intestines,
      skin surface swabs for analysis of the bacteria on skin and blood samples for analysis of
      biomarkers and metabolites. Biomarkers and metabolites are molecular and cellular parts that
      deal with genetic makeup, like DNA, RNA, protein, and/or other naturally occurring substances
      that may be associated with transplant outcomes. Participants can expect to be enrolled in
      this study for 3 years.
