    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to assess the feasibility, safety and efficacy of
      4SCAR-CD44v6 T-cell therapy targeting multiple cancers. The study also aims to learn more
      about the function of the CD44v6 CAR-T cells and their persistency in the patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CD44 variant domain 6 (CD44v6) which belongs to CD44 family has been implicated in
      tumorigenesis, tumor cell invasion and metastasis. The expression of CD44v6 was reported for
      the majority of squamous cell carcinomas, a proportion of adenocarcinomas of differing
      origin, a proportion of melanoma and lymphoma. This expression pattern has made CD44v6 an
      attractive target for the therapy of various types of CD44v6 positive cancers.

      The T cells from patients or transplantation donors will be genetically modified with
      lentiviral CAR vector to recognize specific molecules - CD44v6 expressed on the surface of
      the cancer cells. The engineered T cells will be applied to patients through intravenous
      delivery.

      The purpose of this clinical trial is to assess the feasibility, safety and efficacy of
      CD44v6 CAR-T cell therapy in multiple cancers including - but not limited to - stomach
      cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, multiple myeloma and lymphoma which are CD44v6
      positive. Another goal of the study is to learn more about the function of the 4SCAR-CD44v6 T
      cells and their persistency in the patients.
