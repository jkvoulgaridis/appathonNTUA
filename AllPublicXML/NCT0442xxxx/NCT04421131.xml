  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The central hypothesis is that use of mIVAA (mobile Inspección Visual con Ácido Acético -
      Spanish for Visual Inspection with Acetic Acid (VIA)) will increase the proportion of VIA
      positive women who complete follow-up clinical evaluation compared to VIA positive women in
      situations in which mIVAA was not used, thus potentially improving cervical cancer treatment
      and survival rates. The study will collect qualitative and quantitative data to examine the
      feasibility and preliminary impact of mIVAA on reducing attrition for follow-up clinical
      evaluations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in Lima, Peru in the context of mobile units operated by La Liga
      for promoting cancer screening. mIVAA comprises two components: a digital imaging device and
      a telemedicine platform.

        1. The digital imaging device is either a mobile phone camera or the pocket colposcope
           plugged into a mobile phone.

        2. The telemedicine platform is mobile phone-based, with an interface for midwives in the
           mobile units to enter patient information and acquire and upload cervical images, and an
           interface for the colposcopists based remotely to review the cervical images and patient
           information and return feedback.

      The specific aims are:

      Aim 1: To pilot test mIVAA in a community-based setting in Peru.

      Aim 2: To evaluate effectiveness of mIVAA by comparing the attendance for follow-up clinical
      evaluation among women screened with mIVAA compared to historical data on women referred for
      follow-up without mIVAA.
