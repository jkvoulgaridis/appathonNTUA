  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of behavioral disorders is high in patients living in an institutional
      environment or hospitalized in a long-term care unit. The consequences of these symptoms are
      not negligible with a faster cognitive decline and a significant impact on the life of the
      institution and of other patients when the disorders are pervasive and too difficult to
      manage for the healthcare teams.

      Despite the daily attention paid to these disorders and their causes, especially the
      environmental ones, the teams are sometimes helpless, the teams are sometimes helpless today
      to fight against these symptoms, and their management thus constitutes a real challenge.

      Non-drug interventions targeting this problem often require additional training,
      architectural installations (Snoezelen space) and / or are moderately effective. In order to
      offer a solution that can be used by everyone, that is transportable and based on new
      technologies, the TOVERTAFEL device was created.

      These are interactive games projected onto a table using a ceiling projector. The light
      animations invite people to &quot;play with the light&quot; using arm or hand movements. These games
      stimulate residents' physical activity and encourage interactions between residents and with
      caregivers.

      In this study, it is a question of evaluating the effectiveness of the TOVERTAFEL device on
      the frequent behavioral symptoms in dementia (agitation, ambulation, apathy, anxiety), the
      quality of life of the patients, as well as on psychotropic treatments.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Behavioral and Psychological symptom dementia with Neuropsychiatric Inventory for Health Staff (NPI HS) after 6 weeks of intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The NPI-HS makes it possible to assess out of 12 each SPCD (delusions, hallucinations, agitation, depression, anxiety, elation, apathy, disinhibition, depression, aberrant motor behavior, sleep and appetite) according to its frequency (1: sometimes, 2: quite often, 3: frequently, 4; very frequently) and according to its severity (1: mild, 2: moderate, 3: significant). The score is calculated by multiplying the frequency and severity for each dimension and adding each of these sub-scores. The maximum score is 144. Responses to the NPI-ES are collected from the healthcare team by a psychologist before the start of the intervention, then at 6 weeks and 13 weeks of inclusion.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Scores obtained before and after an intervention session on the Instantaneous Well-Being Assessment scale</measure>
    <time_frame>before and after one intervention seance</time_frame>
    <description>It is a visual analog scale allowing the patient to report on his state of well-being. In response to the question &quot;How do you feel now / right now?&quot; &quot;, The patient will position their feeling of well-being by relying on pictograms representing simple facial expressions (joy, neutral and sadness) whose treatment is preserved late in the evolution of Alzheimer Disease. On the back, the positioning of the patient according to the pictograms is transcribed into a numerical value from 1 to 5. The answer &quot;1&quot; will correspond to the weakest feeling of well-being and the answer &quot;5&quot; to the feeling of the highest well-being.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Score obtained from the Caregiver Apathy Inventory after 6 weeks of intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Caregiver Apathy Inventory collects information on the presence of apathy in patients with cerebral pathologies according to three dimensions: emotional dullness, loss of initiative, loss of interest. Each dimension is assessed by a caregiver according to its frequency (1: sometimes, 2: quite often, 3: frequently, 4; very frequently) and according to its severity (1: mild, 2: medium, 3: important). The score for each dimension is calculated by multiplying the frequency by the severity, obtaining a maximum score of 12. The total score of IA-S is obtained by adding the scores of the 3 dimensions obtaining a maximum score of 36.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evolution of the consumption of psychotropic drugs before the start of the intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The evolution of the number of antidepressant, antipsychotic, anxiolytic and hypnotic drugs per patient will be compared according to the period (Tovertafel or usual animation techniques). For the patients concerned, the consumption of benzodiazepines translated into the administered dose equivalent to oxazepam will also be compared.</description>

    <description>The TOVERTAFEL is a small box that can be attached to the ceiling. Inside the box is a high-quality projector, infrared sensors, a speaker, and a processor that work together to project games onto the table. Because the colored objects respond to the movements of the hands and arms, the residents can play with the light itself.
The planned activities provide cognitive, social and physical stimulation through light projections and can all be used individually or in groups with the presence of a caregiver or facilitator. Sixteen play activities are offered.</description>
