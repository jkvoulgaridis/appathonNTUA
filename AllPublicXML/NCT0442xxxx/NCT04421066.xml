    <textblock>
      In this study genomic, proteomic and histological technologies for the search and
      characterization of epigenetic modifications and molecular or protein markers, useful in the
      diagnosis and progression of peri-implant diseases and prevention of implant failure will be
      used.

      Samples stored at the Biomedical Research Institute of A Coruña, Xerencia Integrated
      Management of A Coruña (University Hospital Center of A Coruña), belonging to the collection
      of the line of research &quot;Oral Health and Systemic Relationship&quot; with registration nº 2017/104
      will be used for the realization of the present study.

      Nucleic acid extraction and histological analysis of the samples will be performed to
      evaluate the functional epigenetic modifications associated with peri-implant diseases, in an
      exploratory manner.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subjects must have read, understood and signed an informed consent regarding the
             obtaining of biological samples and participation in the research line of &quot;Oral Health

             example, severe medical problems, bone metabolism disorders, uncontrolled bleeding
             disorders, depressed immune system, diseases that require the periodic use of
             steroids, uncontrolled endocrine disorders) .

             area.

          -  Samples of subjects with a history of having received treatment with intravenous or
             subcutaneous antiresorptive agents associated with osteonecrosis of the jaw, such as
             bisphosphonates.

        Samples of subjects assigned to the healthy group that meet any of the following criteria
        will be excluded from participation in this study:

          -  Root fragments, pericoronaritis, endo-perio lesions, dental abscesses at the site of
             the biopsy.

          -  Presence of BOP in the sample collection site.

        Peri- implant disease samples / Exclusion of Subjects

        The samples of the subjects assigned to the peri- implant diseases group that meet any of
        the following criteria will be excluded from participation in this study if the implants
        were removed due to:

          -  Subjects with implants previously treated surgically for peri- implant disease with
             antibiotics.
