  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) Diagnosis is based on rising creatinine. Intrarenal
      vasoconstriction occurs earlier and measuring flow resistance in the renal circulation (Renal
      Resistive Index (RRI)) could become part of vital organ function assessment using Doppler
      ultrasound.

      The aim of this study is to predict AKI in septic patients in ICU by measuring RRI on
      admission by comparing two groups of patients, first group with RRI of normal value (0.6-0.7)
      and the other group with high RRI more than 0.7 and both with normal renal function on
      admission.

    <textblock>
      Patients who have criteria of sepsis, with normal renal function on admission will undergo
      Renal Doppler Ultrasound examination to measure Renal resistive index.

      Patients will be divided into 2 groups:

        1. Group (A) patients with renal resistive index between 0.6 and 0.7 (normal RRI).

        2. Group (B) patients with renal resistive index more than 0.7 (high RRI).
