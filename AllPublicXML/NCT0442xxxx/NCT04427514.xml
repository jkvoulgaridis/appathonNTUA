  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is an open-label, prospective, single-arm, single center study.

      In this study is planned to involve 12 patients, who need continuous ambulatory peritonealis
      dialysis (CAPD). Telemedicine software is related to peritoneal dialysis. With the help of a
      tablet device running an Android system on patients and the care team and the smart devices
      attached to it (scales, blood pressure monitor), patients perform measurements in their homes
      in connection with solution changes. The resulting data is transmitted through the
      telemedicine system to the care team, which can take immediate intervention if necessary and
      notify the patient of any change in therapy.

      After enrollment, the patient is educated about the using of telemedicine system and then the
      standard CAPD will be continued in their home treatment supplemented with a telemedicine
      system.

      There is a monthly follow-up visit in the CAPD therapy. Before each control visit a
      telemedicine doctor, for whom are available telemedicine data, decides whether a control
      visit is necessary. After that line the patient will be subjected to a personal check - up
      visit by another specialist, for whom the result of the telemedicine visit is unknown. At the
      end of the control visit, the doctor declares whether it could have been triggered the
      examination with the review of telemedicine data.

      In the end of the study will be summarized the average number of visits that can be omitted
      and will be analyzed the extent to which the two medical opinions and the necessity of the
      visit matched.
