    <textblock>
      An &quot;Advanced Planning Program of Health Decisions&quot; (APPHD) is a process of reflection and
      relationship between the patient, their relatives and health professionals. It is based on
      respect for patient's autonomy, to engage patients in making decisions about their disease so
      that the process is shared between the medical team, the patient and their relatives. Until
      now, it has not been measured whether the APPHD is effective and, therefore, really fulfills
      its purpose

      BACKGROUND: An Advanced Care Planning (ACP) program of health decisions is the result of a
      process of reflection and relationship-building between the patient, their relatives and
      health professionals. It is based on respect for patients' autonomy, involving them in making
      decisions about their disease in a way that is shared between the medical team, the patient
      and their relatives. Up until now, the efficacy of an ACP has not been measured in the
      existing literature, and therefore it is unknown if these programs reach their goal.
      OBJETIVES: The main objective of our study is to evaluate the efficacy of an ACP program for
      decision-making in patients with advanced heart failure (HF) in comparison to usual follow up
      and care. This objective will be evaluated by the Patient Activation Measure test, which
      measures the participation and self-management of the patient in decision-making. Secondary
      objectives: to evaluate the effect of the program on quality of life, to know if the patients
      wishes expressed through the ACP program are fulfilled, to measure the impact of the program
      on patients' caregivers, to determine the satisfaction of patients included in the program
      and to evaluate the effect on quality of death. METHODS: randomized multicentre clinical
      trial at four hospitals in Madrid. Once they are included in the study, patients' allocation
      to groups (control vs intervention) will be made by alternative sampling. ACP will be applied
      to the intervention group, whereas in the Control Group usual follow-up will be carried out
      in HF units. All patients will fulfil questionnaires and tests related to the objectives of
      the study again after a 12-month follow-up period in order to gauge the effect of ACP in
      patients with advanced HF.

    <intervention_model_description>Once patients have been included in the study, the assignment process will be carried out by random sampling to the study groups. In the First Group (control group), patients will be followed in HF outpatients units according to the usual established protocol. In the Second Group (intervention group), patients will participate in the ACP program. Treatment for HF will be the same in both groups. The research team has developed the ACP program based on the published bibliography on ACP and advanced HF. The four hospitals mentioned will start recruiting at the beginning of the study. The principal investigator will be responsible for interrupting recruitment once the sample size has been reached.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>This objective will be evaluated by the PAM (Patient Activation Measure) test, which measures the participation and self-management of the patient in decision making. PAM measures the activation (participation and self-management) of the patient in decision-making. It evaluates the knowledge, skills and confidence of patients' self-management classifying patients in levels of self-management activation. Level 1: They do not feel responsible for their own health and care. (Score 47.0 or lower); Level 2: They may lack basic understanding about their condition, treatment options, and / or self-care. (47.1 to 55.1); Level 3: They know the basic facts of their illness and treatments. (55.2 to 67); Level 4: They have made most of the decisions, but they may have difficulties in maintaining behaviours over time or in stressful situations (67.1 or higher).</description>

    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>This objective will be evaluated by the LWHFQ Questionnaire (Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire), which measures the quality of life in patients with HF. Scoring range: 0 to 105 points: The higher the score obtained, the poorer the quality of life of patients. Questions refer to signs and symptoms of the disease, social relationships, physical, sexual activity, work and emotions. It is self-administered, with Likert response options, ranging from 0 (quality of life not affected) to 5 (maximum impact on quality of life). The global score is obtained by adding the 21 items scores (range: 0-105); the highest value corresponds to the worst quality of life. It assesses the impact of chronic heart failure in two dimensions: the physical dimension based on eight items (range: 0-40) and the emotional dimension consisting of five items (range: 0-25).</description>

    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>This objective will be evaluated by the Dying and Death quality questionnaire (QODD). This questionnaire measures the quality of the dying process.
Quality of Dying and Death - 17-Item Version: Each item includes a filter question reporting what actually occurred during the final period of the decedent's life, followed by a rating of what occurred. The first 10 filter questions ask the frequency of occurrence and use the following response options: 0: none of the time; 1: a little bit of the time ; 2: some of the time; 3: a good bit of the time; 4: most of the time; 5: all of the time. The last 7 filter questions ask whether the event occurred and are answered with a yes/no response. After each filter question, the respondent rates the decedent's experience, using the following scale: 0 = terrible experience…10 = almost perfect experience.</description>

Zarit questionnaire about caregiver's burden. This interview measures caregivers' degree of subjective overload in relation to chronic patients. It consists of 22 items that collect caregivers' feelings. Each feeling scores on a frequency gradient that ranges from 1 (never) to 5 (almost always). Interpretation:
or &lt;45 points: no overload
47 to 55 points: slight overload
