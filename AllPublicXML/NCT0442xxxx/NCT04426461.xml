  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression and anxiety disorders rank in the top ten causes of years lived with disability.
      Less than 50% of patients experiencing long-lasting improvements to current gold-standard
      treatments. Two gold-standard behavioral interventions include behavioral activation, focused
      on enhancing approach behavior towards meaningful activities, and exposure-based therapy,
      focused on decreasing avoidance and challenging negative expectations. While these
      interventions have divergent treatment targets, there is little knowledge to inform which
      strategies should be used in the frequent case of comorbid anxiety and depression.
      Approach-avoidance decision-making paradigms focus on assessing responses when faced with
      potential rewards and threats, tapping into processes important for both anxiety and
      depression as well as behavioral activation and exposure-based therapy.

      For this study, investigators will recruit individuals reporting both anxiety and depression
      symptoms and randomize them to one of three different interventions: (1) behavioral
      activation, (2) exposure-based therapy, and a non-specific therapy approach (3) supportive
      therapy. Participants will complete clinical, self-report, behavioral, and functional
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) assessments before and after therapy. Investigators will
      use a computational approach to model factors that may influence one's behavior during
      approach-avoidance decision-making, including drives to avoid threat versus approach reward
      and confidence versus uncertainty in one's decisions.

      This project will accomplish the following aims (1) Determine how changes in brain and
      behavior responses during approach-avoidance conflict relate to changes in mental health
      symptoms with the different therapy approaches, (2) Determine the degree to which baseline
      brain and behavior responses during approach-avoidance conflict predict response to the
      different therapy approaches, above and beyond the influence of demographics and baseline
      symptom severity.

      Results will enhance understanding of how different psychotherapy approaches (behavioral
      activation, exposure-based therapy) may impact brain responses and decisions when faces with
      potential reward versus threat and approach versus avoidance drives. In addition, results
      will have important implications concerning the potential for a more personalized approach to
      psychotherapy, enhancing knowledge of which types of therapy strategies may be most
      beneficial for which individuals.
