  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to train community health workers (promotoras) from the
      Prosalud promotora program to implement the Cultivando la Salud (CLS) breast and cervical
      cancer screening program, to adapt and deliver the CLS intervention program for
      Hispanic/Latina women in the Greater Houston Area, and to evaluate the process and effect of
      the adapted CLS program on increasing mammography and cervical cancer screening.

    <description>Promotoras will deliver the CLS program either in face-to-face and/or group sessions to all women within 2 months of the baseline interview. Each session will last approximately 1 to 2 hours, and will include CLS materials adapted for this study.At the conclusion of the CLS program, promotoras will provide information about local and affordable providers delivering low-cost or free breast and cervical cancer screening services. Should a woman require follow-up for abnormal results, referrals will be given to programs,which provides assistance accessing cancer diagnostic and treatment services. Two weeks after delivering the education component of the CLS program, promotoras will call women to provide any further assistance needed. During these follow-up calls promotoras will provide on-going navigation support to women in need of mammography and Pap test screening</description>
