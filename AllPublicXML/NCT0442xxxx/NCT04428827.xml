    <textblock>
      Majority of patients with hypertension have primary hypertension (without an underlying
      cause). Primary aldosteronism (PA) is the most common cause of secondary hypertension, and
      can be found in 5-10% of patients locally. PA is caused by excessive release of a hormone
      (aldosterone) from the adrenal glands, which can be unilateral (one gland) or bilateral (both
      glands).

      It has been shown that excess aldosterone has other harmful effects in addition to
      hypertension, such as directly affecting the heart, blood vessels, kidneys, leading to
      increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. This is supported by studies showing
      reversal of these effects after treatment for PA.

      The investigators aim to assess the long-term cardiovascular, and renal outcomes of patients
      with PA, compared to patients with essential hypertension.
