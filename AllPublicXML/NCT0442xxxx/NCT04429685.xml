  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low dose ketamine is used for pain management and for the treatment of anxiety and
      depression. Prior studies on low dose ketamine have noted short-term (minutes to hours)
      increases or decreases in blood pressure. Blood pressure that is too high or too low can be
      problematic if untreated. It is unknown exactly how low dose ketamine affects blood pressure.
      In fact, no prior studies have measured sympathetic nervous system activity after low dose
      ketamine has been given to an adult. Because sympathetic nervous system activity has a large
      influence on blood pressure, we need to know how exactly low dose ketamine affects these body
      systems. Therefore, in this research we will study how low dose ketamine affects sympathetic
      nervous system activity and cardiovascular function. The results from this research will
      inform doctors about how low dose ketamine affects the sympathetic nervous system, heart, and
      blood vessels.
