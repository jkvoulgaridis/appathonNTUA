      The objective of the present study was to analyze the differences between the formulas used
      to estimate fat mass and to establish the existing relationship with the skinfold sum in
      anthropometry. A total of 2,458 active subjects participated in the study (mean age:
      27.98±7.43 years-old). Basic measurements and skinfolds variables were measured following the
      guidelines of the International Society for the Advancement in Kinanthropometry (ISAK), and
      Kerr, Durnin-Womersley, Faulkner and Carter equations were used to assess fat mass.
      Significative differences were found between all the formulas for the percentage of fat mass
      and the fat mass in kilograms. The correlations among the skinfolds sums and the different
      equations were high and significative in all the cases. There were differences between all
      the formulas used to estimate the fat mass. The six or eight skinfold sums could be a valid
      and better alternative than the fat mass equations or the BMI to assess the subcutaneous fat
      mass in physically active adults.
