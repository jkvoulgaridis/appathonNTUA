  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Soccer, the most popular sport in the world, exposes players to repeated head impacts and
      concussions, due to contact with another player or with the ground. Moreover, routine
      game-play in soccer involves intentional and repeated head impacts through ball &quot;heading&quot;,
      with frequent high velocities, which might cause a transient brain dysfunction. In this
      pre-post prospective interventional study, 22 soccer players will perform 10 headers from
      machine-projected soccer balls at standardized speeds, modelling routine soccer practice.
      They will perform heading series in 2 different oral conditions, on different days at least 1
      week apart: 1) Without mouthguard and tight jaws ; 2) With mouthguard and tight jaws. The
      strength of the neck muscles will be measured before the heading series. The kinematic of the
      movement will be recorded during each impact during the 2 heading series, as well as the
      activity of the jaw muscles which will be recorded by electromyogram. Before and after each
      heading series, electrophysiological data, multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and
      cognitive computerized assessment will be acquired
