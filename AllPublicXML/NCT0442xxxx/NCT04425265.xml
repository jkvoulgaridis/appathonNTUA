  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims at exploring whether plasma radiofrequency ablation at low temperature is
      associated with better survival outcome in localized recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma by
      conducting a randomized controlled trial of plasma radiofrequency ablation at low temperature
      versus electrocautery block resection at high frequency for localized recurrent
      nasopharyngeal carcinoma. If the hypothesis is confirmed, it is expected to provide a
      convenient choice for the surgical treatment of localized recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

    <description>Under the guidance of nasal endoscope, the nasopharyngeal tumor and its sufficient safety margin are completely removed through the bilateral nasal cavity. Then investigators use plasma radiofrequency ablation at low temperature to ablate the tumor tissue and normal tissue of the margin along the upper and lower surgical margin until no obvious tumor remained under the naked eye.</description>

    <description>Under the guidance of nasal endoscope, the nasopharyngeal tumor and its sufficient safety margin are continuously and completely removed through the bilateral nasal cavity. Then investigators separate the posterior part of the nasal cavity and the top wall of the nasopharynx along the bone of the nasopharyngeal fornix, cut the pharyngeal suture, and cut the two sides along the edge of the carina, and then merge along the anterior vertebral muscle surface to the midline incision. Along the the soft palate under the inferior margin, investigators horizontally cut the mucosa of the posterior wall of the nasopharynx, and completely frees the entire soft tissue of the posterior wall of the nasopharynx.</description>
