  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, PA imaging will be used to examine the physiological and physical changes in
      lymph node involvements of head and neck cancer during radiotherapy with or without
      chemotherapy. Our objective in this pilot study will be to evaluate if PA parameters change
      within the lymph node involvements during chemoradiation therapy over time. Our hope is to
      use this information to correlate the changes in measured PA parameters with radiological
      response.

    <description>The primary study endpoint will investigate changes of measured PA markers and compare these to radiological assessment of response of lymph node involvement to chemoradiation therapy for head and neck cancer. Changes in PA parameters will be made to a pre-treatment point over the course of treatment.</description>

    <description>The secondary study endpoint will correlate changes of measured PA markers to five-year overall survival (OS) of the same patient cohort. The survival status and of the patient cohort will be tracked after the treatment for five years based on the patient information system and follow up surveys if necessary.</description>
