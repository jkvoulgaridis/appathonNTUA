  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Humans produce non-verbal vocalizations (shouting, growling, screaming), laughter, ...) in
      various contexts that are likely to perform biological functions.

      and important social issues. Yet despite their importance in the human vocal repertoire, the
      mechanisms and functions of non-verbal vocalizations remain little studied and poorly
      understood including in humans.

      In this context, the investigators wish to examine how the perception of vocalizations
      non-verbal aversive behaviours influence pain tolerance in healthy adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Humans produce nonverbal vocalisations such as screams, grunts, roars, cries and laughter
      across a variety of contexts. Yet despite the prominence and apparent importance of these
      nonverbal sounds in human communication, the investigators still know very little about their
      influence on human perception and behaviour. That's why, in this study, the investigators
      will examine specifically the influence of nonverbal vocal perception on pain tolerance.

      The remainder of the study will involve up to three trials of a pain tolerance (cold pressor)
      task, during which the investigators will ask participants to listen to vocalisations (e.g.,
      babies' cries or babbling) while submerging the participant's hand in bath of circulating
      cold water.

      The results of the study will contribute to theoretical understanding of the functions of
      nonverbal vocal communication in humans, in particular the influence of nonverbal vocal and
      perception (of babies' cries) on pain tolerance.

    <intervention_name>Cold pressor task (CPT)</intervention_name>
    <description>The cold pressor test is among the most common and established methods for studying human reactions to pain and pain tolerance.
Participants submerge a hand in cold water (approx. 5°C) and are asked to keep their hand submerged for as long as can (until the sensation is intolerable), up to a maximum of 5 min.
The procedure is safe because the hand is removed before adverse effects can occur.
The participant will be given a break of 5 min in between trials, and will interchange hands between trials.
During this break hand may to be place in warm water (25-35°C) for up to 4 min to normalise hand temperature, which will be measured before and after each trial using a digital thermometer held firmly in the palm of the hand. Each participant will complete no more than three trials (conditions) in a randomised order.</description>

    <description>During the experience, participants are led to listen, via headphones, to aversive non-verbal vocalizations (baby crying). The sound levels used to broadcast the non-verbal vocalisations will be scrupulously measured using approved and certified equipment during the preparation of the experiments. These sound volumes will be chosen so as not to inconvenience participants.</description>
