    <textblock>
      This study consists of a single-dose study and a multiple-dose study, both using a
      single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation design： I.
      Single-Dose Study There will be a total of 6 dose cohorts. Each cohort will include 10
      subjects, of which 8 receives HEC96719 tablets and 2 receives placebo, regardless of gender.
      Each subject will only participate in one dose cohort. Each cohort will be divided into 2
      group. The first group consists of 2 sentinels, one receiving active and one placebo. The
      second group will consist of the remainder of the cohort (7 active and 1 placebo) and,
      following review of the available safety data, will be dosed 48 hours after the sentinel
      group. Subjects can leave the pharmacy after their biological samples are collected on day 3.
      The last safety follow-up visit is to be performed on day 7±1 via telephone. Subjects in each
      cohort will receive a single dose of HEC96719 or placebo in the fasted state on day 1, and
      safety evaluation is to be performed on day 3 and 7.

      II. Multi-Dose Study There will be a total of 3 dose cohorts. Each cohort will consist of 12
      subjects, of which 10 receive HEC96719 tablets and 2 receive placebo, the dose regimen will
      comprise no less than once a day and will not exceed 4 times daily dosing for 7 consecutive
      days (study doses, administration method (fasted or fed), dosing frequency, and dosing period
      are all to be determined based on data from the single-dose study and multiple-dose study).
      Each subject will only participate in one dose cohort. Subjects will reside at the pharmacy
      from the day before dosing (D-1) to 96 h after the last dose. Subjects can leave pharmacy
      after their biological samples are collected. The last safety follow-up visit is to be
      performed 168±24 h after the last dose via telephone.
