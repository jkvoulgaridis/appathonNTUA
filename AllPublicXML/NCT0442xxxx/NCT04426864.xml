      Objective: To demonstrate the most effective exercise intervention for women with
      fibromyalgia syndrome on the pain, quality of life, depression, and body composition through
      a comparative study of three types of exercise intervention: supervised aerobic plus
      stretching, supervised resistance plus stretching, and home-based stretching.

      Objective: To demonstrate the most effective exercise intervention for women with
      fibromyalgia syndrome on the pain, quality of life, depression, and body composition through
      a comparative study of three types of exercise intervention.

      Methods: Eighty-four patients women with fibromyalgia syndrome were assigned to three groups:
      supervised aerobic plus stretching exercises group (group I, n:28), supervised resistance
      plus stretching exercises group (group II, n:28) and home-based stretching exercises group
      (group III, n:28). The target heart rate (HR) corresponding to values of 50-70 %
      ergospirometric VO2max were determined by the submaximal treadmill test. Group I was
      instructed walking at their target HR on a treadmill. Exercise intensity in group II was
      determined by one-repetition maximum (1RM) measurements. Group III was instructed to exercise
      at home. All participants were instructed to perform stretching exercises. Before and after a
      12-week exercise program, participants were evaluated by weight, Body Mass Index (BMI), total
      body fat and muscle percentage, Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire
      (FIQ), Short Form-36 (SF-36) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI).

    <description>An exercise prescription was developed for each woman based on the data acquired from the baseline treadmill exercise test. Target HR corresponding to values of 50-70 % ergospirometric VO2max (moderate-intensity) was determined by the submaximal treadmill test. The participants were instructed to perform their exercises at 50 % of VO2max for six weeks. At seventh their exercise intensity was increased to target HR corresponding to 70 % of VO2max. HR was monitored by a Polar HR monitor (Polar Beat, Port Washington, NY). Stretching exercises were performed at the beginning and end of each exercise session. Each muscle group exercise was performed 3-4 times and each repeat was 30 seconds long. The muscle groups which were involved in stretching exercises were upper trapezius, rhomboid, hip flexor, hamstring, pectoral, piriformis, quadriceps, gastrocnemius, soleus, levator scapulae, hip adductor and tensor fasciae late muscles. The exercise program was applied 3 days a week for 12 weeks.</description>

    <description>According to the data obtained from 1-RM tests, an exercise prescription was developed for each woman. The participants were instructed to perform their exercises with 50% of 1-RM for six weeks. In the 7. week, weights were increased to 70-80% of 1-RM. The number of sets increased progressively (10 repetitions per set; 1 set in the first two weeks; 2 sets in the 3rd and 4th week; 3 sets in the 5th and 6th week). The muscle groups which were involved in resistance exercises were bilateral biceps, deltoid, trapezius, pectorals, serratus anterior, latissimus dorsi, levator scapulae, rhomboid, gluteal, quadriceps, hip adductor and abductor, hamstring, gastrocnemius and abdominal muscles. Stretching exercises were performed at the beginning and end of each exercise session. Each muscle group exercise was performed 3-4 times and each repeat was 30 seconds long. Stretching exercises were given for the muscle groups they worked on. The exercise program was applied 3 days a week for 12 weeks.</description>
