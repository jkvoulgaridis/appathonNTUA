    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trial.The main purpose
      of this study is to determine if postsurgical opioid use and pain scores are decreased with
      oral Propranolol treatment. The treatment period will last for six days and the observation
      period will last for three months. Effectiveness of treatment will be assessed by means of
      post-operative opioid consumption as primary outcome measure.

    <description>Subjects randomized to the propranolol treatment arm will be administered propranolol 40mg BID for three days prior to surgery, 40mg BID the day of surgery and on post-operative days 1 and 2. Subjects and researchers will be blinded and will not know if propranolol or placebo control is administered.
Patients will be evaluated for opioid usend pain scores at 24 hrs, 48 hrs, 1 week, 4 weeks, and 12 weeks post-op.
Blood will also be obtained pre-operatively, 8 hours and 24 hours post-operatively to measure the level of inflammatory markers. We will use these samples to evaluate if treatment with propranolol decreases the levels of inflammatory markers, and if this correlates to decreased opioid use and pain scores post-operatively.
All other pre-, intra-, and post-operative interventions will be equivalent between the experimental and placebo groups, and this study's interventions will not affect surgical management.</description>
