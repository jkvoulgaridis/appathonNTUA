    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>If the Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D) for Venetoclax during induction is established, then the dose-expansion cohort will continue to test venetoclax in both induction and maintenance. Participants will be administered non-continuous induction therapy with Venetoclax (RP2D-I/induction RP2D), Atezolizumab (1200mg) every 3 weeks (Q3W) on Day 1, Carboplatin (5mg/mL/min) on Day 1 and Etoposide (100mg/m^2) on Days 1-3 followed by continuous maintenance therapy with Venetoclax (RP2D-M) and Atezolizumab (1200mg) every 3 weeks (Q3W) on Day 1. If significant toxicity and DLTs in induction preclude identification of an RP2D for venetoclax in induction treatment, then the safety and efficacy of venetoclax will only be investigated in dose-expansion in the maintenance setting. Participants will be administered continuous maintenance therapy with Venetoclax (RP2D-M) and Atezolizumab (1200mg) every 3 weeks (Q3W) on Day 1.</description>
