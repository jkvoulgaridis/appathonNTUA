  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women suffer from cardiovascular diseases 10 years later than men, therefore female sex has
      been considered as a 'protective factor'. However, the risk of cardiovascular disease in
      women increases rapidly after menopause and the declining levels of endogenous estrogen is
      thought to be the causative factor. Furthermore, Postmenopausal hormone therapy (HT)
      decreases the severity and intensity of menopausal symptoms and improves women's quality of
      life. Until the last 10 years, based on the results of observational studies, postmenopausal
      HT may protect women against cardiovascular events and decrease the risk of coronary artery
      disease by 35-50%. However, recent randomized primary and secondary prevention trials did not
      support the cardioprotective effect of HT.

      The aim of this study is to assess the effect of hormone therapy on serum ischemia modified
      albumin (IMA) levels. Thirty surgical menopausal women who admitted to Karadeniz Technical
      University, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology during 1-year period
      and diagnosed as menopause and planned to have hormone therapy for menopausal symptoms were
      enrolled for this prospective study. The serum Ä°MA levels were recorded before and after (3
      months, 6 months, 12 months later) hormone treatment (2 mg Estradiol Hemihidrat).

        Within 10 months of the study period, estradiol hemihydrate for all patients who underwent
        TAH + BSO for gynecology and obstetrics in our clinic and evaluated with the diagnosis of
        surgical menopause in the postoperative period (6th week) was prescribed. These cases were
        evaluated in terms of inclusion and exclusion criteria after they were determined to be
        volunteers to participate in the study.
