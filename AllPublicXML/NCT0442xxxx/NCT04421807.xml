    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to investigate the effects of scapulathoracic stabilization exercises
      additionally applied to complex decongestive therapy after mastectomy on posture, balance and
      quality of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lymphedema is a chronic and progressive condition that occurs with the accumulation of
      protein-rich fluid in interstitial tissue spaces as a result of abnormal development or
      damage to the lymphatic system. Lymphedema is divided into 2 as primary and secondary.
      Secondary lymphedema is the most common form seen in upper extremity, usually after breast
      cancer treatment approaches. In lymphedema, not only upper limb affected, but also posture,
      balance, shoulder girdle, scapula and quality of life can be adversely affected. Complex
      decongestive therapy has been accepted as the gold standard treatment in lymphedema to reduce
      edema, however, there were insufficient studies investigating the effects on the posture and
      the balance in patients with lymphedema. Scapulatoracic stabilization exercises aim to
      increase muscle stability ability, kinesthetic awareness, ovarall stability and balance.
      However, when the literature is reviewed, no study is found investigating the effect of
      scapulatoracic stabilization exercises in individuals who developed lymphedema after
      mastectomy.

    <measure>General posture status</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline , at 4 weeks and at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>General posture status will be evaluated with the New York Posture Scale, postural changes that can occur in 13 different parts of the body are scored by observing the individual posteriorly and laterally. Each parameter is given 5 if smooth, 3 if moderately impaired, 1 if severely impaired. At the end of the scoring minimum 13, maximum 65 points can be obtained.</description>

    <description>Balance will be evaluated with MINIBESTEST. It includes sub-parameters of Intuitive, Reactive Postural Control, Sensory Orientation, Dynamic Walk. Each parameter has its own scoring and the total score is obtained by adding all of them. In the test consisting of 14 items, each parameter is given a score between 0-2. 0 indicates the lowest function level, 2 indicates the highest function level. A maximum of 28 points is obtained at the end of the scoring.</description>

    <measure>Quality of life outcomes</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline , at 4 weeks and at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It will be evaluated with Lymphedema Quality of Life Questionnaire. The survey consists of 21 questions. The first part of the 20 questions contains the questions of function, appearance, symptom and mood, and the last question evaluates the overall quality of life. The first 20 questions area scoring is not at all (1), a little (2), quite (3), many (4). The total score ranges from &quot;1&quot; to &quot;4&quot; and is obtained by dividing the sum of the question scores answered by the number of questions. A high score indicates that the quality of life is low. The last question that assesses the overall health status is between 0 (bad) and 10 (excellent).</description>

    <measure>The severity of the lymphoedema</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline , at 4 weeks and at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>For the evaluation of the severity of the lymphoedema, circumferential measurements in centimeters on bilateral upper extremities. at 5-cm intervals from wrist to axilla will be used</description>

    <measure>Lymphedema symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline , at 4 weeks and at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Pain, numbness, tingling, fatigue, feeling of heaviness in lymphedema symptoms were evaluated individually with Visual Analogue Scale. This scale is a 10 cm line with no marks along them, anchored with thewords&quot;no pain&quot;on one hand, and&quot;the most severe pain&quot;on theother. Participants will be simply instructed to place a mark alongthe line at a level representing the intensity of their pain,Pain, numbness, tingling, fatigue, feeling of heaviness.</description>
