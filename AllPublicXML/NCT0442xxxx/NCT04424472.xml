  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine the utility of renal ultrasonography (US) in the
      detection of abdominal recurrences after definitive therapy for renal cell carcinoma (RCC)
      and compare the detection rate to that of cross-sectional imaging.

    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Compare the average radiation exposure over 5 years for patients on current standard of care imaging surveillance for RCC, which consists of both ultrasound and cross-sectional imaging, to that of patients who would only receive cross-section imaging surveillance for RCC. This would yield overall increase in radiation burden for patients with RCC</description>
