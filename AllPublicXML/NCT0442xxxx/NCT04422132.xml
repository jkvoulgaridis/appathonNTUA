  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare urinary and bowel side effects of hypofractionated
      radiotherapy in 20 treatments (4 weeks) to ultra-hypofractionated radiotherapy in 5
      treatments (2 weeks) for prostate cancer that has returned after prostatectomy. The
      investigators are also interested in looking at time to progression and the quality of life
      (health scores).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The standard treatment for most patients with biochemical recurrence after radical
      prostatectomy is salvage radiotherapy. Salvage radiotherapy delays the need for chronic,
      non-curative treatment, such as long-term androgen suppression, and is the only potentially
      curative treatment of some biochemical recurrences after prostatectomy.

      Patients are recommended to undergo salvage radiotherapy to eradicate biochemical disease
      delivered in approximately 40 treatments over the course of 8 weeks, representing a high
      burden of therapy, which may be related to lower utilization of salvage radiotherapy. Modern
      radiotherapy for prostate cancer has been afforded many advantages including advanced
      image-guided radiotherapy allowing for larger dose delivery in fewer treatments and smaller
      margins with hypofractionated (20 treatments) and ultra-hypofractionated (5 treatments)
      radiotherapy.

      In patients that need salvage radiotherapy, the potential advantages of hypofractionated and
      ultra-hypofractionated radiotherapy delivered over 20 or 5 treatments are: 1) increased
      convenience to patients because of fewer treatment days, 2) reduced costs to patients because
      of reduced travel expenses and copays, 3) improved resource utilization for physicians
      because of the fewer number of treatments per patient and consequently 4) reduced cost to
      society. In prostate cancer specifically, hypofractionated and ultra-hypofractionated
      radiotherapy has the added potential of not increasing toxicity with shorter treatment times.

    <description>The primary objective is to demonstrate that 5 days of ultra-hypofractionated radiotherapy does not significantly increase patient-reported Gastrointestinal (GI) and Genitourinary (GU) symptoms over 20 days of hypofractionated radiotherapy 2 years after treatment completion as measured by EPIC.
Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) short form questionnaire. The Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) is a comprehensive instrument designed to evaluate patient function and bother after prostate cancer treatment. Scores range from 0 to 100, lower scores indicate worse outcomes and higher EPIC scores represent better outcomes.</description>
