  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients who have previously had incontinence surgery due to stress incontinence
      (Midurethral slings (tvt, tot, etc.)), the symptoms may return in the following years and the
      patient can reapply with urinary incontinence. Urodynamic evaluation is important before
      stress incontinence surgery to confirm clinical diagnosis based on symptoms and findings and
      to determine the factors that may affect the effectiveness of surgery and the possibility of
      complications. Urodynamics evaluation is performed in the preoperative period in patients
      scheduled for incontinence. Urodynamics evaluation is performed again in patients who applied
      with post-operative recurrence due to surgery failure or different reasons.

      It is aimed to show whether there is a difference between the urodynamics parameters of these
      patients who were examined preoperatively and the urodynamics parameters examined in case of
      postoperative failure. Thus, the primary goal; to show which of these parameters has
      deterioration or if the surgical method is insufficient if it is within certain limits or
      urinary incontinence may recur.

        The files of the patients will be accessed through the system, and patients who have had
        incontinence surgery and applied again due to recurrence will be selected. The data of
        these patients will be scanned and recorded. The control group will also be created in the
        same way, and data of patients who have undergone surgery and have no urinary incontinence
        and who have postoperative urodynamics will be recorded. .
