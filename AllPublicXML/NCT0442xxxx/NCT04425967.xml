  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, soft tissue sarcomas (STS) are preoperatively irradiated in a conventionally
      fractionated regimen of 25 x 2 Gy in five weeks as if these tumors exhibit high α/β ratios of
      10 Gy or higher. Recent radiobiological investigations, however, suggests substantially lower
      α/β ratios of approximately 4.9 Gy, suggestive of sensitivity to (modest) hypofractionation.
      This study investigates a new and patient friendly preoperative regimen of 14 x 3 Gy in the
      hypothesis that both the postoperative wound complication rate as well as the local control
      probability at two years are comparable to the current clinical practice of 25 x 2 Gy.

    <textblock>
      Surgery is the cornerstone in the treatment of non-metastatic sarcomas. Whenever feasible the
      resection should include a free surgical margin providing a rim of uninvolved tissue
      surrounding the tumor. In most deep located tumors however, to preserve essential
      neurovascular and bone structures and thus to preserve function, the margins are often
      limited. High grade tumors are, even with wider margins, at higher risk of local failure.
      Radiotherapy can reduce this risk of local failure.

      Preoperative radiotherapy might be expected to reduce tumor burden prior to resection,
      theoretically allowing more conservative surgical therapy. Postoperative Radiotherapy allows
      histological examination of the tumor specimen, especially the margins, aiding in further
      treatment planning; it may also be associated with fewer early wound complications.
      Radiotherapy as a (neo)adjuvant treatment is conventionally given in 25 fractions of 2 Gy.

      In preoperative radiotherapy, as compared to postoperative radiotherapy, lower doses (50
      versus 60 to 66 Gy) and smaller field sizes can be used, resulting in a reduced risk of late,
      often irreversible, complications. Consequently, preoperative Radiotherapy is the preferred
      approach in many centers. Modern radiobiological investigations suggest that intermediate to
      high-grade soft tissue sarcomas exhibit α/β ratio's with an average of 4.9 Gy, justifying
      initiating clinical studies into (modest) hypofractionation. Obviously, various subtype
      derived cell lines exhibit different characteristics but on average an α/β ratio of 4.9 Gy
      would be a reasonable denominator for sarcomas as a group.

      The new schedule is, however, a substantial reduction of the patient's treatment burden (44%
      less fractions) and has a potential of being cost-effective for radiotherapy facility
      logistics.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed newly diagnosed intermediate to high grade soft tissue
             sarcoma localized to the extremities, trunk and chest wall or the head and neck area,
             for which the standard treatment is a combination of and radiotherapy and surgery
             (deep seated and/or &gt; 5cm in largest tumor diameter and/or an anticipated close
             resection margin and/or grade II/III according to the FNCLCC definition);

          -  Patients staged by at least a CT scan of the chest (and a CT scan of the abdomen, if
             deemed indicated according to local practices, e.g. in case of a myxoid liposarcoma).
             Staging may also be performed by FDG-PET scanning and or total body MRI scans. This
             staging procedure should not reveal metastatic disease. If, however, a low metastatic
             burden is detected such that this does not preclude the application of both
             preoperative radiotherapy and definitive surgery, patients are allowed to participate;

          -  WHO Performance Status ≤ 2;

          -  Able and willing to undergo preoperative radiotherapy;

          -  Able and willing to undergo definitive surgery;

          -  Able and willing to comply with regular follow-up visits;

          -  Able and willing to complete patient reported outcome questionnaires (health-related
             quality of life and cost effectiveness);

          -  Age ≥ 18 years;

          -  Signed written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior malignancies; except another malignancy and disease-free for ≥ 5 years, or
             completely resected non-melanomatous skin carcinoma or successfully treated in situ
             carcinoma;

          -  Patients with recurrent sarcomas who underwent prior radiotherapy to the target lesion
             (if the primary sarcoma was managed by surgery only and no perioperative RT, patients
             are eligible);

          -  Ewing sarcoma and other PNET family tumors, rhabdomyosarcomas (both pediatric and
             adult), osteosarcomas;

          -  Any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition potentially
             hampering compliance with the study protocol and follow-up schedule; those conditions
             should be discussed with the patient before registration in the trial;

          -  Female patients who are pregnant;

          -  Intention to perform an isolated limb perfusion, instead of a tumor resection;

          -  Neoadjuvant chemotherapy to be scheduled between end of radiotherapy and definitive
             surgery (neoadjuvant chemotherapy before radiotherapy is allowed);
