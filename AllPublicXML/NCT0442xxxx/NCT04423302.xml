  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study aims to assess the efficacy of TOTUM-63, a mix of 5 plant extracts,
      consumed at the daily regimen of three times per day on glucose and lipid homeostasis in
      dysglycemic subjects. The hypothesis is that TOTUM-63, consumed 3 times per day, is superior
      to placebo for decrease of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) concentration after 24 weeks of
      consumption.
