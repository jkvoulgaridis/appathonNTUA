    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled study aims to evaluate the status of the individuals with hindfoot
      pain and to recommend preventive precautions and appropriate exercise programs with Smart
      Phone-Based Applications. Additionally, to compare the results of patients who attended
      through mobile applications (Achilles Tendinopathy and Plantar Fasciitis) with the results of
      patients included in the hands-on program.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Foot pain is common in the general population, with prevalence estimates ranging from 17 to
      30% . A systematic review concluded that nearly one-quarter of adults over age 45 experience
      frequent foot pain. Foot pain has been associated with poor balance, gait problems, the
      limitation of daily living activities, and health-related quality of life. It has been
      reported that at least two-thirds of individuals experience moderate functional daily life
      problems .The etiology of hindfoot pain is mostly associated with Achilles Tendinopathy and
      Plantar Fasciitis, which are prevalent, affecting millions of people each year . Most cases
      of hindfoot pain if not treated, they will get worse with time and resistant symptoms. This
      is why to get more information on prevalence and risk factors in the general population is
      necessary to organize health care planning and the extent of clinical need.An increase in the
      use of digital technology and smart phones globally with mobile applications provide an
      alternative solution to the planning of primary health care services. In the US,
      approximately 90% of adults have a mobile phone, and 58% of these prefer smart phones, while
      in Turkey, 98% of adults use mobile phones, and 77% of them are smart phones owners. The
      popularity of smart phones provides opportunities for reaching information and giving skills
      to users through applications. These applications offer new opportunities for collecting,
      evaluating, and monitoring health information and have portability, the flexibility of use,
      and a width of the access area.With the concept of this approaching (using digital
      technologies,) several systematic reviews have examined digital programs using for different
      health conditions/ pathologies (paralysis, lack of balance/stabilization, cardiac disorders,
      and joint / extremity). A great deal of physiotherapy interventions for hindfoot pain
      includes electrotherapy agents, 'hands-on' therapy, stretching, and strengthening exercises.
      The exercise programs are an essential part of rehabilitation programs for hindfoot pain, and
      patients who involved in this exercise program also need to get feedback by physiotherapist.
      For this reason, the digital technology-based applications are considered to be contributive
      for follow-up exercise regularly and detecting the changes and progression. Additionally, to
      the best of our knowledge, a smartphone application research involving hindfoot pathology
      with suggesting assessment methods and including exercise program is not available in the
      literature. Thereby, the study aims to evaluate the status of the individuals with hindfoot
      pain and to recommend preventive precautions and appropriate exercise programs with Smart
      Phone-Based Applications and to compare the results of patients who attended through mobile
      applications (Achilles Tendinopathy and Plantar Fasciitis) with the results of patients
      included in the hands-on program.

    <intervention_model_description>One hundred twenty patients aged 18-75 years, diagnosed as Plantar fasciitis and Achilles Tendinopathy by an Orthopedic surgeon, will be included. Patients will be randomly divided into three groups according to inclusion criteria.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Feiss Line test</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Feiss Line is an ankle examination procedure that tests for pes planus, flatfoot, fallen medial longitundinal arch.Patient should be standing with weight distributed evenly.
The examiner uses a marker to mark the inferior apex of medial malleolus and medial surface of the base of the base of the 1st metatarsal.
The examiner draws a line connecting the two points. The examiner locates the the navicular tuberosity and marks it.</description>

    <measure>Visual Analog Scale - Pain Assesment</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) was used to estimate the severity of participants' first step (morning time) and activity pain. It consists of a line, usually 100 mm long, whose ends are labeled as the extremes (no pain and worst pain imaginable); the rest of the line is blank.</description>

    <measure>Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Tampa consists of 17 questions and is used in diseases associated with acute and chronic low back pain, fibromyalgia, and musculoskeletal injuries. The scale uses a 4-point Likert score (1 = Strongly disagree, 4 = Strongly agree). A total score is calculated after the reversal of items 4, 8, 12, and 16. The patients can have a total score of between 17-68. The higher the score indicates, the higher the kinesiophobia</description>

    <measure>The Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment-Achilles Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The VISA-A aims to evaluate the clinical severity of patients with chronic Achilles tendinopathy. It can be used to determine the patient's clinical severity and provide a guideline for treatments as well as for monitoring the effect of treatment. Robinson et al. designed the Victorian Institute of Sports Assessment-Achilles (VISA-A) questionnaire, as a region-specific functional questionnaire, to assess the severity of AT.6 It contains eight questions that cover the three domains of pain (questions 1-3), function (questions 5-7) and activity (questions 7 and 8). Scores are summed to give a total out of 100. An asymptomatic person would score 100. It has proven to be a valid and reliable instrument to measure disability in cross-cultural studies conducted in Turkey</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Foot Function Index</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>FFI assessed pain, activity restriction, and disability. The pain subscale, which includes nine items, measures foot pain related to a variety of conditions. Various functional activities depending on foot problems were determined by the disability subscale, which also includes nine items. Activity restrictions due to foot problems were assessed with an activity limitation subscale containing five items. Higher scores indicate more pain, disability, and limited activity. In our study, the patients were asked to mark each category with a score between 0 and 10 about their pain, activity restriction, and disability level. All the categorized scores were collected, and a total score was noted.</description>
