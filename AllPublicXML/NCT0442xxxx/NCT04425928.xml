  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study it was aimed to investigate the effects of home treatment program based
      standard activity on dizziness, balance and daily life activity in patients with dizziness
      complaint originated from chronic unilateral peripheral vestibular disorder and compare to
      effects of exercise-based home rehabilitation program.

      The aim of this study was to assess the effects of an activity training programme on
      dizziness, imbalance, and level of independence in daily living activities in patients with
      chronic dizziness. 75 patients between 18-65 years of age who diagnosed chronic peripheral
      vestibular disorders and individuals with vestibular rehabilitation indications were included
      in our study. Patients were randomly divided into 3 groups consist of 25 patients as an
      activity group, exercise group, and control group. Education was given to each group. Ä°n
      addition, the activity group was performed a training activities program, the exercise group
      was performed in the Cawthorne-Cooksey exercises program. Therapy programs were prescribed
      once daily at home for 4 weeks. After demographic information was obtained from all patients,
      assessments were performed at the beginning and at the end of the treatment program (4
      weeks). Dizziness severity was assessed by the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), activities of daily
      livings were assessed by Vestibular Disorders Activity Questionnaire (VADL) and balance was
      assessed by Sensory Organization Testing (SOT).
