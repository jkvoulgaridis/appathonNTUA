      This trial evaluates if cryoablation will stimulate a local immune response by cluster of
      differentiation 8 positive (CD8+) cells which are not present in ablation naive regions of
      the tumors in patients with mesothelioma. Cryoablation uses extreme cold to damage or destroy
      tumor lesions. Mesothelioma is a rare cancer that grows and spreads quickly, and has low
      survival rates. The information learned from this study may provide evidence as to whether
      there is a measurable, local immune response from cryoablation. Studying samples of
      mesothelioma tissue in the laboratory from patients who have undergone biopsy may help
      doctors learn more about the effects of cryoablation on cells. It may also help doctors
      understand how well patients respond to treatment.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the simple hypothesis that cryoablation of mesothelioma will promote local
      tumor infiltration by cytotoxic cluster of differentiation 8 positive (CD8+) cells that will
      not be present in ablation naive regions of the tumors.

      II. To determine whether there is a preponderance of T cells in ablated tumor tissue in
      comparison to non-cryoablated tissue.

      OUTLINE:

      At the time of standard of care pleural biopsy, patients undergo cryoablation over 30
      minutes, then a sample of tissue from the ablated region and a non-ablated (tumor negative
      control) region are collected.

    <description>Subsequent fluorescence activated cell sorting for cluster of differentiation 4 positive (CD4+) and CD8+ markers will be performed to identify sub-populations of lymphocytes. The counts will be compared using a one-way paired t-test (two samples from each patient; ablated and non-ablated). The isolated cells will be frozen for potential subsequent use (if the hypothesis for the study is true then subsequent profiling of the cells will be performed, such whole exome sequencing (ribonucleic acid-sequencing) and metabolomic profiling).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adults that have been identified at tumor board with high suspicion for mesothelioma
