  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Perforated diverticulitis of the colon can be complicated by peritonitis, either purulent or
      fecal. Both are life threatening conditions requiring emergency surgery. The background in
      terms of reasons for inflammation (diverticulitis) and perforation to develop is unknown. In
      this study we focus on specific changes associated with inflammation, both in tissues and of
      fecal and mucosal microbiota.

      A prospective study of abdominal fluid, periferal blood, tissues as well as feces in Patients
      (perforated diverticulitis with peritonitis undergoing emergency surgery, Group I), and in
      Controls (patients operated due to colorectal cancer, Group II; patients with mild
      diverticulitis not needing surgery, Group III).

      Immune acitvity in abdominal fluid and periferal blood by immunoassay of 92 individual
      proteins. mRNA expression of 96 specific genes in tissue samples. Quatification of bacterial
      diversity in feces and colon mucosa.

        The aim is to study immune responses in patients with perforated divrticulitis leading to
        peritonitis and emergency surgery. This group will be compared with patients operated for
        colorectal cancer and patients with uncomplicated (mild) diverticulitis not undergoing
        surgery.
