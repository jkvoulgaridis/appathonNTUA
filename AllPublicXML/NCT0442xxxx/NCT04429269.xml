    <textblock>
      Improving the early diagnosis of breast cancer can reduce mortality. With mammography as the
      main tool for screening early breast cancer, the characteristics of dense breast and young
      onset of disease in Chinese women lowers the efficiency. The aim of this prospective study
      was to compare which method, x-ray or ultrasound, is more appropriate for screening and early
      diagnosis of breast cancer in Chinese women.

      Breast cancer has become the most common malignancy in women. Improving the early diagnosis
      of breast cancer can reduce mortality. Mammography is recommended as the main tool for
      screening and early diagnosis of breast cancer in the guidelines of European and American
      countries. However, the characteristics of dense breast and young onset of disease in Chinese
      women make the screening and early diagnosis strategies of Western countries, which are
      mainly based on mammography, unsuitable for Chinese women. The aim of this prospective study
      was to compare which method, x-ray or ultrasound, is more appropriate for screening and early
      diagnosis of breast cancer in Chinese women.
