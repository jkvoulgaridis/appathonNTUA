  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite implementing hospital quality programs after hip fracture surgery older adults often
      experience a decline in the level of physical function, reduced quality of life; and the
      mortality and readmission rates are high.

      Early mobilization is important in order to prevent loss of muscle mass; however to prevent
      morbidity an early start of strength training is also necessary. Furthermore, the risk of
      complications, morbidity, and mortality are associated with insufficient management of pain.

      The project aims to examine the effect of measuring vital signs and consistent rehabilitation
      in the primary and secondary sectors in older adults after hip fracture surgery.

      Method/ design:

      The study is a cluster-randomized stepped wedge study. Participants will be recruited among
      patients admitted to an orthogeriatric ward who are 65 years of age or older and citizens in
      one of three municipalities. Participants are also the health professionals in the
      orthogeriatric ward and the three municipalities.

      The three municipalities form five clusters, which are randomized, and every three-month one
      cluster cross from control to intervention.

      The study compares usual practice (control) to an intervention named 'Rehabilitation of
      Life'. An intervention best described as an empowerment-oriented cross-sectorial program
      including vital sign measurement and systematic progressive rehabilitation and combined with
      convenient access for collaboration among professionals.

      Primary outcome: Timed Up and Go (TUG) measured 2 months after the time of operation.

      The investigators hypothesize that 'Rehabilitation of Life' for older adults with a hip
      fracture will result in a significant reduced TUG-score in comparison to a practice not
      offering 'Rehabilitation of Life'
