  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nowadays, most assisted reproduction laboratories attempt to maintain as much as possible ex
      vivo culture conditions comparable to those in vivo. Various culturing condition such as
      temperature and pH parameters have been adjusted according to in vivo values in order to
      improve in-vitro fertilization (IVF) outcomes. Embryos of most mammals, including that of
      humans, are not exposed to oxygen concentration higher than 8%. Thus, embryos and gametes
      should be kept in a low oxygen environment during manipulation in assisted reproduction
      treatment.

      Culturing embryos in low oxygen concentrations is now a general practice in IVF laboratories.
      However, there are still laboratory procedures when the oocytes/embryos are exposed to
      atmospheric oxygen. In most laboratories, oocytes retrieval is performed under atmospheric
      oxygen concentration. Oocyte is very sensitive to environmental changes, for instance,
      transient cooling to room temperature can cause irreversible disruption of the meiotic
      spindle in human oocytes and oocyte in vitro maturation can lead to the decline of energy
      metabolism in human oocytes. Whether oocyte exposed to atmospheric oxygen during oocyte
      retrieval has detrimental effect on embryo development and IVF outcomes is unknown.

      Previous studies showed that low oxygen tension during embryo culture improved implantation
      rate and clinical outcomes, but embryo quality was not affected. In other studies, embryo
      quality was improved but overall pregnancy was not affected. The reason for the discrepancies
      could be because the oxygen tension during oocyte/embryo manipulation was not under well
      control. For instance, oocyte retrieval, fertilization check and embryo grading were
      performed under atmospheric oxygen. It is difficult to predict how these factors negatively
      impact the IVF outcomes.

      In this project, the investigators hypothesize that lower oxygen tension during oocyte/embryo
      manipulation improves IVF outcomes.

      In the experimental group, oocyte pickup will be performed in a lower oxygen tension
      environment (5% oxygen, 89% nitrogen, 6% carbon dioxide); oocyte pickup will be performed in
      a special workstation with reduced oxygen tension environment while fertilization check and
      embryo grading will be performed in conventional and time lapse embryo culture system. The
      time lapse culture system can provide a constant lower oxygen tension culture environment to
      the embryos. In the control group, oocyte pickup, fertilization check and embryo grading will
      be performed in atmospheric oxygen environment. Under this arrangement, the difference
      between the 2 groups is the oxygen tension during oocyte/embryo manipulation. The
      investigators believe that a solid conclusion can be drawn about whether lower oxygen tension
      environment can benefit IVF outcomes.
