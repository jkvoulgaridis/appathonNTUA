    <textblock>
      Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) is currently a standard procedure for a wide
      range of blood-oncological diseases and genetic disorders. Recent improvements in transplant
      technologies, infection prevention and graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) management procedures
      have significantly reduced the transplant-related mortality (TRM). However, approximately 50%
      of pediatric patients may develop liver dysfunction before HSCT and 74% to 85.5% after HSCT,
      with a TRM related to liver dysfunction reaching 46%. The liver and pancreas complications
      still remain too high for the difficulties and diagnostic inefficiencies and, consequently,
      for the lack of targeted and safer therapies. The diagnostic problems can be summarized in 3
      major points: a) the histological examination of liver and pancreas parenchyma cannot be
      routinely performed because of the organ anatomy and the relative risk of the bioptic
      procedures; b) the lack of specific biomarkers or advanced imaging techniques appropriate for
      the diagnosis of HSCT complications; c) the multifactorial causes of organ complications, as
      well as drug toxicities, GVHD, siderosis, ductopenia (considered as an index of hepatic
      GVHD), the accumulation of potentially toxic substances favored by siderosis and ductopenia.
      In more than 50% of HSCT patients, siderosis and/or ductopenia may represent common
      pathological conditions. Furthermore, international guidelines issued by onco-hematology and
      transplantation scientific societies recommend a chelating treatment with deferasirox in all
      hematological and oncological patients undergoing an intense transfusion regimen. However, in
      the presence of siderosis and marked ductopenia, patients receiving deferasirox may
      experience both severe renal and hematological toxicities and lack of effectiveness of the
      chelating treatment.

      Therefore, the principal aim of the present retrospective study will be the evaluation of the
      transplant-related mortality (TRM) in patients requiring a chelation treatment according to
      the Italian guidelines in pediatric patients

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present retrospective study will be conducted at the Bone Marrow Transplant Center, IRCCS
      Burlo Garofolo, Trieste, Italy. All pediatric patients who underwent one or more allogeneic
      HSCTs between 2010 and 2018 will be enrolled according to inclusion/exclusion criteria.

      The following data will be collected in a retrospective manner:

        -  Data on the underlying disease (diagnosis, therapeutic protocol, transfusion regimen,
           possible relapses, type of transplant, conditioning regimen, infectious complications,
           immunosuppressive treatment, including use of steroids);

        -  Pre-transplant liver and pancreatic function, as well as quantification of iron content
           by nuclear magnetic resonance (MRI);

        -  Pre-transplant histological evaluation of liver parenchyma in case of pre-existing liver
           disease;

        -  Post-transplant liver and pancreatic function and the evaluation of parenchymal
           accumulation of Fe+;

        -  Length and doses of DFX treatment, and corresponding drug plasma concentrations as per
           routine drug monitoring protocols;

        -  Treatment tolerability according to CTC-AE grading V5.0, November 27, 2017 The
           post-transplant data will be collected within 2 years from HSCT (or the last HSCT when
           more than one).

      The data entered in an appropriate anonymous database will be processed by descriptive
      statistics and uni- multivariate statistical analyses according to study endpoints. DFX
      plasma concentrations will be analyzed by means of to a nonlinear mixed effect modeling
      approach to elaborate a population pharmacokinetic (POP/PK) model. POP/PK findings will be
      further analyzed together with clinical and laboratory data.
