  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Binge eating disorder (BED) is a common and disabling eating disorder (ED) which has
      significant effects on psychological wellbeing, physical health, and quality of life. Talking
      therapies, most notably cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), are presently recommended for the
      treatment of BED. However, outcomes from treatment are inadequate. Therefore, there is a need
      for development of new treatments.

      This study aims to investigate the feasibility of combining Attention Bias Modification
      Training (ABMT) and Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) to reduce binge-eating
      behaviour and craving for food in people with BED.

      ABMT is a computerised training that seeks to alter responses towards food that people are
      not consciously aware of. During ABMT, participants are trained to 'look towards' low-calorie
      food and 'look away' from high-calorie food. TDCS is a safe, well tolerated, non-invasive
      form of brain stimulation which is suitable for supervised self-administration. It stimulates
      specific brain areas using a mild electrical current (2 mA) via small electrodes placed on
      the scalp. In this study, participants will be randomly allocated to receive either ABMT with
      real tDCS or ABMT with sham tDCS. ABMT and real/sham tDCS will be delivered simultaneously,
      i.e. participants will engage in ABM training whilst receiving tDCS. All participants will be
      remotely supervised by the study researcher for the duration of each treatment session.

      Biological male and female adults (aged 18-60) of any gender will be eligible to take part if
      they have a DSM-V of BED and they are overweight or obese.

      Taking part will involve completing 10 sessions of combined ABMT and real or sham tDCS over
      2-3 weeks. Binge frequency, food craving and other outcomes will be measured at the start of
      the study, end of the study, and at the 6-week follow-up.

    <measure>Achievement of a 'steady state' of recruitment</measure>
    <time_frame>Start of Recruitment to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Recruitment rate/month over months will be assessed to demonstrate that recruitment targets for the main trial can be met within an adequate time-frame. An average of 3 patients per month must be recruited (randomised) over a consecutive 12 month period (a minimum of 36 patients) in order to demonstrate a 'steady state' of recruitment.</description>

    <measure>Eating Disorder Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 week follow up (on average, 8 weeks after baseline assessment)</time_frame>
    <description>The Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q) will be used to assess eating disorders symptoms. The EDE-Q is a 36-item self-report quesitonnaire, and a higher global score indicates more severe eating disorder symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Craving for food</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 week follow up (on average, 8 weeks after baseline assessment)</time_frame>
    <description>The Food Craving Questionnaire (FCQ) will be used to assess trait-level craving for food. Total scores can range between 15 and 90, with higher scores indicating more frequent and intense food cravings.</description>

    <measure>General psychopathology</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 week follow up (on average, 8 weeks after baseline assessment)</time_frame>
    <description>The Depression, Anxiety and Stress- Scale (DASS-21) is a 21-item self-report questionnaire which aims to evaluate mood, anxiety and stress levels over the previous week. Sum scores for the total DASS range between 0 and 120, with higher scores indicating more severe psychopathology. Sub-scales assess depression, anxiety and stress symptoms specifically, and scores range from 0 to 42, with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Food related attention</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 week follow up (on average, 8 weeks after baseline assessment)</time_frame>
    <description>The Food Attention Network Task (Food-ANT) will be used to assess three components of attention (i.e. orienting, alerting and executive function) using food (low- and high-calorie) versus non-food pictures (neutral items). Change in reaction time will be used to assess change in orienting, alerting and executive function.</description>

    <measure>Attention Bias for Food</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 week follow up (on average, 8 weeks after baseline assessment)</time_frame>
    <description>The Visual Probe Task (VP) will be used to assess visuo-spatial attention biases for food cues. Change in dwell time measured by eye tracking and reaction time will be used to assess change in attention bias for food cues.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Working Memory</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to post treatment (on average 18 days after baseline assessment)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants are presented with a continuous stream of stimuli (either faces or words), and for every stimulus, the participant must indicate (yes/no) whether or not the current stimulus is the same as the one presented three trials back. This is known as the N-Back and is a measure of working memory. Higher numbers of correct responses indicates superior working memory function.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Face Affective Go/No Go</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to post treatment (on average 18 days after baseline assessment)</time_frame>
    <description>Neuropsychological task measuring information processing biases for positive and negative facial expressions. The participant is told a target emotion and asked to press a button only when the target emotion is present. The task consists of six blocks, each of which presents a series of faces showing either the target emotion or a differently valenced distractor. Reaction times are calculated for correct responses for each condition. Affective bias scores are calculated by subtracting the sad target/happy distractor condition reaction time from the happy target/sad distractor condition reaction time.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cognitive Flexibility</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to post treatment (on average 18 days after baseline assessment)</time_frame>
    <description>In Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) participants are asked to sort 64 cards to match either color (red, blue, yellow, or green), form (crosses, circles, triangles, or stars), or number of figures (one, two, three, four). During the task, the sorting rule changes discreetly from color to form or number of figures without the participants being informed. The participants have to shift sets accordingly and sort cards following the new sorting rule. Set shifting difficulties are indicated by preservative errors; thus, higher scores on this test represent poorer cognitive flexibility.</description>
