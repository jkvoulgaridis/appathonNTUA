    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to assess the feasibility, safety and efficacy of
      PSMA-specific CAR-T cell therapy in patients with PSMA positive tumor. Another goal of the
      study is to learn more about the function of the PSMA CAR-T cells and their persistency in
      the patients.

    <textblock>
      Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is expressed in normal prostate and is upregulated
      in prostate tumor. Therefore, PSMA is a promising target for antigen-specific immunotherapy
      in patients with prostate cancer. However, it has been reported that PSMA expression is not
      restricted to prostate cancer and PSMA is often enriched in the tumor stromal environment. By
      immunostaining, we found that PSMA is expressed in a variety of solid tumors, including brain
      tumor, neuroblastoma and some lymphoma tumor tissues.

      This study aims to use T cells obtained directly from the patient, which can be genetically
      modified to express PSMA-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR). The CAR molecules enable
      the T cells to recognize and kill tumor cells or tumor stromal tissues through the
      recognition of a surface antigen, PSMA. This study will evaluate the side effects and the
      best dose of anti-PSMA CAR-T cells to target PSMA positive tumors and tumor microenvironment.

             be non-respectable, metastatic, progressive or recurrent.

          2. The expression status of PSMA antigens in the tumor tissue will be determined for
             eligibility. Positive expression is defined by PMSA antibody staining results based on
             immunohistochemistry or flow cytometry analyses.

          3. Body weight greater than or equal to 10 kg.
