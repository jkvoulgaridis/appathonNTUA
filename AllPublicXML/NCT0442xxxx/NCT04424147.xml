  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up Until now, there is not well acepted treatment for relapsed/refractory (rr) acute myeloid
      luekemia (AML), which has low complete response and poor survival. According to different
      guildlines, clinical trial is the first choice for the treatment of rrAML. High expression of
      BCL-2 and hypermethylation are very important factors for drug resistance in AML. Lots of
      studies have reported combination of BCL-2 inhibitor with hypomethylating agents (HMA) showed
      a promising efficacy in elder or unfit patients with newly diagnosed AML, however, presented
      not that exciting curing effect in rrAML. It is known that overexpression of MCL-1 and BCL-XL
      is the main reason for leukemia cells being resistant to BCL2 inhibitors. Since
      Homoharringtonine (HHT) could downregulate MCL-1 and BCL-XL in leukemia cells, there might be
      a synergic effect for combination of BCL-2 inhibitors with HHT, which has been proven in the
      treatment of lymphoma. Yet, there is not a report for the use of this combination in AML. In
      this single arm multi-centers prospective study, adult patients with rrAML are included and
      treated with BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax at a dose of 400mg per day for 14 days, combined with
      azacitidine (AZA) at a dose of 75mg/m2 per day for 7 days, and HHT 1mg/m2 per day for 7 days,
      and then the eficacy and safety of HVA regimens as salvage treatment in rrAML are assessed.
