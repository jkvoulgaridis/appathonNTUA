      Acutus Medical's AcQBlate Force Ablation Catheter when used in combination with the Qubic
      Force Sensing Module (AcQBlate Force System), is indicated for cardiac electrophysiological
      mapping, delivery of diagnostic pacing stimuli, and radiofrequency ablation of sustained or
      recurrent atrial arrhythmias.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female between the ages of 18 to 80 years at time of consent.

          -  Clinically indicated and scheduled for a de novo or repeat catheter ablation of PAF or
             PerAF

          -  Willing and able to provide written informed consent to to participate in the study
             and agree to comply with all follow-up visits and evaluations for the duration of the
             study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  In the opinion of the investigator, any contraindication to the planned atrial
             ablation, including anticoagulation contraindications or sepsis

          -  Continuous AF &gt; 12-months (long-standing persistent AF)

          -  Atrial arrhythmias secondary to electrolyte imbalance, thyroid disease, or any other
             reversible or non-cardiac cause.

          -  An implanted pacemaker or Implantable Cardiac Defibrillator (ICD).

          -  Structural heart disease or cardiac history as described below:

          -  Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt; 35% based on transthoracic echocardiogram
             (TTE) within the previous 180-days.

          -  Left atrial size &gt; 55 mm based on TTE within the previous 180-days.

          -  Evidence of heart failure (NYHA Class III or IV).

          -  Previous cardiac surgery, ventriculotomy, or atriotomy (excluding atriotomy for

          -  Pregnant or lactating (current or anticipated during study follow up).

          -  Current enrollment in any other study protocol where testing or results from the study
             may interfere with the procedure or outcome measurements for this study.

          -  Any other condition that, in the judgment of the investigator, makes the patient a
             poor candidate for this procedure, the study or compliance with the protocol (includes
             vulnerable patient population, mental illness, addictive disease, terminal illness
             with a life expectancy of less than two years, extensive travel away from the research
             center)
