  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to find Electroencephalogram (EEG) biomarkers to predict transcranial
      direct current stimulation (tDCS) response in obsessive-compulsive disorder.

      The purpose of this study is to explore resting state electroencephalography and transcranial
      magnetic stimulation and electroencephalography (TMS-EEG) biomarkers that would predict
      transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) response in obsessive-compulsive disorder with
      cathode electrode targeting orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). 30 OCD patients will be recruited to
      this study and performed once a day, five times a week direct current stimulation treatment
      for two weeks. The investigators will assess symptom severity before and after two weeks of
      tDCS. Through the study, Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale（Y-BOCS）, the Obsessive
      Compulsive Inventory-Revised (OCI-R), the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), Pittsburgh
      sleep quality index (PSQI)and side-effect questionnaire will be obtained by a trained
      investigator. Resting state electroencephalography and TMS-EEG testing will be conducted
      before and after tDCS treatment.

    <measure>Change in symptom improvement assessed by the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>It assesses the severity of OCD symptoms. The Y-BOCS scale ranges from 0 to 40, with 0 being no symptoms and 40 being severe.The responder on Y-BOCS is defined as a Y-BOCS decrease at least 35% from the baseline at post-treatment.</description>

    <measure>Change in long-interval intracortical inhibition (LICI) and short interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) measured by TMS-EEG</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>LICI and SICI are TMS-EEG paradigm to assess the extent of cortical inhibition. LICI and SICI will be measured using single and paired TMS pulses applied to the OFC. LICI and SICI will be compared between before and after treatment.</description>

    <measure>EEG biomarkers as predictors of response to tDCS</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>LICI and SICI measured by TMS-EEG and resting state EEG will be performed to investigate predictors of response to tDCS in OCD patients.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Obsessive Compulsive Inventory-Revised(OCI-R)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>It is an inventory of OCD symptoms with 18 items that are rated on a 5-point Likert scale. Total scores range from 0 to 72, with higher scores indicating more severe OCD symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in The Beck Depression Inventory-II(BDI-II)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>It consists of 21 items and uses a 0 to 3 severity scale. Total scores range from 0 to 63, with higher scores indicating more severe depression symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in The Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>It is an inventory of anxiety symptoms with 18 items that are rated on a 5-point Likert scale(0 to 4). Total scores range from 0 to 72, with higher scores indicating more severe anxiety symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Pittsburgh sleep quality index(PSQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) contains 19 self-rated questions which measures seven aspects of sleep: (1) subjective sleep quality, (2) sleep latency, (3) sleep duration, (4) habitual sleep efficiency, (5) sleep disturbances, (6) use of sleeping medication, and (7) daytime dysfunction. The 19 self-rated items are combined to form seven component scores, each of which has a range of 0-3 points (0 indicates no difficulty, while 3 indicates severe difficulty). The seven component scores are then summed to yield one global score, with a range of 0-21 points (0 indicating no difficulty, and 21 indicating severe difficulties in all the seven areas of sleep quality).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Side-effect questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>It consists of 10-item and uses 0 to 3 severity scale to rate the intensity of side effects. Total scores range from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating more severe side-effect. It also assesses the relation between side-effect and the effects of tDCS using 0 to 4 scale. Total scores range from 0 to 40, with higher score indicating the greater relation.</description>
