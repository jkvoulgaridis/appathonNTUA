  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is the most commonly diagnosed
      neurobehavioral disorder in childhood. Children with ADHD struggle in school due to problems
      with attention and high levels of impulsivity and hyperactivity. They are at substantially
      increased risk for long-term difficulties into adulthood, including academic
      underachievement, substance abuse, and criminal behavior. The diagnosis of ADHD, which is
      based on subjective ratings by parents and teachers, likely results from multiple different,
      overlapping differences in circuits of the brain responsible for attention and impulse
      control. However, we do not have any scientific or clinical tests that allow us to understand
      these circuits. In an effort to improve ADHD outcomes, we have used a technology called
      Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) to identify highly reliable measurements of brain
      function. We have identified two very promising measures that are abnormal in children with
      ADHD and, importantly, also predict the severity of ADHD behaviors. The goal of this project
      is to determine if these two TMS measurements could be used to help better guide ADHD
      treatment. To do this, we will perform three investigations in 8 to 12 year old children to
      determine: 1) test-retest reliability; 2) pharmacologic responsiveness; and 3) correlations
      with two domains of function relevant to ADHD: &quot;Cognitive Control&quot; and &quot;Emotional Valence.&quot;
      Through these investigations, we aim to determine whether these two TMS brain measures are
      reliable and meaningful enough to be used to help improve precision of individually-targeted
      and effective ADHD treatments.
