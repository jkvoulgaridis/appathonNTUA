             local advanced, recurrent or metastatic patients who could not be treated surgically.
             Note: ① the diagnosis result of NSCLC based on sputum cytology needs to be confirmed
             by immunohistochemistry; ② the current disease should be treated by radiotherapy as
             the first choice The subjects whose treatment strategy or follow-up target focus
             judged by the researchers should take radiotherapy as the first treatment strategy
             should not be selected.

             metastatic NSCLC.

          4. According to the method of second-generation sequencing, L858R point mutation in exon
             21 of EGFR gene was found in primary NSCLC with or without any other coexisting
             mutations.

          5. Within 28 days before randomization, at least one measurable lesion was selected
             according to the RECIST v1.1 standard (see Appendix 1); for the lesions that had
