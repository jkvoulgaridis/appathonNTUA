      Background:

      Parkinson Disease (PD) is a nervous system disorder that affects movement. Dopamine is an
      important neurotransmitter in the brain. As PD progresses, there is less and less dopamine in
      the brain. Researchers think there may be a relationship between differences in attention and
      dopamine in people with PD.

      Objective:

      To learn if people with PD that is worse on one side also have differences in how much
      attention they pay to the two sides of space on their left and right.

      Eligibility:

      English-speaking, right-handed people age 35-80 with PD.

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with medical and neurological history and exam, and medicine
      review.

      Participants will have 1 study visit. It will last 7-8 hours. They will stop taking their
      Parkinson medicine 12 hours before the visit.

      Participants will complete questionnaires.

      Participants will do tasks on a computer screen. They will judge the middle of lines, react
      to stimuli, and search and identify items that appear on the screen.

      Participants may have functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI uses a
      strong magnetic field and radio waves to take pictures of the brain. During the MRI,
      participants will lie on a table that slides in and out of the MRI scanner. While inside the
      scanner, they will look at a cross on a screen, relax, and think about nothing.

      Participants will undergo prism adaptation. They will sit in front of a board while their
      chin rests on a support. They will point to 1 of 2 dots on the board while they wear prism
      glasses that shift their vision to the left or right.

      Study Description:

      We will investigate the relationship between Dopamine (DA) function and attention in patients
      with asymmetric Parkinson Disease (PD). We hypothesize that the direction of asymmetry in
      dopamine (DA) depletion predicts the asymmetry in visual attention.

      Objectives:

      Primary Objective:

      - to study attentional asymmetry in patients with PD. We hypothesize that visual attention in
      Parkinson will be biased to the visual field contralateral to the least affected hemisphere
      (i.e. contralateral to the most affected side).

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  to investigate the correlation between feedback learning and visuospatial attention
           performance in PD. We hypothesize that feedback learning will also be affected according
           to the most compromised hemisphere. Right hemisphere-predominant PD patients (left-motor
           predominant), compared to left hemisphere-predominant patients, will exhibit a rightward
           visuospatial bias and a relative preference for learning from reward, compared to
           punishment.

        -  to investigate the effect of prism adaptation on feedback learning and visuospatial
           attention in PD. This objective is exploratory.

      Endpoints:

      Primary Endpoint: visuospatial performance on the Landmark Task

      Secondary Endpoints: performance on:

        -  Posner Task

        -  Visual Search Task

        -  Attentional blink Task

        -  Visuospatial performance on the Manual Line Bisection Task

        -  Reward and Punishment Implicit Feedback Learning Task

        -  The Attentional Scaling Task

      Functional connectivity measured with resting state fMRI.

      Study Population:

      Sixty patients with asymmetric PD. Any gender, aged 35-80 (inclusive), able to give consent
      and without a diagnosis of significant illness affecting the central nervous system other
      than PD.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Any current major neurological or psychiatric disorder other than Parkinson s disease,
             such as, (but not limited to) stroke, dementia, Alzheimer disease, Schizophrenia or
             Major Depression Disorder

          2. Inability to provide consent

          3. Members of the Behavioral Neurology Unit, NINDS

          4. Left-handed per the Edinburgh Handedness scale

          5. Primarily axial motor symptoms or symmetrical limb involvement

          6. Pregnancy

          7. Exclusion criteria for MRI

               -  Presence of metal which would make having an MRI scan unsafe, such as pacemakers,
                  stimulators, pumps, aneurysm clips, metallic prostheses, artificial heart valves,
                  cochlear implants or shrapnel fragments, or if subject was a welder or metal
                  worker, since small metal fragments may be present in the eye.

               -  Claustrophobia

               -  Inability to lie supine comfortably for 1 hour

               -  Pregnancy

        INCLUSION OF VULNERABLE PARTICIPANTS:

        Because the goals of the study can be accomplished without involving vulnerable population,
        we will not include individuals without consent capacity.

        Since the goal is to characterize visuospatial attention deficits in idiopathic PD which is
        a disease of late adulthood, we will not include children.

        The effects of MRI on fetal development and the health of pregnant women is unknown.

        Therefore, women who are pregnant and breast-feeding will be excluded and women who can
        become pregnant will be excluded following a positive pregnancy test, if the optional MRI
        is under consideration.

        The study requires fluency in English in order to completely understand tasks instructions,
        thus non-English speakers/readers will be excluded.
