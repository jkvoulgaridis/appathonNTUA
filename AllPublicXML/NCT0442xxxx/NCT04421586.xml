  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand why parents do or do not vaccinate their children
      and explore what information parents need to vaccinate their children. The study will test
      whether information about vaccinations provided during pregnancy by a health provider (VISTA
      intervention) may improve the possibility that a child is vaccinated on time.
