  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare treatment of sebaceous hyperplasia with pulsed dye
      laser (PDL) plus neodymium doped yttrium aluminum garnet laser (Nd:YAG) versus erbium doped
      yttrium aluminum garnet (erbium:YAG) laser versus electrodesiccation and curettage (ED&amp;C).

      This is a randomized clinical trial. Approximately 18 participants will enrolled. Each
      participant will have their sebaceous hyperplasia lesions randomized to receive either
      Erbium:YAG, PDL plus Nd:YAG, or ED&amp;C treatment. Solitary lesions will be randomized to a
      group, thus, a patient may receive all three treatments, each on different lesions. Lesions
      will be treated twice, 2-6 weeks after the first treatment. Lesion size and count will be
      measured before treatment and at follow-up 4-12 weeks after the first treatment. This study
      is a pilot study designed to determine the feasibility of these procedures.

      Subjects currently living in the Chicago metropolitan area and meet inclusion/exclusion
      criteria will be considered for enrollment.
