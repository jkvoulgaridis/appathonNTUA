    <measure>Mindfulness</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Mindfulness is assessed using the Mindfulness Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS) consisting of 15 items. Higher scores reflect higher levels of dispositional mindfulness. The scale has been validated in college, working adult, and cancer patient populations (Brown and Ryan, 2003). The scale range was changed from 1-6 to 1-7 when adapted and added into the LIFE XT personal health assessment.</description>

    <measure>Stress</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Stress is assessed using 4 items from the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). The PSS has demonstrated internal consistency and validity (Cohen, 1983). The PSS asks respondents to indicate how often they felt or thought a certain way during a specified time period (i.e., over the last 2 weeks). Examples of items include, &quot;how often have you felt that you were unable to control the important things in your life,&quot; and &quot;how often have you felt that things were going your way.&quot; The sale range was changed from 1-5 to 1-7 when adapted and added into the LIFE XT personal health assessment. Higher scores reflect higher levels of perceived stress.</description>

    <measure>Energy</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Energy (or vitality) is assessed using the Short-Form-36 (SP-36) which consists of 36 items to assess vitality. Higher scores reflect higher levels of vitality. The SP-36 inspired the question, &quot;During the past month, how often did you experience the following?&quot; in the LIFE XT assessment. The questionnaire asks this question about four items: felt full of pep, felt tired, had a lot energy and felt worn out. Each of these questions is on a scale from 1-7, for a total of 28 points and a higher score reflecting higher energy levels.</description>

It has been validated in patients with major depressive disorder (Lam et al.). The scale range was changed from 0-4</description>
