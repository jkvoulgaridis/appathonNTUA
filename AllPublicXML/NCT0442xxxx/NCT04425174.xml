    <textblock>
      Regional anesthesia is commonly used in major surgeries in combination with general
      anesthesia to ensure adequate postoperative analgesia for the patients and decrease the
      consumption of systemic analgesic intraoperative and postoperative.

      Epidural analgesia is a gold standard analgesic technique for the majority of abdominal
      surgeries, yet it has some limitations in some surgeries as colorectal surgeries due to
      delayed ambulation due to muscular weakness and postural hypotension.

      Quadratus Lumborum (QL) block is a new technique for analgesia of the abdominal wall muscles.
      Its mechanism depends on the injection of the local anesthetic agent between the abdominal
      wall muscles into the thoracolumbar fascia surrounding the Quadratus Lumborum muscle by
      ultrasound (US) guided technique. Three approaches are identified depending on the injection
      sites namely, lateral, posterior, and anterior approaches. The analgesic agent spreads to the
      thoracic paravertebral space to anesthetize the thoracolumbar nerves, and the thoracic
      sympathetic trunk supplying the anterior abdominal wall and the abdominal viscera.

      QL block has the advantage of producing extensive sensory block leading to adequate
      postoperative analgesia and a decrease in narcotic consumption. A lot of researches studied
      its role and effectiveness in major abdominal surgeries.

      The abdominal surgeries carry a lot of complications postoperatively, one of them is acute
      kidney injury (AKI). 40% of the hospitalized cases diagnosed as AKI was due to surgery. The
      incidence of AKI postoperatively is variable depending on the surgical setting and type of
      surgery. General surgeries account for the second type of surgeries which carry a risk for
      AKI (13.2%) while cardiac surgeries are considered the first type carries the risk for AKI
      (18.7%).

      Multiple risk factors for the incidence of AKI were identified and classified into general
      factors and factors related to the surgery. The general factors include for example male
      gender, high body mass index (BMI), diabetes, hypertension, pre-existing chronic kidney
      disease, and the prolonged use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI). While the
      surgical related factors include the use of diuretics, vasopressors, Intra-operative
      hemodynamics instabilities, large colloid infusion, and intra-operative blood transfusion.

      AKI as a post-operative complication occurred secondary to multiple complex factors. The
      major of these factors are fluid depletion which may occur either pre or intra-operatively
      and neuroendocrine response to anesthesia and surgery itself. The hypoperfusion leads to
      renal arteriolar changes trying to keep the glomerular filtration rate within a normal range.
      Also, the sympathetic effects of the neuroendocrine hormones lead to renal vasoconstriction
      aiming to re-distribute the blood to the medulla but instead, it actually leads to renal
      ischemia.

      Renal doppler is a bedside non-invasive technique that can assess the renal blood flow
      reflecting renal perfusion. Renal resistive index (RI) is one of the parameters which can be
      measured during the doppler study reflecting the degree of the renal vascular resistance. RI
      obtained by renal doppler can assess the modifications and changes that occurred in renal
      flow.

      In this study, the investigators aim to assess the analgesic efficacy of QL block compared to
      the epidural anesthesia and to study the effect of each of them on postoperative kidney
      function and renal flow using renal doppler.

      -  Study place: Ain Shams University Hospitals.

        -  Written informed consent will be taken from all patients.

        -  Inclusion criteria: 60 patients with an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA)
           physical status I-III and those aged between 35 and 65 years scheduled for colorectal
           surgeries.

        -  Exclusion criteria: patients with serious cardio-cerebral vascular diseases,
           neurological disorders, bleeding disorders as QL block is a deep block, allergies to
           local anesthetics (LAs), infection at the puncture site, body mass index (BMI)&gt; 35kg/m2,
           history of mental illness, and patients who will not consent to the procedure.

      The selected patients will be randomized and allocated using a computer assessed automated
      method (www.randomizer.org) dividing them into two study groups. The control group (EP) will
      receive epidural anesthesia while the other group of patients (QL) will receive a QL block.

      Patient preparation: patients will be asked to fast for 8 hours with full clinical and
      laboratory results will be checked for any exclusion criteria with special concerns regarding
      the laboratory kidney function. Renal doppler will also be done for all patients within 12
      hours pre-operatively measuring renal flow peak systolic velocity (PSV) and renal resistive
      index (RI).

      Inside the operating room (OR), the patient will lie in a supine position with the
      application of the standard monitoring including electrocardiogram (ECG), oxygen saturation
      (SpO2), non-invasive blood pressure, and end-tidal carbon dioxide (ET Co2) using capnogram. A
      peripheral wide bore cannula will be inserted followed by ringer lactate solution infusion at
      a rate of 8 ml/kg. Premedication will be given in the form of 0.05 mg/kg Midazolam. Induction
      of anesthesia will be performed by 2 μg/kg Fentanyl, 2 mg/kg Propofol, and 0.5 mg/kg
      atracurium. This will be followed by the application of the endotracheal tube to start
      mechanical ventilation which will be adjusted to obtain end-tidal CO2 in the range of 35-45
      mmHg. The anesthesia maintenance will be done by using 1.5% isoflurane and oxygen and top up
      atracurium 0.5 mg/kg every 20 min. Radial artery invasive blood pressure monitoring will be
      initiated and the internal jugular central venous line will be inserted for central venous
      pressure monitoring. A urinary catheter will be inserted for urinary output volume
      assessment.

      Intraoperative analgesia will be given if the patients show an increase in the blood pressure
      or heart rate more than 20% of the basal values in the form of IV fentanyl 1 μg/kg.
      Continuous ECG, blood pressure and pulse saturation will be monitored. Fluid input, fluid
      output (urine and third space loss), blood loss, and central venous pressure will be recorded
      to ensure adequate fluid balance.

      At the end of the surgery, isoflurane will be discontinued and the residual neuromuscular
      block will be reversed by atropine 0.02 mg/kg and neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg. After the regaining
      of spontaneous breathing, extubation will be done when the patient is fully awake.

      Epidural analgesia: will be performed after the induction of general anesthesia by a
      well-experienced anesthesiologist. The patients will be turned in the left lateral decubitus
      position and after complete skin asepsis and draping, an 18 G Tuohy epidural needle will be
      inserted in the intervertebral space T10-T11 with Vaccum catheter aspiration technique
      followed by insertion of an epidural catheter. The epidural will be activated at the end of
      the surgery seeking to compare it versus QL as postoperative analgesia. A continuous epidural
      will be achieved by using 0.125% bupivacaine at a rate of 6 ml/hour.

      QL block application: Bilateral US-guided QL block using the anterior approach will be
      applied at the end of surgery by a well-experienced anesthesiologist. The patient will be
      adjusted in a lateral position. Sterilization will be done then a curve-linear probe (3.5
      MHZ) will be applied below the level of the 12th rib at the level of the posterior axillary
      line and adjusted till visualization of the QL muscle, Psoas major muscle (PM), and erector
      spine muscle (ES). A 22 gauge needle will be inserted under visualization of the US anterior
      to QL muscle till the space between QL muscle and PM muscle. Aspiration will be done to
      confirm the absence of blood. Confirmation of the correct site will be done by injection of
      saline (hydro dissection). We will inject 25 ml of 0.25% bupivacaine on each side

      Postoperative study parameters: The patients will be transferred to the intensive care unit
      (ICU) for continuous close 24 hours observation. 10-points Visual analog scale (VAS) will be
      used for pain assessment with 0 equal no pain while 10 represents the worst pain. The
      following parameters will be assessed:

        -  Time for the first morphine dose requirement and the 24 hours cumulative morphine
           consumption will be recorded as the primary outcome. Morphine will be given in a dose of
           0.05 mg/kg when the VAS score is more than 4.

        -  Postoperative kidney function will be assessed using laboratory and US doppler indices
           to be compared with the preoperative values as a secondary outcome. The laboratory tests
           will include serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and compared with
           pre-operative values.

      Renal doppler: An experienced blinded radiologist will perform the renal doppler using a 3.5
      MHz probe. The renal Doppler study will be done for both groups preoperatively and
      postoperatively. The patients will lie supine or in lateral positions. The US probe will be
      applied to the anterior or midaxillary line with the probe in transverse direction till
      adequate visualization of the kidney. Color and pulse wave doppler will be applied to assess
      the intra-renal and main renal arteries. The intra-renal arteries assessment will be repeated
      at upper, mid, and lower pole levels of each kidney. The peak systolic velocity (PSV), and
      resistive index (RI) of the main renal artery bilaterally will be measured. Also, the mean RI
      of the three measurements of the intra-renal artery RI will be calculated. The normal RI is
      considered when a value &lt; 0.7.

      Sample size calculation:

      Using the PASS 11 program for sample size calculation and according to Aditianingsih et
      al.,2019. The expected cumulative dose of morphine consumption over 24 hours postoperatively
      in study groups = 3 ± 0.32 mg and 4 ± 0.2 mg, the sample size of 30 patients/group can detect
      this difference with power 100% and alpha error 0.05.
