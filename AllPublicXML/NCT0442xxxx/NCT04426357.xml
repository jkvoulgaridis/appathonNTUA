      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of JNJ-64417184,
      JNJ-68294291, and JNJ-65201526 after a single oral dose of JNJ-64417184 in adult participants
      with various degrees of impaired renal function (moderate [optional], severe renal
      impairment, and end stage renal disease (ESRD) not requiring hemodialysis) compared to
      participants with normal renal function.

    <description>AUC (0-infinity) is defined as area under the plasma analyte concentration time curve from time 0 to infinite time, calculated as AUC (last) plus C(last)/(lambda)z, where C (last) is the last observed measurable (non-BQL) plasma analyte concentration; extrapolations of more than 20 percent (%) of the total AUC (that is, percent AUC (infinity), extrapolations greater than [&gt;] 20%) are reported as approximations of JNJ-64417184 and its metabolites (JNJ-68294291 and JNJ-65201526).</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants with normal renal function:

        must have normal renal function defined as: estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)
        greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 90 milliliter per minute per 1.73 meter square (mL/min/1.73
        m^2 (calculated by the modification of diet in renal disease [MDRD] formula)

          -  Healthy on the basis of physical examination, medical and surgical history, and vital
             signs performed at screening. If there are abnormalities, the participant may be
             included only if the investigator judges the abnormalities to be not clinically
             significant or to be appropriate and reasonable for the population under study. This
             determination must be recorded in the participant's source documents and initialed by
             the investigator

          -  Participants with moderate or severe renal impairment:

        must meet the following additional inclusion criteria to be enrolled in the study: must be
        otherwise healthy except for the renal impairment and its underlying disease states and
        mild comorbidities and participant must be medically stable on the basis of physical
        examination, medical history, vital signs, 12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG), and clinical
        laboratory tests performed at screening. If there are abnormalities or results outside the
        normal reference ranges, the participant may be included only if the investigator judges
        the abnormalities or deviations from normal to be not clinically significant or to be
        appropriate and reasonable for the population under study. This determination must be
        recorded in the participant's source documents and initialed by the investigator

          -  Participants with end stage renal disease (ESRD): must have a hematocrit at screening
             of greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 30 percent (%)

          -  Must not smoke more than 10 cigarettes or 2 cigars or 2 pipes per day from within 3
             months prior to screening until the end of the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of any illness (unrelated to renal impairment or its underlying disease, as
             appropriate) that, in the opinion of the investigator, might confound the results of
             the study or pose an additional risk in administering study drug to the participant.
             This may include but is not limited to history of relevant drug or food allergies,
             history of cardiovascular or central nervous system disease, history or presence of
             clinically significant pathology, chronic skin disease, or history of mental disease

          -  Known allergies, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to JNJ-64417184 or any of its
             excipients

          -  Past history of clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias (example, extrasystole,
             tachycardia at rest), history of risk factors for Torsade de Pointes syndrome
             (example, hypokalemia, family history of long QT Syndrome)

          -  Any evidence of clinically significant heart block or bundle branch block at screening

          -  Current human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) or HIV-2 infection (confirmed by
             antibodies) at screening

          -  History of hepatitis A, B, or C infection, or current hepatitis A infection (confirmed
             by hepatitis A antibody immunoglobulin M [IgM]), or hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection
             (confirmed by hepatitis B surface antigen), or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection
             (confirmed by HCV antibody) at screening
