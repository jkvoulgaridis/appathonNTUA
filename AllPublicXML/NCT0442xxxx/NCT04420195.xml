  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing a lung transplant will be enrolled. All patients will undergo lung
      transplantation with standard post-operative management, including triple immunosuppression.
      As soon as the patient is deemed appropriate to take medications via the oral route, they
      will be converted from IR tacrolimus to Envarsus XR. Patients will be followed per site's
      standard of care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung transplantation will be performed per standard-of-care techniques. All post-transplant
      management, including initial triple immunosuppression, will be carried out per standard of
      care. Once the patient is able to take medications via the oral route, they will be converted
      to Envarsus XR, which will be maintained for the first year post-lung transplant.

    <description>Envarsus XR is an FDA-approved drug for the prophylaxis of organ rejection in de novo kidney transplant patients or in kidney transplant patients converted from IR tacrolimus when used with other immunosuppressants. Envarsus XR is a novel extended-release formulation of tacrolimus created using MeltDose technology. Envarsus XR is available in tablet form. It is available in 0.75, 1, and 4 mg tablets.</description>

    <description>Historical cohort of 20 subjects who will be maintained on IR tacrolimus following transplant. Dosing will be converted on an individual basis (Capsules: 0.5 mg, 1 mg and 5 mg or Injection: 5 mg) . All patients will be initiated on IR tacrolimus either under the tongue (sublingual) or as a solution given through a tube placed through the nose into the stomach, which is standard of care for all lung transplant recipients.</description>
