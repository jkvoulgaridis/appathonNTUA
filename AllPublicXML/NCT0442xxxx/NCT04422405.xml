    <intervention_name>One Anastomosis Gastric Bypass (OAGB)</intervention_name>
    <description>The procedure is performed laparoscopically. The &quot;GIA&quot; stapler divides the stomach at the junction of the body and antrum. An Ewald tube, roughly the diameter of the esophagus, is passed by the anesthetist and held against the lesser curvature. The division of the stomach against the tube is completed, with 5- 6 lines of staples. The division of the stomach is parallel to the lesser curvature and up to the angle of His. A point is selected on the small bowel about 200 cm distal to the ligament of Treitz. The jejunal loop is brought up antecolic, and the Endo-GIA stapler is used to perform the anastomosis between the stomach and the small bowel at this point. The distal end of the gastric tube is anastomosed to the side of the small bowel.</description>
