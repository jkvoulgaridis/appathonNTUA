  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Family support is a positive predictor for psychiatric patients. For example, since the
      1980s, it has been shown that family psychoeducation improves patient adherence to care and
      statistically decreases patient relapse and hospitalization rates by half, resulting in lower
      care costs. Yet, the stress of hospitalizing a patient, seeing the feelings of shame or guilt
      of caregiver and the impact on their quality of life are rarely taken into account by
      caregivers during the first weeks hospitalization in a patient's psychiatry.

      Barrelet emphasizes the importance of organizing the meeting in the first hours of
      hospitalization with the family in order to strengthen the alliance, to improve
      communication.
