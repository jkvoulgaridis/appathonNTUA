      300 selected patients will be recruited, who have at least one atherosclerotic plaque in the
      carotid artery that is thicker than 2.0 mm and which is determined to be uniformly or
      predominantly echolucent by standard ultrasonography. For each of the plaques, standard
      ultrasonography will be used to evaluate lesion echogenicity, while contrast‑enhanced
      ultrasonography (CEUS) will be used to perform the visual and quantitative analysis of
      neovascularization. Each technique will be applied at baseline (at the time of study
      enrollment) and following 1 year of Elococumab Injection treatment. During the study, these
      patients will be treated with Elococumab Injection (1ml:140mg),ih, every two weeks.

    <description>We will use the time-signal intensity curve to calculate the changes in carotid plaque neovascularization.The time-intensity curve parameters includes: Baseline intensity(BI) and peak intensity (PI).Due to the ultrasound contrast agent, the intra‑plaque signal intensity increased. Thus, enhanced intensity (EI) was calculated as follows: EI = PI ‑ BI. EI is a parameter that measures the intensity differences between pre‑ and post‑injections of the intravascular tracer. Relative plaque enhancement (EI‑R), measured at the separate peak enhancement point in the blood and plaque, will be calculated as the ratio of enhanced intensity in the carotid artery lumen (EI‑L) to the enhanced intensity in the plaque (EI‑P) using the following formula: EI‑R=EI‑L/EI‑P.</description>

    <description>After one year's treatment of Elovocumab Injection, the patients will undergo follow-up standard ultrasonography again. We will measure the size of each lesion.The carotid plaque sizes at pre‑ and post‑elovocumab therapy will be analysed.</description>
