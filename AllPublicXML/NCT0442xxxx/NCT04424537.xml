  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of the primary risk factors for the development of diabetes is obesity. While even
      moderate weight loss achieved by dieting can lead to improvements in metabolic health,
      reduced-calorie diets are notoriously difficult to sustain. Over the past decade, a number of
      groups have shown that low protein diets are associated with metabolic health in both rodents
      and humans. In particular, specific building blocks of protein- the branched chain amino
      acids (BCAAs) leucine, isoleucine, and valine - are associated with insulin resistance and
      diabetes in humans. Blood levels of the BCAAs decrease in humans fed a low protein diet, and
      we recently showed that reducing either dietary BCAAs or protein rapidly restored normal body
      composition and insulin sensitivity to diet-induced obese mice without reducing calorie
      intake.

      Current study will test the metabolic role of dietary BCAAs in humans by completing an
      adequately powered, randomized controlled study. A total of 132 subjects stratified by gender
      will be randomized to one of three groups: 1) Control; 2) Low Protein; 3) Low BCAA. Subjects
      in each group will replace two meals a day (and 2/3rds of their baseline dietary protein)
      with meal replacement beverages based on either complete protein powder or a BCAA-free
      medical food for two months. Primary outcomes will be weight and fasting blood glucose
      levels. A number of secondary outcomes will also be assessed and blood, adipose, and fecal
      samples will be collected for integrated transcriptional and metabolomic pathway analysis to
      identify and compare the metabolic pathways affected by low protein and low BCAA diets.

    <description>Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is a standard technique for the determination of body composition. DXA results will be used to calculate fat and lean mass composition. Total body Bioelectrical Impedance Spectroscopy (BIS) is a minimal risk procedure which enhances DXA as it permits the determination of intracellular water.BIS is used to calculate fat and fat-free mass composition. A formula will be used to combine BIS fat-free mass composition and DXA lean mass composition corrected by limb length, which allows a surrogate measurement of muscle mass.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 30 (±7)days, 60(-3 to +7)days, 134(+7) days</time_frame>
    <description>Insulin resistance will be measured by HOMA-IR (Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance) method. Insulin resistance reveals the dynamics between the participant's baseline (fasting) blood sugar and the responsive insulin levels.
HOMA-IR healthy range: 1.0 (0.5-1.4), less than 1.0 means participant is insulin-sensitive which is optimal, above 1.9 indicates early insulin resistance, above 2.9 indicates significant insulin resistance.</description>

    <description>Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a hormone which regulate insulin signalling in response to nutritional status. Levels of FGF21 induced in response to low protein diet and fasting will be measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay(ELISA) assay.</description>
