  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Learning Skills Together (LST) program is a synchronous web-based educational
      intervention developed to address the essential need for training to equip family caregivers
      to someone with mid-stage Alzheimer's disease to confidently provide complex care tasks.The
      purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate the feasibility of delivering LST, the program's
      acceptability to caregivers, and likelihood of effecting caregivers self-efficacy and
      mastery.

    <time_frame>Change from baseline and 4 weeks post-intervention; Change from baseline and 8 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>This will be measured using the Caregiving Competence Scale reported by Pearlin and colleagues (1990), as it is described by Robertson and colleagues (2007). This measure includes 3-items pertaining to caregiver's confidence (e.g., &quot;I feel confident that I am meeting the needs of my relative&quot;). There are four response options to each statement (Never [0] to &quot;All of the time&quot; [3]), such that scores may range from 0 to 9). Robertson and colleagues (2007) reported a Cronbach's alpha of 0.81.</description>

    <measure>Change in caregiver Mastery</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline and 4 weeks post-intervention; Change from baseline and 8 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>This will be measured using the Caregiver Mastery Scale developed by Pearlin &amp; Schooler (1978). This 7-item scale asks participants the extent to which they feel they have control over various parts of their lives (e.g., &quot;I have little control over the things that happen to me&quot;). Participants may respond that they &quot;Strongly Disagree (1) to Strongly agree (4) with each statement, such that scores range from 7 to 28. The mean score for this measure among caregivers to frail older adults was previously reported as 19.42 (SD 3.29), with Cronbach's alpha of 0.78 (Chan et al., 2018).</description>

    <description>Participants in the Learning Skills Together program will begin their participation with a one-on-one phone call with an interventionist, who will ensure the participant is prepared to to attend the group sessions (e.g., familiar with videoconference technology) and will help the participant to set individual goals. The caregiver participant will then attend 4, group-based sessions lasting approximately 1.5 hours each, to learn about common complex care tasks managed by family caregivers to someone with mid-stage Alzheimer's disease, such as managing behavioral symptoms of dementia, incontinence, nutrition, transferring, medication management, and more. Sessions will integrate interactive activities, such as videos, case studies, and discussions. Approximately four weeks later, caregivers will be asked to attend a group reflection session to discuss application of what was learned and progress in meeting individual goals.</description>
