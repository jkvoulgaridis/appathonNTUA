      High risk patients are referred for the medical oncology consultation to organize oncological
      surveillance after general staging of the disease. Signature of the informed consent of
      SALOME study, inclusion in the study and risk-adjusted surveillance schedule :

      (i) Liver MRI every 6 months performed at the expert center for UM (according to guidelines).

      (ii) For enucleated patients, a blood sample (3 x 6 ml EDTA tubes) is taken every 6 months
      according to the schedule below. Plasma and mononucleated cells will be isolated and
      preserved for bio-markers research.

        -  M0 : during the first medical oncology visit.

        -  At each imaging assessment, every 6 months for at least 5 years (M6 to M60) and 10 years
           maximum (M120).

        -  At the diagnosis of metastasis.

        -  At each significant event during the metastatic disease (surgery, treatment response or
           progression).
