    <measure>Number of Participants Reporting one or More Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Based on TEAEs Severity</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 30 months</time_frame>
    <description>A severity grade is defined by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version 5.0. Grade 1 scales as Mild (asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated); Grade 2 scales as Moderate (minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate instrumental Activities of Daily Living [ADL]); Grade 3 scales as Severe (severe or medically significant but not immediately life threatening hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self-care ADL); Grade 4 scales as Life-threatening consequences, urgent intervention indicated, and Grade 5 scales as Death related to Adverse Event (AE).</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants with Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLTs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 30 months</time_frame>
    <description>A DLT will be defined as any of the TEAEs, but not limited to, those that occur during Cycle 1 and are considered by the investigator to be at least possibly related to TAK-676 as an SA or in combination with pembrolizumab. TEAEs meeting DLT definitions occurring in Cycle 2 or later will be considered in the determination of the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of TAK-676, both in the TAK-676 SA and the combination with pembrolizumab arms. Toxicity will be evaluated according to NCI CTCAE version 5.0.</description>

             these therapies.

          4. TAK-676 in combination with pembrolizumab:

             o With histologically confirmed (cytological diagnosis is acceptable) advanced or
             metastatic solid tumors, including:

               -  Tumors that have relapsed or are refractory to anti-programmed cell death protein
                  1 (anti-PD-1)/anti-programmed cell death ligand 1 (anti-PD-L1) therapy.

               -  Tumors that are naive to anti-PD-1/ anti-PD-L1 therapy.

          5. Adequate bone marrow, renal, hepatic and cardiac functions.

          6. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &gt;50%, as measured by echocardiogram or
             multiple-gated acquisition (MUGA) scan within 4 weeks before receiving the first dose
             of study drug.

          7. Clinically significant toxic effects of previous therapy have recovered to Grade 1
             (per NCI CTCAE Version 5.0) or baseline, except for alopecia, Grade 2 peripheral
             neuropathy, and/or autoimmune endocrinopathies with stable endocrine replacement
             therapy.

          8. Once peripheral evidence of TAK-676 pharmacodynamic stimulation of the innate and/or
             adaptive immune system is observed in the blood and/or clinical response (CR/PR) is
             observed in at least 1 participant, subsequent participants must:

               -  Have at least 1 lesion amenable for biopsy.

               -  Agree to have 2 tumor biopsies: 1 during the screening period and 1 while on

             controlled by tap or requiring indwelling catheters.

          8. History of brain metastasis unless:

               -  Clinically stable (that is, &gt;=6 weeks) following prior surgery, whole-brain
                  radiation, or stereotactic radiosurgery, AND

               -  Off corticosteroids.

             arm), biologic, or hormonal therapy (except for adjuvant endocrine therapy for a
             history of breast cancer). Concurrent use of hormones for noncancer-related conditions
             is acceptable (except for corticosteroid hormones).

         14. Radiation therapy within 14 days (42 days for radiation to the lungs) and/or systemic
             treatment with radionuclides within 42 days before C1D1 of study drug(s). Participants

    <ipd_description>Takeda makes patient-level, de-identified data sets and associated documents available for all interventional studies after applicable marketing approvals and commercial availability have been received (or program is completely terminated), an opportunity for the primary publication of the research and final report development has been allowed, and other criteria have been met as set forth in Takeda's Data Sharing Policy (see www.TakedaClinicalTrials.com for details). To obtain access, researchers must submit a legitimate academic research proposal for adjudication by an independent review panel, who will review the scientific merit of the research and the requestor's qualifications and conflict of interest that can result in potential bias. Once approved, qualified researchers who sign a data sharing agreement are provided access to these data in a secure research environment.</ipd_description>
