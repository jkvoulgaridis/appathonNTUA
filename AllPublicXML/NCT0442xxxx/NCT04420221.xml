      Safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of GSK S. aureus candidate vaccine (GSK3878858A) when
      administered to healthy adults (dose-escalation) and to adults 18 to 50 years of age with a
      recent S. aureus skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI). In the dose-escalation safety lead-in
      phase in healthy adults safety and immunogenicity of 4 different compositions is assessed.
      After safety has been shown in this phase, in the second phase, proof of principle (PoP)
      phase of the study in adults with a recent SSTI safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of the
      final composition of the vaccine is assessed.
