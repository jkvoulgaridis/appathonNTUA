    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the retinal vascular features using optical coherence tomography
      angiography in patients that received endoscopic endonasal approach for the removal of an
      intra-suprasellar pituitary adenoma compressing the optic nerve.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the potential role of optical coherence tomography angiography in predicting
      the postoperative recovery of retinal vascular network of the optic disc in patients before
      and at 3 months after Endoscopic Endonasal Approach for the removal of an intra-suprasellar
      pituitary adenoma compressing the optic nerve.

      The optical coherence tomography angiography represents a novel and non-invasive diagnostic
      technique that allows a detailed analysis of retinal vascular features.
