    <textblock>
      To detect the difference of PD-L1 and miRNA expression profiles of exosomes in NSCLC patients
      before and after immunotherapy, and to explore the potential of plasma exosomes PD-L1 and
      miRNAs as biomarkers to predict the therapeutic effect of NSCLC on anti-PD-1 / PD-L1.

    <description>100 patients with stage IV EGFR / ALK wild-type NSCLC (squamous cell carcinoma patients do not need to be detected) who received anti-PD-1 (pabolizumab) treatment combined with chemotherapy as the first-line treatment were enrolled in the center. Baseline plasma samples were collected before the treatment, and the efficacy was evaluated once every two treatment cycles. At the same time, plasma samples were collected at key nodes until the patient's progress.</description>
