    <textblock>
      All physicians, nurses, and nurse midwives working on Labor and Delivery will be required to
      complete cervical exam simulation training. Data before and after institution of the training
      will be compared to determine if the training leads to less cervical exams during labor and
      increases consistency between examiners

      The labor cervical exam is the cornerstone of the management of labor as the accurate
      assessment of cervical dilation and effacement are crucial in recognizing a normal labor from
      and abnormal one. To enhance accuracy and precision among healthcare providers working on
      Labor and Delivery we have created a high fidelity cervical exam simulator. All providers
      working on Labor and Delivery Repetitive will be required to practice on the simulators until
      a pre-specified level or accuracy is achieved. We will prospectively and retrospectively
      assess the number of cervical exams a women receives and the discrepancy between exams
      performed by 2 different providers both before and after the training is instituted.

    <description>During the first week of the study they will also examine 10 rigid clay followed by 10 foam cervices in the PVC pipe- based cervical models. Each nurse will then examine 1 sets of 10 high-fidelity silicone task trainers approximately three per week for a maximum of 20 sessions (200 repetitions total). For each set of 10 exams, the estimates will recorded on an answer sheet. A cumulative summation analysis will be performed on each participant. When an individual nurse achieves competence her training will be suspended</description>
