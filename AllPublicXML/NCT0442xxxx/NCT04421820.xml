  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BOLD-100 is an intravenously administered sterile solution containing the ruthenium-based
      small molecule. BOLD-100 has been shown to preferentially decrease the expression of GRP78 in
      tumour cells and ER stressed cells when compared to normal cells. BOLD-100 will be combined
      with cytotoxic FOLFOX chemotherapy in this study, with a dose escalation cohort to ensure
      tolerability and safety, followed by a cohort expansion phase.

             (including OTC, herbal or homeopathic preparations) that could affect (improve or
             worsen) the cancer being studied, or could affect the action or disposition of
             BOLD-100, or its clinical or laboratory assessment, e.g., Coumadin therapy, due to
             high competitive protein binding. Subjects taking ANY supplemental IRON, i.e.,
             therapeutic or as part of a multivitamin regimen, are excluded from this study,
             whether prescribed or self-medicated.

             another investigational therapy or anti-cancer therapy.
