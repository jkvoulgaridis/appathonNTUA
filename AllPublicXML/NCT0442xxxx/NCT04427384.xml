  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this registry study are to evaluate real-world clinical outcomes and
      patient reported outcomes that measure the effectiveness and safety of STaRT.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients (N=600) with surgically resected (R) brain tumors of any pathology who have
      undergone STaRT are eligible. Data collected will include local control, overall survival,
      QOL, neurocognition, functional decline, and surgical and radiation associated AE's. Data
      will be collected at 1, 3, 6, 9,12, 18 and 24 months, then every 6 months through 5 years.
      RESULT: Data will be used to benchmark clinical outcomes of STaRT therapy and allow for
      comparisons to existing standard-of-care treatments. This will be the first observational
      registry study of R+STaRT, delivered by Cs-131 sources in permanently implanted resorbable
      collagen tile carriers. The outcome measures captured will allow for evaluation of the
      potential risks and benefits of this treatment approach for patients in a real-world setting.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who undergo maximum safe resection of intracranial neoplasm(s) AND
             implantation of GammaTiles.

          2. Willing and able to provide informed consent and to participate in all evaluations.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Inability to undergo pre-operative and post-operative imaging for disease and implant
             assessment.

          2. Major medical or psychiatric illness, which, in the investigator's opinion would
             prevent completion of treatment, ability to complete assessments at the time of
             enrollment, and/or interfere with follow ups.

          3. Lack of English language fluency sufficient to allow for completion of neurocognitive
             and QOL tests (which are in English).
