  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was intended to test if reframing an offer for a free follow-up eye examination
      could increase uptake within ongoing community-based screening program for low-income and
      minority populations in Baltimore City. This study evaluated the effect of offering
      participants a physical voucher they were told was redeemable for free follow-up, relative to
      simply telling participants that the follow-up appointment would be free of charge. The
      investigators assessed two forms of vouchers, one with estimated value information, and one
      without. The underlying hypothesis was that reframing these already free offers would
      increase uptake by increasing perceived offer value and increasing a sense of regret from not
      taking advantage of a &quot;good deal.&quot;

    <description>The primary endpoint was attending a follow-up appointment, either on the initially scheduled or on a rescheduled date within 90 days of the date of screening. Individuals who did not meet this endpoint either stated that they were not interested in follow-up at the screening event itself, cancelled or did not show for their appointments on 3 occasions, stated that they were not interested in follow-up when study staff attempted to reschedule, or did not show for an appointment and could not be reached for rescheduling after 3 attempts.</description>

    <description>Patients being referred for follow-up received standard materials, counseling, and reminders as in the 'no information' group and were provided with a physical voucher they were told is redeemable for free follow-up appointment at Johns Hopkins Hospital. The voucher included the patient's name, the screener's name, and an expiration date 90 days from the date of screening.
These participants were told: &quot;I am going to give you this voucher for a completely free appointment and a free pair of glasses if you need them. So, with this voucher, both the exam and the glasses will be completely free.&quot;</description>

    <description>Patients being referred for follow-up received standard materials, counseling, and reminders as in the 'no information' group and were provided with a physical voucher they were told is redeemable for free follow-up appointment at Johns Hopkins Hospital, which would normally cost $250. The voucher included the patient's name, the screener's name, an expiration date 90 days from the date of screening, and a statement about the $250 voucher value.
These participants were told: &quot;I am going to give you this voucher for a completely free appointment and a free pair of glasses if you need them. These services normally cost about $250, but with this voucher, both the exam and the glasses will be completely free.&quot;</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Referred for follow-up at a Screening to Prevent Glaucoma (SToP) study screening event
             (overarching observational study from which trial sample was drawn). SToP participants
             were referred for follow-up for any of the following conditions: (1) VA worse than
             20/40 in at least 1 eye despite autorefraction; (2) signs of retinal abnormalities on
             fundus photography; (3) uninterpretable fundus photography; (4) cup-to-disc ratio
             (CDR) greater than or equal to 0.9, and/or CDR between 0.7 and 0.9 with visual field
             defects or history of glaucoma; and (5) IOP of 23 mm Hg or greater.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  SToP participants who were not referred at the time of screening but later contacted
             after review of fundus photography

          -  SToP participants who were referred for follow-up but stated at the time of counseling
             that they were already under the care of an eye doctor
