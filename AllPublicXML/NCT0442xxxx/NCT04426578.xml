  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common inherited heart muscle condition
      affecting up to 1 in 200 of the general population. It results from mutations in genes
      encoding components of the contractile apparatus in the heart muscle cell (myocyte). These
      mutations result in increased energy cost of force production for the myocyte which then
      cumulatively causes a myocardial energy deficit. This myocardial energy deficit is then
      thought to lead to cardiac hypertrophy ('left ventricular hypertrophy' or LVH) in HCM.

      LVH leads to impairments in heart muscle function, heart muscle oxygenation and microvascular
      blood flow and is the chief driver of patient symptoms in HCM. These symptoms consist of
      chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, fainting episodes or palpitations. Occasionally,
      the disease may cause sudden cardiac death (SCD). HCM is the most common cause of SCD in
      young people including competitive athletes. In addition, HCM has been found to result in
      significant global deterioration in health-related quality of life.

      Treatment of HCM has focused on relief of symptoms by drugs such as ß-blockers which slow the
      heart rate and improve heart function. However, symptom relief is often incomplete and there
      is no evidence on the benefit of ß-blockers or related medications to reverse LVH.
      Perhexiline, a potent carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1 (CPT-1) inhibitor shifts myocardial
      metabolism to more efficient glucose utilisation and rectifies impaired myocardial
      energetics. It is currently used to treat angina in patients with coronary artery disease.
      There is some preliminary evidence that Perhexiline may aid in the improvement of symptoms in
      patients with HCM. However, the effect of any form of therapy on potential regression of LVH
      in HCM remains unexplored.

      In this randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial, the investigators will use state of
      the art cardiac imaging, principally advanced echocardiography and Cardiovascular Magnetic
      Resonance (CMR) to study the effects of perhexiline on LVH, cardiac function, and oxygenation
      in symptomatic patients with HCM. The investigators hypothesize that perhexiline will
      favourably reduce LVH and improve myocardial oxygenation by improving myocardial energetics,
      and that these putative morphological and functional changes can be accurately measured
      utilizing echocardiography and CMR. If this pilot study supports the hypothesis, then it will
      pave the way for a major randomised controlled trial to definitely determine the role of
      Perhexiline in HCM.

    <description>All eligible and consented patients will be randomised to initiation of perhexiline 100mg once daily or identical placebo. After 4 days of treatment, a blood sample will be collected to determine plasma perhexiline concentrations: timing of the sample need not be &quot;trough&quot; in view of the long-acting nature of perhexiline. Depending on the blood results, patients might require as little as 50mg/week (slow metabolisers) or as much as 600mg/day (ultra-rapid metabolisers). The initial sample will be utilized primarily to detect presence of hydroxylated metabolite: patients in whom perhexiline is detected in the absence of metabolite will be designated &quot;slow metabolisers&quot; and will have their dosage reduced to 50 mg/week in the first instance. Repeat assay at 30 days will be utilized for individual finer dose titration based on dose adjustment table. Paired dosage adjustment in placebo-treated patients will be performed to avoid unblinding.
Compliance will be assessed by capsule count.</description>
