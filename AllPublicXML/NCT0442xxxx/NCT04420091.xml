  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an exploratory, non-comparative, multi-centric trial in 30 free-living healthy
      male and female subjects with moderate knee joint discomfort and loss of functionality.

      The objective of this trial is to determine whether oral administration of Cartidyss, a
      concentrated fish cartilage extract, can contribute to the improvement of knee joint
      functionality and discomfort in adult population

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      30 patients will be enrolled during a 4-month period in 3 investigational sites and each
      patient will undergo 3 visits (V0: Inclusion visit at baseline, V1: Follow-Up Visit after 1
      month ± 3 day and V2: End Visit after 3 months ± 5 days).

      The primary objective of this trial is to determine whether oral administration of Cartidyss,
      a concentrated fish cartilage extract, can contribute to the improvement of knee joint
      functionality and discomfort in adult population, using a specific self-administered
      questionnaire. The secondary objectives of the study are to evaluate the effect of Cartidyss
      on knee function and pain at rest and while walking, with patient global assessment and
      quality of life at each time point. The tolerance, compliance, satisfaction, rate of
      responder to the supplementation and pain killer's consumption would be also evaluated as
      secondary endpoints.

The SF-36 is a 36-item patient-reported questionnaire that covers eight health domains: physical functioning (10 items), bodily pain (2 items), role limitations due to physical health problems (4 items), role limitations due to personal or emotional problems (4 items), emotional well-being (5 items), social functioning (2 items), energy/fatigue (4 items), and general health perceptions (5 items). Scores for each domain range from 0 to 100, with a higher score defining a more favorable health state.</description>
