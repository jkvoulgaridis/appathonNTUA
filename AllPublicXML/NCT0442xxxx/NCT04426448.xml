  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to culturally adapt a brief psychological intervention for
      Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and assess its efficacy, feasibility, and acceptability
      in a pilot trial. The intervention has been shown to be efficacious among individuals with
      comorbid severe mental illness (SMI) and PTSD.

      The study will be conducted in three phases. The first phase will determine a description of
      trauma and responses to traumatic experiences among patients with severe mental illness. The
      first phase of the study will also determine participants' and mental health care providers'
      perceptions of suitable PTSD interventions in this middle-income context. The findings will
      then be used to culturally adapt the brief intervention in the second phase. A pilot trial
      will be conducted in the third phase of the study.

      Participants with comorbid SMI and PTSD will be randomized into two groups (n= 20
      intervention group, n= 20 control group). Outcomes of the intervention such as the severity
      of PTSD symptoms, knowledge about PTSD will be assessed at baseline and at different
      timelines during the study.

      This study will fill the knowledge gap on trauma and its consequences among individuals with
      severe mental illness in Botswana, it will also contribute to the improvement of clinical
      practice in the management of PTSD and SMI.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study participants will be recruited from Sbrana Psychiatric Hospital, the only referral
      psychiatric hospital in Botswana. The hospital population is representative of the culturally
      diverse Botswana nation because patients with severe mental illness from the entire country
      are admitted to the hospital. Forty participants (40) will be recruited and randomized to
      receive the Brief Relaxation, Education, And Trauma HEaling (BREATHE) intervention or
      treatment as usual.

      The intervention will be delivered by the Principal Investigator who has received training
      from the intervention developer. Supervision will be provided telephonically.

      The BREATHE intervention will be delivered weekly for each participant for a total of three
      weeks and 4 participants will be enrolled per group resulting in a total of 5 groups. The
      estimated period of intervention delivery and data collection is therefore expected to last
      for a period of ~15 weeks.

      Outcomes such as anxiety, depressive and PTSD Symptoms, and knowledge about PTSD will be
      assessed before participants receive the intervention, weekly (following each treatment
      session), month one and month three after treatment completion. Assessment of feasibility and
      acceptability will be done at treatment completion with the intervention group. Participants
      on the control arm will receive outcome measures at the same time points as those receiving
      the intervention. The investigators will utilize an objective assessment of skin conductance
      which has been shown to be greater in individuals with PTSD than in individuals without PTSD
      and similarly increased during a trauma interview in individuals with PTSD compared to
      individuals who do not have PTSD.
