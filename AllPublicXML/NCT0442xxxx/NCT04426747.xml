  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Patients with inflammatory arthritis (IA), such as spondyloarthritis (axSpA),
      rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or psoriatic arthritis (PsA) are more prone to physical inactivity
      but derive specific benefits from regular physical activity. Barriers and facilitators to
      physical activity (B&amp;F-PA) are key elements and knowledge of their correlation to physical
      activity is essential for developing interventions to promote physical activity that have a
      greater likelihood of success.

      Objectives: primary objective will be to measure the correlation of these B&amp;F-PA to physical
      activity collected through apps. Secondary objective will be to (I) to quantify physical
      activity collected through apps in IA patients and (II) to observe the link between physical
      activity, B&amp;F to physical activity and adherence to treatment.

      Patients and methods: This is an international, multicentric, cross-sectional study.

      Patients: From the first of September to the first of February 2020, all patients with
      definite axSpA, RA or PsA, aged above 18 and able to walk, who have a mobile phone compatible
      with apps that can track steps, who agree to participate and give his oral informed consent
      and with ability to read and write in the language of the participating country, seen in
      outpatient visits in the participating centers, will be asked to participate. The planed
      inclusion was 200 participants.

      Data collection: clinical data and information about physical activity and B&amp;F-PA will be
      entered by rheumatologists during or electronically by patients at the same time point.

      Questionnaire for B&amp;F-PA: a patient reported questionnaire was recently developed for this
      study in 2019 based on a systematic review to identify the main B&amp;F-PA. A list of questions
      was generated from the systematic review reviewed and tested for face validity by 11 experts
      and confronted to 20 patients with IA through a cognitive debriefing.

      Physical activity: Physical activity will be measured objectively during the last 7 days by
      apps already installed by default on the mobile phone of participants and subjectively with
      the International Physical Activity Questionnaire short version (IPAQ-S).

      Other outcomes: Stage of exercise behavior change and adherence to treatment will also be
      collected.

      Planned analyses: Perceived B&amp;F-PA will be described using frequencies. A score will be
      calculated for each participant representing the limitations or facilities to perform
      physical activity.

      Analysis of the physical activity: The distribution of mean number of steps will be assessed
      visually for outliers. Univariate analysis will be completed between mean number of steps and
      gender, age, disease and stages of change. Correlation between mean number of steps and
      IPAQ-S score will be calculated.

      Link between physical activity and barriers and facilitators: The link between B&amp;F
      questionnaire score and mean number of steps will be tested using linear regression. Then
      multivariate regression including demographic variables, psychological status and disease
      characteristics will be performed.

      Outcomes of the study: The expected outcomes of the ImBAIA study are a better understanding
      of B&amp;F to physical activity in patients with IA and their impact to limit or to favor
      physical activity. We also expect to observe the level of physical activity of an IA
      population objectively measured with apps. Finally, a validation was expected to use
      questionnaire of B&amp;F.

        Outpatients from secondary and tertiary care hospitals in France and in the United Kingdom
        will be invited to participate. Over the 5 months recruitment period, all patients with
        definite axSpA, RA or PsA who satisfy the inclusion criteria, seen in outpatient visits in
        the participating centers by one of the investigators, will be asked to participate. We
        plan to include 200 participants (based on a sample size calculation explained in
        statistical analysis part), 10-20 patients in each center, with a maximum of 30 patients
        per center and a competitive recruitment. We will aim for a minimum of 50 patients per
        disease group. After including of 50% of the population we will reorient inclusion if
        needed. Data will be collected at a single moment, during a usual visit.
