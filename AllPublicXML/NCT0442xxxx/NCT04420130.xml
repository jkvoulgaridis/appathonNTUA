      This is a a single-arm, prospective study of Camrelizumab combined with ablation and
      chemotherapy for patients with Pancreatic cancer liver metastasis.

      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Camrelizumab
      combined with ablation and chemotherapy as a treatment of Pancreatic cancer liver metastasis.

    <description>First, patients with liver metastases from pancreatic cancer are given ablation of liver metastases, and conventional chemotherapy plus camrelizumab is performed 1 week after surgery. If patients have multiple metastases, ablation treatment needs to be performed in stages, each ablation After 1 week of treatment, sequential chemotherapy + camrelizumab were reinfused, and the efficacy was evaluated every 2 cycles until the disease progressed or the patient could not tolerate it.</description>
