  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fatigue is a common symptom experienced by patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Prior
      works have demonstrated that it may profoundly impact the ability to return to productive
      activity and cognitive functions. However, few interventions have been applied in this
      population.The purpose of the current will be to test the effect of acupressure on fatigue
      reduction after traumatic brain injury.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fatigue is a pervasive and critical long-lasting symptom experienced by patients with
      traumatic brain injury (TBI) and can persist up to months or years after head injury.
      However, thus far, only few non-pharmacological interventions, such as mindfulness, are
      implemented in reducing fatigue in TBI survivors. Prior works have suggested that acupressure
      can significantly improve fatigue in different populations, such as cancers survivors and
      patients with hemodialysis. Therefore, we would like to test whether acupressure effectively
      improve fatigue after TBI.
