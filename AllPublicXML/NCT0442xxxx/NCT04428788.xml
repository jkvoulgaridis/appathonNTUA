      Study CC-94676-PCA-001 is a first-in-human dose finding study to determine the safety,
      tolerability, PK, PD, and preliminary efficacy of CC-94676 in subjects with mCRPC who have
      progressed on ADT and at least one prior secondary hormonal therapy approved for CRPC (eg,
      abiraterone, enzalutamide, apalutamide, or darolutamide). The dose escalation will evaluate
      the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of CC-94676 in mCRCP subjects to determine
      the MTD of CC-94676. The dose expansion will further evaluate the safety and preliminary
      efficacy of CC-94676 administered at or below MTD in subjects with mCRPC.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects must satisfy the following criteria to be enrolled in the study:

          1. Subject is a male ≥ 18 years of age at the time of signing the informed consent form
             (ICF).

          2. Subjects must have histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the
             prostate.

          3. Subjects must have documented progressive metastatic castration-resistant prostate
             cancer (CRPC).

          4. Subjects must have progressed on androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and at least one
             prior secondary hormonal therapy approved for CRPC (eg, abiraterone, enzalutamide,
             apalutamide, or darolutamide).

          5. Subjects must have serum testosterone ≤ 50 ng/dL. Subjects must continue primary
             androgen deprivation with a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) analogue
             (agonist or antagonist) if they have not undergone bilateral orchiectomy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The presence of any of the following will exclude a subject from enrollment:

          1. Subject has confirmed or suspected small cell carcinoma of the prostate/neuroendocrine
             prostate cancer.

          2. Subject has known symptomatic brain or epidural central nervous system (CNS) or spinal
             metastases requiring steroids (above physiologic replacement doses) or radiation.

          3. Subject had systemic anticancer therapy or investigational treatments within 4 weeks
             (except treatments to maintain castrate status) or ≤ 5 half-lives prior to the first
             dose of CC-94676, whichever is shorter.

          4. Subject had palliative radiation, strontium-89, or radium-223 ≤ 4 weeks prior to the
             first dose of CC-94676. Palliative radiation for the alleviation of pain due to bone
             metastasis will be allowed during the study, as long as this is not a sign of
             clinically significant disease progression.

          5. Subject has any significant medical condition, such as uncontrolled infection,
             laboratory abnormality, or psychiatric illness that would prevent the subject from
             participating in the study.
