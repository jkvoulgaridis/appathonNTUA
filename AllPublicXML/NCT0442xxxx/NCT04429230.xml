  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Huntington's disease is a disabling neurodegenerative disease. Patients present with
      involuntary movements of the body and cognitive symptoms like behavioral problem, difficulty
      in planning tasks, etc. No effective treatment is currently available for them apart from
      symptomatic therapy. Currently, studies are going on the effectiveness of noninvasive brain
      stimulation (NIBS) in neurodegenerative diseases. It is a mode of brain stimulation technique
      where current is delivered into the brain by placing electrodes into their scalp.
      Transcranial pulsed current stimulation (tPCS) is a new modality of noninvasive brain
      stimulation. It is a device that generates electrical impulses. The current generated from
      this device can stimulate underlying brain areas. The investigators have planned to study the
      efficacy of non-invasive brain stimulation via tPCS in these patients of Huntington's
      disease.

      At first, the investigators will rate their involuntary body movement by a standard scale,
      assess arm movements by a robotic device, assess speech with standard protocol, assess brain
      electrophysiology by electroencephalography (EEG) and will also do gait (walking) analysis.
      Next, the investigators will give them a single session of 20 min stimulation via real tPCS
      (active stimulation) or placebo (sham stimulation). After 20 mins of stimulation, the
      investigators will re-assess the patient after 1 hour using the same tools mentioned
      pre-stimulation.

      Each patient will receive real and placebo stimulation with a 1-month gap in between. They
      will not know whether they are receiving real stimulation or placebo. Assessment will be done
      before stimulation, 1 hour after stimulation and after 1 month of stimulation.

      The investigators have planned to study the efficacy of non-invasive brain stimulation via
      Transcranial pulsed current stimulation (tPCS) in patients of Huntington's disease. Anodal
      stimulation will be given to the brain area based on quantitative electroencephalography
      (qEEG) findings.

      Patients will be assessed clinically by standard rating scale (UHDRS) and by qEEG, KinArm and
      Gait - before and after a single session of 20 min stimulation via tPCS or sham stimulation.

      The investigators have planned to assess-

        1. Speech

        2. Upper limb movement via KinArm. Standard KinArm testing protocol will be used which is
           used universally.

        3. Gait via Gait Carpet (Zeno Walkway)

        4. Quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG)

        5. Scale for Huntington's disease (UHDRS) tPCS will be delivered through a pair of
           saline-soaked (0.9% NaCl) surface sponge electrodes. Anode will be placed on the scalp
           over the area based on qEEG findings. Participant's speech will be recorded using a
           head-mounted microphone (AKGc520) and a digital recording device (Zoom H4nPro) while
           performing the following calibrated tasks (Calibration involves a sound level meter
           placed at 15cm from the mouth while talker says 'ah' at 70dBA) - a. Prolonged 'ah'. b.
           Rapid repetitions of the sounds &quot;puh&quot;, &quot;tuh&quot;, and &quot;kuh&quot;. c. Two productions of a
           sentence with selected speech sounds (s, sh, p, b, t, i, a, u, ae, ai). &quot;She saw Patty
           buy two poppies.&quot; d. Two times louder production of a sentence with selected speech
           sounds. &quot;She saw Patty buy two poppies.&quot; e. Repetition of a continuous vowel at normal
           and fast rates. 'eye-eye-eyeeye- eye' without making any voice breaks or pauses&quot;. f.
           Read aloud a section of a standard passage - standard rainbow passage g. Monologue. Talk
           for two minutes about an interesting vacation (or an interesting hobby or activity). The
           Zeno walkway will be used in conjunction with the ProtoKinetics Movement Analysis
           Software (PKMAS) . The walkway contains a series of pressure sensors to detect
           footfalls. These data will be captured and collated via the PKMAS software, resulting in
           numerous spatial, temporal and pressure-related gait parameters. Timed-up-and-go (TUG)
           task will be used, consisting of rising from chair, walking across the 20-foot gait
           carpet, turning around off the carpet, walking back and sitting down. This will be
           performed over 3 trials. Gait analysis provides various parameters as output such as
           stride length, line of progression, step length, toe-offs and other temporal and spatial
           parameters for analysis. Neurophysiological EEG signals will be recorded, eyes-closed,
           no-task, using g.Nautilus g.tec wireless system. The g.tech system uses earclip
           reference sensors. The subject will be in a quiet place with less light or
           electromagnetic perturbations. During the resting state recordings, patients are seated
           in a comfortable arm chair and will be instructed to keep relaxed, with their eyes
           closed for 5 min. A paired t test will be used to compare baseline data and post tPCS
           data. Descriptive analysis of the neurological examination findings will be provided.

    <description>The investigators will evaluate the effectiveness of tPCS in patients of Huntington's disease. The investigators will apply Unified Huntington's disease rating scale (UHDRS) pre and post stimulation. The scale is for assessment of chorea, dystonia, ataxia, extraocular movements, speech, gait, postural imbalance. Each subsection can be scored from 0-4. By summing up, the total score ranges from minimum 0 and maximum 124. Higher score means more severity.</description>
