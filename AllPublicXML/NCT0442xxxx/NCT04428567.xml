      A pilot trial to determine the feasibility of treadmill training with dual training in
      patients with Fragile X-Associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is substantial evidence that physical exercise can improve motor and cognitive function
      in individuals with Parkinson's Disease, traumatic brain injury or chronic stroke survivors.
      However, to the investigator's knowledge, no studies have explored the effect of treadmill
      training with or without a cognitive dual Task on gait, balance and cognition in Fragile X -
      Associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS), which is characterized by action tremor,
      cerebellar gait ataxia, parkinsonism, peripheral neuropathy and cognitive deficits, all of
      which increase the risk for falls and progressive disability. There are presently no
      medications or treatment interventions that have been shown to effectively manage the
      symptoms of FXTAS or delay disease progression, and it is currently not clear whether either
      the ST or Dual-Task treadmill training paradigms would be feasible or effective in FXTAS.

      A total of 10 individuals with FXTAS will recruited from the Rush University Movement
      Disorders Clinic or the FXTAS Clinic Database at Rush University. The subjects will be
      assigned to either 6 weeks of dual-task treadmill exercise training combined with a cognitive
      task (intervention group) occurring 3 times weekly, or control group. The primary outcome
      measures will be feasibility, safety and patient adherence. The assessments will occur at
      baseline, week 3, week 6, 1 month &amp; 6 month post-training.

    <measure>Change in balance and mobility measured by Instrumented-SWAY (i-SWAY)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A test (not a scale) to assess balance and postural sway. Subjects will be asked to stand still with their hands across their chests and their feet positioned a set distance apart (scaled to their height) with a wearable sensor that records movements applied to the lumbar trunk. This sensor will record parameters including mean total sway area, path length, jerk, and sway distance in the mediolateral and anteroposterior directions.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in balance and mobility measured by Mini-BEST balance scale</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This is a shortened version of the Balance Evaluation systems Test (BESTest). It aims to target and identify 6 different balance control systems and has been used as a performance-based balance measure in many interventions and clinical trials. 1) The original BESTest 4 level (0-3) scoring was revised to 3 levels (0-2) due to redundancy. 2) Total Score = 28 points per test directions. 3) Two items have right and left assessment in which the lower score is used within the total score (directions specify which to use). 4) For research, many studies specify use of both left and right data, thus calculating data based on 32 (vs 28 points).</description>

    <measure>Change in patient reported confidence in balance measured by Activities-Specific Balance Confidence Scale (ABC)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, week 6, post-training month 1 &amp; month 6</time_frame>
    <description>A 16-item self-report questionnaire in which patients rate their balance confidence for performing activities. Items are rated on a rating scale that ranges from 0 - 100. Score of zero represents no confidence, a score of 100 represents complete confidence. Overall score is calculated by adding item scores and then dividing by the total number of items.</description>

    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>One of the oldest and most widely used test of short-term verbal and working memory. On each trial subjects will be presented with a series of digits appearing one at a time on a computer screen. Subjects will be tested in 2 variants; forward-span and backward-span. In the forward-span, the subject will be asked to recall the digits in the order they appeared.

    <measure>Change in health related quality of life measured by the Neuro Quality of Life Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Neuro-QoL (Quality of Life in Neurological Disorders) is a measurement system that evaluates and monitors the physical, mental, and social effects experienced by adults and children living with neurological conditions. It is a self-report of health related quality of life in 17 domains and sub-domains for adults and 11 for children with neurological disorders. Raw scores are converted based on consistent metric (T-distribution) with data from the US general population with a t-score mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10. Adult Banks include 19-45 items. Items are scored on a 5-point scale that uses different language depending on assessment. the questions range from least (1) to most (5) based on frequency of behavior, amount of difficulty, or degree of agreement.</description>
