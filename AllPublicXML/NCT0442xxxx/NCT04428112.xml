  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      These caregivers are a vulnerable group due to their physical isolation and well-documented
      rural disparities in health care access and quality. Many rural dementia caregivers
      experience serious health consequences due to caregiving responsibilities that can limit
      their ability to maintain their caregiving role. Thus, there is a pressing need for
      effective, scalable, and accessible programs to support rural dementia caregivers.

      Online programs offer a convenient and readily translatable option for program delivery
      because they can be accessed by caregivers in the home and at the convenience of the user.
      Building Better Caregivers is an online 6-week, interactive, small-group self-management,
      social support, and skills-building workshop developed for caregivers of individuals with
      Alzheimer's disease or related dementia.

      The investigators will conduct a hybrid effectiveness-implementation randomized controlled
      trial that will enroll and randomize 640 rural dementia caregivers into two groups: 320 in
      the intervention (workshop) group and 320 in the attention control group. Caregivers will be
      recruited throughout the United States. Primary outcomes will be caregiver stress and
      depression symptoms. The investigators hypothesize that stress scores and depression symptoms
      will be significantly improved at 12 months in the intervention group versus control group.
      The investigators will also identify key strengths (facilitators) and weaknesses (barriers)
      of workshop implementation. The investigators will use the RE-AIM implementation framework
      and a mixed methods approach to identify implementation characteristics pertinent to both
      caregivers and rural community organizations.

      If the Building Better Caregivers workshop is proven to be effective, this research has the
      potential to open new research horizons, particularly on how to reach and effectively support
      isolated dementia caregivers in rural areas with an intervention that is scalable, even in
      low-resourced settings. If the workshop can achieve its goals with rural dementia caregivers,
      some of those most isolated, it would also be expected to be scalable in other low-resourced
      settings (e.g., in urban or suburban environments).
