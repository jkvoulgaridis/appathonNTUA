  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized trial included physiotherapy students, randomized in two groups, experimental
      one included simulation for developed competencies related to clinical reasoning in
      physiotherapy interventions for people with low back pain. The second group developed
      role-playing. this protocol allows us to compare two strategies with simulation for to
      promote clinical decisions in physiotherapy practice.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain (LBP) is symptomatology with a high global prevalence; health professionals,
      including physiotherapists, must have the skills to create professional interaction plans
      that permit a better quality of life for consultants. Clinical simulation can be a pedagogic
      setting that facilitates students with adequate training to acquire skills that improve
      professional reasoning in this clinical situation. The objective of this study was to compare
      the effects of clinical simulation with a simulated patient (SP) versus simulation with
      role-playing (RP) in physiotherapy students for decision-making in clinical skills while
      caring for a person with LBP. Methods. An experimental study, with 42 participants from two
      Colombian universities, randomized into two groups (SP n = 21, RP n = 21). The clinical skill
      was evaluated during the interaction with a person with LBP for which the Objective
      Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE-ML) was validated for individuals with low back pain;
      thereafter, a pedagogical method was conducted that included clinical simulation and,
      finally, the OSCE-ML was applied again to compare both groups.

    <description>The group denominated SP received a teaching strategy based on a class session with simulated practice for decision-making in clinical skills when caring for a person with LBP. Each session lasted approximately 120 minutes, and the clinical case used for the SP sessions was subjected to face validity with experts in the area of study.</description>

    <description>received a class session based on a &quot;role playing&quot; simulation strategy, structured for the same purpose established in the SP group. This session lasted approximately 120 minutes, and the learning environment was the classroom in which students assumed different roles to act out; some of them acted as people with LBP and others as physiotherapists</description>

    <description>Simulation can be used as a pedagogic tool that provides students with significant learning regarding decision-making in interacting with people, in this case patients with LBP. It is a potential strategy for developing diverse skills focused on the safety of the patient and the therapist.</description>
