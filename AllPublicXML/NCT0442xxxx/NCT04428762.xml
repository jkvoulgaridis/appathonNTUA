  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of T1DM in children, especially infants under 4 years of age, is increasing in
      the last decade. Not all patients are willing or able, from different reasons, to be treated
      with insulin pumps. This portion of patients' needs subcutaneous insulin injections, at lest
      4 injections per day, sometimes up to 8 injections per day.

      The recommended treatment is insulin injection before each carbohydrate content meal. Since
      each injection may lead to pain, many patients do not inject all recommended doses. The
      solution could be: eat with no bolus, or not to correct glucose level to retrain from pain
      sensation. I-Port use is able to address this issue by reducing the pain sensation
      accompanied with the injection. I-Port advance may give a technological solution to
      non-insulin pump T1DM pediatric patients.

      There are no reports in the literature of the use of iport in children and youth. This
      information is essential since 95% of pediatric diabetes mellitus cases are insulin dependent
      and require multiple injections. Better balanced diabetes in childhood may prevent
      complications to long range and long-term diabetes therapy. Moreover, if discovered safe, the
      iport can be used also for other subcutaneously delivered medication in children, such as
      somtostatin analog, human growth hormone and clexane Study is designed as 2 parts. Initial
      part is a cross over design to compare between ipor use an injections regarding glucose in
      range, side effects and quality of life.

      Second part is designed as prospective. To assess glycemic control with iport use or 3 months
      .
