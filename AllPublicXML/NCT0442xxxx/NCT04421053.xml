  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The 2009 IOM recommendation value for weight gain during pregnancy is widely used. Due to the
      unclear relationship between gestational diabetes mellitus and weight gain during pregnancy
      when formulating this recommendation value, pregnant women with gestational diabetes mellitus
      were excluded from the study population. Control of appropriate weight gain and control of
      blood glucose stability is an important part of GDM management in pregnant women. The
      incidence of GDM in China is about 15%-20%, and the number of pregnant women with GDM ranks
      first in the world. For the sake of the current and long-term health of maternal and infant,
      it is of great significance to explore the appropriate weight gain range and formulate the
      recommended value for GDM pregnant women as an independent population. This project intends
      to use prospective cohort study and retrospective analysis method of combining the
      observation of pregnant women with gestational diabetes blood sugar and weight changes,
      through the comparison of normal pregnant women suitable scope of weight gain, analyzes its
      influence on adverse pregnancy outcomes, increased the weight of gestational diabetes women
      recommended value is put forward, and combined with the Delphi expert consultation method for
      evaluation.

      This project used a prospective cohort study and retrospective analysis to analyze the
      changes in blood glucose and body weight in women with gestational diabetes during pregnancy.
      Based on the description of weight gain range of pregnant women with normal blood glucose,
      the influence of weight gain on adverse pregnancy outcome was analyzed, and the recommended
      weight gain value for women with gestational diabetes was proposed in combination with Delphi
      expert consultation method.
