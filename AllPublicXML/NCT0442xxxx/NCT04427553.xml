  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Percutaneous Peripheral Nerve Stimulation is a relative new intervention applied by physical
      therapists. Although it has been hypothesized that this technique could improve pain and
      function, no studies have investigated changes in physical performance in soccer players.
      This study will evaluate changes in physical performance after the application of
      Percutaneous Peripheral Nerve Stimulation in a sample of healthy soccer players.

    <measure>Changes in Contra-Movement Jump between baseline and follow-up periods</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and immediately after each session and 1 month after the last treatment session</time_frame>
    <description>The jump will start in an upright position with participants hands in their waists. They will perform a vertical jump after a fast down countermovement. During the knees and hips flexion, the trunk will remain the most upright as possible. The jump is measured using a Chronopump-Boscosystem DIN-A2 contact platform obtaining a jump reliable and valid height in centimeters</description>

    <measure>Changes in Squat Performance Speed between baseline and follow-up periods</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and immediately after each session and 1 month after the last treatment session</time_frame>
    <description>The Speed4Lift device will be used. Squats will be performed using a 20kg olympic bar with two 20kg discs in each side. Participants will place the bar over their shoulders in a 90º triple-flexion position. The measurements will be performed during the concentric contraction phase of the squat</description>

    <description>Participants assigned to this group will received two sessions (once per week) of ultrasound guided Percutaneous Peripheral Nerve Stimulation targeting the femoral nerve. We will apply a biphasic compensated electrical current at a frequency of 10 Hz, a pulse width of 240 µs and intensity allowed over a pain-free motor threshold (muscle contraction). Each participant will receive 10 repetitions of 10 seconds each one with 10 seconds rest- period between series (total treatment session 1.40 min).
After that participants will walk during 3 minutes.</description>
