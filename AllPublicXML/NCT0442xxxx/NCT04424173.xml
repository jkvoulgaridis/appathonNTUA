      This study aims to assess the effect of low dose combined estradiol and norethindrone acetate
      hormone therapy on serum CRP levels and life quality in natural menopause women. 45 natural
      menopause women who admitted to Karadeniz Technical University, Faculty of Medicine,
      Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology for 1 year and diagnosed as menopause and planned to
      have hormone therapy for menopausal symptoms involved in this study. The serum CRP levels and
      vasomotor symptoms scores graded according to Blatt-Kupperman Index and life quality scores
      according to Menopause-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (MENQOL) in Turkish were
      recorded before and after (3 months later) low dose hormone treatment (1 mg Estradiol and 0.5
      mg Norethindrone acetate).
