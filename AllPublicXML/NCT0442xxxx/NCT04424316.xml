  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study is designed to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of maternal immunization with RSVpreF against medically attended lower
      respiratory tract illness (MA-LRTI) in infants.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study to
      assess the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of RSVpreF or placebo (1:1 randomization) in
      infants born to healthy women vaccinated during pregnancy, as well as the safety and
      immunogenicity in the pregnant women. This will be a global study which will span multiple
      RSV seasons.

          -  Prior pregnancy complications or abnormalities at the time of consent, based on the
             investigator's judgment, that will increase the risk associated with the participation

             maternal participant's participation in, and completion of, the study or could
             preclude the evaluation of the maternal participant's response.

          -  Congenital or acquired immunodeficiency disorder, or rheumatologic disorder or other
             illness requiring chronic treatment with known immunosuppressant medications,

             past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior or laboratory abnormality that may
             increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational product
             administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the
             judgment of the investigator, would make the participant inappropriate for entry into
             this study.

          -  Participation in other studies involving investigational drug(s) within 28 days prior
             to consent and/or during study participation.

             systemic corticosteroids for &gt;14 days within 28 days prior to study enrollment.
