    <textblock>
      Primary Objective:

      To demonstrate the non-inferiority of the SHAN6™ vaccine to the licensed SHAN5™ given with
      bOPV and IPV vaccines when coadministered with PCV and ORV

      Secondary Objective:

        -  To describe the immunogenicity profile of the SHAN6™ vaccine 3-dose primary infant
           vaccination and that of the control vaccines (SHAN5™ given with bOPV and IPV)

        -  To describe the immune response to co-administered ORV-1 (Rotarix™) in a subset of
           participants from each group

        -  To describe the immune response to co-administered PCV-13 (Prevnar 13®) in a subset of
           participants from each group

        -  To describe the persistence of the antibodies against SHAN6™ antigens following a 3-dose
           primary series of SHAN6™ or SHAN5™ given with bOPV and IPV

        -  To describe the immunogenicity profile of SHAN6™ 28 days after the single booster dose
           of SHAN6™

        -  To describe the safety profile of the SHAN6™ vaccine and the control vaccines (SHAN5™
           given with bOPV and IPV), when administered concomitantly with routine pediatric
           vaccines
