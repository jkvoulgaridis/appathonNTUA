  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized clinical trial to test the effect of a type of non-invasive brain
      stimulation on the response to a behavioral intervention designed to enhance cognitive
      control over food cravings in obese and overweight women. The brain stimulation is called
      transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS). All eligible participants will engage in a
      behavioral intervention known to enhance control over food cravings and will be randomly
      assigned to receive either tDCS or sham stimulation to the prefrontal cortex of the brain.

      This study is a randomized clinical trial to test the effect of a type of non-invasive brain
      stimulation on the response to a behavioral intervention designed to enhance cognitive
      control over food cravings in obese and overweight women. The brain stimulation is called
      transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) which is a form of stimulation that delivers a
      low amplitude electrical current to the brain via the scalp (i.e. trans-cranial) to modify
      brain activity.

      All eligible participants will engage in a behavioral intervention (Go-No Go task), known to
      enhance control over food cravings, and will be randomly assigned to receive either tDCS or
      sham stimulation to the right prefrontal cortex of the brain during 8 20-min daily sessions.

      Primary outcome: score changes in eating behaviors scales (YFAS and TFEQ), scales will be
      applied at baseline and at the end of the 8 brain stimulation sessions.

      Secondary outcomes: changes in diet, brain function (brain MRI/MRS) Other outcomes: food
      cravings scales and impulse control scales and cognitive function.

    <description>Yale Food Addiction Scale (YFAS26) that is a 25-item measure developed to measure food addiction. Score range: 0 to 7. Higher scores in the scale mean more symptoms resembling food addiction (worse).</description>

    <measure>Change in Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Scores measured at baseline and at up-to 2 weeks after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire is a validated scale that is designed to measure 3 dimensions of human eating behavior: cognitive restraint of eating (Factor I), disinhibition (Factor II), and hunger (Factor III). The minimum score for factors I-II-III is therefore 0-0-0, and maximum possible score is 20-16-15. Higher scores in the respective scales are indicative of greater cognitive restraint (better), uncontrolled (worse), or emotional eating (worse).</description>
