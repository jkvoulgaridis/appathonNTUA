  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to improve quality of care for dental patients in the state of
      Michigan. This will be achieved through educating dentists about best practices for opioid
      prescribing and includes three continuing education (CE) credits and one (or two) academic
      detailing (AD) visits. The cohort of 90 dentists who are enrolled to the CE will be
      randomized into two groups upon enrollment. One of these groups, half of the cohort, will
      receive the academic detailing. A report will be written highlighting key findings from this
      project and best practices for treating patients after dental care.The quality of care for
      dental patients will be improved by sharing this information with both participating and
      non-participating dental providers statewide through reports, manuscripts, and presentations.
      These data will inform best practice with the potential for future academic detailing and
      educational interventions for dentists and oral surgeons.

    <description>In addition to continuing educational (CE) videos this group will receive up to two personalized, one-on-one, education sessions from an academic detailer. The sessions will last between 15-30 minutes. Each AD visit will consist of: an introduction, a brief needs assessment, key educational messages, a discussion of challenges the provider faces, and giving the provider leave-behind educational materials. The AD visit key educational messages are specific recommendations for opioid-prescribing practice change. When appropriate the detailer will suggest a phone call with Dr. Romesh Nalliah to discuss specific dentistry questions. There may also be a second AD visit if agreed upon by the dentist.</description>

    <description>Dentists enrolled in the CE program will serve as the control group. They will have access to the 3 hours of CE content online similar to the AD group; however, they will not receive academic detailing or the opportunity to connect via phone with Dr. Nalliah.
In this group, if the dentists have content-specific questions after participating in the CE program, they may contact MichiganOPENdental@umich.edu for responses appropriately directed to Dr. Nalliah.</description>
