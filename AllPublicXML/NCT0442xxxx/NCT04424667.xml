  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized double-blind clinical trial to compare the incidence of microbiological proven
      late onset sepsis in extremely preterm infants (&lt;1000 grams) that are supplemented with donor
      milk pasteurized by High Temperature Short Time (HTST) method versus the Holder method.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Donor milk pasteurized by an innovative High Temperature Short Time (HTST) system (patented
      by researchers) retains more immune and trophic compounds than pasteurized milk by
      traditional Holder method. These compounds are related to the protection conferred by breast
      milk against nosocomial sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm infants, so it would
      be of interest to study if there is a clinical benefit in these patients when health
      professionals are supplementing with donor milk pasteurized by both methods.

      The purpose of this study is to compare the incidence of microbiological proven late onset
      sepsis in newborns under 1000 grams that in the first 28 days of life need to be supplemented
      with donor milk pasteurized by HTST method versus the Holder method.

      This is a randomized double-blind clinical trial with parallel assignment. A total of 305
      premature babies with a birth weight of less than 1000 grams will be recruited, admitted to
      the Neonatology Services of the Hospital 12 de Octubre and the Hospital de La Paz and meet
      the inclusion criteria. Half of the patients will be supplemented exclusively with donor milk
      pasteurized by the HTST system and the other half with pasteurized milk by the Holder method.
      Linear generalized models will be used for longitudinal data analysis.
