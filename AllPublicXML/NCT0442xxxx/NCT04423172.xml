  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The exposure rate</measure>
    <time_frame>approximately two years</time_frame>
    <description>Exposure is defined as &quot;disruption of the device (using dye leak testing or water testing) or visible tissue dissemination&quot;.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean procedure time</measure>
    <time_frame>Within one day after the surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Mean procedure time will be measured by hour/minutes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The probability of failure during in-bag morcellation procedure</measure>
    <time_frame>approximately two years</time_frame>
    <description>Failure is defined as the operator's inability to successfully insert and extract the device.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Estimated blood loss during operation</measure>
    <time_frame>Within one day after the surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Blood loss during operation will be measured by volume (mL)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Post-operative pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Within one month after the surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The patients' post-operative pain will be measured by The Visual Analog Score （VAS).The maximum value is 10 and the minimum is 0. The lower score means a better outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of intra- or post-operative complications</measure>
    <time_frame>Three months after the surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Intra or post complications rate (e.g. urinary, intestinal or nerve injury)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Surgeon Task Load Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Within one week after the surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The Surgery Task Load Index will be measured by questionaire. The maximum value is 120 and the minimum is 0. The higher score means a worse outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Patients' life quality postoperative</measure>
    <time_frame>One months after the surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The patients' life quality will be measured by The World Health Organization's Quality of Life Questionnaire-Brief Version（WHOQOL-BREF).The maximum value is 120 and the minimum is 0. The higher score means a better outcome.</description>
