      weeks by a certified yoga instructor and an assistant. Participants will also instruct to
      practice yoga at home for 1 additional day per week and to record the dates and duration of
      practice at home. A manual will be given to the participants with written descriptions in
      both English and Urdu with pictures portraying each of the key yoga postures performed in the
      classes. Tips on how to practice each posture safely and comfortably and how to adapt each
      posture to improve incontinence and pelvic floor function will also be provided in the
