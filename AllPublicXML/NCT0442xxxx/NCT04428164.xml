  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Comfort can be a physical sensation, a psychological state, or both simultaneously (Pearson,
      2009). Patient comfort in an inpatient setting is a subjective state that varies from each
      individual based on different factors and situations. The Richards-Campbell Sleep
      Questionnaire (R-CSQ) (Emami, Heidari, &amp; Naseri et. al, 2019) and the Revised American Pain
      Society Outcome Questionnaire (APS-POQ-R) (Gordon, Palomino, &amp; Pellino, et. al, 2010) are
      tools that have been developed to assess patient satisfaction and comfort in the hospital
      setting. The R-CSQ is a scale used to measure different aspects of sleep quality. This scale
      allows the patient to rate their quality and amount of sleep on a scale of 0-100. The R-CSQ
      allows the patient to rate six different components of their sleep, including sleep depth,
      sleep latency, awakenings, returning to sleep, sleep quality, and noise. The APS-POQ-R can be
      utilized to measure perceived levels of pain in patients. The APS-POQ-R scale is a validated
      scale that is used in the hospital setting with reliable and consistent results. This scale
      measures five aspects of a patient's perception and experiences with pain and a sixth aspect
      including nonpharmacological interventions.

      We propose that if patients implement interventions that promote sleep and decrease pain,
      comfort will be improved.

      Aim(s)/Objective(s)

        -  Improve patient sleep during their hospital stay.

        -  Determine patient self-reported pain assessment using non-pharmacologic strategies.

        -  Determine if the &quot;patient toolkit&quot; improves patient experience of pain and sleep.

      Hypothesis 1. Primary Hypothesis Patients' experience of pain and sleep will improve with the
      implementation of interventions from our &quot;patient toolkit&quot;.

      .2. Secondary Hypothesis Patients will report an increase in sleep and a decrease in pain
      after use of the interventions provided in the &quot;patient toolkit&quot;.

      3. Tertiary Hypothesis Patients will report satisfaction with results gained through
      implementation of our &quot;patient toolkit&quot;.

      STUDY DESIGN

        -  60 to 80 medical surgical patients per campus (MCMC, MDMC, MMMC, MRMC) will be recruited
           to participate (total: 240 to 320 patients) Only adult medical surgical patients over
           the age 20 will be recruited.

        -  Quasi-experimental, pre-/post-test, repeated measures interventional study

        -  Length of patients hospital stay will determine length of intervention used; average
           estimate is a four-day length of stay

        -  Give pre-assessment the morning after first night of admission (Day 2)

        -  Participants will receive a toolkit upon informed consent completion that will include
           intervention strategies (eye mask; ear plugs; puzzle book; adult coloring book; colored
           pencils; aromatherapy patches; herbal tea bags) and data collection booklet for
           pre-survey, daily survey, and post-survey

        -  Data will be collected over 6 to 10 weeks to achieve desired number of participants

        -  Anticipated completion of study will be December 2020
