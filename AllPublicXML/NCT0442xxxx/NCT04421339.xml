  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in sleep quality, as assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 5, week 9</time_frame>
    <description>The PSQI is a 9-question instrument used to measure the quality and patterns of sleep in adults.
Scoring of the answers is based on a 0 to 3 scale, whereby 3 reflects the negative extreme on the Likert Scale. A global sum of &quot;5&quot;or greater indicates a &quot;poor&quot; sleeper.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Improvement in sleep quality, as assessed by the Huntington's disease (HD) sleep questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 5, week 9</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire contained 45 questions that focused on different sleep-related issues such as duration, quality of sleep, abnormal nocturnal behavior and quality of life.
The questionnaire has a total score of 19 points, scores of (0 - 3) represent the 'normal' range whilst, scores of (4 - 6) reflect 'mild' and scores of 7 and above indicate a 'significant' sleep disturbance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Improvement in daytime somnolence, as evaluated by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 5, week 9</time_frame>
    <description>The ESS is a questionnaire designed to measure the subject's general level of daytime sleepiness.
This scale scores from 0-24, with higher scores showing severe excessive daytime sleepiness.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Improvement in self-perceived cognitive function, as assessed by the Quality of Life in Neurological Disorders questionnaire (NeuroQOLv2.0) Cognition Function - Short Form</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 5, week 9</time_frame>
    <description>It is an 8-question instrument designed and validated to evaluate perceived difficulties in cognitive abilities (e.g., memory, attention, and decision making, or in the application of such abilities to everyday tasks (e.g., planning, organizing, calculating, remembering and learning).
The score ranges from 0-100, with higher scores meaning a better or worse outcome according to the domain evaluated.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Improvement in global cognitive functioning, as assessed by the Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 5, week 9</time_frame>
    <description>The MoCA was designed as a rapid screening instrument for mild cognitive dysfunction.
Scores on the MoCA range from zero to 30, with a score of 26 and higher generally considered normal.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Improvement in quality of life, as evaluated by the Huntington's Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire (HDQoL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 5, week 9</time_frame>
    <description>It is a disease-specific scale containing 40 questions, with answers including different types of frequency from &quot;never&quot; to &quot;all of the time&quot;.</description>
