  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of lenvatinib in HCC subjects who
      have progressive disease after first line treatment with checkpoint inhibitors.

      Approximately 20 subjects will be enrollment to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      lenvatinib.

      CT/MRI assessments will be made at end of first line treatment with checkpoint inhibitors,
      and every 8-12 weeks thereafter. Disease status will be determined at the site (ie.
      Investigator and/or radiologist) using RECIST version 1.1.

      The primary efficacy endpoint is response rate (RR) defined as proportion of subjects with
      SD/PR/CR per RECIST 1.1.

    <description>It is the sum of the proportion of stable disease (SD), complete response (CR) and partial response(PR) per RECIST 1.1. That is, RR = SD + CR + PR</description>

    <description>An adverse event (AE) refers to any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product, but which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. Number and classification of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0 were recorded.</description>
