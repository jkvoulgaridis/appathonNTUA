  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A 2-arm, parallel group, randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of adding two
      innovative &quot;wise&quot; social psychological interventions—growth mindset and self-affirmation—to a
      6-month usual care family-based, group behavioral intervention for weight control in children
      with obesity, to reduce body mass index trajectory over 12 months, compared to the usual care
      behavioral intervention alone.
