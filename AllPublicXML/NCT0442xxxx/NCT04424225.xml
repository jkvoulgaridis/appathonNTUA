      Aim 1a will test the acute impact of psilocybin on the strength of the psychophysical
      surround suppression effect.

      Aim 1b will test the acute impact of psilocybin on the strength of known surround
      suppression-related vERPs measured with EEG.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will address the critical need for more precise characterizations of the
      acute visual effects of the drug psilocybin by measuring the impact of acute psilocybin
      intoxication on a perceptual task known as visual surround suppression, compared to an active
      placebo control. The data collected in the proposed experiment will make important
      contributions to knowledge of how psilocybin impacts contextual processing in the brain.
      Moreover, this will in turn inform the neurobiology of visual surround suppression in
      general, providing the first investigation of links between surround suppression and
      serotonergic pathways in humans. Furthermore, the impact of psilocybin on surround
      suppression will complement recent discoveries of differences in surround suppression present
      in certain clinical populations. Taken together, these points suggest that this relatively
      simple and straightforward study could have significant payoff in its contribution to
      knowledge, not only of the effects of psilocybin but also of key brain processes underpinning
      human vision and context processing more broadly.

    <measure>Psychophysical Discrimination Threshold</measure>
    <time_frame>3-5 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Visual psychophysics tasks will consist of perceptual judgments (e.g., subject will report which of two visual stimuli presented appears to have higher contrast). Based on these responses, psychophysical discrimination thresholds are calculated using an adaptive staircase technique and reported in units of percent contrast.</description>

    <measure>Difference in Event Related Potential Amplitude</measure>
    <time_frame>3-5 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Electroencephalography (EEG) will be collected during a visual surround suppression task and event related potential (ERP) amplitudes (in units of microvolts/millisecond) will be compared for visual target stimuli in different stimulus conditions (e.g., with vs. without surrounding stimuli).</description>

    <measure>Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) Positive Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>approximately 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The positive and negative affect schedule is a self-report questionnaire that consists of two 10-item scales - positive and negative affect. Each item is rated on a 5-point scale of 1 (not at all) to 5 (very much). Positive scale score is calculated as the sum of items 1, 3, 5, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17, and 19. Scores range from 10-50, with higher scores representing higher levels of positive affect.</description>

    <description>The positive and negative affect schedule is a self-report questionnaire that consists of two 10-item scales - positive and negative affect. Each item is rated on a 5-point scale of 1 (not at all) to 5 (very much). Negative scale score is calculated as the sum of items 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 11, 13, 15, 18, and 20. Scores range from 10-50, with higher scores representing higher negative affect.</description>

    <measure>Revised Mystical Experience Questionnaire (RMEQ-30)</measure>
    <time_frame>approximately 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Revised Mystical Experience Questionnaire, a self-report of experiences associated with psilocybin use, contains 30 items rated on a scale from 0 (none; not at all) to 5 (extreme). From the report, 4 scores are produced - Mystical Experience, Positive Mood, Transcendence of Time and Space, and Ineffability.
The mystical experience score is calculated by summing 15 items scores and ranges from 0 to 75, with higher scores indicating a stronger mystical experience.
The positive mood score is calculated by summing 6 items scores and ranges from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating greater positive mood.
The transcendence of time and space score is calculated by summing 6 items scores and ranges from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating greater transcendence of space and time.
The ineffability score is calculated by summing 3 items scores and ranges from 0 to 15, with higher scores indicating greater feelings of ineffability.</description>

    <measure>Ego-Dissolution Inventory (EDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>approximately 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The ego-dissolution inventory (EDI) contains 16 items relating to altered ego-consciousness - 8 items relating to the experience of ego-dissolution and 8 items relating to the antithetical experience of ego-inflation. Items are rated using a visual analog scale that is converted to a numeric range from 0-100.
The ego-dissolution score is calculated as an unweighted average of the 8 items relating to the experience of ego dissolution. Scores for this subscale range from 0-100, with higher scores indicating greater ego dissolution.
The ego-inflation score if calculated as an unweighted average of the 8 items relating to the experience of ego inflation. Scores for this subscale range from 0-100, with higher scores indicating greater ego inflation.</description>
