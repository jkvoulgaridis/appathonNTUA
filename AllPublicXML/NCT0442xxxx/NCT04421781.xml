  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Retrospective monocentric analysis performed on patients treated with salvage HIFU for
      isolated macroscopic recurrence in the prostatic bed after radical prostatectomy and salvage
      or adjuvant EBRT. The oncological outcomes (treatment failure-free survival, progression-free
      survival), the adverse events and urinary incontinence will be evaluated.

    <measure>Oncological outcomes in the prostatic bed after S-HIFU for a local recurrence after RP and salvage or adjuvant EBRT.</measure>
    <time_frame>December 31, 2019</time_frame>
    <description>Oncological outcomes:
Treatment failure-free survival: absence of:
recurrent prostate cancer in the prostatic bed and/or
metastasis and/or
introduction of systemic treatment
Progression-free survival: absence of:
metastasis and/or
introduction of systemic treatment
decrease in PSA value: any drop in PSA after S-HIFU, regardless of whether there was subsequent PSA progression
BCR-free survival following S-HIFU defined as an absence of two rises in PSA ≥0.2 ng/mL above nadir
Functional outcomes:
complications (Clavien classification)
Urinary incontinence (Ingelman-Sundberg score)</description>

    <description>Patients were treated using dedicated post-EBRT parameters (5-s pulse, 5-s waiting period, 90% of the acoustic power). Between July 2005 and November 2018, at Edouard Herriot Hospital (Lyon, France), 22 consecutive patients were treated with S-HIFU for a local recurrence after RP and salvage or adjuvant EBRT. The oncological outcomes (treatment failure-free survival, progression-free survival), the adverse events and urinary incontinence were retrospectively reviewed.</description>

        Between July 2005 and November 2018, at Edouard Herriot Hospital (Lyon, France), 22

        prostatectomy and salvage or adjuvant EBRT. The oncological outcomes (treatment
        failure-free survival, progression-free survival), the adverse events and urinary

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  patient treated by S-HIFU for a single recurrence within the prostatic bed after an
             initial RP with curative intent with or without lymphadenectomy followed by salvage or
             adjuvant EBRT (with or without pelvic lymph node irradiation) combined or not with
             ADT;

               -  life expectancy of ≥10 years;

               -  histological local recurrence (positive biopsy),

               -  negative metastatic evaluation (All patients underwent multiparametric MRI
                  (mpMRI) to confirm the relapse in the prostatic bed and Choline PET/CT to exclude
                  metastasis (lymph node, visceral or bone metastasis).

               -  the use of ADT at BF after S-EBRT was not an exclusion criterion (ADT was
                  introduced by the centre referring the patient).

               -  no limits were placed on prostate cancer characteristics, PSA (value, doubling
                  time (PSA-DT)), Gleason score and location of suspected recurrence in relation to
                  the sphincter.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  patients who do not meet the inclusion criteria
