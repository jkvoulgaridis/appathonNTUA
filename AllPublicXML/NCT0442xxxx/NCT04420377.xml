  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the effects of L-carnitine tartrate, on muscle performance and
      recovery from intense exercise in participants undergoing resistance training. Measures of
      muscle performance will include isometric testing on the mid-thigh pull and ground reaction
      forces in the countermovement- and squat-jump. Markers of immune function will include
      salivary immunoglobulin A (IgA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Muscle damage will be
      assessed by plasma myoglobin (MYOB) and creatine kinase (CK). Perceptual measures will be
      assessed using a validated perceived recovery status (PRS) scale and muscle soreness scale.
      Additionally, the modified Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) will be administered
      following each training session to grade physical exertion and monitor progression of the
      training protocol. Blood lactate will be collected immediately prior to and after a
      standardized workout protocol during week 5 of the study.

      training protocol. Blood lactate will be collected immediately prior to and after a
      standardized workout protocol during week 5 of the study.

      In totality, the study will last 5-weeks, consisting of supplementation with moderate
      exercise performed 2 days per week, at home. Week 5 will consist of a pre-training
      assessments, an intense lower-body strength endurance training day, and subsequent testing 48
      hour testing (Post-Week 5). The baseline testing (will be performed on approximately 10
      subjects per day over the course of 4 days) and will consist of the following measures:

        -  DEXA (Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry) Body Composition Analysis

        -  Blood Draw

        -  Salivary Measures

        -  Isometric Mid Thigh Pull

        -  Force Plate Mechanography

        -  Visual Analog Scales

      For the first 4 weeks of training, participants will be asked to workout 2 days per week at
      home.

      On Monday of week five, 20 subjects will be assessed on the following measures:

        -  DXA

        -  Blood Draw

        -  Salivary Measures

        -  Isometric Mid Thigh Pull

        -  Force Plate Mechanography

        -  Visual Analog Scales

      On Tuesday of week 5, the 20 subjects that tested on Monday, will go through an intense lower
      body, strength endurance protocol, and the left over 20 subjects will go through the
      following assessments:

        -  DXA

        -  Blood Draw

        -  Salivary Measures

        -  Isometric Mid Thigh Pull

        -  Force Plate Mechanography

        -  Visual Analog Scales

        -  Before and After the workout - Finger Prick Blood Sample

      On Wednesday of week 5, the 20 subjects that tested Monday, will have a day to rest. The 20
      subjects that tested Tuesday, will go through an intense lower body strength endurance
      protocol.

        -  Before and After the workout - Finger Prick Blood Sample (for blood lactate)

      On Thursday of week 5, the 20 subjects that tested Tuesday will have the day off, while the
      20 subjects that tested Monday will be assessed on the following measures:

        -  Blood Draw

        -  Salivary Measures

        -  Isometric Mid Thigh Pull

        -  Force Plate Mechanography

        -  Visual Analog Scales

      On Friday of week 5, the 20 subjects that tested Tuesday will be assessed on the following
      measures:

        -  Blood Draw

        -  Salivary Measures

        -  Isometric Mid Thigh Pull

        -  Force Plate Mechanography

        -  Visual Analog Scales

      Participation will be sought from 80 male and female subjects ranging from 18 to 65 years old
      who are active (i.e. 30 minutes per week of moderate activity classified as greater than 50 %
      of their heart rate (HR) max 3 days â€¢ week-1). Two cohorts of 40 subjects will be examined in
      the study.

      The supplement will be administered as a dose of 2g of Carnipure (L-carnitine), per day for
      the duration of the study. Placebo and treatment conditions will be administered in visually
      identical capsules. Statistical analysis will be carried out on the entire study population
      and on the female study population independently.
