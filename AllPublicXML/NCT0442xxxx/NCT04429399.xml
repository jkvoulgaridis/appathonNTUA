  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The perfusion of the deeply different areas coexisting in ARDS lung generates two type of
      venus-admixure : true shunt and shunt effect. Briefly, true shunt and shunt effect are
      related to non-aerated and poorly-ventilated lung areas perfusion respectively. Practically,
      it is not possible to quantify the true shunt and the shunt-effect directly, but we can
      measure the &quot;total-shunt&quot;, i.e. the sum of two kind of venus-admixured. As it is known from
      classical physiology, the effects of FiO2 variations on PaO2 are deeply different depending
      on the type of venous admixures. In the case of a patient with virtually only true shunt, any
      FiO2 variation will not modify the PaO2. On the other hand, in a patient with virtually only
      a shunt effect, increasing the FiO2 the PaO2 will progressively increase. Indeed, ventilating
      a patient presenting only a shunt effect (without true shunt) with pure oxygen will generate
      a &quot;normal&quot; P/F ratio. In patients ventilated with high PEEP levels it is difficult to predict
      based on the P/F ratio the relative amount of true shunt and shunt effect. However, patients
      presenting a significant shunt effect when ventilated with higher PEEP level would likely
      have &quot;unstable&quot; poorly aerated lung areas that need PEEP to remain opened. In those patients,
      a PEEP-weaning protocol based on the P/F ratio could induce significant alveolar
      de-recruitment and clinical deterioration. On the contrary, patients with less shunt effect
      would be likely less prone to alveolar de-recruitment and would benefice from PEEP decrease.

      the investigators set up a study to test the hypothesis that patients presenting a
      significant shunt effect when ventilated with higher PEEP levels could be prone to
      significant alveolar de-recruitment at the PEEP weaning attempt. To do so, the investigator
      has to measure the total shunt at higher PEEP level in patients ready to be weaned from the
      PEEP (according to the Mercat protocol), at three FiO2 levels (i.e. 0,3, 0,6 and 1). The
      shunt effect is quantified as the difference in total shunt between FiO2 0,3 and .The
      hypothesis of this study is that the shunt effect could predict alveolar de-recruitment when
      weaning PEEP.
