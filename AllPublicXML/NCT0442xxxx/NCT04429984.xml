    <description>An Adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence (including a symptom or disease or an abnormal laboratory finding) in a participant or clinical investigation participants administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment being given. An SAE is any event that results in: death; life-threatening; requires inpatient hospitalisation or results in prolongation of existing hospitalisation; persistent or significant disability/incapacity; a congenital anomaly/birth defect or a medically important event. AEs include serious adverse events, unexpected AEs, non-serious adverse events (AEs).</description>
