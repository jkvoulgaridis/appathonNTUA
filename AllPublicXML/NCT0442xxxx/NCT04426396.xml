  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a blind evaluation, self-control, multicenter clinical trial. 340 patients who need
      selective operation to evaluate the function of coronary artery were selected and measured
      with ctffr and FFR. The data of the experimental group was defined as: FFR value at the
      distal end of stenosis was obtained by calculating the original DICOM data of coronary CT
      angiography (CCTA) before operation with the non-invasive blood flow reserve analysis
      software of Hangzhou ArteryFlow Technology Co., Ltd. The gold standard group data is the
      clinical measured FFR (clinical gold standard) at the stenosis lesions. It is defined that
      when the coronary artery reaches the maximum congestion state, the pressure value at the
      distal end of the stenosis lesions is accurately measured by the guide wire with a pressure
      sensor, and the ratio value with the coronary mouth pressure is the FFR. By comparing the
      data of the experimental group and the data of the gold standard group, the effectiveness and
      safety of the devices in the experimental group were evaluated.
