  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of Individualized Meta-Cognitive
      Training (EMC +), in people with psychosis of brief evolution on symptoms, especially on
      positive symptoms. Secondary aims would be to assess the effect of EMC+ in metacognition,
      psychosocial and neuropsychological functioning, and to assess the maintenance of program
      effects on 6 months.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized clinical trial in which some patients receive the EMC+ and others
      treatment as usual.The evaluator will be blind to the group to which the patients belong. The
      sample for the overall project will be a total of 70 people with a diagnosis of psychotic
      spectrum, less than 5 years of experience and with a score =&gt; 3 positive PANSS (last month)
      and treated in one of the participating institutions. The evaluation was performed at
      baseline, at post-treatment and at 6 months follow up. Symptoms, metacognition, psychosocial
      and neuropsychological functioning were assessed.

      The EMC consists of 10 therapeutic units with weekly sessions of 45-60 minutes. The material
      available for the Individualized Metacognitive Training (EMC) program is made up of
      power-point presentations.

    <measure>Jumping to conclusions. (Brett-Jones et al. 1987).</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Three different computer tasks were used in the study. In Task 1, jars contained balls of two different colors; in one of them the proportion was 85 black versus 15 orange balls and in the other the ratio was reversed. Task 2 was the same as Task 1 but with a proportion of 60:40 in each jar. Finally, Task 3 was similar to Task 2 but instead of balls, the jars contained positive or negative comments with a proportion of 60:40. The patients had to decide which to jar belonged the extracted balls or comments. At all times the participants had information about the balls previously extracted, in order to control the effect of memory. The subjects could remove as many balls as needed to make their final decision (Garety et al., 2005). JTC was considered as taking a decision after extracting 1 or 2 balls.Dichotomous: yes/no. A &quot;yes&quot; represents a worse outcome</description>

    <description>The Beck Cognitive Insight Scale. this scale is a self-registering measure of 15 items .which evaluates how the patients assess their own judgement. It has two dimensions; self-reflection (R) (9 items), and self-certainty (C) (6 items). A compound index of cognitive insight is obtained as the subtraction of self-certainty from self-reflection (R-C).Range: 0-45. Higher values represent a better outcome</description>

Personalizing Bias (PB) indicates the proportion of external attributions for negative events which are personal as opposed to situational. A PB score of greater than 0.5 therefore represents a greater tendency to use personal rather than situational external attributions for negative events.</description>

    <description>A Movie for the Assessment of Social Cognition. Spanish Validation. 46 multiple-choice questions about the emotions, thoughts or intentions of the protagonists.
Only one answer out of four is correct. The four choices of each answer include, (1) correct attribution of ToM to the characters of the film, (2) excessive ToM errors (a mental state that is attributed when there is no reason to), (3) reduced ToM errors (a present mental state that is not attributed) and (4) total absence of mental inference (a physical causality attribution instead of a mental state). These errors could be classified as overmentalization, undermentalization and absence of mentalization.</description>

    <description>MCT+ combines the process-oriented approach of metacognitive group training with elements of individual cognitive-behavioral therapy.
The metacognitive training program is comprised of 10 modules targeting common cognitive errors in schizophrenia. (Moritz et al, 2013).
The modules are: 1:Therapeutic alliance, 2: Introducyion to MCT+, 3:Disease model, 4: Attributional style, 5: Decision making, 6: Changing beliefs, 7: Empathizing, 8: Memory, 9: Depression and self-steem, 10: Relapse prevention.
The treatment consist of 10 weekly sessions of 45-60 minutes.</description>
