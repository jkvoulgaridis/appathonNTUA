  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tympanic membrane perforations are common medical problem that encounters a lot of patients
      in all age groups.

      The gold standard for treatment of perforations is tympanic membrane closure procedure
      (tympanoplasty) which is done under general anesthesia.

      This procedure could be problematic for many patients who are not suitable for general
      anesthesia due to their medical status.

      It's also time consuming for the patient and for the medical system, since it takes a lot of
      time to reach the operation room and hospitalization for at least two days.

      The purpose in this study is to use Tachosil (Fibrinogen based patch) under local anesthesia
      to close tympanic membrane perforations.

      Tachosil is in use for hemostasis and for tissue repair after injury. Tachosil is bound to
      the tissue and form a waterproof membrane. In the setting of ENT clinic and under local
      anesthesia, the investigators will start the procedure with debridement of the tympanic
      perforation edges, then they will close the perforation using two pieces of Tachosil under
      and above the perforation in the right form (active side to the active side).

      If the results will be similar to tympanoplasty results, this method may be used for closure
      of tympanic perforation and save time and money for the patient and for the health system.

      Tympanoplasty is the gold standard treatment for tympanic membrane perforation.

      It is done under general anesthesia in the following form:

      Incision in the post auricular area, harvesting of fascia and cartilage from the concha of
      the pinna .

      In Trans ear canal approach starting with debridement of the edges of the tympanic membrane
      perforation and closing the perforation using cartilage and fascia.

      After being informed about the study and potential risks, all patients giving informed
      consent will participate in the study.

      This study will include two groups. The first group will be treated with the conventional way
      as described above. The interventional group will be treated using Tachosil in the following
      order:

      Local anesthesia using Lidocadren (lidocaine and epinephrine) will be injected to the ear
      canal using dental needle.

      Debridement of the edges of the tympanic membrane perforation Placing the tachosil under and
      above the perforation in the correct order. The patient could be discharged home immediately
      after the procedure if no adverse effects are seen (dizziness, nausea or vomiting).

      After one month, similar to the conventional treatment method, the patient will be invited to
      the otology clinic, for hearing test and microscopic examuntaion of the tympanic membrane, to
      see if the perforation is closed.

      The study will compare the success rate in the two groups and if it will be similar that will
      help publish this method and use it in patients who are not suitable to general anesthesia
      and in hospitals were waiting time table for operation room is very long.
