      This study is a phase II single-arm clinical study.The purpose of this study was to evaluate
      the efficacy and safety of carrelizumab combined with apatinib mesylate and standard
      chemotherapy (pemetrexed plus carboplatin) in patients with advanced non-squamous and
      non-small cell lung cancer who have failed tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy and are
      ALK-positive.
