  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our hypothesis is that the doxorubicin eluting-beads currently used in hepato-oncology might
      be applicable to high-grade prostate cancer before radical prostatectomy.

      The primary objective of this Phase IIa pilot study is to evaluate the safety of performing
      prostate embolization with doxorubicin eluting-beads according to different loading doses.
      Four dose levels will be tested: doxorubicin-free beads to test the effect of embolization
      alone, 2.5 mg of doxorubicin (1/20 of the dose administered for liver cancers), 5 mg and 10
      mg of doxorubicin.

      The secondary objectives of the study are to evaluate the tolerance (functionnal
      questionaries at D0, D14 M1 and M3; collection of complications at D1, D5, D14, M1, M3; MRI
      at D14), evaluate the systemic diffusion of doxorubicin (doxorubinemia at D1), evaluate an
      early anti-tumor effect of the treatment (via a prostate-specific antigen test at D14 M1, M3
      and magnetic resonance imaging at D14), describe the distribution of beads observed on the
      surgical specimen and evaluate the dose effect at 1 month and 3 months after surgery (via a
      prostate-specific antigen test at D14, M1, M3 and magnetic resonance imaging at D14).

    <intervention_model_description>This is a purely descriptive, non randomized, non controlled, prospective sequential-type pilot study on the first use in the indication for prostatic arterial embolization using beads loaded with doxorubicin in increasing doses: 0 mg, 2.5mg, 5 mg and 10 mg. It is a study with escalating doses of doxorubicin : 3 patients with non-loaded beads, 3 patients with beads loaded at 2.5 mg (1/20 of the dose administered for liver tumors), 3 patients with beads loaded at 5mg and 3 patients with beads loaded at 10mg.</intervention_model_description>

It is the most commonly-used validated, multidimensional, self-administered questionnaire to evaluate erection difficulties (Rosen, Althof &amp; Giuliano 2006). It consists of 15 questions covering 5 areas: erectile function (questions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 15),satisfaction regarding sexual activity (questions 6,7 and 8), orgasm (questions 9 and 10), sexual desire (questions 11 and 12), overall satisfaction (questions 13 and 14).

    <description>The International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-6 ) score was developed and validated in 96-97 by Pfizer then adopted by the WHO as the gold standard for judging the efficacy of treatment for erection difficulties evaluated as part of clinical trials. It is the most commonly-used validated, multidimensional, self-administered questionnaire to evaluate erection difficulties (Rosen, Althof &amp; Giuliano 2006). It consists of 15 questions covering 5 areas: erectile function (questions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 15),satisfaction regarding sexual activity (questions 6,7 and 8), orgasm (questions 9 and 10), sexual desire (questions 11 and 12), overall satisfaction (questions 13 and 14). Patients must respond to the questionnaire based on their own experience over the last 4 weeks.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have given written informed consent.

          -  Patients must be affiliated to or benefit from a health insurance scheme.

          -  Patients with a high-risk prostate cancer with a Gleason score of 9-10 on the biopsy,
             candidate for a multimodal treatment with radical prostatectomy validated at the
             multidisciplinary meeting.

          -  Patients with a normal blood count.

          -  Patients with a normal liver function test.

          -  Patients with an electrocardiogram including left ventricle ejection fraction
             (ventricular scintigraphy or echocardiography) and an echocardiogram allowing us to
             rule out heart disease.

          -  Patient must be completely recovered from acute toxicities (such as stomatitis,
             neutropenia, thrombopenia and generalized infections) caused by a previous cytotoxic
             treatment.

          -  OMS/ECOG score≤1 (to guard against a possible loss of therapeutic opportunity related
             to a delay in surgery caused by chemo-embolization).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are taking part in another study.

          -  Patients in an exclusion period determined by a previous study.

          -  Patients under legal guardianship, curatorship or tutorship.

          -  Patients not in condition to be able to express his consent (e.g. patient undergoing
             psychiatric treatment with mental disorders)

          -  Patients who refuse to sign the consent form.

          -  Patients for whom it is impossible to give clear information. • Patient already has a
             metastatic disease.

          -  Patients who have contraindications for surgery.

          -  Patients with a rectal or vesicular collateral pathology that cannot be excluded or a
             collateral penile pathology which, by precaution, would not allow embolization
             (unknown effect on the erection in the event of arterial exclusion).

          -  Patients with a contraindication for magnetic resonance imaging (pacemaker
             incompatible with MRI, claustrophobia, metal apparatus, total hip prosthesis).

          -  Patients with a past history of aortobifemoral bypass procedure or other vascular
             surgery making endovascular access to the prostate arteries impossible.

          -  Patients with irreversible hemostasis disorder: TP &lt; 50%, TCA &gt; twice the control,
             Platelets &lt; 60 G/L.

          -  Patients with contraindications as mentioned in the Summary of Product Characteristics
             for Doxorubicin.
