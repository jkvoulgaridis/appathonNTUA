  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ImmuneSense Lyme is a study, which is designed to better understand the immune response to
      Lyme disease. This is critically important because the immune system may be able to tell us
      important information about how our own bodies detect and respond to the disease that current
      tests cannot. De-identified data collected from this study may accelerate the development of
      better diagnostics for Lyme disease and improve outcomes for many.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Cohort 1:

          -  Participants at or above the age of 7

          -  Arm A: Participants with an EM rash ≥ 5 cm (confirmed by Lyme disease independent
             expert) with or without other signs and symptoms of Lyme disease

          -  Arm B: Participants who do not have an EM rash &gt;/= 5 cm (either not confirmed by a
             Lyme disease independent expert or lacking a rash), but who have signs and symptoms
             suggestive of Lyme disease that warrants further testing, such as, but not limited to
             fever, myalgias, malaise, lymphadenopathy, rigors, arthralgias, peripheral and
             radiculoneuropathy, encephalopathy, intermittent arthritis, meningitis, heart block,
             carditis, etc

        Cohort 2:

        - Individuals in general good health, who reside in Lyme disease endemic regions

        Cohort 3:
