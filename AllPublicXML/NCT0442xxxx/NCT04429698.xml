  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: When used with standard diagnostic testing, point-of-care ultrasonography (POCUS)
      might improve the proportion of patients admitted with chest pain (CP) who are correctly
      diagnosed, decrease length of stay (LOS) in emergency department (ED) and costs. We therefore
      assessed POCUS for the heart, lungs, aortic, hepatobiliary and deep vein in addition to the
      usual initial diagnostic testing in this patient population.

      Methods: In a prospective, randomised-controlled, parallel-group trial in the ED at Sakarya
      University Training and Research Hospital, Turkey, patients (≥18 years) with CP were randomly
      assigned in a 1:1 ratio to a standard diagnostic strategy (control group) or to standard
      diagnostic strategy supplemented with POCUS (POCUS group).
