  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Efforts in curing and preventing obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) have been elusive thus
      far. One reason for that is the lack of understanding of the role of the brain in the
      development and treatment of the disease. In recent studies, the hypothalamus was identified
      as part of a brain network including higher cognitive regions that is particularly vulnerable
      to insulin resistance. Furthermore, the central insulin response in this network predicted
      food craving and hunger. In this project, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is
      implemented as a tool to stimulate brain networks. The investigators hypothesize that
      stimulating the hypothalamus-cognitive network will enhance insulin sensitivity and reduce
      food intake, food craving and hunger. Furthermore, the project will provide the unique
      opportunity to investigate novel mechanisms of insulin resistance in participants who have
      been extensively metabolically characterized.

      Objectives The overarching aim of the study is to stimulate the hypothalamus-cognitive brain
      network to improve insulin sensitivity and eating behavior.

      Specific Objectives

        1. Implement tDCS stimulation compared to sham stimulation in overweight and obese adults
           to assess the impact on eating behavior, cognition and metabolism.

        2. Evaluate whether 3-day non-invasive brain stimulation of the hypothalamus-cognitive
           network has a causal effect on metabolism.

        3. Evaluate whether 3-day non-invasive brain stimulation has a significant effect on brain
           functional connectivity and diffusion parameters.
