  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to identify physiologic and molecular mechanisms that underlie
      hypoglycemia in the absence of diabetes (or medications that can cause hypoglycemia) and to
      investigate potential genetic and microbiome differences which contribute to hypoglycemia. We
      will test the hypothesis that hypoglycemia in the absence of diabetes is linked to genetic
      variation or the microbiome, and identify whether additional medical history or diagnoses are
      enriched in the population of patients with hypoglycemia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although there are several conditions which have been identified that cause, or contribute to
      hypoglycemia, diagnosis can be challenging, as the physiologic, and molecular mechanisms are
      incompletely understood. Additionally, treatment options are relatively limited, and often
      incompletely effective and/or not well tolerated. Investigating the causative factors and
      mechanisms of hypoglycemia is important therefore in improving our understanding in order to
      develop new and more effective approaches to treatment.

      The current study aims to:

        1. more fully characterize clinical history and demographics in patients with diverse forms
           of hypoglycemia by creating and analyzing a patient database;

        2. for a subset of patients, characterize metabolic and hormonal responses to a standard
           meal;

        3. analyze DNA variants in individuals with hypoglycemia;

        4. analyze differences in the intestinal microbiome in individuals with hypoglycemia.

      DNA will be stored for additional expanded genotyping, depending on results of targeted
      resequencing. Fecal samples and /or cultures from them may be used for mouse transfer
