  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label phase II, single-arm, biomarker multi-institutional pilot study. Men
      with progressive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who have been
      treated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and at least one prior second generation
      AR-targeted therapy (either abiraterone or enzalutamide) will be enrolled in this study. All
      patients will receive treatment with testosterone cypionate 400 mg, intramuscular, every 28
      days for a maximum of 3 cycles or limiting toxicity, if it occurs before the end of the
      scheduled therapy. After 3 cycles of BAT (12 weeks), patients may continue receiving this
      therapy off study at the discretion of the treating physician, if clinical/radiographic
      benefit.

      During the study period, patients will have plasma collected for cell-free tumor DNA analysis
      and CTC ARV7 status and also will perform 68Gallium-PSMA PET at baseline and then every 6
      weeks.

             concern over fracture risk, severe and extensive spinal metastases with concern over
             spinal cord compression, extensive liver metastases).

          -  Concurrent use of other anticancer agents or treatments, with the following

             MRI.

               -  Cardiac failure NYHA (New York Heart Association) III or IV.
