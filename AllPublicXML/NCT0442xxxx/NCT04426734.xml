  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This a prospective study review of the clinical efficacy of DEXTENZA for the treatment of
      anterior uveitis compared to the standard of care topical corticosteroid treatment
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with anterior uveitis are typically treated aggressively with every 1-2 hour (while
      the patient is awake) potent topical steroid agents, during initial stage of inflammation,
      and evaluated at frequent intervals, with a schedule of steroid tapering dictated by clinical
      response. The most common topical corticosteroid prescribed for the treatment of anterior
      uveitis are prednisolone acetate 1%, dexamethasone 0.1%, prednisolone sodium phosphate 1% and
      Difluprednate 0.05%. However, topical treatments are limited by the potential for patient
      non-adherence and variation in drug concentrations due to the intermittent or suspension of
      use nature of application. A corticosteroid insert placed in the inferior and superior
      canaliculi provides the advantages of reliable and continuous drug delivery for 24 hours a
      day for 30 days without the need for patients to adhere to a treatment regimen. Dextenza is a
      sustained-release dexamethasone intracanalicular insert recently approved by the FDA for pain
      and inflammation post ophthalmic surgery. Dextenza was shown to decrease inflammation and
      pain compared with placebo following cataract surgery in a multicenter randomized clinical
      trial.

    <description>The area of the punctum is first anesthetized with eye drops. A localized injection of lidocaine in perform once the surface of the punctum is numbed with the eyedrop. After 5-10 minutes, the corner of the eyelid and the region of the punctum will be fully anesthetic. The upper and lower punctum are then dilated with a punctum dilator to facilitate the insertion of the DEXTENZA medication. The DEXTENZA medication is then inserted using smooth forceps into the dilated opening of the upper and lower punctum. Once the DEXTENZA is inserted into the both the upper and lower punctum, the procedure is down. No repeated insertion of the DEXTENZA is required for the study.</description>
