  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the trial is to evaluate the safety, determine the recommended phase 2 dose,
      and assess preliminary clinical activity of GEN1044 in subjects with solid tumors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial is an open-label, multi-center safety trial of GEN1044. The trial consists of two
      parts: a dose escalation part (phase 1) and an expansion part (phase 2a). The expansion part
      of the trial will be initiated once the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) has been determined
      from phase 1.

        Breast Cancer (TNBC), Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck (SCCHN), Non-small Cell
        Lung Cancer (both adenocarcinoma (ACC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (NSCLC/ACC and
        NSCLC/SCC), Bladder Cancer.

                  allogeneic bone marrow transplant, or stem cell rescue within 3 months prior to

               9. Serious, non-healing wound, skin ulcer (of any grade), or bone fracture.

          2. Any history of intracerebral arteriovenous malformation, cerebral aneurysm, new or
             symptomatic brain metastases or stroke.

          3. Prior therapy:

             Radiotherapy: Radiotherapy within 14 days prior to first GEN1044 administration.
             Palliative radiotherapy will be allowed.

          4. Treatment with an anti-cancer agent (within 28 days or after at least 5 half-lives of
             the drug, whichever is shorter), prior to GEN1044 administration. Toxicities from
             previous anti-cancer therapies that have not resolved.

          5. Has a history of ≥ grade 2 cytokine release syndrome (CRS) with other CD3-based
             bispecifics, or a history of ≥ grade 3 allergic reactions to monoclonal antibody
             therapy as well as known or has known allergies, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to
             GEN1044 or its excipients.
