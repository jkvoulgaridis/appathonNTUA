  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of itraconazole on
      pharmacokinetics of healthy Chinese adult subjects after oral administration of SHR6390
      tablets. The secondary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety of SHR6390 alone and
      when co-administered with itraconazole. The exploratory objective of the study is to explore
      the effect of SHR6390 related metabolic enzymes and transporter gene polymorphisms on the
      pharmacokinetics of SHR6390.
