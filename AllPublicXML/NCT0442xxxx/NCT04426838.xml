  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Disturbed sleep is stressful to persons living with dementia (PLwD) and their caregivers. It
      contributes to earlier placement of the PLwD in nursing homes and increase the risk for many
      psychological and cognitive health issues and poor quality of life for both the PLwD and the
      caregivers. Given the potential harmful side effects of medications, non-medication
      alternatives, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBTi), may be safer to
      improve disturbed sleep in this population. CBTi which includes stimulus control, sleep
      compression, relaxation, sleep hygiene, and cognitive restructuring, is effective and has
      durable and sustained effects on sleep outcomes over the long-term. CBTi has improved sleep
      disturbances in PLwD and their caregivers, separately. Since disturbed sleep in the
      PLwD-caregiver dyad is bidirectional and interdependent, targeting the pair as a unit for
      intervention has the potential to lead to improved sleep and health outcomes for both
      persons. There is no current published research on CBTi when the PLwD and their caregivers
      receive the intervention at the same time; as a result, the researchers will examine the 1)
      feasibility; 2) acceptability; and 3) preliminary efficacy of 4-week CBTi intervention for
      community-dwelling PLwD and their caregivers who are both experiencing sleep disturbances.
      Forty PLwD-caregiver dyads will be randomized to face-to face or videoconferencing sessions.
      Preliminary efficacy of the intervention will be assessed using objective (actigraphy) and
      subjective sleep quality measures. In addition, semi-structured interviews will be conducted
      to examine the acceptability and satisfaction with the intervention.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 71% of the persons living with dementia (PLwD) and 70% of their caregivers experience
      sleep disturbances, which are distressing for both the PLwD and their caregivers.
      Specifically, PLwD often experience restlessness and fragmented sleep, which in turn can
      affect caregivers' sleep patterns leading to multiple nightly awakenings, shorter sleep
      duration, and/or inconsistent sleep-wake times. These disturbances increase the risk for a
      myriad of psychological, cognitive, behavioral, and physiological health issues and poor
      quality of life for the dyad. Given the interdependence of the dyadic sleep disturbances and
      the negative health consequences of sleep disturbances on the dyad, there is a critical need
      to develop and provide effective interventions to improve their sleep. Pharmacologic
      treatment often results in potential harmful side effects like falls and cognitive decline;
      therefore, non-pharmacologic approaches are recommended for this population.

      Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTi), a non-pharmacologic intervention that has
      demonstrated effectiveness for improving sleep disturbances in multiple populations, is
      delivered in various formats including face-to-face and videoconferencing. Individually, PLwD
      and caregivers have successfully deployed behavioral sleep techniques, resulting in improved
      sleep quality. However, there is no current published research on CBTi completed
      simultaneously by the PLwD-caregiver dyad, and that is exactly what we seek to do with
      early-stage individuals and their caregivers. We premise this effort on the notion that a
      dyadic intervention can use early-stage individuals' retained capacity for communication and
      comprehension to establish in-the-moment agreements about strategies the caregiver can employ
      to enact and facilitate positive sleep behaviors in the PLwD and to pair that with acquired
      strategies to engender his/her own positive sleep behaviors.

      This project seeks to gather formative and preliminary data on CBTi delivered simultaneously
      to the PLwD-caregiver dyad. The researchers will use a quantitative, descriptive approach to
      determine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a 4-session CBTi
      intervention administered to 40 PLwD-caregiver dyads randomized to face-to face or
      videoconferencing sessions who will receive the intervention as a unit. Participants will be
      recruited through the Alzheimer's Association and the Goizueta Alzheimer's Disease Research
      Center at Emory University. Objective and subjective sleep, depressive symptoms, and
      cognitive health data will be collected at baseline, and 1 week and 3 months post-completion
      of the intervention.

      In community-dwelling PLwD and their caregivers where both persons in the dyad self-report
      sleep disturbances, the specific aims for this study are:

        1. Assess the feasibility of a face-to-face or video conferencing dyad-based CBTi
           intervention.

        2. Evaluate the acceptability of a face-to-face or video conferencing dyad-based CBTi
           intervention.

        3. Examine the preliminary efficacy of face-to-face or video conferencing CBTi intervention
           on sleep quality outcomes including sleep efficiency and perceived sleep quality.
