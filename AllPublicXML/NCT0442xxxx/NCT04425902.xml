  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single sequence study that is being conducted to investigate the
      potential drug-drug interaction (DDI) when GSK3640254 is co-administered with a cocktail of
      cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes and transporter probe substrates in healthy participants. This
      study will aid in understanding these interactions and resulting changes in exposure (if any)
      when drugs that are metabolized via these pathways are given in combination with GSK3640254.
      The study will consist of a Screening period and 3 sequential treatment regimens.
      Participants will be administered a single dose of probe substrate drugs (caffeine 200
      milligram (mg), metoprolol 100 mg, montelukast 10 mg, flurbiprofen 100 mg, omeprazole 40 mg,
      midazolam 5 mg, digoxin 0.25 mg and pravastatin 40 mg) on Day 1, followed by washout of 10
      days. Participants will then receive GSK3640254 200 mg once daily on Days 11 to 20 followed
      by co-administration of probe substrate drugs with GSK3640254 on Day 21. The total duration
      of the study will be approximately 54 days including Screening. Approximately 20 participants
      will be treated in the study.
