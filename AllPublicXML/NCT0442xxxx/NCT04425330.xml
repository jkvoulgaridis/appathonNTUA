  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Myelomeningocele is a severe type of spina bifida, resulting from improper closure of the
      neural tube. This condition drastically affects the structures of the spinal cord, as a
      result the spinal cord, nerve roots and meninges are exposed during pregnancy resulting in
      deficiencies. The combination of these deficiencies results in an overall decrease in
      mobility and functional participation. There is little evidence about physical therapy
      interventions in this population. However, it is known that the International Classification
      of Functionality, Disability and Health for Children and Youth is a useful tool to assist
      therapists in analyzing problems and thinking about the focus of the intervention. The
      current literature demonstrates that resources such as low intensity light, also known as
      photobiomodulation as a therapeutic means, can be auxiliary means in the rehabilitation of
      neurological conditions, as studies show that photobiomoduction promotes sensory and motor
      recovery in the animal model of spinal cord injury . And a clinical trial showed that after
      photobiomodulation treatment combined with photobiomodulation, individuals with spinal cord
      injuries improved motor and sensory function. Therefore, the objective of the study is to
      evaluate the effects of physical therapy associated with photobiomodulation on functional
      performance in children with low and sacral lumbar myelomeningocele. Materials and methods:
      Participants will be recruited at the Integrated Health Clinic of University Nove de Julho.
      Those who meet the inclusion criteria will be randomized to two groups using a randomization
      site (randomization.com). Group 1 will be submitted to active PBM and physiotherapeutic
      exercises. Group 2 will be submitted to sham PBM and physiotherapeutic exercises. The
      irradiation will be carried out with an LED with a wavelength of 850 nm, energy per point of
      25 J, 50 seconds per point and a power of 200 mW. in the placebo group the device will not
      emit light. The objectives of the physiotherapy exercises will be performed according to the
      goals and objectives of the child / guardian. Muscle activity will be assessed using a
      portable electromyography (BTS Engineering) and as a measure of functionality the
      sit-to-stand task will be performed. The electrodes will be positioned on the muscles:
      lateral gastrocnemius, anterior tibial and rectus femoris. To assess the functional
      independence of children, the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory will be used.
      Quality of life will be assessed using the Child Health Questionnaire - Parent Form 50. The
      sensory evaluation will be performed using the Semmes-Weinstein kit (Smiles®). Protein
      expression of BDNF will be quantified from saliva samples using the ELISA technique. The data
      will be analyzed with the aid of GraphPad PRISM version 7.0

    <masking_description>Participants will not know whether which group they are participating in, that is, treatment group or placebo with photobiomodulation.
The evaluator and who will perform the exercises will not know which group the participant is participating in relation to photobiomodulation.
A therapist who will not participate in assessments and physiotherapy sessions will perform the application of photobiomodulation.
The microtubes with the saliva samples will be marked with numbers corresponding to each participant, so the evaluator will not know which group the sample corresponds to. A therapist will be responsible for the assessment and electromyography scales.</masking_description>

    <description>Muscle activity will be assessed using a portable electromyography (BTS Engineering) synchronized to the BST EMG analyzer system. As a measure of functionality, the sit-to-stand task will be performed.
The electrodes will be positioned on the muscles: lateral gastrocnemius, anterior tibialis and rectus femoris.
For the assessment of the sit-to-stand the participant will be positioned in a chair with 90º flexion of the hip, knee, ankle and supported feet.
An assessment will be carried out with the child sitting at rest. Afterwards, the child will be asked to stand up and remain in an upright position for 10 seconds. Afterwards the child will be asked to sit down. The repetition of the sit-to-stand task will be performed 3 times with an interval of 5 minutes.</description>

    <description>The sensory evaluation will be performed using the Semmes-Weinstein kit (Smiles®), which is a set of six nylon monofilaments of the same length that exert force on the specific area tested. Each monofilament has a different color and diameter: green (0.05 g), blue (0.2 g), violet (2 g), red (4 g), orang (10 g) and magenta (300 g) 16. The score ranges from seven (green monofilament) to 1 (magenta monofilament).18 The test will be performed on the following dermatomes: L1, L2, L4, L5, S1, S2 and S3.</description>

    <description>To assess the functional independence of children, the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory (PEDI) will be used. This child assessment tool assesses functional performance, in terms of capabilities (functional skills) and performance of what the child actually does in response to the environment (the amount of caregiver assistance needed to perform daily tasks) in three domains: self-care, mobility and social function. This inventory was translated into Portuguese and culturally adapted to take into account Brazilian socio-cultural specificities.</description>

    <description>The evidence on the effectiveness of physical therapy in children with myelomeningocele is limited. The International Classification of Functionality, Disability and Health for Children and Youth is a useful tool to assist therapists in analyzing problems about the focus of the intervention. The evidence in physical therapy practice for individuals of all ages with neurological disorders, focuses on 5 Ps: prevention, prediction, participation, personalized and plasticity. Thus, neurological physiotherapists must perform the care with a focus on preventing the patient's disabilities, predicting the ideal response of an intervention, through measures of results of the movement system. In addition, it is of paramount importance that the goal of rehabilitation is that people with neurological disabilities are fully included and participate in life activities that are important to them and that their care is personalized. All of these measures facilitate the process of positive plasticity.</description>

    <description>Photobiomodulation occurs from the application of low intensity light such as low intensity laser and light emitting diode (LED). The therapeutic effectiveness of phototherapy is based on the absorption of photons by photoreceptors or chromophores. Studies on the experimental model of spinal cord injury have shown that both wavelengths have the potential to be an effective and non-invasive means of therapy, promoting axonal appearance, increased concentration of glial cells and nerve connections, in addition to functional and sensitive. The findings of a clinical trial involving individuals diagnosed with spinal cord injury demonstrate that PBM exerted positive effects on motor function, especially during isotonic contraction of stimulated muscles assessed by electromyography, and there was a recovery in sensory perception and muscle strength.</description>
