      The aim of this study is to investigate dietary, lifestyle and psychosocial changes possibly
      occurred during Italy's lockdown, that is in the period of time between March 9 2020 and May
      3 2020 (hereafter referred to as the Phase 1 lockdown) in two different populations: the
      Moli-sani Study cohort and the Italian general population.

      The containment measures released by the Italian Government for the period between March 9-
      May 3 2020 have been aimed to reduce the movement of people from their homes, which was only
      allowed in cases of special need, and the use of smart work (working from home) wherever
      possible .As a consequence, the lockdown period is likely to have lasting effects on people
      and their lifestyles, especially nutrition, and psychosocial well-being.

      A web-based questionnaire was developed to retrospectively investigate dietary, lifestyle and
      psychosocial changes possibly occurred during Italy's lockdown, that is in the period of time
      between March 9 2020 and May 3 2020 (hereafter referred to as the Phase 1 lockdown).

      The potential impact of Phase 1 lockdown on lifestyles will be tested in two distinct
      population cohorts, that is the Moli-sani Study cohort (established among residents in the
      Molise region in the period 2005-2010) and a sample of the general Italian population, aged â‰¥
      18 years.
