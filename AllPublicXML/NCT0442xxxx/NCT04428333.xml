  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate if the addition of GSK3359609 to pembrolizumab in
      combination with 5FU-platinum based chemotherapy improves the efficacy of the pembrolizumab
      combination with 5FU-platinum based chemotherapy in participants with recurrent or metastatic
      (R/M) head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). This randomized, double-blinded, Phase
      II/III study will compare the combination of GSK3359609 with pembrolizumab and 5FU-platinum
      chemotherapy to placebo in combination with pembrolizumab and 5FU-platinum chemotherapy in
      participants with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC of the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx
      or larynx. Approximately 640 participants will be enrolled in the study.
