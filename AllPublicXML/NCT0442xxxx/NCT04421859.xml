  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A team at the National Healthcare Group Eye Institute in Singapore have developed an
      augmented reality mobile phone application, EyeCU, to simulate glaucoma progression and
      enhance understanding about the disease and its course. It is a bilingual (English/Spanish)
      application that is free-to-download on the Android and Apple app store. As eye care
      physicians in the South Bronx, the investigators are hopeful that the findings in this study
      can be extrapolated to our patients in the South Bronx, where poor health literacy,
      non-adherence to glaucoma medication and poor follow-up remains a large barrier. The
      investigators hope that by offering the simulation in both English and Spanish, the
      investigators will not only be able to improve our patients' understanding of glaucoma, but
      also improve glaucoma treatment adherence and assess our patient population's responsiveness
      to augmented reality as an educational platform.

      Experimental design: Pilot cohort study

      Sample size: Initial test population will be confined to 54 patients

      Proposed study time period: January 2020-July 2021

      Data collection: Patient characteristics such as age, sex, ethnicity, preferred language, zip
      code, employment status, highest educational attainment, current topical eye medications,
      Past Ocular History, Past Medical History

      Recruitment for participation in the study will be performed via leaflet by clinic
      coordinator during glaucoma clinic registration.

      Consent will be conducted by clinic coordinator or another member of the research team who is
      not directly involved in the participant's clinical care.

      Pre-intervention glaucoma knowledge questionnaire (NEHEP glaucoma knowledge questionnaire)
      will be given to participants, to be completed on dedicated clinic tablet device.

      Post-intervention glaucoma knowledge questionnaire (NEHEP glaucoma knowledge questionnaire)
      will be given to participants, to be completed on dedicated clinic tablet device.

      Rate of missed glaucoma follow-up appointments before and 6 months after application use will
      be collected from the electronic medical record.

      Rate of medication adherence before and 6 months after application use will be collected from
      the electronic medical record.
