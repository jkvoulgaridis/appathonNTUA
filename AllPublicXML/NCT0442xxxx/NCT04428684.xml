  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The comparator drug (Zoladex 3.6 mg) is approved for use as a thinning agent for the
      endometrium prior to endometrial ablation. The dosing recommendation is one or two depots
      with each depot given four weeks apart. When two depots are administered, surgery should be
      performed within two to four weeks following administration of the second depot.

      The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate non-inferiority of a generic formulation
      of goserelin 3.6 mg as compared to Zoladex ® 3.6 mg on endometrial thinning prior to surgery.
      The study is an open label, multicenter, prospective, parallel group randomized study.

      Blind for Sponsor, ultrasound assessment, testing labs and statistician, the study will be
      performed in premenopausal women with dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB) eligible for
      endometrial ablation. Patients will be randomized in a 1 to 1 ratio to receive either the
      Peptigroupe test product (Pepti 3.6 mg) or Zoladex® 3.6 mg for a treatment of 8 weeks (two
      injections).

      Ultrasonic measurement of endometrial thickness will be performed on screening and on days 0
      (pre-injection), 28 (pre-injection) and 42 (pre surgical procedure).

      The pharmacodynamics profile will be tabulated at the end of the study on the basis of the
      following data:

        1. Estradiol

        2. LH and FSH as additional information on hormone response

      Goserelin safety profile will be assessed throughout the study on the basis of the following
      assessments:

        1. Treatment-emergent AEs

        2. Physical examinations

        3. Vital signs

        4. 12-Lead ECG

        5. Laboratory parameters (i.e., biochemistry, haematology, and urinalysis)
