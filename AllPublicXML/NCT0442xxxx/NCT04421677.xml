  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study (phase 1 clinical trial) to evaluate the safety and tolerability of
      phenylbutyrate in IBM. In this open label study, 10 patients with sporadic inclusion body
      myositis will be treated with phenylbutyrate (3 gm twice daily) for 3 months. There will be a
      run-in period, during which certain biomarkers will be measured at baseline and at the end of
      the run-in period in addition to final measurement at the end of the treatment period.

    <measure>Safety and Tolerability of Phenylbutyrate Measured by Incidence of Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 3 - Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>Since this is a Phase I pilot trial, the primary outcome will be testing the safety and tolerability of phenylbutyrate in patients with Inclusion Body Myositis. This will be measured by the incidence of adverse events reported in subjects throughout the treatment period of the trial.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Inclusion Body Myositis Functional Rating Scale (IBMFRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>The IBMFRS is a quickly administered (10-minute) ordinal rating scale (ratings 0-40) used to determine patients' assessment of their capability and independence in 10 functional activities. The higher a subject scores on the scale, the better functional ability the subject has.</description>
