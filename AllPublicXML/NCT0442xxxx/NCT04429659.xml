    <textblock>
      To investigate changes in refractive errors and evaluate clinical outcomes of strabismus
      surgery in patients with both amblyopia and partially refractive esotropia (PAET).Amblyopic
      patients with PAET were enrolled. Non-amblyopic patients with full refractive accommodative
      esotropia (RAET) were included in the study as a control group. Preoperative and
      postoperative best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), spherical equivalent (SE), astigmatism,
      stereoacuity and deviations at near and distance were evaluated and statistically compared in
      the patient group. The mean BCVA, SE, astigmatism were compared between the patient and the
      control groups.

      Purpose: To investigate changes in refractive errors and evaluate clinical outcomes of
      strabismus surgery in patients with both amblyopia and partially refractive esotropia (PAET).

      Material-Method: Amblyopic patients with PAET were enrolled. Non-amblyopic patients with full
      refractive accommodative esotropia (RAET) were included in the study as a control group.
      Preoperative and postoperative best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), spherical equivalent
      (SE), astigmatism, stereoacuity and deviations at near and distance were evaluated and
      statistically compared in the patient group. The mean BCVA, SE, astigmatism were compared
      between the patient and the control groups.
