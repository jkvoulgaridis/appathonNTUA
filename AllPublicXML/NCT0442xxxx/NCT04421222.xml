  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, clinical research study of EPI-7386, an investigational drug being studied
      as a treatment for patients with prostate cancer. All patients in the study will receive
      EPI-7386.

      Since this is the first study of EPI-7386 in humans, there is no information about how it
      affects people or what dose should be used. Therefore, the main purpose of this study is to
      assess the safety (side effects) of EPI-7386 and to find a dose that can be given without
      unacceptable side effects.

      There are other important things that will be evaluated during the study:

        -  How the amount of EPI-7386 in the blood changes over time.

        -  The effect of EPI-7386 on prostate cancer.

        -  The effect of EPI-7386 on certain substances in the body.

        -  The possibility that EPI-7386 can interact with other drugs.
