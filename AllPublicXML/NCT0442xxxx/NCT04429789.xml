  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a single-center, single-blind three-group randomized (1:1:1) controlled
      trial (RCT) comparing two hypnosis interventions to waitlist control efficacy for MS-related
      fatigue.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This project will test the efficacy of two different hypnosis approaches for improving
      MS-related fatigue that have shown to be beneficial for individuals with cancer and other
      medical conditions in the management of their symptoms. One of these methods, the
      active-alert hypnosis has helped people to manage fatigue and may have important advantages
      over the more traditional relaxation hypnotic approaches in the treatment of fatigue, since
      the hypnotic inductions and the self-hypnosis methods use activation instead of relaxation.
      Therefore, the goals of this study are to determine if a comparison study of these two
      hypnotic conditions is feasible, and, if so, to determine which treatment may be more
      effective for helping individuals with MS gain more control over fatigue. Additionally, it
      will explore the mechanisms of these two approaches to hypnosis treatment to determine which
      might be most helpful to individuals with MS and fatigue.

    <masking_description>Research assistant administering the telephone assessments is blinded to participant treatment intervention while the clinician conducting the treatment sessions is blinded to participant responses provided during telephone assessments. The only instance where we may unblind staff members to assessment or treatment data (depending on what the staff member is responsible for) will be at the end of the study, after data collection has been completed. At that point, the staff member conducting telephone assessments may be allowed to know which interventions participants were assigned to, and the clinician conducting treatment sessions may be allowed to access assessment data if a staff member were to assist in data cleaning or data analysis. Participants are blind to study hypotheses and will not be told which intervention is expected to yield what results. Participants may be unblinded if/when we disseminate findings (e.g., in a published manuscript) related to this study.</masking_description>

    <description>Participants in this arm will continue their usual care for fatigue. The therapist will notify participants assigned to Usual Care via the participant's preferred mode of communication (phone, U.S. mail, or email). People assigned to usual care will be encouraged to continue using the health care services available to them to address their fatigue. The study therapist will emphasize the importance of completing the outcome assessments. Following the completion of their final assessment (3 month follow-up); these individuals will be offered their choice of the two hypnosis treatments.</description>

    <description>Participants in this arm will receive four one-hour weekly sessions where participants will learn how to use hypnosis along with relaxation. The exercises and suggestions included in the training will be adapted from the protocol used in a series of studies on the efficacy of self-hypnosis training for the management of chronic pain in persons with disabilities, and from a therapist guide of procedures and hypnotic suggestions for chronic pain.</description>
