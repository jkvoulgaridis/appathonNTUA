    <textblock>
      An observational clinical trial in a single centre. The objective of this study was to
      determine the efficacy of mandibular advancement device (MAD) therapy on snoring intensity,
      frequency, and oxygen desaturation periods in mild-moderate obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)
      patients with snoring problems. Totally, 18 mild-moderate OSA patients (8 females and 10
      males) with subjective snoring complaint were selected. Each patient's diagnostic
      polysomnographic analysis (PSG) was accepted as initial PSG values. Each patient was
      subjected simple pulse oximeter (SPO) and smartphone sleep application (SSA) at 3 different
      nights at home. Diagnostic mean values of oxygen desaturation index (obtained by using SPO),
      snoring intensity score (obtained by using SSA), and snoring percentage (obtained by using
      SSA) were recorded. Non-titratable-customized MAD with 60-75% of maximal mandibular
      protrusion were fabricated. The patients were instructed to wear their MAD every night. SPO
      and SSA measurement were repeated at the 1st, 4th, 12th, and 24th week of the treatment
      process. At the 24th week of treatment, The PSG were repeated and all PSG, SPO, and SSA
      values were compared with initial diagnostic values.

    <measure>Change from Baseline Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) at 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline and in 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>AHI was defined as total number of apnea or hypopnea events which lasts for at least ten seconds per hour during full nigth polysomnography (PSG) and accepted to be the main physiological sleep parameter in the present study. The AHI values were used for the evaluation of the severity of OSA and the MAD's treatment success in OSA patients</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Mild-moderate OSA patients for MAD treatment</arm_group_label>
    <description>Patients are classified as mild Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) if they have between 5-15 Apnea-Hypopnea Index, moderate if they have between 15-30, and severe if they have &gt;30, as measured by Polysomnography (Epstein LJ, Kristo D, Strollo PJ, et al. 2009). The principal treatment methodology for OSA patients is positive airway pressure. In patients with mild to moderate OSA, oral appliances such as mandibular advancement devices (MAD) is alternately indicated (Ramar K, Dort LC, Katz SG, et al. 2015) The American Academy of Dental Sleep Medicine (Ramar K, Dort LC, Katz SG, et al. 2015) recommended titratable-customized MADs for patient comfort and the ability to permit modifications in the amount of mandibular protrusion for treatment efficacy. However, Aarab et al (Aarab G, Lobbezoo F, Hamburger HL, Naeije M. 2010) demonstrated similar therapeutic efficiency of non-titratable-customized MADs in the treatment of OSA</description>

    <intervention_name>Non-titratable-customized mandibular advancement device</intervention_name>
    <description>The most comfortable protruded mandibular position situated between 60-75% of MMPV was determined according to patient response with 6mm of the vertical interocclusal dimension between maxillary and mandibular central incisors and registered. The upper and lower acrylic resin splints were secured to each other in the posterior region with auto polymerizing acrylic resin and NTC-MADs were obtained. The patients were instructed to wear their non-titratable-customized mandibular advancement device every night.</description>
