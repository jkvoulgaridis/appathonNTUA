  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Dance for Diabetes program was designed as a community service project for the North
      Carolina Albert Schweitzer Fellowship. The purpose of this research is to evaluate the
      effectiveness of the project and its impact on participants. This study will assess whether a
      group dance workshop along with diabetes education can help people with diabetes and
      prediabetes.

    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study that will be testing whether or not a group dance workshop is useful
      and effective. If it is, the study team will refine the workshop model and do additional
      dance classes in the future. This research study will involve attending a dance workshop
      twice a week for 2 months using an online, video-conferencing computer application.
      Participants will also receive information about exercise and how to manage their diabetes.
      Participants will receive a phone call every two weeks during the 2 months to assess their
      experience. Study participants will also be asked to complete surveys at the beginning and
      end of the 2-month session, as well as 1 month and 2 months after the classes end.

A normal A1c level is below 5.7 percent</description>
