  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, crossover study enrolling experienced dual cannabis-tobacco smokers
      (N=18) to describe the differences in THC and toxicant exposure, examining pharmacokinetic,
      subjective, and cardiovascular effects from smoking and vaping dry herb cannabis. This study
      will also examine the differences in toxicant exposure and cardiovascular disease risk
      between smoking cannabis and smoking tobacco cigarettes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Experienced dual cannabis-tobacco smokers will participate in a within-subject crossover
      study with three blocks: smoked cannabis (purchased by participants from a local dispensary),
      dry herb cannabis vaporizer, and usual brand tobacco cigarette. Each block will consist of 2
      consecutive days on an inpatient research ward. The first inpatient day of each block will
      comprise of two sessions: (1) The first session will be a standardized bout to compare
      pharmacokinetic, physiologic, and subjective effects of cannabis and tobacco use; (2) after 6
      hours of abstinence, the second session will be ad libitum access to the assigned product for
      2 hours to compare subjective effects (reward, satisfaction, craving reduction) and use
      patterns. The second inpatient day will consist of ad libitum use of the assigned product
      from 8:00 AM to midnight. An abstinence day will be added after the second day of the last
      block to assess exposure and effects biomarkers during a period of abstinence from cannabis
      (smoked/vaped) or tobacco.
