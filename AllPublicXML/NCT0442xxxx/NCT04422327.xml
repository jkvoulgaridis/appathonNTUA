    <textblock>
      This study aimed to assess the impact of consumption of COMBO, a combination product of two
      Bifidobacterium longum strains, on stress, mood and bowel symptoms in adults with Irritable
      Bowel Syndrome (IBS).

      This is an open label study designed to assess the impact on stress, mood and bowel symptoms
      &amp; safety of COMBO, a combination of Bifidobacterium longum 35624® and Bifidobacterium longum
      1714™ strains, when consumed once daily for 8 weeks, in adults with Irritable Bowel Syndrome
      (IBS). Volunteers will be screened according to the selection criteria in order to identify
      up to 40 female subjects, with recurrent abdominal pain/discomfort and mild to moderate
      stress/mood status. The study will involve 6 visits over an 18 to 20-week period [Screening
      period (Visit 1: week-2), Intervention period (Visit 2: week 0, Visit 3: week 4, Visit 4:
      week 8), and Follow-up/ Washout period (Visit 5: week 12, Visit 6: week 16)]. Participants
      will fill in daily and weekly eDiary from 1st visit onwards. Questionnaires will be
      administered from visit 2 to visit 6. Research blood and saliva will also be collected at
      these time points. Stool sample will be collected at Visit 2, 4, 5, 6.
