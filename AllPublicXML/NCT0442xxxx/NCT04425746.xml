  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of afamelanotide
      (previously developed as CUV1647) as adjunctive therapy in patients undergoing photodynamic
      therapy using porfimer sodium.

    <description>Quality of life, as measured by the Short Form-36 Health survey (SF-36) (quality of life questionnaire). The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability.</description>
