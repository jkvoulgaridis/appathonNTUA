  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the prevalence of tissue homologous recombination
      repair (HRR)-related gene mutations (positive/negative/Variant of uncertain significance
      (VUS)), clinical outcome such as prostate-specific antigen-progression free survival
      (PSA-PFS), overall survivals (OS) and treatment pattern in mCRPC patients.

      &lt;Methods&gt; Study design: multi-center, prospective cohort study

      Data Source(s):

      In this study, 155 patients (expected recruitment patients: maximum 205 patients) will be
      enrolled from approximately 20~30 sites in Japan. Study Population: mCRPC patients who
      diagnosed between 2014 and 2018. Exposure(s): N.A Outcome(s): Prevalence of tissue
      HRR-related gene mutations, clinical outcomes such as Over survival and PSA-PFS, Treatment
      pattern

      Sample Size Estimations:

      The target population is 155 patients based on the prevalence of HRR-related genes (BRCA1,
      BRCA2 and ATM) which is reported in previous global study (PROfound study).

      Statistical Analysis:

      This study is not intended to verify specific hypotheses, and the results are evaluated
      descriptively. There is no plan of interim analyses before the final analysis.

      An archived formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) sample, ten slides and 10 μm in thickness
      on uncharged slide be used for HRR-related gene mutation testing in principle. And also, ten
      10 μm slides is sent to Myriad with one 3-5 micron on a charge slide for the HE
      staining(Hematoxylin and eosin staining) which is continuous with the slice for HRR-related
      gene mutation. These contents include with a sample of &gt;25 mm2 in section area containing a
      ≥30% tumor nuclei preferred (≥20% tumor nuclei accepted). If patients have some tumor samples
      at multiple points, the latest sample is preferred to use HRR-related gene mutation testing.
      And other tumor sample is acceptable to use HRR-related gene mutation testing if test is
      failed.

        The target population is mCRPC patients who diagnosed between 2014 and 2018 and be
        confirmed to be succeeded HRR-related gene mutation analysis with archived primary or
        metastatic tumor sample. As median of expected overall survival of mCRPC is 2.5 to 3 years
        from diagnosis, follow up period is enough to measure outcomes including survival. The
        baseline period is set to calculate overall survival and to detect clinical outcome at
        least half. The patients will be enrolled consecutively to this study.
