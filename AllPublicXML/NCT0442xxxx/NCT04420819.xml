    <textblock>
      Introduction: eccentric exercise (EE) has been widely used in rehabilitation and in improving
      physical fitness due to its mechanical advantage and less metabolic demand, however, EE can
      induce muscle damage providing structural changes and reduced muscle function, therefore, it
      is necessary to look for alternatives to reduce this damage caused by stress. Thus, ischemic
      preconditioning (PCI) can be seen as an aid in reducing the damage caused by EE, as it can
      attenuate the ischemia-reperfusion injury, and can be used to accelerate the post-exercise
      recovery process. Objectives: to compare the effects of PCI, using different occlusion
      pressures, on acute and late responses to perceptual outcomes and muscle injury markers, in
      addition to checking whether the technique causes deleterious effects on performance in
      post-exercise recovery. Methods: a randomized placebo controlled clinical trial will be
      conducted with 80 healthy men aged 18 to 35 years who will be randomly divided into four
      groups: PCI using total occlusion pressure (POT), PCI with 40% more than POT, placebo (10
      mmHg) and control. The PCI protocol will consist of four cycles of ischemia and reperfusion
      of five minutes each. All groups will perform an EE protocol, initial assessments,
      immediately after the end of the EE, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours after exercise, with the maximum
      isometric voluntary contraction (CVIM) assessed by the isokinetic dynamometer, vectors of
      cell integrity by by means of electrical bioimpedance (BIA), creatine kinase (CK), blood
      lactate, pain on the visual analog scale (VAS), pain threshold by the pressure algometer,
      muscle thickness by ultrasound and tone, muscle rigidity and elasticity by myotonometry. The
      descriptive statistical method and analysis of variance will be used for the repeated
      measures model. The level of significance will be p &lt;0.05.
