  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and performance of thoracic and/or
      lumbar spine surgery using the MLX and XLX ACR interbody implants as measured by reported
      complications, radiographic outcomes, and clinical patient outcomes. This study is being
      undertaken to identify possible residual risks and to clarify mid- to long-term clinical
      performance that may affect the benefit/risk ratios of the MLX and XLX ACR interbody
      implants.

    <textblock>
      Patients considered for this study will have previously undergone surgery for their spinal
      condition according to the standard of care of the practitioner. All patients at a given site
      with surgeries that meet eligibility requirements will be included in the study and available
      progress notes, medical records, patient-reported outcomes (PROs), radiographs, and
      complications will be obtained from the medical records.

      The safety and performance of the MLX and XLX ACR interbody implants will be assessed using
      the following:

        1. Complications attributable to the use of the associated interbody implant as noted in
           surgical summaries, progress notes, and hospital records

        2. Neurologic status, symptoms, and subject self-reported clinical outcomes (e.g., pain and
           disability), as available

        3. Radiographic outcome (fusion) and description of device status from plain film
           radiographs and computed tomography (CT) scan(s), as available

      <textblock>
        At least 90 (75 MLX, 15 XLX ACR) subjects will be enrolled in this multicenter study by at
        least four investigative sites. A site may have more than one surgeon investigator
        contributing to the total site enrollment. As a retrospective study, enrollment goals will
        be determined with the surgeon investigator during site selection by the Sponsor and will
        be based on available case volume. The site will identify potential subjects who are more
        than three months from the surgery postoperative time point during the study duration for
        inclusion in the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who were ≥18 years of age at the time of surgery

          2. Underwent spine surgery using either MLX or XLX ACR interbody implant (NuVasive, Inc.,
             San Diego, CA) at:

               1. One or two adjacent thoracic and/or lumbar levels for degenerative disc disease
                  or degenerative spondylolisthesis, or

               2. Any number of thoracic and/or lumbar levels for degenerative scoliosis (defined
                  as &gt;10º coronal curve)

          3. Interbody fusion with autograft and/or allograft (i.e., cancellous and/or
