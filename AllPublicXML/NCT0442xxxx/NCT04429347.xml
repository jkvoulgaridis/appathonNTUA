  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, crossover trial aimed at assessing
      the effect of gabapentin and tizanidine, two pain medications, on insomnia in chronic pain
      patients.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain and insomnia are highly prevalent conditions affecting 10-25% and 6-10% of the
      general population, respectively. Importantly, these two conditions frequently co-occur, with
      50-80% of chronic pain patients reporting sleep disturbances. Identifying medication that
      alleviates pain and insomnia simultaneously may help reduce risks associated with
      polypharmacy, including drug-drug interactions.

      In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, crossover trial, gabapentin and
      tizanidine, two drugs which are respectively commonly used to treat neuropathic and
      musculoskeletal pain, will be compared to each other and to placebo in their ability to
      alleviate insomnia in chronic pain patients.

      In each week, patients will receive 3-night (Friday-Sunday) trials each of placebo,
      gabapentin or tizanidine in a randomized, double-blind order and will monitor their insomnia
      using the Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS) questionnaire (adapted to fit the time frame of this
      trial). The primary outcome consists of the difference in mean AIS scores between the 3
      treatments at the primary time point, which is Monday of each week (after 3 nights of drug
      intake).

      Patients will also monitor their sleepiness, pain relief and overall improvement as secondary
      variants using the Stanford Sleepiness Scale (SSS), Visual Analog Scale (VAS), and Patient's
      Global Impression of Change (PGIC) questionnaires respectively.

      Scores on the Monday preceding the first treatment will serve as baseline and the period
      between treatments (i.e. Monday-Thursday nights) will serve as a 4-day washout period between
      treatments.

      Our hypothesis is that gabapentin and tizanidine will both be more effective than placebo in
      alleviating insomnia in chronic pain patients but will not be different from one another.
