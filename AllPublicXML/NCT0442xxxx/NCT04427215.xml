      During cancer treatment, several patient experience substantial psychological distress,
      mainly depression and anxiety, which can persist over years after completion of treatment.
      These psychological impairments can aggravate symptom burden and can seriously affect
      health-related quality of life. Likewise, the diagnosis of cancer has not only a significant
      impact on the affected patients, but also on their families, and may cause emotional
      responses of shock, doubt, anxiety, and depression.

      Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has been in use among cancer patients for a long
      time and several types of CAM that are practiced in various parts of the world. In the
      general among Lithuanian adult population, the use of CAM begins to seem common and the
      country claim for guidelines researches and to test the effectiveness of this practice to
      support the use of some CAM therapies on mental health of patients as well as their families.

      In the St. Francis Oncology Center in Klaipeda some CAM have been applied aimed to increase
      the recovery and quality of life in the patients and their families. The effectiveness of
      different CAM therapies (Dance/movement therapy, Art Therapy, Music Therapy, Bibliotherapy
      and Physical Activity ) on mental health and recovery of cancer patients as well as on
      caregiving experiences and mental health of partners of cancer patients, it will be of great
      value to improve and provide a more effective service and the quality of caring in this
      patient as well as the continuing work of the Francis Oncology Center in Klaipeda and
      partners, with more higher scientific excellence and quality .
