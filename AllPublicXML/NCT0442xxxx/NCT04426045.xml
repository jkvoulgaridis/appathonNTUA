  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adequate pain control after total hip arthroplasty is crucial for early ambulation and
      patient satisfaction. The supra-inguinal fascia iliaca compartment block has been described
      as a promising technique for primary total hip arthroplasty. However, one of the concerns
      with supra-inguinal fascia iliaca compartment block is still the potential for quadriceps
      weakness that might delay ambulation. The pericapsular nerve group (PENG) block has been
      recently introduced a new technique for blockade of the articular branches of the femoral,
      obturator and accessory obturator nerves. PENG block is possible to provide sufficient
      analgesia and preserve lower limb muscle strength. The investigators will compare
      ultrasound-guided supra-inguinal fascia iliaca compartment block with PENG block in patients
      undergoing total hip arthroplasty.

    <description>A curvilinear 2-5MHz ultrasound probe will be initially placed in a transverse plane over the anterior superior iliac spine and then aligned with the pubic ramus by rotating the probe counterclockwise approximately 45 degrees. In this view, the iliopubic eminence, the iliopsoas muscle and tendon, the femoral artery, and pectineus muscle will be observed. A 22-gauge, 80-mm needle will be inserted from lateral to medial in an in-plane approach to place the tip in the musculofascial plane between the psoas tendon anteriorly and the pubic ramus posteriorly. A total volume of 20 ml of ropivacaine 0.2% will be injected.</description>

    <description>A linear 6-13-MHz ultrasound probe will be placed in the sagittal plane to obtain an image of the anterior superior iliac spine. The fascia iliaca and sartorius, iliopsoas, and oblique internal muscles will be identified by sliding the probe medially. After identifying the &quot;bow-tie sign&quot; formed by the muscle fascias, a 22-gauge, 80-mm needle will be introduced 1 cm cephalad to the inguinal ligament. Using an in-plane approach, the fascia iliaca will be penetrated and hydrodissected, separating the fascia iliaca from the iliac muscle. A total volume of 30 ml of ropivacaine 0.2% will be injected.</description>
