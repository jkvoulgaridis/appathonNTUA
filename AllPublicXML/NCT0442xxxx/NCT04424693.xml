  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preeclampsia is a significant medical condition occurring in 3-8% of pregnancies and impacts
      deleteriously both maternal and fetal health. An important discovery has been made by Dr
      Craig D Scoville showing that early Tdap vaccinations in pregnancy can reduce the incidence
      of preeclampsia by more than 50%. A prospective clinical research trial is proposed and
      urgently needed to validate this finding and thereby make a significant contribution in
      reducing the incidence of this common and severe complication of pregnancy.

    <textblock>
      A double blinded randomized prospective clinical research study is proposed to validate the
      hypothesis that Tdap vaccinations at week 28 in pregnancy can reduce the incidence of
      preeclampsia by more than 50%. This project will recruit 1600 pregnant women with appropriate
      informed consent in the first trimester of pregnancy, obtain detailed obstetric and health
      history, and then randomize these subjects so 800 women receive Tdap at week 28, and 800
      women receive Tdap at week 36, and all women will be followed during their pregnancies using
      standard of care with special attention to preeclampsia and fetal outcomes. Blood samples
      will be obtained at weeks 12, 20, and 36 in order to test the anti-tetanus toxoid antibody
      levels, anti-diptheria antibody levels, anti-pertussis antibody levels, and also maternal
      cytokines (IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNFa, IL-17, and IFNg), and placental biomarkers (sFlt-1,
      sEng, and PIGF) for preeclampsia on those patients who develop preeclampsia and compare to
      those who didn't and thereby better understand the biomarkers of preeclampsia and devise a
      better formula for positive prediction for preeclampsia. To make this change in clinical
      practice and save lives, this study is asking for funding from NICHD PA-18-480.

    <masking_description>Each study site will designate an &quot;injection nurse&quot; who will be responsible for preparing both placebo and Tdap administration and will be the only one knowing when a patient gets either Tdap injection at week 28 or placebo injection at week 28, or gets Tdap injection at week 36 or placebo injection at week 36. This person will be the only one at each site who will know the randomization of each subject and is the only one who will administer the injection. Every subject will receive Tdap either at week 28 or week 36 and receive placebo injection on the other injection time.</masking_description>
