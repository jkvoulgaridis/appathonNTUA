  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study the participant will be invited to be seated in the self-measurement kiosk
      after registration in the Emergency department. In this kiosk, the participant will be
      measuring their own vitals and answering a short questionnaire regarding the reason for
      presentation. All these results are displayed on a screen for the triage nurse. Based on the
      results, high-risk patients will be highlighted on the screen, so they may be seen faster.

  <detailed_description>

      The questionnaire entails questions which would otherwise be asked by the triage nurse,
      regarding reason for presentation, fever, pain and and possible allergies. This is done
      through a touch-screen.

      The vital signs and potential alarm symptoms from the (multilingual) questionnaire are being
      displayed with the pain score on a screen in the triage room and at the nurses desk. An
      adapted Early Warning Score (aEWS - without respiratory rate) is calculated from the vital
      signs. Abnormal results are being highlighted and carried up on the screen to the top
      position. This enables the triage nurse to pick up the sicker participants in the waiting
      room faster. The measurements are valid, so they do not have to be repeated by the triage
      nurse.

      Users will be contacted afterwards regarding satisfaction of use
