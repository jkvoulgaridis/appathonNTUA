  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence and mortality rates of breast cancer are still increasing in both developing
      and developed countries. The number of women ≥70 years who are affected by breast cancer (BC)
      worldwide is also on the increase. Based on the largest population and increasing aging, BC
      is also rapidly increasing among the elderly in China. According to the epidemiological
      profile data regarding BC in China, the second onset age peak of BC morbidity occurred after
      70 years old and in 2020, the proportion of patients older than 65 is expected to exceed
      one-fifth and reach 27.0% by 2030. However, some controversies remain to be resolved due to
      the lack of high quality evidence. The tumor biological behavior, treatment choice and
      treatment tolerance among the elderly prominently differ from their young counterparts.
      Besides, they are rarely enrolled in large-scale randomized clinical trials or prospective
      cohort studies and the results are obtained mainly from retrospective studies. Also, frequent
      deviations from the standard guidelines lead to insufficient or excessive treatments, though
      the so-called standard guidelines are based on the clinicopathological characteristics and
      research findings among the younger BC patients. Studies focusing on the global population
      confirmed that the biological behavior of tumors among elderly patients was more favorable
      compared with younger patients but did not transform into survival benefits eventually.
      Numerous prospective, randomized trials have demonstrated that breast conserving surgery
      (BCS), consisting of segmental mastectomy and radiation treatment with or without axillary
      lymph node dissection (ALND), is equivalent to mastectomy in terms of overall survival (OS)
      and disease free survival (DFS) for patients with early stage breast carcinoma. Presentation
      of the ACOZOG-Z011 study results in 2011 resulted in a downward trend in the use of a
      completion axillary lymph node dissection in early breast cancer patients with 1-2 positive
      sentinel lymph nodes (SLN), treated with wide local excision (WLE) and whole breast
      irradiation. However, there is little evidence regarding the optimal axillary treatment in
      elderly breast cancer patients, since these patients are often excluded from clinical trials.
      We had done a retrospective study of breast cancer in the elderly, which demonstrated that
      those who with complex comorbidities receiving wide local excision merely were about 1.5
      times more than those who without (71.2% vs 46.0%, p＜0.001). However, it is paradoxical that,
      on the one hand, the risk of dying from breast cancer may increase if patients do not receive
      the standard treatment; on the other hand, they could not live long enough to benefit or even
      suffer more from the standard treatment. The key is to figure out who they are. Given the
      high proportion of patients treated only with WLE, we believe that it is important to compare
      the effects of different surgical procedures on prognosis among the elderly BC patient in a
      prospective cohort study, to be more specific, comparing the WLE versus any other surgical
      procedures.
