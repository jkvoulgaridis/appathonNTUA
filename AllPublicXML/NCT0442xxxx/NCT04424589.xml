  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Axial spondyloarthritis (AS), is a chronic and disabling disease that mainly affects young
      people, generating clear limitations in mobility and functional capacity in patients who
      develop this disease. Although pharmacological treatment is the basis of the therapeutic
      treatment of (AS), non-pharmacological treatment is a fundamental complement that guarantees
      the optimization of movement patterns, in turn favoring independence in the basic activities
      of life daily through the management and control of the derived signs and symptoms. Several
      studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of physiotherapy in treating symptoms in patients
      with AS, one of these studies is the Cochrane review developed by Dagfinrud et al. One of the
      techniques described by the Cochrane Review in the management of symptoms is orthopedic
      manual therapy (OMT), defined as a specialized area of physical therapy used for the
      treatment of neuro-musculoskeletal conditions, based on clinical reasoning, using approaches
      highly specific treatment plans that include manual techniques and therapeutic exercises.

      Among these manual techniques, it includes myofascial induction as the primary technique of
      choice for the management of soft tissue and fascial system restrictions, it has been shown
      to be in rheumatic diseases such as fibromyalgia and osteoarthritis, as well as in
      non-inflammatory mechanical diseases such as non-specific low back pain, a low-cost, rapid
      therapeutic action strategy with sustained gains over time in managing global symptoms.
      Currently, the effects of myofascial induction on the mobility and function of patients with
      AS are unknown, despite the excellent results that these techniques have shown in
      dysfunctions of non-autoimmune musculoskeletal origin. For this reason, this study will seek
      to evaluate the efficacy of myofascial release compared to sham therapy in joint range of
      motion in patients diagnosed with axial spondyloarthritis.

      Trial design: Controlled parallel double blind superiority clinical trial. Participants of
      the trial: Patients with a diagnosis of axial spondyloarthritis, of legal age, attending the
      rheumatology service of an outpatient clinic in the city of Bogotá. Planned trial period: The
      intervention per participant is designed to develop 6 therapy sessions 2 times per week over
      the course of 3 weeks. It is not planned to follow up the participants in time after the end
      of the study and treatment time. The total duration of the project will be 4 months while the
      necessary population is recruited to complete the sample size.

    <measure>Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Metrology Index (BASMI)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Index that examines 4 axial measurements (cervical rotation, Schober test, lateral trunk flexion, tragus wall distance), also includes a measurement of peripheral mobility (intermaleolar distance), The measurement of these variables is carried out comparatively, in at least two attempts, obtaining the averages of the measurements to calculate the final score based on the 11-point table.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>BASFI is a set of 10 questions designed to determine the degree of functional limitation in people with AS. The score is generated by giving a value of 1 to 10 to each of the questions, once this process has been carried out, this value is divided by 10 and the higher the score given by the scale, the greater the estimates functional limitation.</description>

    <measure>El Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This index is developed to measure disease activity in patients with ankylosing spondylitis. It consists of 6 questions that include the components of fatigue, spinal pain, joint pain / inflammation, pain in the entheses and morning stiffness. The score is generated by giving a value from 1 to 10 to each of the questions.</description>

    <description>Myofascial release or induction (MFR) is a widely used manual therapy treatment involving specifically guided, low-load, long-lasting mechanical forces to manipulate the myofascial complex, aimed at restoring optimal length, decreasing pain, and improving function. Manual therapists often use their hands using their knuckles, elbows, or other instrumental tools to slowly penetrate the layers of the fascia, using applied pressure with a few kilograms of force that can strain the restricted fascia, this implies a guided gentle stretch.
The experimental group will receive 1 examination session and 6 myofascial release sessions carried out by a physiotherapist specialized in orthopedic manual therapy, superficial and deep techniques will be applied in the cervical region, for the spinal at the level of the quadratus lumborum, sacroiliac region and upper trapezius. 2 sessions per week over the course of 3 weeks.</description>
