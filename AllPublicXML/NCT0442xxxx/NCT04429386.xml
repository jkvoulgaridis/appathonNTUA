  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Assessing the changes in the brain-gut axis after weight loss surgery and their relationship
      with weight loss and changes in eating behaviors.

      Obese women undergoing weight loss surgery will be recruited to participate in the study.
      These individuals will undergo a screening visit and 4 study visits. The study visits will
      occur before, and at 1-, 6- and 12 months after the weight loss surgery. Each study visit
      will include evaluation of brain function (fMRI), anthropometrics, blood and stool samples
      and eating behaviors questionnaires.

      Assessing the changes in the brain-gut axis after weight loss surgery and their relationship

      Obese women undergoing weight loss surgery will be recruited to participate in the study.
      These subjects will undergo a screening visit and 4 study visits. The study visits will occur
      before, and at 1-, 6- and 12 months after the weight loss surgery. Each study visit will
      include evaluation of brain function (fMRI), anthropometrics, blood samples (gut hormones,
      cytokines, metabolomics ) and stool samples (16S RNA and Metabolomics) and eating behaviors
      questionnaires (YFAS, TFEQ, food cravings/preferences scales, 3-day food food intake records)

      Primary outcomes: weight loss after surgery and changes in eating behaviors scales (YFAS,
      TFEQ) , metabolomics, appetite related hormones and gut microbiome (16S RNA) Secondary
      outcomes: changes in brain function (fMRI/MRS), diet (3-day food intake records) and
      inflammatory markers.

    <measure>Change in Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire score at 6-months</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at baseline and 6-months after the bariatric surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire is a validated scale that is designed to measure 3 dimensions of human eating behavior: cognitive restraint of eating (Factor I), disinhibition (Factor II), and hunger (Factor III). The minimum score for factors I-II-III is therefore 0-0-0, and maximum possible score is 20-16-15. Higher scores in the respective scales are indicative of greater cognitive restraint (better), uncontrolled (worse), or emotional eating (worse).</description>
