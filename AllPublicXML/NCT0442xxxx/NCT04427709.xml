  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to evaluate the effects of oxytocin (naturally occurring
      hormone) given by an intramuscular (IM; into the muscle) injection, has on your
      parasympathetic nervous system. The parasympathetic nervous system is the part of the
      involuntary nervous system that is sometimes called the &quot;rest and digest&quot; system; the
      parasympathetic system conserves energy as it slightly slows the heart rate, increases
      intestinal and gland activity, and relaxes sphincter muscles in the gastrointestinal tract.

      This is a single site study at Wake Forest School of Medicine. Healthy volunteers and
      patients with advanced knee arthritis being seen in the Orthopedic Clinic in consultation for
      potential total knee arthroplasty will be recruited after their doctor visit if the decision
      is made not to perform surgery at this time.

      Study participants will come to the Pain Clinical Research Unit on 2 occasions. On these
      visits, they will receive an intramuscular (i.m.) injection of placebo or oxytocin, 25
      micrograms (μg) (Pitocin®), obtained from the research pharmacy. The order in this cross-over
      study will be randomized and double blind, and the studies separated by at least 48 hours.
      Every 2.5 minutes beginning 20 minutes before injection and until 180 minutes after injection
      oscillation in pupil diameter at low frequency (hippus) will be obtained using an infrared
      pupilometer, in which they focus on a central point of gaze for 20 seconds. Hippus, a measure
      of parasympathetic output to the pupil and affected by central actions of oxytocin as
      described in preliminary data, will be calculated as the magnitude of power in the 0-0.25
      Hertz (Hz) bin of the spectral analysis of pupil diameter, after removing blink and saccade
      artifacts. After 180 minutes the study participant will be discharged from the Pain Clinical
      Research Unit.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female &gt; 18 and &lt; 75 years of age, Body Mass Index (BMI) &lt;40.

             medical history, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status 1, 2, or 3.

          3. For healthy volunteers, normal blood pressure (systolic 90-140 mmHg; diastolic 50-90

             arthritis subjects, normal blood pressure or, for those with hypertension, pressure

             compromise the quality of the data

          3. Women who are pregnant (positive result for serum pregnancy test at screening visit),
