  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Between the large trochanter and the muscles adhering to it, trochanteric bursa and several
      other bursa may be found. Trochanteric bursitis can be alone or together with tendinitis of
      other bursa and adhering muscles. The first is called trochanteric bursitis, the second is
      called hip periarthritis, which is difficult to distinguish clinically. It is more common in
      women of middle age. The main complaint is the large trochanter and pain on the side of the
      thigh. Pain is aggregated by walking abduction and external rotation by walking, lying down
      with hip movements. The palpation is sensitive to the top of the large trochanter. There may
      also be tenderness in the muscles in the lateral of the thigh. On plain radiographs, slight
      irregularities or peritrocanteric calcifications can be seen in the large trochanter. Bone
      scintigraphy shows local increased involvement. In differential diagnosis, stress fractures,
      local infection and bone and soft tissue tumors should be considered.

      Rest is recommended in treatment. Activities such as running, standing for a long time are
      prohibited. Ice application can be given in the acute period. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
      (SOAI) drugs, analgesics, TENS can be used for pain relief. In cases where conventional
      treatments are insufficient, that is, the patient's pain is still continuing and functional
      recovery is inadequate, some alternative methods are also applied. These treatments include
      ozone, prolotherapy injection applications, dry needling, acupuncture, hirudotherapy,
      phytotherapy, mesotherapy, balneotherapy, kinesiobanding, etc. d. In our study, we aim to
      compare the effectiveness of ozone injection in patients diagnosed with trochanteric bursitis
      and to compare steroid injection with the application of ozone therapy.

      60 patients with trochanteric bursitis will be taken to the first and second groups by random
      number generator method. Ozone therapy is planned for 30 patients in the first group, and
      steroid injection is planned for the second group in 30 patients, and the study period is
      planned to be 4.5 months. Patients between the ages of 18-75 will be admitted and no
      difference will be made in terms of gender. The child will not be sick. Patients will be
      evaluated by the doctor who made the injection. All patients will also be evaluated before
      the first injection (T0), after treatment (T1) and after the first month (T2) after
      treatment. VAS (visual analog scale), Nottingham Health Profile and Harris Hip Evaluation
      Form will be used to evaluate patients. Our study is a randomized controlled prospective
      study.

      Treatment to be applied to patients will be selected randomly. Steroid injections will be
      administered to patients in a single dose, while ozone injection will be applied in three
      doses (1, 4, 7, 10 days), with a total of 4 doses. In ozone injection applications, while 1st
      dose 25 gamma, 2nd dose 20 gamma, 3rd and 4th dose 15 gamma 10 cc ozone will be injected; 1ml
      betamethasone will be used for steroid injection. The evaluation of the patients will be done
      by a different physician than the physician who made the injections. The financial burden of
      the treatment applied will be borne by the researchers.

      The study is planned to be done between 20/06/2020 - 15/10/2020. This study is a randomized
      controlled prospective clinical trial. The sample size is 60 patients.
