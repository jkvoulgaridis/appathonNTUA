  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PTSD is a chronic mental health condition that drastically reduces an individual's quality of
      life Dextrose injection with a small needle has been used for chronic pain patients and
      observational results have shown it to be effective in reducing anxiety, brain fog, and
      depression in patients with PTSD. This randomized trial will compare dextrose injection with
      saline injection for PTSD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PTSD is a well-recognized debilitating mental health condition associated with previous
      trauma exposure. It is part of the DSM-5 Trauma and Stressor related disorders category. The
      National Vietnam Veterans Readjustment Study found that the lifetime prevalence of PTSD among
      veterans is 18.7%. However, most statistics regarding the prevalence of PTSD in veterans are
      under-represented because many transitioning veterans do not seek treatment due to concerns
      with the stigma of PTSD. Treatments for PTSD normally involve a multi-disciplinary approach.
      First-line treatments include psychotherapy and serotonergic reuptake inhibitors. Many
      patients fail pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy.

      Unilateral stellate ganglion block performed favorably for treatment of PTSD in a recent RCT,
      based upon an expectation that the cervical sympathetic system is neuropathically upregulated
      in PTSD. However, side effects may include generalized seizures, hypotension, spinal block,
      and recurrent laryngeal or phrenic nerve block, and it can be performed only unilaterally due
      to the risk of laryngeal paralysis.

      Perineural injection of peripheral nerves, plexi, or sympathetic ganglia with dextrose 5% in
      water (D5W), has performed well in the treatment of neuropathic upregulation in chronic pain
      patients. No lidocaine is required, which allows for avoidance of lidocaine toxicity risk,
      and because of that, bilateral procedures are feasible, if indicated. Bilateral
      hydrodissection of the cervical plexus (injection into the superficial cervical space) is
      gentle, safe, and easily performed with ultrasound guidance. Anesthetic injected in that
      space spreads readily into the deep cervical space, which includes the stellate ganglia.
      Empirical observations by the primary investigator in over 200 consecutive procedures in
      patients with neck or head pain who also had anxiety, brain fog, or depressive symptoms, and
      some of whom had formal diagnoses of PTSD, revealed consistent/spontaneous mention by the
      patients of near-immediate (5-10 minutes) reduction in their symptoms. A cumulative benefit
      has been observed, as well. The effects of BHDCP with D5W as a stand-alone treatment for PTSD
      has not been formally evaluated The objective of this study is to determine the immediate
      post-injection effects of BHDCP with D5W on anxiety, cognitive clarity, depression, or pain
      in U.S. veterans with PTSD. The primary hypothesis is that BHDCP with D5W will significantly
      reduce anxiety within 30 minutes, as measured by a 0-10 NRS score for severity of anxiety,
      and will outperform control injection.
