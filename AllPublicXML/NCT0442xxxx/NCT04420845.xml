  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test whether adding sleep hygiene education and support to diabetes
      self-management education and support (DSMES) in diverse patients (African American,
      Hispanic, Pacific Islander, and Caucasian) with type 2 diabetes myelitis (T2DM) from rural
      UAMS Regional Programs clinics is more effective than DSMES alone. The specific aims for this
      study are:

        -  Aim 1A (Primary): Determine if this model improves blood glucose levels as measured by
           the HbA1c test in diverse adults with T2DM.

        -  Aim 1B: Determine the preliminary effectiveness of DSMES+SHES on sleep duration and
           sleep quality, blood pressure, fasting lipids, body mass index (BMI), self-management
           behavior, self-efficacy, diabetes-related distress, and diabetes-related quality of life
           in diverse adults with T2DM.

        -  Aim 2A: Determine the feasibility and acceptability of DSMES+ SHES when implemented with
           diverse adults with T2DM.

        -  Aim 2B: Determine the feasibility and acceptability of DSMES+ SHES implementation in
           Regional Programs clinics.

    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The PROMISÂ® Short Form v1.0- Sleep Disturbance-4a scale will be used to assess self-reported perceptions of sleep quality, sleep depth, and restoration associated with sleep.This includes perceived difficulties and concerns with getting to sleep or staying asleep, as well as perceptions of the adequacy of and satisfaction with sleep.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in mean blood pressure (systolic &amp; diastolic, mmHg) from baseline to 12 weeks post-intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Blood pressure will be measured with a sphygmomanometer and stethoscope or digital blood pressure device with the participant seated and arm elevated.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in mean body mass index (BMI) from baseline to 12 weeks post-intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>BMI will be collected by measuring participant height (without shoes) using a stadiometer, and by measuring participant weight (without shoes) using a calibrated digital scale. Participant weight and height will then be used to compute a continuous measure of BMI.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in mean total cholesterol (mg/dL) from baseline to 12 weeks post-intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Through finger prick blood collection, point of care tests will be used used to test total cholesterol using a commercial lipid panel kit and Cholestech LDX analyzer.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
