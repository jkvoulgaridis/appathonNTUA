  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have previously reported that cardiac surgery with CPB ( cardiopulmonary
      bypass) in young infants induced a drastic reduction in mHLA-DR ( Human Leucocyte Antigen)
      expression, which represents one of innate immune mediator. Danger-Associated Molecular
      Patterns (DAMPs) can elicit immune response and may subsequentely induce an immune-suppressed
      state. The investigators hypothesize that CPB causes excessive DAMP release, leading to the
      development of immune suppression. Thus, DAMPs release will be assessed in patients
      undergoing CBP, and consequences on immune suppression will be evaluated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Plasma levels of heat shock protein (HSP 70), high mobility group box (HMGB1), S100A9 and
      IL-33 will be measured at four time points (prior to the onset of CPB, Hour 6 postoperative,
      day 1 and day 3 after surgery). HLA-DR gene expression will be determined before surgery and
      at day 3 postoperative. The direct effect of DAMPs release and immune suppression will be
      assessed by in vitro experiments.

        All patients admitted to pediatric resuscitation at the Nantes University Hospital after
        cardiac surgery under CEC ( extra-corporal circulation) and aged less than 3 months meeting
        the criteria for inclusion and non-inclusion of the study will be included. We can
        objectify the recruitment of 80 patients in total over 2 years.

        Since natural evolution (variation of rates and their kinetics) of the secretion of
        different DAMPs during the first months of life is unknown, the investigators added a
        control group to know the expression and kinetics of DAMPs outside cardiac surgery under
        CEC. This control group will be defined by infants under 3 months of age undergoing heavy
        digestive surgery and having a central venous catheter to facilitate access to blood
        samples (n = 20).
