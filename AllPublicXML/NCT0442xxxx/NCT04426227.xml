  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Regional anaesthesia is the performance of spinal, epidural or peripheral nerve blocks to
      allow patients to undergo surgery awake and to provide post-operative pain relief.
      Anaesthetists inject local anaesthetic using specialist needles close to nerves to prevent
      transmission of pain. Hand-held ultrasound is often used by anaesthetists to direct these
      needles to the correct position i.e. close to, but not in the nerve itself. If the needle is
      not adequately seen using the hand-held ultrasound it may pierce the nerve causing permanent
      nerve damage and significant patient harm.

      Within the time and resource constraints of postgraduate medical training, it would be
      advantageous to optimise expertise acquisition of practical skills with a cheap,
      self-directed educational intervention. Therefore, the aim of this study is to determine
      whether gaze training is associated with improved performance of an ultrasound-guided needle
      task. The investigators hypothesise that improved gaze control will translate to better
      technical performance of an ultrasound-guided regional anaesthesia task.

    <description>The gaze-trained group will be shown a video, derived from the eye tracker, of an expert's visual control whilst performing the ultrasound task. Participants will be made aware of the target-focused gaze strategy (lengthy and stable fixations on the needling target), and the manner in which the gaze shifted from target to tools (hands, needle and transducer) in a fast, smooth fashion. They will then be advised to try to mimic the gaze strategy of the expert while undertaking the needling task as their first training task. After completion of this training task, participants will be shown their own video data, as captured by the eye tracker. Participants will be asked to comment on differences between their own video and the expert video they had previously seen. This feedback process will be replicated a further four training task attempts. Participants in this group will therefore undergo a total of five training attempts of the needling task.</description>
