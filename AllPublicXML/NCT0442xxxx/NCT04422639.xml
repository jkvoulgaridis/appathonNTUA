  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study is a randomized, open-label, 2-arm active-controlled phase II clinical trial
      conducted at a single study site (UAMS). Subjects will be randomized to one of the 2
      treatment arms and stratified by size of index lesion and number of brain metastases.

      The investigators will prospectively compare preoperative (neoadjuvant) SRS/SRT to
      postoperative (adjuvant) SRS/SRT in patients undergoing surgical resection for brain
      metastases.

      The investigators hypothesize that neoadjuvant SRS/SRT prior to surgical resection of brain
      metastases will result in improved freedom from Central Nervous System (CNS) events when
      compared to adjuvant SRS/SRT after surgical resection.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with prior histopathological diagnosis of cancer other than small cell lung
             cancer, lymphoma, and germ cell histologies.

          -  MR imaging of the brain with findings strongly suggestive of metastatic tumor(s) as
             assessed by the radiologist.

          -  Seen by a neurosurgeon or radiation oncologist and judged to be appropriate for
             participation in this study, including the ability to tolerate both surgery and
             SRS/SRT, e.g., the ability to lie flat in a stereotactic soft head frame.

          -  ECOG ≤ 2

          -  1-2 index lesion(s) appropriate for resection, not previously treated with SRS/SRT.

        Index lesion(s) should be &gt; 2 cm and &lt; 5 cm in largest dimension, and require resection.
        Alternatively, patients with a diagnosis of melanoma and a lesion &lt; 1.5cm in largest
        dimension may also be included. o All other brain lesions must be appropriate for SRS/SRT
        alone and treated according to physician preference. Prior neurosurgery and/or prior
        SRS/SRT at a non-overlapping location are permitted at the discretion of the treating
        physician.

        - MRI confirmed 1-10 lesions, 1-2 of which are the index lesions undergoing surgery.

        Each non-index lesion (up to 10) must measure ≤ 3.0 cm in maximal extent on contrasted MRI
        scan, and not otherwise require resection.

          -  Clinical indication and plan for stereotactic radiosurgery to all known brain lesions
             requiring treatment (≤ 10 metastases).

          -  Surgical resection able to be performed within 15 days of radiotherapy completion.

          -  Written informed consent obtained from subject, or a legally designated power of
             attorney and ability for subject to comply with the requirements of the study.

          -  Negative pregnancy test in women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) within 30 days of
             radiation. WOCBP is a female patient less than 50 years of age or who has menstruated
             within the last 12 months.

          -  Known allergy to gadolinium, pacemaker, or other contraindication such as metal
             implant that is not safe for MRI. Patients with MRI-compatible implants are eligible.

          -  Patients who have local recurrence of previously treated brain metastasis.

          -  Patients who have received prior WBRT.
