  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), small-airway dysfunction (SAD)
      is considered a key element and a functional consequence of the pathology. However, the exact
      role of SAD as a specific 'pharmacological target' is not yet fully known.

      Objectives In an open-label prospective study, we aimed to ascertain whether an extra-fine
      formulation of Beclomethasone dipropionate/Formoterol fumarate (BDP/FF) NEXThaler® 100/6 μg
      b.i.d. can improve the impact of the disease on the quality of daily life of COPD patients,
      acting on SAD.

      Methods We studied COPD patients with severe airflow obstruction and 1 moderate exacerbation
      in the previous year, being treated with BDP/FF NEXThaler® for 12 weeks. They underwent three
      visits, at the start of the treatment (V1), at 6th week (V2) and at 12th week (V3). By the
      impulse oscillometry system and by spirometry and plethysmography we measured at each visit
      the fall in resistance from 5 to 20 Hz (R5-R20) and the residual volume/total lung capacity
      (RV/TLC). COPD Assessment Test (CAT) and the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC)
      questionnaire were also measured at each visit to assess the impact of the disease on the
      quality of life of the patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, there has been a growing interest in deepening the contribution of small
      airways (with a diameter &lt;2mm) to the clinical expression of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary
      Disease (COPD).

      In patients with stable COPD, SAD severity was found to be progressively increased both with
      the degree of airflow obstruction and with GOLD risk class. Moreover, a correlation between
      SAD and COPD impact measured with the CAT (COPD Assessment Test) was found, being the
      severity of SAD a predictor of the impact of the disease (CAT≥10). A close correlation
      between SAD and both quality of life (measured with the St. George's Respiratory
      Questionnaire) and perceived dyspnea (measured with the modified Medical Research
      Council-mMRC scale) was also found in COPD patients.

      The exact role of SAD as a specific 'pharmacological target' is not yet fully known.
      According to the guidelines, the administration of combination such as Beclomethasone
      dipropionate/Formoterol fumarate (BDP/FF) in extra-fine formulation produced a clinically
      relevant improvement in quality of life (&gt; 4 units in the St. George's Respiratory
      Questionnaire) and in dyspnea. However, it is not yet defined whether exists a correlation
      between symptomatic improvement and SAD and whether an improvement of symptoms can be
      achieved acting pharmacologically on SAD.

      The rationale for this study is based on the hypothesis that an extra-fine formulation of
      BDP/FF, designed to target the entire bronchial three, included the peripheral zone, can
      improve the impact of the disease on the quality of life of COPD patients, acting on SAD. The
      functional indices of SAD used in this study are from the impulse oscillometry system (IOS),
      the standard spirometry and the body plethysmography.

      The primary endpoint of the study was, therefore, an improvement of the impact of the disease
      on quality of daily life (CAT) and of dyspnea (mMRC) after 12th week treatment with an
      extra-fine formulation of BDP/FF in a cohort of COPD patients with severe airway obstruction
      and one moderate exacerbation in a previous year; secondary endpoint was an improvement of
      the SAD at the 12th week in these patients.

    <description>The CAT (COPD Assessment Test) is a questionnaire suitable for completion by all patients diagnosed with COPD. It comprises 8 simple questions that most patients should be able to understand and complete independently.
The CAT has a scoring range of 0-40, where each question is ranging 0-5. A CAT score&gt;10 indicates a medium/high impact level of COPD.
A difference or change of 2 or more units over 2 to 3 months in a patient suggests a clinically significant difference or change in health status (minimal clinically relevant change, often referred to as the Minimum Clinically Important Difference or MCID).</description>

    <description>The modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnoea scale is a questionnaire that consists of five statements about perceived breathlessness: grade 1, &quot;I only get breathless with strenuous exercise&quot;; grade 2, &quot;I get short of breath when hurrying on the level or up a slight hill&quot;; grade 3, &quot;I walk slower than people of the same age on the level because of breathlessness or have to stop for breath when walking at my own pace on the level&quot;; grade 4, &quot;I stop for breath after walking 100 yards or after a few minutes on the level&quot;; grade 5, &quot; I am too breathless to leave the house&quot;. Patients are asked about their perceived breathlessness and are then classified into MRC dyspnoea grades according to how they perceive their disability.</description>

    <description>The IOS was performed with the Jaeger MasterScreen-IOS device following the standard recommendations. Respiratory resistances at 5 Hz and 20 Hz (R5 and R20, kPa x s x L-1) were used as a total and proximal airway resistance index, respectively, and the resistance drop from 5 to 20 Hz (R5 - R20, kPa x s x L-1) was considered as an indirect index of resistance of the peripheral airways. The oscillometer was calibrated daily.</description>
