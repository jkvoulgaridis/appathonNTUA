  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dystonia is a neurological disorder, which causes involuntary, sustained muscle contractions,
      resulting in uncontrollable twisting, repetitive movements, and abnormal postures. Selective
      impairment of the motor control of highly skilled and goal-oriented behaviors is the defining
      feature of task-specific focal dystonias. Among these, laryngeal dystonia (LD) is
      characterized by involuntary spasms in laryngeal muscles, which selectively occur during
      speaking but not whispering, crying, or laughing. As speech communication is a vital part of
      our daily existence, LD symptoms have a deeply pervasive effect on the quality of life of the
      affected individual, often extending beyond speech motor deficits and causing significant
      occupational disability, psychiatric comorbidities, long-lasting stress, and social
      isolation.

      Despite the chronic, debilitating impact of LD, its clinical management remains stagnant. The
      overall objective of this study is to conduct a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled,
      parallel design, phase 1 clinical trial to assess the feasibility and efficacy of a
      neurofeedback brain-computer interface (BCI) paradigm in LD patients that acts upon and
      modulates the disorder pathophysiology. The rationale for the proposed studies is that
      delineation of task-specific neural alterations for their feasible utilization as a
      pathophysiological target of therapeutic intervention will establish a robust scientific
      foundation for the development of novel strategies for LD treatment, inform the conduct of
      the next phase of the clinical trial, and directly contribute to closing the existing
      critical gap in the clinical management of this disorder.

The power analysis calculated the sample size of 16 subjects per group needed to achieve statistically significant results. To increase power and account for subject dropout possibilities, up to 20 subjects will be recruited for each of the two groups.</intervention_model_description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

          1. Patients will have clinically documented isolated adductor laryngeal dystonia (ADLD)
             without any other forms of dystonia or tremor. ADLD causes involuntary spasms during
             vocal fold adduction, leading to voice breaks predominantly on vowels and strained,
             strangles quality of voice, predominantly affecting voice production during the
             speaking. Only patients with the ADLD form of disorder will be recruited to minimize
             the impact of heterogeneity of voice symptomatology on the outcome of these phase 1
             studies;

          2. Healthy controls will be healthy individuals with a negative history of any
             neurological, psychiatric, or laryngeal problems;

          3. Age from 18 to 80 years;

          4. Native English speakers. Non-English-speaking subjects will not be recruited because
             brain activation and neural network organization are different between native and
             non-native English speakers;

          5. Right-handedness (based on Edinburgh Handedness Inventory). Left-handed subjects will
             not be recruited because brain activation and neural network organization are
             different between right and left-handed individuals;

          6. Normal cognitive status (based on Montreal Cognitive Assessment).

        Exclusion criteria:

          1. Subjects who are incapable of giving informed consent will be excluded from the study;

          2. Pregnant or breastfeeding women until the time they are no longer pregnant or
             breastfeeding will be excluded from the study. All women of childbearing potential
             will undergo a urine pregnancy test, which must be negative for study participation;

          3. Subjects with a past or present medical history of (a) neurological problems, such as
             stroke, movement disorders (except for ADLD in the patient group), brain tumors,
             ataxias, myopathies, myasthenia gravis, demyelinating diseases; (b) psychiatric
             problems, such as schizophrenia, bipolar depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder;
             (c) larynÂ¬geal problems, such as vocal fold paralysis, paresis, carcinoma;

          4. Subjects with impaired hearing, vision, and speaking abilities (except for ADLD), as
             these would most typically have a neurological origin;

          5. Patients who have dystonia symptoms at rest in order to avoid the potential confound
             of dystonic spasms occurring during the asymptomatic task production;

          6. Patients who are not symptomatic due to the treatment with botulinum toxin injections
             into the affected muscles. The duration of positive effects of botulinum toxin varies
             from patient to patient but lasts on average for 3-4 months. All patients will be
             evaluated to ensure that they are fully symptomatic and are at least three months
             post-injection prior to study participation;

          7. To avoid the possibility of confounding effects of drugs acting upon the central
             nervous system, all subjects will be questioned about any prescribed or
             over-the-counter medications as part of their initial screening. Those who are on
             medication(s) affecting the central nervous system will be excluded;

          8. Subjects with implanted deep brain stimulators will be excluded from the study;

          9. Subjects will be asked whether they have undergone any head and neck surgeries,
             particularly any brain surgery and laryngeal surgeries, such as thyroplasty, laryngeal
             denervation, and selective laryngeal adductor denervation-reinnervation. Because both
             brain and laryngeal surgery may potentially lead to the brain structure and function
             re-organization, all subjects with a history of brain and/or laryngeal surgery will be
             excluded from the study.
