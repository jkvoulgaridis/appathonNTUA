      Objective: To evaluate the safety, feasibility and clinical efficacy of transthoracic
      single-hole assisted laparoscopic radical gastrectomy for Siewert Type Ⅱ adenocarcinoma of
      esophagogastric junction.

      Methods: A prospective, single-center, one-arm study will be performed. Patients who have
      been diagnosed with Siewert type Ⅱ esophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma and meet the
      eligibility criteria will be included in the study and undergo the transthoracic single-hole
      assisted laparoscopic radical gastrectomy. The data of preoperative, intraoperative,
      postoperative and follow-up will be recorded and analyzed.

      Primary study endpoints: The incidences of early postoperative complications and mortality.

      The secondary study endpoints:(1) Surgery and oncology indicators ;(2) Early postoperative
      recovery information ;(3) 3-year disease-free survival and overall survival rate;(4) 5-year
      disease-free survival and overall survival.

      1. Surgery and oncology indicators,such as length of operation, intraoperative blood loss,
           transit thoracotomy or laparotomy rate, length of proximal tumor from esophageal
           resection margin, number of mediastinal lymph node dissections and the positive, number
           of abdominal lymph node dissections and the positive, tumor type and pathological stage,
           etc.;

        2. Early postoperative recovery information ,such as time of first exhaust and defecation,
           time of leaving the bed, time of recovery of full and half-flow diet, time of removal of
           chest drainage tube, time of postoperative hospitalization, etc.
