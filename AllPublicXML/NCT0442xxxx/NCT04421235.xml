  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Incarcerated pregnant women are a largely invisible special population with great need for
      health care and advocacy. The number of women who are incarcerated in the U.S. has increased
      over 750%, or from 13,258 in 1980 to 111,616 in 2016. Arkansas has the 8th highest number of
      incarcerated women in the nation, 60% higher than the national average. As the number of
      incarcerated women has risen, so too has the need for jails and prisons to address women's
      health needs, including pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum care. Nationally, over 75% of
      incarcerated women are of childbearing age and about are pregnant upon intake. However,
      little is known about the population of women who have become incarcerated while pregnant in
      Arkansas â€” including the outcomes of these women and their children and how these outcomes
      may vary in relation to services that are received during incarceration. This research study
      aims to first expand knowledge on incarcerated women in Arkansas by using administrative data
      to retrospectively examine the health status and outcomes of pregnant women who were
      incarcerated in state prison by Arkansas over a five-year period (Aim 1). Then, the
      investigators will lay the groundwork for and subsequently analyze prospectively gathered
      outcomes of women in Arkansas state prisons by supplementing administratively-collected data
      with in-person data collection (Aim 2). This prospectively-gathered data will include records
      of: 1) self-report responses to surveys about their health and mental health, 2) women's
      participation or nonparticipation in elements of programming for incarcerated pregnant women
      that was recently launched by Arkansas Department of Correction in collaboration with the
      study PI (i.e., Growing Together), and 3) self-report responses to surveys about the elements
      of Growing Together. The Growing Together program elements that are currently active and that
      will be evaluated under this protocol are a lactation program, lactation education, and a
      mental health support group. The investigators will also pilot and conduct an open-label
      evaluation of an additional program component, doula support, with a sample of up to 24
      incarcerated women (Aim 3). Assessment of the program components in Aims 2 and 3 will focus
      on evaluating acceptability to the population and feasibility.

    <description>There are 5 program components that women may receive as a part of childbirth support:
Prenatal education - consists of up to 8 sessions of education on pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum health and wellness.
Support group - semi-structured group which provides time for women to process their pregnancy and postpartum-related experiences with other women facing similar challenges. Integrates mindfulness exercises, cognitive-behavioral skills, and special topics as requested by group members.
Lactation program - program for women who wish to provide breastmilk for infants from which they are separated.
Doula support program - 2 prenatal and 2 postnatal individual visits with a doula who will also provide continuous childbirth support and support during separation from infants.
Parenting classes - group classes focused on helping women learn parenting skills and (if applicable) meet state requirements for reunification with children</description>
