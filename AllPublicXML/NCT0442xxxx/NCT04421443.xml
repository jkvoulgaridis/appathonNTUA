    <textblock>
      The present pilot study with a multiple baseline experimental desing will verify the
      feasibility and clinical utility of the Unified Protocol, applied in an online group format
      in a mental health setting of the Spanish national health system to patients waiting for
      bariatric surgery with diagnosis or symptoms of Emotional Disorders

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is currently becoming a serious global public health problem due to the high
      prevalence and the large increase in recent years. This condition is associated with
      different health problems, including physical and mental diseases. The presence of anxiety or
      depression disorders among candidates for bariatric surgery it is very high and predicts
      worse results. The present study aims to explore the feasibility and clinical usefulness of
      an online group format application of the Unified Protocol, a transdiagnostic emotion-based
      intervention for patients waiting for bariatric surgery with at least one emotional disorder
      diagnosis or emotional symptoms.

      We will conduct a pilot study with a repeated single case experimental design (multiple
      baseline design) in a public mental health service. The sample will consist of 45
      participants who will be randomized to three baseline conditions: 8, 12 or 15 evaluation days
      before the intervention. Depression and anxiety symptoms and diagnostic criteria will be the
      primary outcome measures. Secondary measures will include evaluation of affectivity,
      personality traits, general fit, quality of life, and different body image and eating
      outcomes. An analysis of treatment satisfaction will be also performed. Assessment points
      include baseline, pre-treatment, post-treatment, and follow-ups every three months until two
      years after post-treatment.

    <intervention_model_description>In the present investigation, all consecutive patients who have been selected to undergo bariatric surgery and present anxiety or depressive symptoms or at least one diagnosis of emotional disorder, are asked to participate. Once inclusion criteria are accomplished, each patient will be randomly assigned to one of the multiple baseline groups: 3, 5 or 8 evaluation days before the intervention. The study includes eleven assessment points (baseline, pre-treatment, post-treatment and eight follow-ups, one every three months until two years after treatment completion).</intervention_model_description>
