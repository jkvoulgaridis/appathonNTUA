  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the hypothesis that supplemental video visits can significantly improve
      glycemic control for pediatric patients with Type 1 Diabetes over a 1 year period, will be
      satisfactory to patients and families, and may alter their utilization of high-cost
      healthcare such as ED visits and hospitalizations.
