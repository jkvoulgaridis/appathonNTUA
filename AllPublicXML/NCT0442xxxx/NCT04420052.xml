  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a chronic condition with limited therapeutic options.
      Moreover, the pathophysiology is poorly understood. The aim of this study is to evaluate the
      efficacy of osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) in the course of this condition by
      applying several techniques supposed to be related to the autonomic nervous system. Our
      hypothesis is that these techniques could have beneficial effects on inflammation and head
      symptoms in CRS.

      Methods:

      A sample of 90 patients diagnosed by ENT specialist will be randomly assigned to the OMT
      group or the placebo group. The placebo procedure will consist in using light touch around
      the nose, on the throat and on the thorax. Treatment and placebo protocols are composed of
      two visits at day 0 and day 30.

      A general practitioner will determine the eligibility for the study.

      The outcomes include Peak Nasal Inspiratory Flow (PNIF) measured five times: at day 0, 30
      (twice each, before and after treatment) and 180 (once). The two groups will be compared
      regarding short and long term evolution.

      The evolution of symptoms will be assessed by the Sino-nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22) seven
      times: at day 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180. This outcome will be analyzed using mixed
      effect modelling

      A Qualitative study will be conducted in the two groups to understand the patients'
      experiences during care.

      This protocol has been approved by a french ethic committee (Comit√© de Protection des
      Personnes Sud Ouest et Outre-Mer II, 2020.04.09).

      Statistical analysis details:

      PNIF middle term evolution:

      If the two groups can be compared regarding their socio-demographics characteristics, a
      student's t-test will compare evolution (day 0 before treatment to day 30 before treatment)
      of the PNIF between groups.

      If characteristics are different, a multivariate linear model will be applied.

      PNIF long term evolution:

      The same tests will be made. The evolution will be assessed between day 0 (before treatment)
      and day 180.

      PNIF short term evolution:

      The same tests will be made. The evolution will be assessed before and after treatment at day
      0 and day 30.

      SNOT-22 evolution:

      Mixed effect model will assess the evolution of symptoms from day 0 to day 180

      Response Shift detection:

      For the SNOT-22, an Oort procedure will be performed in order to detect Response shift among
      individuals.
