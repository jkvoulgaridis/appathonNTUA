  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the referral to harm reduction services (HRS) including syringe
      services, naloxone overdose prevention, substance use treatment referral, HIV, HCV, and STD
      testing and referral and linkage to care through capacity building of existing programs
      through client services data.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective longitudinal Type 1 Hybrid Implementation Effectiveness Study on the
      expansion of harm reduction services for people who inject drugs (PWID) and people who use
      opioids (PWUO) residing in high risk areas of rural southern Illinois. This study record
      describes one component of the larger Ending transmission of HIV, HCV, and STDs and overdose
      in rural communities of people who inject drugs (ETHIC) study Community Response Plan (CRP)
      framework, specifically the expansion of harm reduction services intervention (HRS). The aim
      is to assess the effectiveness of expansion of evidenced based harm reduction services
      through our CRP framework comprising: a) geographically targeted recruitment based on hot
      spot and vulnerability analyses, b) community engagement, c) recruitment via Respondent
      Driven Sampling (RDS), d) expanded surveillance for HIV and HCV, and e) concomitant HCV and
      opioid use treatment capacity expansion through the Extension of Community Healthcare
      Outcomes (ECHO) model. Examination of facilitators and barriers impacting implementation of
      service delivery is evaluated through mixed methods process evaluation. The Type 1 Hybrid
      design is supported by conditions including the existing evidence based for benefits and
      minimal harm of &quot;harm reduction services&quot; and strong base for applicability of this
      intervention in the study setting (ie rural opioid use)

    <ipd_description>The ETHIC study is participating site of the Rural Opioid Initiative (ROI), a collaborative funded by NIDA. The ROI includes a Data Coordinating Center (DCC) housed at the University of Washington. The University of Chicago will submit de-identified data from the study to the DCC as covered under a data use agreement for the purposes of performing cross-site analyses using a harmonized data set. No parties outside of the ROI will have access to the combined dataset. All project proposals will be subject to approval by the ROI. The data will be available after encrypted submission to the DCC and will remain for the duration in accordance to the data use agreement.</ipd_description>
