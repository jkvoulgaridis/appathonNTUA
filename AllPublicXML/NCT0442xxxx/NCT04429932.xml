  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the overall performance of the currently-marketed MybluTM e-cigarette
      device and pods, as assessed by nicotine uptake, exposure to smoke constituents, safety and
      consumer satisfaction, over 9 days. The study is designed as an open-label, randomized study
      in adult smokers.

      Subjects are invited to participate to a second part of the study, for 5 additional days, to
      compare the use of MybluTM to the use of subject's usual brand combustible cigarettes.
