  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gestational diabetes (GDM) is a form of diabetes that develops during pregnancy. GDM is
      associated with increased risks for pregnancy complications such as macrosomia s and preterm
      delivery. Women with a history of GDM have a high risk to develop a type 2 diabetes (T2DM)
      within the next ten years after delivery. The children are also at increased risk of
      developing obesity and T2DM later in life. Studies are needed to find more accurate
      predictors for the metabolic risk later in life. This will help to individualize the
      follow-up and to develop tailored prevention strategies in women and offspring with a history
      of GDM. In this research project we will therefore investigate how the long-term metabolic
      risk can more accurately be predicted in a follow-up cohort of the 'Belgian Diabetes in
      Pregnancy study' (BEDIP-N). We will study the relationship between maternal weight, degree of
      body fat and degree of hyperglycaemia in pregnancy on the long-term metabolic risk of 375
      women and offspring pairs 3-7 years after the delivery across different gestational glucose
      tolerance groups based on the 2013 WHO criteria in pregnancy. In addition, we will study
      whether a promising new biomarker, glycated CD59, is a good predictor for the long-term
      metabolic risk.

        We plan to recruit 375 women-offspring pairs with the five largest centers who participated
        in the initial BEDIP study. Women and offspring will be recruited according to 3 different
        subgroups based on the antenatal result of the GCT and OGTT in the index pregnancy (a
        sample of 125 in each group): GDM group; normal glucose tolerance (NGT) on the OGTT with an
        abnormal preceding GCT (abnormal GCT NGT group); NGT on the OGTT with a normal preceding
        GCT (normal GCT NGT group). Abnormal GCT is defined as glucose≥130mg/dl, in line with our
        previous research.
