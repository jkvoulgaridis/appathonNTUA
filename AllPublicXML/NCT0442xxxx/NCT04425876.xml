    <textblock>
      The study is being conducted to: a) evaluate the tolerability and safety of the
      co-administration of Fluzoparib and FOLFIRINOX in patients with resectable pancreatic cancer,
      and establish a maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of the combination and
      b) assess the efficacy of the co-administration of Fluzoparib and FOLFIRINOX in patients with
      resectable pancreatic cancer.
