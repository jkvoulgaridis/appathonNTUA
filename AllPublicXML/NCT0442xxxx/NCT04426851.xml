      The main objective of Part 1 of this trial is to investigate the absolute bioavailability of
      BI 1358894 with an intravenous microdose formulation containing labelled [C-14] BI 1358894
      and an unlabelled oral tablet formulation of BI 1358894 in healthy male subjects.

      The main objective of Part 2 of this trial is to investigate the relative bioavailability of
      BI 1358894 administered as an oral suspension.

             12-lead ECG, and clinical laboratory tests

          -  Age of 18 to 55 years (inclusive)

          -  BMI of 18.5 to 29.9 kg/m2 (inclusive)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any finding in the medical examination (including BP, PR or ECG) deviating from normal
             and assessed as clinically relevant by the investigator

          -  Repeated measurement of systolic blood pressure outside the range of 90 to 140 mmHg,
             diastolic blood pressure outside the range of 50 to 90 mmHg, or pulse rate outside the
             range of 40 to 100 bpm

          -  C-reactive protein (CRP) &gt; upper limit of normal (ULN), liver or kidney parameter
             above ULN

          -  Any laboratory value outside the reference range that the investigator considers to be
             of clinical relevance

          -  Any evidence of a concomitant disease assessed as clinically relevant by the
             investigator

          -  Gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic,
             immunological or hormonal disorders

          -  Cholecystectomy or other surgery of the gastrointestinal tract that could interfere
             with the pharmacokinetics of the trial medication (except appendectomy or simple
             hernia repair)

          -  Diseases of the central nervous system (including but not limited to any kind of
             seizures or stroke), and other relevant neurological or psychiatric disorders
