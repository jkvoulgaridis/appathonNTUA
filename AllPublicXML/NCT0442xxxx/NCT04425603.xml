  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study will verify the clinical and radiographic performance of the prosthesis
      when used in human subjects over a period of 10 years. All complications will be documented.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The clinical evaluations will be based on standard, functional and pain parameters Harris Hip
      Score pre-operatively, and at 6 months, 3, 5, 7.5 and 10 years post-operatively. Postal
      Oxford questionnaire preoperatively, and yearly thereafter. The objective of this study is to
      analyse the clinical and radiographic responses and the complication rates for patients
      undergoing primary total hip arthroplasty using the Anthology Hip Replacement System
      (Anthology Hip System).

    <measure>Harris Hip Score - 10 years</measure>
    <time_frame>10 years post operative</time_frame>
    <description>The Harris Hip Score is a joint specific score that consists of 10 items covering domains of pain (1 item, 0-44 points), function (7 items, 0-47 points), functional activities, absence of deformity (1 item, 0 or 4 points), and hip range of motion (2 items, 0-5 points). Scores range from 0 (worst) to 100 (best).</description>

    <measure>Quality of life with Oxford Hip Score (postal) - 10 years</measure>
    <time_frame>10 years post operative</time_frame>
    <description>Patients are asked to reflect on their pain and functional ability over the previous four weeks. There are two domains (pain and function) with six items or questions in each. Each item has five possible responses. In the original scoring responses were from 1 = least difficult to 5= most difficult. Item scores are summed to give a total score from anywhere between 12 and 60. The lower the score, the better the outcome.</description>

    <measure>Quality of life with EuroQol Questionnaire (EQ-5D) -10 years</measure>
    <time_frame>10 years post operative</time_frame>
    <description>The descriptive system consists of five dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression) each of which takes one of three responses. The responses record three levels of severity (no problems/some or moderate problems/extreme problems) within a particular dimension. The EQ VAS records the respondent's self-rated health on a vertical, visual analogue scale where the endpoints are labelled 'Best imaginable health state' and 'Worst imaginable health state'. This information can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome as judged by the individual respondents.</description>

          1. Those presenting with primary or secondary osteoarthritis or avascular necrosis of the
             femoral head or patients suitable for a primary total hip replacement. This is the
             patient group that will benefit from operative surgery to treat osteoarthritis.

          2. Those deemed capable of giving informed consent, understanding the aims of the study
             and expressing willingness to comply with the postâˆ’operative review programme.
             Patients capable of giving informed consent are eligible for inclusion into the study.

          3. Participants who signed the Ethics Committee approved specific Informed Consent Form
             prior to surgery. Patients who have not given informed consent will not be eligible
             for inclusion into the study.

        Exclusion criteria:

          1. Patients whose prospects for a recovery to independent mobility would be compromised
             by known coexistent, medical problems.

          2. Patients not suitable for primary hip replacement.

          3. Patients with active or suspected infection.
