      Study aim Determination of the effect of a honey based (HB) syrup on the blood parameters of
      patients with breast cancer Design Two arm parallel group randomised clinical trial, double
      blinded Settings and conduct Design of the study: Women patients with breast cancer referring
      to Shohaday-e- Tajrish Hospital of Tehran who are under chemotherapy treatment. In order to
      blind the investigator, medications are named as &quot;A&quot; for syrup of HB and B for placebo. The
      patients don't aware of the type of drug they are assigned to. In addition, the groups are
      entered into statistical analysis as &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B.

      The patients will revive either A or B syrup for 4 weeks. At the beginning of the trial
      demographic data would be gathered. Also, a blood sample would be drawn at the beginning time
      and after the end of intervention period (week 4).

      Data would be analysed by SPSS software using T-test.
