  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will compare two types of rehabilitation in patients who undergo a surgery
      for treatment of malleolar fractures: immediate complete weight-bearing and delayed
      weight-bearing.

      The investigators want to evaluate if the immediate complete weight-bearing can improve and
      hasten the functional outcome of the ankle without increasing the risk of complications.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study population corresponds to the patients who may benefit from a post-operative
      rehabilitation protocol with immediate weight-bearing. Eligible lateral malleolar fractures
      are limited to Weber A and Weber B fractures, since they have a higher stability, after open
      reduction and internal fixation, compared to Weber C and Maisonneuve fractures. This higher
      stability gives the possibility to evaluate the benefit of the immediate weight-bearing
      protocol without safety concerns.

      A power analysis was performed to estimate the required sample size to detect a significant
      difference in the OMAS score at 6 weeks between groups: the number of patients needed is 42
      patients per group (84 patients overall) but, considering the risk of drop-outs, the
      investigators plan to enroll 20% more patients for a total of 100 patients.

      The surgical operation will be carried out following the AO Foundation general and specific
      rules concerning the surgical treatment of malleolar fractures . In particular,an anatomical
      open reduction and internal fixation with one or two compression screws sustained by a
      neutralization third-tubular plate for simple fractures or a bridging third-tubular locking
      compression plate for multi-fragmentary fractures will be performed.

      Postoperatively, patients who still meet the eligibility criteria will be randomized in 2
      groups: immediate post-operative complete weight-bearing and complete weight-bearing delayed
      for 6 weeks.Immediate complete weight-bearing consists in the possibility to undergo all the
      everyday activities without limiting weight-bearing and without the use of walking aids
      (patients will wear an ankle brace, this will ensure the safety of the early recovery phases,
      protecting from dangerous movements while allowing the mobilization in the healthy range of
      movement). Delayed weight-bearing consists in the limitation of the weight-bearing to 20-30%
      of patient's total weight using crutches for the first 6 weeks after surgery (also patients
      of the control group will wear the ankle brace).

      Subsequent follow-up visits are scheduled at 2, 6, 12 and 24 weeks after surgery. Patients
      with a fracture non-union radiologically confirmed at week 24 will be followed up until 48
      weeks after surgery. Clinical assessments will be performed using subjective, objective and
      radiological evaluations. Safety will be monitored throughout the study.

      Overall study duration will be 2 years and 6 months (2 years to reach the expected sample
      size and 6 months to complete the follow-up):

    <measure>change from day 1 after surgery in subjective functional ankle recovery on the Olerud-Molander Ankle Score at week 6</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and week 6</time_frame>
    <description>Functional ankle recovery is measured using the Olerud-Molander Ankle Score (OMAS)- The OMAS is a validated, self-administered patient questionnaire designed to subjectively evaluate ankle function after fracture. The scale is an ordinal functional rating scale based on nine different items given different points.
The total score is calculated as the sum of each rated item and range from 0 points (totally impaired function) to 100 points (completely unimpaired function). The OMAS questionnaire will be administered after surgery (visit 1, day 1) and at week 6 (visit 3).
A negative change from the day of surgery to week 6 will indicate an improvement in OMAS score and, therefore, in functional ankle recovery.</description>

    <measure>Change form day of surgery in functional ankle disability on the Foot and Ankle Disability Index (FADI) during the first 24 weeks after surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 2, 6, 12 and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>measured using the Foot and Ankle Disability Index (FADI) at 2, 6, 12 and 24 weeks postoperatively.
FADI is designed to assess functional limitations related to foot and ankle conditions. FADI consists of 4 pain-related and 22 activity-related items) for a total of 26.
Each of the 22 activity-related items is scored on a 5-point Likert scale from 0 (unable to do) to 4 (no difficulty at all). The 4 pain-items are scored from 0 (none) to 4 (unbearable). The total FADI score is calculated as percentages, with 100% representing no ankle dysfunction.
The FADI questionnaire will be administered after surgery (visit 1, day 1) and at week 2, (visit 2), 6 (visit 3), 12 (visit 4) and 24 (visit 5).
A positive change from the day of surgery to week 2, 6, 12 or 24 will indicate an improvement in FADI score and, therefore, in functional ankle disability.</description>

    <measure>Daily pain and function</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>monitored through mobile NRS application up to 12 weeks postoperatively. A new application suitable for the use with both Android and iOS running mobile phones was developed by our Institution (EOC- Ente Osedaliero Cantonale) , namely &quot;EOC - EMApp&quot;. The application asks the patients two simple questions: to rate actual pain and function on a 0-10 NRS two times daily at random hours in the morning and the evening, as suggested by previous experiences. The following parameters will be calculated and compared between groups: average daily pain and function, mean value of pain and function for each week and for the entire period of assessment (12 weeks). If the patient does not have a smartphone, he/she will not be included it in this assessment group.</description>

    <measure>change in quality of life on the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36 questionnaire).</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 2, 6,12 and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>measured from the day of surgery (Day 1) to 2, 6, 12 and 24 weeks postoperatively by a using the SF-36 questionnaire.
The SF-36 is a validated, self-administered questionnaire specifically designed for evaluating patient health-related quality of life. It comprises of 36 questions, relating to eight key areas of physical and psychological health, including vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning, mental health. The weighted-score of each area is transformed into a 0-100 scale, with lower scores indicating the more disability and higher scores the less disability.
A negative change from the day of surgery to week 2, 6, 12 or 24 will indicate an improvement in SF-36 score and, therefore, in quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Return to previous daily activities on the Tegner activity level scale</measure>
    <time_frame>week 12 and week 24</time_frame>
    <description>evaluated by using the Tegner score at 12 and 24 weeks postoperatively. The Tegner activity level scale is a patient-administered rating system designed to provide a standardized method of grading work and sporting activities. It consists of a graduated list of activities of daily living, recreation, and competitive sports. The patient is asked to select the level of participation that best describes their current level of activity and that before injury. The score varies from 0 that represents sick leave or disability pension because of ankle problems to 10 that corresponds to participation in national and international elite competitive sports.
The Tegner activity level scale questionnaire will be administered at week 12 (visit 4) and 24 (visit 5).
A positive change from score before injury to post-operative score will indicate an improvement in Tegner activity level scale score and, therefore, a higher level of activity and return to previous daily activity.</description>
