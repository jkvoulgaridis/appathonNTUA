  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The planned study is a prospective analysis of non-psychoactive Cannabidiol (without THC) as
      an adjunctive therapy for blepharospasm in a masked double cross-over study. This prospective
      study is a follow-up to a retrospective study completed by the researchers using
      over-the-counter, self purchased CBD. This study will use FDA approved Cannabidiol
      medication, Epidiolex, directly from GW pharmaceuticals, rather than self-purchased CBD from
      the internet. Additionally, patients will undergo EEG monitoring via a Blink-EEG protocol for
      objective data measurements of changes induced by CBD in Blepharospasm patients. Independent
      second measures will be of blink kinematic analysis of review of video recording. Results
      would also be correlated with the Blepharospasm Severity Disability Index, Modified CDQ-24
      scale and Jankovic Rating Scale. To assess any change in anxiety that might be relevant to
      therapeutic effect, the anxiety scale GAD-7 survey will also be administered and correlated
      with the results. This study will attempt to codify the data and quantify if adjunctive CBD
      therapy improves those areas compared to botulinum injection alone.

    <time_frame>4 times over 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>EEG/EOG data will be recorded using an EGI Geodesic Netstation high-density, whole head recording system (Electrical Geodesics, Inc., Eugene, OR) using 128 electrodes distributed around the head and face, with the impedance of all electrodes will be maintained below 60 kΩ according to the recommended value for this system. The data will be recorded at a sampling rate of 500 Hz and band-pass filtered between 0.01 and 250 Hz, with the recorded signals for all electrodes being referenced to the vertex electrode. The results wills be measured in μV deflections over time. The results will be assessed for change at each time point over 6 months.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Jankovic Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>4 times over 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Jankovic Rating Scale is a survey of Blepharospasm Severity and Frequency, each ranked numerically from 0-5 as below:
Blepharospasm Severity 0 = None
= Minimal, increased blinking present only with external stimuli (i.e., bright light or wind)
= Mild, spontaneous eyelid fluttering (without active spasm). Symptoms are noticeable, possibly embarrassing, but not functionally disabling.
= Moderate, very noticeable spasms of eyelids, only. Mildly incapacitating.
= Severe, incapacitating spasms of eyelids and possibly other facial muscles.
Blepharospasm Frequency 0 = None
= Slightly increased frequency of blinking.
= Eyelid fluttering lasting less than 1 second in duration.
= Eyelid spasms lasting for more than 1 second, but eyes open more than 50% of wakeful hours.
= Functionally &quot;blind&quot; due to persistent eyelid closure, more than 50% of the waking time
The results will be assessed for change at each time point over 6 months.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Blepharospasm Disability Index (BSDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 times over 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The BSDI is a survey of symptoms experienced from blepharospasm for activities of daily living, ranked from 0-4 as below:
Items:
Reading Driving a vehicle Watching television Shopping Doing everyday activities Getting about on foot
Ratings 0 = no impairment
= mild impairment
= moderate impairment
= severe impairment
= not possible due to severe disease Not applicable = N/A</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Modified CDQ-24 Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>4 times over 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Modified CDQ-24 Questionnaire is a series of 24 questions surveying how often a specific activity or function is affecting a person. Answers include never/occasionally/sometimes/often/always or not at all/slightly/moderately/severely/very severely.
This is calculated by assigning scores of 1, 2, 3,4, and 5 to the response categories of &quot;never,&quot; &quot;occasionally,&quot; &quot;sometimes,&quot; &quot;often&quot; and &quot;always&quot; respectively, as well as assigning scores of 1, 2, 3,4, and 5 to the response categories of &quot;not at all,&quot; &quot;slightly,&quot; &quot;moderately,&quot; &quot;severely&quot; and &quot;very severely&quot; respectively.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7</measure>
    <time_frame>4 times over 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>This survey asks participants how often they have been bothered by specific problems over the past two weeks. GAD-7 total score for the seven items ranges from 0 to 21. This is calculated by assigning scores of 0, 1, 2, and 3, to the response categories of &quot;not at all,&quot; &quot;several days,&quot; &quot;more than half the days,&quot; and &quot;nearly every day,&quot; respectively</description>
