    <textblock>
      The study, entitled &quot;RCT study of laparoscopic middle hepatic venous guidance versus
      conventional ananatomical hemihepatectomy&quot;, was designed to compare the efficacy of two
      different ananatomical hemihepatectomy procedures under laparoscopy.

      Backgroud &amp; Aim:Hepatectomy is the main way to treat all kinds of liver surgical diseases,
      which can be divided into anatomic hepatectomy and non-anatomic hepatectomy.Among them,
      anatomic hepatectomy is suitable for primary liver cancer, hepatolithiasis and other benign
      and malignant diseases;It can be divided into hepatic venous guidance and non-hepatic venous
      guidance hepatectomy (traditional ananatomical hepatectomy).The aim of this study was to
      observe and compare the perioperative period and follow-up results of the two different
      laparoscopic surgical resection methods, and to provide high-level evidence-based medicine
      evidence for the selection of surgical methods for laparoscopic anatomical hemihepatectomy.

    <description>In theory, the advantages of anatomical hemihepatectomy guided by middle hepatic vein are as follows: 1) correctly guiding the transecting plane of the liver parenchyma can reduce the cross-sectional area of the liver and avoid damaging the vascular ducts of the pre-cut liver. so as to reduce the residue of necrotic tissue without blood supply and reduce the occurrence of postoperative complications. 2) active anatomy and exposure of hepatic vein can avoid uncontrollable bleeding after passive injury of hepatic vein, and laparoscopic anatomy has obvious advantage in exposing hepatic vein. 3) it may reduce the early recurrence rate of hepatocellular carcinoma after operation.</description>

    <description>According to textbooks and the views of some scholars at present, traditional anatomical hepatectomy (non-hepatic vein-guided anatomical hepatectomy) has the following advantages: 1) avoiding exposure of hepatic vein can reduce the probability of injury to the trunk of hepatic vein, thus reduce the risk of massive bleeding during operation; 2) the difficulty of operation is relatively low, and a better short-term and long-term effect can be obtained.</description>
