    <textblock>
      A study comparing 2 groups: interval training and control group. Interval training group will
      perform a physiotherapy program based in exercises, at a high intensity, and stretching of
      muscles at the end. Control group will not perform any physiotherapy program. Several
      parameters will be evaluated at baseline, 2 months and 6 months: anxiety, depression,
      functional capacity, blood pressure, lipid profile, physical activity, ecc.

      A study comparing 2 groups: high intensity interval training and control group. Interval
      training group will perform a two-month physiotherapy program based in exercises, at a high
      intensity, and stretching of muscles at the end. Intensity will be established based on Borg
      scale and an effort test.

      Control group will not perform any physiotherapy program, but will have usual care with
      medication.

      Several parameters will be evaluated at baseline, 2 months and 6 months: anxiety, depression,
      functional capacity, blood pressure, lipid profile, physical activity, ecc.

    <description>Incremental shuttle walk test will be used to measure functional capacity. Patients were required to walk along a level 10 m course at a previously determined speed dictated by signals from an audio tape recorder. The walking speed was progressively increased at 1 min intervals, for a total of 12 stages. The test was terminated if the patient was unable to continue at the desired speed or if the patient failed to complete the shuttle course in the allowed time.
Distance walked were determined on exercise cessation (meters).</description>

    <description>International physical activity questionnaire: it has 9 items and provides information on the time spent while walking, in activities of low, moderate and vigorous intensity and in sedentary activities. Based on the estimated METS consumed, the IPAQ divides the subjects into three levels or categories: Low, moderate and high physical activity. The score of the different types of activity is expressed in METS-minutes per week.</description>

    <measure>health related quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 2 months and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Short-form 36: the questionnaire is composed of 36 questions that value both positive and negative health status. It was developed from an extensive battery of questionnaires employed at WHO, which included 40 concepts related to health. The questionnaire contains 8 scales, which represent the concepts of health most frequently used in the main health questionnaires. The 36 items of the instrument cover the following scales: Physical function, Physical role, Body pain, General health, Vitality, Social function, Emotional role, Mental health. The scores of each of the 8 dimensions of the SF-36 oscillate between 0 and 100. A result of 100 indicates optimal health and 0 would reflect a very poor state of health.</description>

    <measure>anxiety</measure>

    <description>Hospital anxiety and depression questionnaire: the questionnaire includes 14 questions regarding the depressant and anxious symptoms of the patient. Two subsets of 7 items each, on Likert scale 0-3. For anxiety HAD-A sum of odd items (1,3,5,7,9,11,13), for depression HAD-D sum of even items (2,4,6,8,10,12,14 ), with a score range in each subscale of 0-21. A higher score means greater anxiety and depression. For both subscales, scores higher than eleven would indicate &quot;case&quot; and greater than eight would be considered &quot;probable case&quot;. The internal consistency for the Spanish population is HAD-A α = .83 and HAD-D α = .87 (Vallejo, Rivera, Esteve-Vives and RodríguezMuñoz, 2012).</description>
