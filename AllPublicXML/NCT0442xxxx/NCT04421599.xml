  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      H1: Aspiration is not necessary for IM injections applied from the ventrogluteal region.

      H2: Aspiration procedure increases pain in IM injections applied from ventrogluteal region.

      H3: The duration of the aspiration procedure on IM injections applied from the ventrogluteal
      region is effective on pain.

    <description>The content of the study was explained to the patients coming to the emergency room. Written informed consents were obtained in line with the &quot;Individual Introductory Information Form&quot; of the patients.
Individual Introductory Information Form: This form includes questions such as the patient's application group, diagnosis, age, gender, height, weight, and blood intake during aspiration in intramuscular injection. It is completed within the first 10-15 minutes of contact with the patient.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analog Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Intramuscular injection was performed in accordance with the application group assigned to the patients who filled the Individual Introductory Information Form. The patients were not told which group they belonged to.
A nurse who except the researcher who performed the application evaluated pain levels that patients feel during injection immediately after the intramuscular injection application, with a Visual Analog Scale. The minimum score that can be obtained from this scale is 0 and the maximum score is 10. A higher score indicates that the pain is more severe. This scale was applied in minutes 1-5 after intramuscular injection.</description>

    <description>The patients who met the inclusion criteria and agreed to participate in the study were assigned to the Experimental Group A who were administered IM injection during which aspiration lasted for 5-10 seconds, to the Control Group who were administered IM injection during which aspiration lasted for 1-2 seconds, and to the Experimental Group B who were not administered IM injection according to the stratified block randomization list. The same &quot;Intramuscular Injection Application Protocol&quot; was applied while all the injections were administered.</description>
