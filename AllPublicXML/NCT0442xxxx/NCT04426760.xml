  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We aim to explore some of the molecular factors that reduce fertility for women with
      leiomyomas, taking into account leiomyoma location, size, number and vascularity. Tissue
      samples from the endometrium and leiomyomas will be obtained during the mid secretory phase
      before and 3-6 months after surgical excision for a comprehensive search for key molecular
      derangements.

      Baseline medical information and standard questionnaire to record symptoms are collected from
      all participants and a gynaecological examination and a 2D and 3D vaginal ultrasonography
      including saline infusion sonography (SIS), if indicated, are performed. Blood samples for
      the biobank for extraction of germ line DNA and for identification of possible biomarkers are
      taken.

      The women with submucosal leiomyomas will undergo hysteroscopic myomectomy and the women with
      intramural leiomyomas will undergo myomectomy per laparoscopy or laparotomy.

      For the participants with intramural leiomyomas and the fertile/infertile controls,
      endometrial samples are taken with an endometrial suction curette in an outpatient setting at
      day 19-23 of the menstrual cycle. The endometrial sampling in the group of women with
      submucosal leiomyomas is being done during the hysteroscopic removal of the leiomyoma, also
      at day 19-23 of the menstrual cycle.

      3-6 months after surgery, cycle day 19-23, endometrial samples will be taken from the women
      who have undergone myomectomy and ultrasound examination is being performed. The women with
      submucosal leiomyomas will undergo a second look hysteroscopy
