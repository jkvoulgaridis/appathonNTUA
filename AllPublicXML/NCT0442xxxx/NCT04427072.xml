  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to learn whether the study drug (capmatinib) helps to control
      lung cancer better compared to a single agent chemotherapy (docetaxel) and whether it is safe
      when given to patients suffering from a particular type of lung cancer. This type of cancer
      is called non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with certain specific genetic alterations
      (called mutations) of a gene called MET, within a specific part of the gene called exon 14.

      Approximately 90 people with advanced or metastatic lung cancer, with these specific
      mutations in the MET gene but without changes in their epidermal growth factor receptor
      (EGFR) or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) genes, will be enrolled in this study.

      The study drug, capmatinib (also known as INC280), is an oral drug that is called a
      'targeted' medicine, which means it targets particular processes that may not be working
      properly in cancer cells (called dysregulation). The dysregulation of the MET signaling in
      cancer cells of patients with NSCLC is believed to make the cancer worse. Capmatinib has been
      shown to selectively block the effects of the MET gene and therefore may help in keeping the
      disease under control, stopping cancer cells from growing. Docetaxel is a standard
      chemotherapy medicine commonly used to treat your type of lung cancer. This standard,
      anti-cancer medicine is a cytotoxic chemotherapy.

      The reason for this study is to find out if capmatinib can control lung cancer better.

      Patients will be randomly assigned to get either capmatinib or docetaxel in a 2 to 1 ratio:

        -  Capmatinib: 2 out of 3 possibility or 66% chance of getting this treatment,

        -  Docetaxel: 1 out of 3 possibility or 33% chance of getting this treatment.

      During treatment, visits will be scheduled every 21 days.

      Participants eligible for the study will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to one of the two
      treatment arms: capmatinib (investigational therapy) or docetaxel. The randomization will be
      stratified by prior lines of systemic therapy received for advanced/metastatic disease (one
      line vs. two lines).

      For all participants, the respective treatment (either with capmatinib or docetaxel) may be
      continued beyond initial disease progression as per RECIST 1.1 (as assessed by the
      investigator and confirmed by BIRC) if, in the judgment of the investigator, there is
      evidence of clinical benefit, and the participant wishes to continue on the study treatment.
      After treatment discontinuation, all participants will be followed for safety evaluations
      during the safety follow-up period, and the participant's status will be collected every 12
      weeks as part of the survival follow-up.

      Participants randomized to docetaxel treatment will be eligible to crossover to receive
      capmatinib treatment after BIRC-confirmed, RECIST 1.1-defined progressive disease and after
      meeting the eligibility criteria prior to crossover.

      The primary objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of capmatinib versus docetaxel
      by comparing progression-free survival (PFS) by blinded independent review committee (BIRC)
      according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 between treatment
      arms.
