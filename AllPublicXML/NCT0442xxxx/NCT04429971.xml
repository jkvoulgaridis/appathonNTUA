  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite an increasing armamentarium of behavioral and biomedical HIV prevention methods,
      since 2010 rates of new infection have remained around 40,000 annually. The demonstrated
      efficacy and subsequent approval of emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for
      pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV by the FDA in 2012 was thought to represent a turning
      point that could significantly reduce the number of new infections. Since approval, the
      promise of PrEP as a transformative intervention has yet to be realized. Despite the
      implementation of systems for clinical evaluation for and initiation of PrEP by primary care
      providers, HIV specialists, and STI clinics, numerous barriers to PrEP expansion have been
      identified, including: 1) patient and provider lack of knowledge, 2) lack of access to
      medical care among high-risk individuals, 3) provider discomfort and inexperience with
      screening for risk behaviors, and 4) insurance and affordability. This proposal seeks to
      expand access to and engagement in PrEP among high risk individuals though an innovative
      delivery approach in the Emergency Department (ED) while addressing these four barriers.

      Aim 1: Initiate a targeted ED-based PrEP screening program and optimize its feasibility and
      acceptability.

      1a Behavioral risk factor eligibility screening will be performed using the ICAP Pre-Exposure
      Prophylaxis (PrEP) Screening for Substantial Risk and Eligibility tool.

        1. b During a 3-month period, use continuous quality improvement methods to decrease the
           time for completion of PrEP eligibility screening to an interval that is acceptable to
           ED patients and providers.

           Aim 2: Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis Provision in the ED (PrEPPED) Trial: Identify 40 PrEP
           eligible patients over a 12-month period who are interested in initiating PrEP in the
           ED. These patients will be offered immediate PrEP (iPrEP) initiation in the ED with
           facilitated linkage to comprehensive out-patient care.

        2. a Evaluate the impact of a PrEP &quot;starter pack&quot; on patients agreeing to iPrEP. The
           primary outcome is engagement in care at 30-days post PrEP initiation visit. Secondary
           outcomes include retention in care, STI diagnosis, risk behavior and PrEP adherence.

      2b Collect data on recruitment and attrition rates, as well as means and standard deviations
      for key measures that will be needed to plan a definitive trial of ED-initiated PrEP.
