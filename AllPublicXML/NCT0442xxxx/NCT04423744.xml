  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, researchers want to find whether the study drug BAY1817080 has an effect on
      the electrocardiogram (ECG). 40 healthy male or female participants with the age of 18 to 65
      years will be enrolled into this study. The ECG of the participants will be monitored closely
      by the researchers to detect any change after intake of the study medication.
