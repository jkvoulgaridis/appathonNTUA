  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic venous disease (CVD) is widespread in adult subjects of western countries and is
      responsible of important morbidity and healthcare costs. CVD has never been extensively
      studied in pediatric population where the early pathophysiological alterations may occur
      undetected. The aim of this study is to assess the prevalence of CVD searching also for the
      early clinical and instrumental signs of this disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic venous disease (CVD) of lower limbs for its high prevalence in adult population
      represents one of the main causes of morbidity in western countries, and it has also an
      important effect on healthcare cost absorbing 1-2% of the total health budget in western
      countries. Clinical manifestations related to CVD are well documented in adults, with
      clinical guidelines that standardize both diagnosis and treatment. Nevertheless, there is a
      scarcity of published data regarding CVD in children, and in addition, venous duplex
      ultrasound test of the lower limbs is performed much less commonly in children than in
      adults.

      Therefore, the natural history of pediatric venous reflux remains unclear, although it is
      possible that it precedes the onset of CVD in adulthood. In this context, this observational
      study aims to identify the presence of venous reflux, as well as clinical and morphological
      data in pediatric subjects, aged between 9 and 18 years old, by performing an office vascular
      visit and an echo duplex scan of lower limbs. The endpoints of this study are to
      prospectively assess the prevalence of CVD in children, as well as to evaluate a possible
      correlation between vein diameter and pathological vein reflux.
