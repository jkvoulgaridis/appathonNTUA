  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Therapeutic drug monitoring of antibiotics in critically ill patients is a present research
      topic of the last ten years. Research results have shown subtherapeutic blood concentrations
      in those patients. However, the amount of antibiotics in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in
      patients with ventriculitis or meningitis is still unclear. This study is a prospective study
      to evaluate the concentration of different antibiotics in the CSF in patients with an
      external ventricular drainage compared to antibiotic blood concentration.

    <textblock>
      Bacterial infections are still associated with a high mortality in intensive care unit
      patients. Especially patients diagnosed with ventriculitis caused by a bacterial infection
      have a bad outcome. Therefore, antibiotic therapy is the only causal opportunity to treat
      those infections. However, there are many chances in pharmacokinetic and -dynamic in
      critically ill patients with unpredictable antibiotic concentrations. Furthermore, it is
      important that the concentration in the blood as well as in the effect-compartment &quot;CSF&quot; is
      sufficient. Less data of the last years describe antibiotic concentrations in the CSF and
      show subtherapeutic levels, which is endangering for the therapeutic success. The introduced
      study is a prospective, observational study that analyses antibiotic concentrations in CSF in
      critically ill patients. The distribution between CSF and blood will be evaluated by
      comparing these two compartments.
