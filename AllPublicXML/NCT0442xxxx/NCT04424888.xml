    <textblock>
      This 5-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2x2 crossover pilot study investigate the
      potential of collecting robust, real-time clinical study measures of glucose levels using
      Abbott Freestyle Libre Continuous Glucose Monitoring devices associated with a smartphone
      application

      The goal of this study is to characterize the performance of a Continuous Glucose Monitoring
      System in medical food studies. The Freestyle Libre Glucose Sensors will be used to follow
      subject's 8-day glucose trajectories over the course of a 5-week, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, 2x2 crossover, medical-food experiment. The medical food has been
      designed to increase butyrate production and promote the health of the colonic mucin layer.
