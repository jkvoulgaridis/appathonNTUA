  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Switzerland, the most commonly performed bariatric procedure is the proximal Roux-en-y
      gastric Bypass surgery. Since marginal ulceration is a known complication after this
      Operation, a Proton pump Inhibitor (PPI) prophylaxis is prescribed postoperatively. Bariatric
      surgery may have an impact on the absorption and consequently on the efficacy of drugs. There
      are only very little data on the pharmacokinetics of PPIs following PRYGB.

      The aim of this study is to analyze the serum concentration of dexlansoprazole preoperative
      and after PRYGB surgery in patients taking PPI prophylaxis and to examine the incidence of
      marginal ulcers postoperatively in the same population.

      This prospective, monocentric study includes 30 patients undergoing a proximal Roux-en-Y
      gastric Bypass surgery and receiving 6 months of postoperative PPI prophylaxis with Dexilant
      (dexlansoprazole). The aim is to examine if the LPRYGB has an impact on the absorption of
      dexlansoprazole. Peripheral blood samples from the study participants are obtained at fixed
      time points after oral Administration of a capsule Dexilant preoperatively as well as 3 and 6
      months after surgery. The incidence of marginal ulceration in the same patient population is
      assessed by upper endoscopy 6 and 12 months after surgery. The surgery, the PPI prophylaxis
      and the upper endoscopy 12 months post-surgery aren't for study purpose. Data collection is
      made by measuring serum drug concentration, patient questionnaires, pill count and upper
      endoscopy.
