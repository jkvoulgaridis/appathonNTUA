  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis is a life-threatening disease characterized by multi-organ failure due to dysregulated
      host response to infection, with high global mortality of 30-50%. One of the most important
      pathophysiologic hallmarks in sepsis is vascular endothelial injury that contributes to the
      severity and outcome of the syndrome. Effective treatments for endothelial cell injury in
      sepsis have been lacking to improve prognosis. Endothelial pyroptosis is a vital mechanism of
      vascular endothelial injury in sepsis; mitigation or abolishment of endothelial cell
      pyroptosis alleviate vascular endothelial damage and improve the prognosis of sepsis mice.
      Gasdermin D (GSDMD) mediated endothelial pyroptosis plays a critical role in modulating
      vascular endothelial injury in sepsis.

      Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), as a class of non-coding protein RNA longer than 200 kD,
      contributes to a variety of cell biological processes. The dysregulation of lncRNA results in
      the occurrence and development of tumors, diabetes, sepsis and other diseases. Therefore, we
      detected lncRNA and mRNA expression profile in 26 blood samples of septic patients using
      Arraystar LncRNA Microarray. We found lncRNA NBR2 regulates septic endothelial pyroptosis.

      To assess any correlation of pyroptosis levels with relevant endothelial cell injury
      parameters and determine the prognostic value in septic patients. we measured the levels of
      pyroptosis in patients admitted to the Department of Critical Care Medicine for sepsis and
      investigated the correlation with related markers of endothelium injury. Furthermore, we
      determined the prognostic value of pyroptosis levels for the mortality of patients with
      sepsis.

        sepsis was defined according to &quot;sepsis 3.0&quot;, which including suspected or confirmed
        infection and increased SOFA â‰¥ 2, confirmed by two experienced intensive care physicians.
        The infection was defined on the basis of infection sites, clinical features, clinical
        microbiology, and imaging tests. Septic shock was defined as a vasopressor requirement to
        maintain a mean arterial pressure of 65 mmHg or greater and serum lactate level greater
        than 2 mmol/L in the absence of hypovolemia.
