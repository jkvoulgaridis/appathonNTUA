      Evaluate the prognostic value of different methods (Osmometry / clinical-biological score)
      compared to the occurrence of capillary leak shock during dengue fever.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      On the South American continent, dengue fever progressively progresses to hyperendemia with
      co-circulation of different serotypes. Among the complications of dengue fever, a frequent
      complication is the shock linked to capillary leakage which often occurs at the time of
      defervescence between the 3rd or 5th day of evolution of the fever. Before that, it is
      difficult to identify patients who are at risk for severe forms. Patients are therefore seen
      regularly to monitor for the development of serious forms, which causes saturation of the
      health system. Despite everything, with each epidemic we observe deaths of previously healthy
      people, which always constitutes an important trauma for the population and for the carers.
      Improving the understanding of the pathophysiology of capillary leakage and the tools to
      predict it would be significant advances in this common tropical pathology. Thus a
      retrospective study of longitudinal data during the dengue 2 epidemic of 2013 made it
      possible to generate precise hypotheses as to the pathophysiology of the shock linked to
      capillary leakage. Hypoprotidemia and hyponatremia having a strong statistical association
      with the subsequent occurrence of shock, the hypothesis is of a progressive disturbance of
      the plasma osmolarity resulting in water leaks towards the interstitial sector.

      These preliminary data also made it possible to develop a predictive score which must now be
      validated over time.
