  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is proposed with treatment of ATG-010 combined with chemotherapy regimens which
      will be chosen by investigators (ICE [ifosfamide+carboplatin+etoposide] or GEMOX
      [gemcitabine+oxaliplatin]), after treatments of 2 to 6 cycles transferring to ATG-010
      monotherapy maintenance treatment, to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and primary efficacy
      of ATG-010 in R/R PTCL and NK/T-cell lymphoma patients.

      This trial is a single-arm, open-label, multi-center Phase Ib clinical study that will
      evaluate ATG-010 combined with chemotherapy regimen selected by investigators (ICE regimen
      ifosfamide+carboplatin+etoposide; Or GEMOX regimen: gemcitabine+oxaliplatin) sequential ATG
      010 monotherapy maintenance, to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and primary efficacy in
      R/R PTCL and NK/T-cell lymphoma patients. Thirty patients are planned to be enrolled (about
      50% of patients will be enrolled in ICE and GEMOX, respectively), among which, no more than 5
      patients will be enrolled in type of NK/T-cell lymphoma.
