      This study compared the effectiveness of two-mode of activity-based upper limb rehabilitation
      (Modified Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy and Bimanual training) on health-related
      quality of life outcomes in school-aged children with cerebral palsy

    <textblock>
      A total of 52 primary schools were screened comprehensively to determine children conforming
      specifications of the inclusion criteria. Demographic characteristics (e.g. age, gender,
      affected side) and severity of functional impairment dealing with cognitive /communication,
      manual ability and mobility were noted. After a comprehensive screening, a total of 30
      children met inclusion criteria (grades 1-4) were randomly assigned to one of two groups
      (Modified Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy or Bimanual training), at an equal number and
      probability. Children blinded to group allocation were delivered activity-based upper limb
      training in the context of Modified Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy or Bimanual training,
      at a similar dose and frequency (10 weeks/3 days per week/2.5 hours per day). 1 out of 3
      sessions per week was carried out in the school time (during the art or physical education
      class), while 2 out of 3 sessions were carried out in rehabilitation centers which the
      children regularly attend for regular care 2-day weekly. All participating children continued
      to receive their standard care (90 minutes per week) throughout the study period.

      During the 1-month screening period, physical characteristics of participants were described
      through classification systems including The Communication Function Classification System,
      The Manual Ability Classification System , and The Gross Motor Function Classification
      System. Participating children were evaluated before the study entry (t1), and at immediate
      (t2) and three months post-treatment (t3) KIDSCREEN-27 questionnaire.

    <description>A list of fine and motor activities consisted of the functional tasks or play activities such as school-education and sports activities, manipulative games, arts, and crafts, etc. to elicit the maximum capacity of the more affected upper limb was created according to the procedure of modified constraint-induced movement therapy (Gordon et al., 2005) and Bimanual training. In addition, specific activities were also chosen in terms of deficit of interest, participant preference (on the condition of having potential effects on hand skills) and parent/guardian, or their teacher's request. In case of activities requiring both hand use, such as stabilizing paper during the painting or holding the bricks of lego on the ground, the treating physiotherapist undertook a role as a dominant hand</description>

    <description>For the Bimanual training, skilled, repetitive, and structured bimanual activities (part or whole task practice) were used to promote bimanual hand use and improve movement deficits determined before the intervention. All targeted deficits of interest were addressed within the context of the selected activity. Specifically, symmetrical bilateral movements were utilized to augment neural input from both sides. Also, meaningful activities such as buttoning and zipping-up trousers, etc. were used to ensure a transition from structured setting to real-life activities</description>
