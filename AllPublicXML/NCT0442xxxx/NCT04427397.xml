  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, all subjects will be given an electric toothbrush. Half of the participants
      will be instructed on how to use the Sulcular Bristle Tip Technique (SBTT). The other half of
      participants will be asked to follow the brushing instructions in the user manual. The
      study's primary aim is to compare the use of the SBTT with an electric toothbrush in reducing
      bleeding on probing with the use of an electric toothbrush used without personal professional
      instruction.

    <description>Tooth brushing should begin on the distal of the most posterior tooth on one side of the mouth and proceed anteriorly and then posteriorly overlapping areas to the most distal surface of the most posterior tooth on the contra lateral side. The lingual is done in like fashion ending where the brushing began. The opposing arch is brushed in the same manner. When moving from one area to the next, disengage the brush bristles entirely off the teeth to allow them to straighten, and then reposition the brush in the next overlapping area. Do not to drag the bristle tips from one area to the next area. For the lingual of the anterior teeth, the narrow portion of the brush is used with the exact same technique as described above. For the lingual of the mandibular molars, the angulation of the toothbrush bristles to the tooth needs to be somewhat more perpendicular to the tooth than on the buccal to ensure that the bristle tips enter the gingival crevice.</description>
