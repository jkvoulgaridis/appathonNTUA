  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to analyze the effects of a 3 months duration self-applied online program,
      composed of 9 modules focused on promoting healthy lifestyle habits (healthy eating and
      increased physical activity), on obese or overweight adults with hypertension. Participants
      will be recruited from a hypertension unit of a public hospital. These patients will be
      randomized allocated into two interventional groups: experimental group will receive
      audiovisual instructions from their hypertension specialist doctor, and the control group
      from a doctor outside the patient. Assessment will include: body composition (BMI), blood
      pressure, levels of physical activity, functional capacity, fall risk, and quality of life.

    <textblock>
      Hypertension and obesity or overweight related, even other associated comorbidities, involve
      a worrying public health problem. The evidence shows that healthy eating and regular physical
      exercise, monitored by different means (internet, face to face, exercise diaries), play an
      important prevention role to maintain health while ageing. In this way, Information and
      Communication Technologies (ICTs) have been demonstrated as a useful tool to promote health,
      working on barriers at the same time, such as low motivation and difficulties to maintain
      regular exercise or healthy eating habits. ICTs also allows to reach a wider audience at a
      lower cost, due to their good cost-benefit relationship and the possibility of increasing the
      efficiency of interventions. Therefore, this study aims to analyze the effects of a 3 months
      duration self-applied online program, composed of 9 modules focused on promoting healthy
      lifestyle habits (healthy eating and increased physical activity), on obese or overweight
      adults with hypertension. Participants will be recruited from a hypertension unit of a public
      hospital. These patients will be randomized allocated into two interventional groups:
      experimental group will receive audiovisual instructions from their hypertension specialist
      doctor, and the control group from a doctor outside the patient. Assessment will include:
      body composition (BMI), blood pressure, levels of physical activity, functional capacity,
      fall risk, and quality of life.

    <description>Fall risk perception (measured with FES Questionnaire). The 'Falls Efficacy Scale' (FES) directly evaluate the impact of fear of falling on social life. This scale has excellent reliability, is correlated with measures of balance and gait, and predicts future falls and decline in functional capacity. The 16 items of the FES are rated according to &quot;how concerned you are about the possibility of falling&quot;, using the following responses (score in parentheses): not at all (1), somewhat (2), fairly (3), and very concerned (4). Thus, the total score ranges from 16 to 64 points. Higher values indicate less fall-related self-efficacy (and more concern about falling).</description>
