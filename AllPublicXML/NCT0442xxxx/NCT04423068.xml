  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this study is to refine and pilot test the investigators novel
      intervention to offer contraception counseling and initiation for hospitalized female
      adolescents, focusing on long acting reversible contraception (LARC).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are two primary objectives in this study. The first objective is to refine the
      investigators previously developed general sexual risk reduction intervention (SexHealth II)
      to focus on patient-centered contraception counseling and initiation for hospitalized female
      adolescents. The second objective is to conduct an open trial to assess feasibility of the
      investigators SexHealth II intervention among hospitalized females aged 14-21 years (N=75).
      Among key stakeholders (i.e., adolescent participants, parents/guardians, hospitalists and
      nurses), the investigators will assess Bowen's feasibility constructs: acceptability, demand,
      implementation, practicality, integration, and limited-efficacy testing. The investigators
      hypothesize that the SexHealth II intervention will be deemed feasible by female adolescent
      participants (i.e., the median score across all feasibility items will be &gt; 2.5.)

    <measure>Feasibility of SexHealth II, an intervention to provide contraception counseling and initiation among hospitalized female adolescents</measure>
    <time_frame>Total study duration for participant follow up is 3 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators primary outcome is feasibility of the intervention among female adolescent participants, which the investigators will assess by administering a survey with 12 Likert-type items with responses ranging from 0 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree). The midpoint (neutral) point on the 0-4 scale is 2, and the investigators define &quot;acceptable level of feasibility&quot; as the median feasibility rating in the population exceeding 2.5, meaning at least half the ratings are positive. Thus, the investigators will test the hypothesis that the true median feasibility rating in the population of adolescents from which the sample is drawn is greater than 2.5.
The investigators expect the true median is above 2.5. Assuming its value is conservatively 2.75, a sample size of 75 provides 90% power to reject H0 using a two-sided sign test for the population median.</description>
