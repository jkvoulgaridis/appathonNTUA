  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Norwegian prospective observational study that evaluates the resectability rate in
      patients with borderline resectable and locally advanced pancreatic cancer who received
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy in a population based cohort. Eligible patients are treated with
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy possibly followed by surgical exploration and resection. All
      Norwegian centres performing pancreatic surgery have agreed to collaborate in this trial. The
      assignment of the medical intervention is not at the discretion of the investigator, but
      follow the national Norwegian guidelines regarding diagnostic work up, oncological and
      surgical treatment and follow up.
