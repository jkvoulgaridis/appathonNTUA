  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted to evaluate the clinical performance and validity of both
      light-induced fluorescence intraoral camera and laser-induced fluorescence device in
      comparison to visual-tactile assessment method in detection of secondary caries around
      margins of resin composite restorations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each patient should have at least one resin composite restoration. The restoration will be
      evaluated by all diagnostic methods. Each examiner will independently record the dental
      findings using all methods, the visual- tactile assessment method and both fluorescent-aided
      identification methods. The visual-tactile assessment method includes the use of mirror,
      probe under good illumination condition, while the fluorescent-aided identification methods
      will be performed by both light-induced fluorescence intraoral camera and laser-induced
      fluorescence device. Then Diagnostic performance for caries detection was evaluated,
      assessing the validity of each diagnostic method in diagnosing secondary caries around
      margins of resin composite restorations
