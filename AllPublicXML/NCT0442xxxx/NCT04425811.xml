      The effect of kinesiological taping applied to the tibialis anterior muscle on gait parameter
      in stroke patients: Sham controlled study

      Objective: The aim of this study was to compare the immediate effect of kinesiological and /
      or sham taping to the tibialis anterior muscle on walking parameters in stroke individuals.

      Methods: The study included 28 adults stroke patients . The subjects who received scores of 7
      or more in the Hodkinson Mental Test and 3 and above in the Functional Ambulation
      Classification with subjects who gastrocnemius muscle spasticity 2 and below points according
      to Modified Ashworth Scale were included in the study. The walking parameters of the
      participants were evaluated with the BTS G-Walk Spatio-Temporal Walking Analysis System. The
      walking parameters of the participants who were selected by randomization method were
      evaluated separately by applying kinesiological taping and sham taping or without any taping
      or interference on a 10 meter track.

    <description>The dominant side lower extremity of the participants was determined as the first preferred lower limb to take steps when walking. Walking parameters of the participants included in the study were evaluated with BTS G-Walk Spatio-Temporal Gait Analysis System. Before the banding applications of the patients, walking parameters were measured by asking them to walk with a shoe that they always use daily with the command &quot;walk normally&quot; on a 10-meter course, and stop with the command &quot;stop&quot; after 10 meters.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>With kinesiological taping walking parameter measurement</measure>
    <time_frame>2 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Kinesiological taping or sham taping was performed by a certified physiotherapist 2 hours after the measurement of walking parameters without any intervention. Kinesiological banding for the tibialis anterior muscle was performed using muscle technique (stimulation). The taping was performed with the patients lying on a stretcher in the supine position. The kinesiological band was cut in the shape of I considering the participant's muscle length, the edges were ovalized, and the skin was purified from moisture, hair and oil. While applying the muscle technique (stimulation), the tibialis anterior muscle was stretched in the plantar flexion and eversion position. It was then activated by applying heat along the band. After the band was activated, the walking parameters of the participant were measured again with the BTS G-Walk device.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>With sham taping walking parameter measurement</measure>
    <time_frame>2 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The sham taping was applied to the participants a week or a week before the application of the kinesiological tape. Sham taping application was applied to the same area as kinesiological taping application, but no technique was used. After the Sahm taping application, the walking parameters of the participants were measured again with the BTS G-Wlak device.</description>
