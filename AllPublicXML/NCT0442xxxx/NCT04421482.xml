  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is estimated that 30-70% of very low birth weight (VLBW) preterm infants will be diagnosed
      with swallowing dysfunction (dysphagia), which often leads to airway compromise in the form
      of laryngeal penetration and/or tracheal aspiration during oral feeding attempts. Chronic
      airway compromise results in a persistent inflammatory state, with disease progression that
      can be devastating for already fragile and developmentally immature lungs in preterm infants.
      At this time, there are limited therapeutic options for dysphagia in VLBW infants during oral
      feeding. In a recent publication, our research group was the first to demonstrate that
      short-duration of oral feeding with cold liquid reduces dysphagia occurrence from 71% to 26%.
      However, these data must be further validated for the effectiveness and safety of a full
      duration feeding before being recommended for routine clinical practice.

      The objective is to identify preliminary evidence for the efficacy and safety of feeding full
      oral cold milk for dysphagia management in preterm infants. We hypothesize that oral feeding
      of cold milk in VLBW preterm infants with dysphagia will improve suck/swallow/breathe
      coordination and decrease penetration/ aspiration to the airway. We further hypothesize that
      cold milk intervention will have no adverse effects on intestinal blood flow, as assessed by
      Doppler Ultrasound. This is significant because there is a critical need to identify
      effective and safe evidence-based treatment options for dysphagia management in preterm
      infants.

      This prospective study will seek to enroll Subjects who meet the following inclusion
      criteria: 1) VLBW (birth weight less than 1,500g and less than 32 weeks gestation), 2)
      admitted to NYU-Winthrop NICU, 3) Post-menstrual age (PMA) &gt; 35 weeks at the time of the
      study, 4) receiving no or minimum respiratory support (&lt;1 lit/min low-flow nasal cannula), 5)
      tolerating at least 50% of their enteral feeding orally, 6) having symptoms of swallowing
      dysfunction during oral feeding (clinical dysphagia) and 7) referred by the medical team for
      video fluoroscopic swallow study (VFSS) and/or fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing
      (FEES).

      To assess the efficacy of cold milk in treating dysphagia, study subjects will first have an
      oral motor feeding assessment using an FDA approved device called the nFant® Feeding Solution
      as well as VFSS and/or FEES. To assess the safety of using cold milk, subjects will receive a
      doppler ultrasound before and after the ingestion of cold liquid feeding to assess the
      mesenteric blood flow.
