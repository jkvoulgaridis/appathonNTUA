          5. Histologically confirmed invasive breast cancer based on local testing on the most
             recent analyzed biopsy of the following breast cancer (BC) subtypes per 2018 American
             Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)/College of American Pathologists (CAP) criteria:

               -  Cohort 1 and 3: HER2 positive status

               -  Cohort 4: HER2-low expressing status

               -  Cohort 2 and 5: both HER2 positive and HER2-low expressing status

        Note 1: According to the 2018 ASCO-CAP guidelines, HER2- positive status is defined as HER2
        immunohistochemistry (IHC) 3+, in situ hybridization (ISH) ≥ 2.0, or average HER2 copy
        number ≥ 6.0 signals. HER2-low expressing status defined as IHC 2+ / ISH-negative or IHC 1+
        (ISH-negative or untested).

        Note 2: Central confirmation of HER2 is not required for study entry. However, tissue
        blocks, or slides, must be submitted to confirm BC subtype by a Sponsor-designated central
        laboratory retrospectively.

        Unresectable locally advanced or metastatic disease documented by computerized tomography
        (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that is not amenable to resection with
        curative intent.

        7. At least one brain lesion needed to be measurable (≥10 mm on T1-weighted,
        gadolinium-enhanced MRI) (study cohorts 2 to 4) or leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (LMC) with
        positive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytology (study cohort 5).

          -  Study cohort 1: History of BM that are non-progressing after WBRT and/or SRS and or
             surgery.

          -  Study cohort 2: Presence of asymptomatic BM without clinical requirement for local
             intervention (WBRT and/or SRS and/or surgery).

          -  Study cohorts 3 and 4: Evidence of new and/or progressive BM following previous WBRT
             and/or SRS and/or surgery.

          -  Study cohort 5: Evidence of LMC with positive CSF cytology.

             8. Previous treatments:

          -  For HER2-positive patients have been previously treated with a taxane and at least one
             HER2-targeted therapy in the advanced scenario.

          -  For HER2-low-expressing patients that also are endocrine receptor negative must have
             been previously treated with at least one chemotherapy regimen. If endocrine receptor
             positive, patients must have been previously treated with at least one chemotherapy
             and one endocrine regimen in the metastatic setting.

             9. Patients must agree to collection of blood samples at the time of inclusion, at
             cycle 2 of treatment, and upon progression or study termination.

        Note: In study cohort 5: Patients must agree to perform spinal taps or must be willing to
        have an Ommaya reservoir placed for CSF assessment, at baseline, every three weeks for 12
        weeks (corresponding to the first 5 cycles of treatment) and every six weeks thereafter.

        10. Willingness and ability to provide tumor biopsy (if feasible) from metastatic lesions
        or breast primary tumor both at the time of the inclusion and after disease progression in
        order to perform exploratory studies.

        Note: If feasible, patients should provide a tissue sample at baseline from metastases
        amenable to biopsy (at sites of locoregional recurrence [skin, chest wall, breast or lymph
        nodes], or distant recurrence [bone, liver, lung or abdomen]) or as alternative from breast
        primary tumor, that will be obtained between progression to the prior regimen and inclusion
        in the study. Patients for whom tissue sample cannot be obtained (e.g., non-measurable
        disease, inaccessible tumor or subject safety concern) may submit an archived metastatic
        tumor specimen only upon agreement from the Sponsor. If feasible, an additional tissue
        sample should be collected at the end of treatment visit for patients who discontinue
        treatment due to disease progression.

        11. Patients should have left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ 50% by either an
        echocardiogram (ECHO) or multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan within 28 days before
        enrolment.

        (ANC) 3 1.5 x 109/L, platelet count 3 100.0 x109/L, and hemoglobin 3 9.0 g/dL. (Platelet,
        red blood cell transfusion as well as G-CSF administration are not allowed within 1 week of
        screening assessments).

        documented Gilbert's disease and/or liver metastases); aspartate transaminase (AST) and

             chronic Grade 2 toxicities may be eligible per the discretion of the Investigator
             after consultation with the Sponsor Medical Monitor or designee (e.g., Grade 2
