      The present project will compare the effect of DH reduction using three different dentifrices
      (Sensodyne Repair and Protect - NOVAMIN technology; Dentalclean Daily Regenerator - REFIX
      technology; Dentalclean Daily Regenerator - REFIX technology + potassium citrate) in
      periodontal patients. The evaluation will be in 6 moments: T1 and T2- immediately before and
      after scaling and root planing (SRP) procedures; T3-after polishing sensitive areas with
      rubbers cups and the dentifrice determined for each group of patients and T4, 5, 6- After 2,
      4 and 8 weeks of SRP. Profissional assessments and patient perception data will be performed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Periodontal patients may report dentinal hypersensitivity (DH) caused by root surface
      exposure as part of disease process or as a result of periodontal treatment. Although some
      studies evaluated DH reduction using desensitizing toothpastes, no specific chemical/physical
      agent is reported for periodontal patients. Thus, the present project will compare the effect
      of DH reduction using three different dentifrices (Sensodyne Repair and Protect - NOVAMIN
      technology; Dentalclean Daily Regenerator - REFIX technology; Dentalclean Daily Regenerator -
      REFIX technology + potassium citrate) in periodontal patients. This randomized, parallel and
      blinded clinical trial will be divided into 3 groups (SEN GROUP: Sensodyne; REG GROUP:
      Regenerator; REGK GROUP: Regenerator + Potassium Citrate) and evaluated at 6 moments: T1 and
      T2- immediately before and after scaling and root planing (SRP) procedures; T3-after
      polishing sensitive areas with rubbers cups and the dentifrice determined for each group of
      patients and T4, 5, 6- After 2, 4 and 8 weeks of SRP. Air blast sensitivity assessments
      (Schiff scale) and patient perception data on DH will be performed using visual analog scales
      (VAS). The comparison between treatment groups will be done by paired T-test if normal
      distribution is observed or Wilcoxon if non-normal distribution. The significance level
      adopted will be 5% (p &lt;0.05).
