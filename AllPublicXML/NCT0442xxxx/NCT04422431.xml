  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the study is to evaluate the change in liver copper (Cu) concentration
      following 48 weeks of treatment with ALXN1840 in adult participants with Wilson Disease (WD)
      who have been previously treated for at least 1 year with standard of care (that is,
      trientine, penicillamine, or zinc). In the Treatment Period, efficacy and safety of ALXN1840
      will be assessed at Week 48.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants who complete the 48-week Treatment Period will be offered the opportunity to
      continue their treatment in a 48-week Extension Period that will offer additional time for
      evaluation of long-term efficacy and safety of ALXN1840. There will be no liver biopsies
      during the Extension Period.
