  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open label study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      neoadjuvant PD-1 antibody plus chemotherapy followed by surgery in resectable stage IIIA-N2
      non-small cell lung cancer.

    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomised, two-arm, phase II, multi-centre clinical trial. The
      proposed study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of preoperative administration PD-1
      antibody plus chemotherapy in patients resectable stage IIIA-N2 NSCLC. Data obtained in this
      study will provide valuable information for planning further phase III clinical trials of
      anti-PD-1 and other immunotherapies in NSCLC, both in the peri-operative and advanced disease
      setting.

    <description>Neoadjuvant treatment (PD-1 antibody+carboplatin+pemetrexed or nab-paclitaxel ) will start within 1-3 days from enrollment. 3 cycles will be administered at 21-day (+/- 3 days) intervals (QW3) prior to surgery. Before surgery a tumor assessment will be done. Patients with stable disease or partial response may be considered for surgery.
Surgery: Surgery must be done within the 4rd-6th week from day 1 cycle 3 of neoadjuvant treatment (day 29-43 after day 1 of cycle 3) Adjuvant treatment: Patients that are R0 confirmed by surgical pathology evaluation will receive the first adjuvant administration within the 2rd to 8th week from surgery. Two cycles of combinded adjuvant treatment (PD-1 antibody+carboplatin+pemetrexed or nab-paclitaxel ) will be administered. Six cycles of PD-1 antibody will start within day 21-24 days from day 1 of adjuvant cycle 2.</description>
