      Background :

      Although the hypersensitivity reactions to cephalosporins have been recently a more focused
      subject, studies on the cephalosporin as an allergen are significantly less frequent that
      those regarding penicillins. Most of the available data regards cephalosporin sensitization
      in patients previously allergic to penicillin. Like penicillins, cephalosporins represent one
      of the most prescribed classes of antibiotics. The diagnosis of cephalosporin
      hypersensitivity is based mainly on clinical history, skin tests (ST) and drug provocation
      tests (DPT). This succession of tests, performed in specialized services, allows to eliminate
      responsibility for the drug in many cases (80-85%). The drug allergy work-up also allows to
      identify profiles of allergy to cephalosporins, with different patterns of cross-reactivity.

      Objective: To analyse the characteristics of patients studied in our Unit for suspicion of
      cephalosporin hypersensitivity.

      Methods: This retrospective study will comprise all the patients who attended the allergy
      service of the UH of Montpellier from 1997 till 2018 with a clinical history evocative of
      cephalosporin drug hypersensitivity reaction (DHR), who underwent a drug allergy work up and
      who gave their consent to be included in the study . The Patients are selected from the Drug
      Allergy &amp; Hypersensitivity Database (DAHD).
