  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-bariatric hypoglycemia (PBH) is an increasingly recognized syndrome that is incompletely
      understood.

      The purpose of this study is to increase our level of understanding by investigating
      mechanisms contributing to this condition.

      Participation in this study will take place over four visits, which will include the
      following:

        -  Wearing of a continuous glucose monitoring device;

        -  Providing a stool sample (collected at home);

        -  Measuring glucose and hormone levels in response to a meal;

        -  Measuring glucose and hormone levels in response to an injection of glucagon;

        -  Measuring hormone levels while we gradually lower glucose levels, and during a
           controlled period of a low glucose level (hypoglycemic clamp).

      We will test the hypothesis that counterregulatory hormone responses are impaired in
      individuals with PBH, and that differences in the intestinal bacteria (microbiome) may
      contribute to this condition.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bariatric surgery is increasingly recognized as a potent tool for the treatment of type 2
      diabetes (T2D), yielding not only weight loss but also rapid improvements in glycemia
      allowing discontinuation of diabetes-related medication within days after surgery. However,
      along with this metabolic success comes an increased incidence of severe hypoglycemia (termed
      post-bariatric hypoglycemia; PBH) for a subset of individuals.

      The goal of these studies is to identify physiological and molecular mechanisms that underlie
      PBH, to determine whether these changes also contribute to surgery-induced improvements in
      glucose regulation (homeostasis), and to define potential new therapeutic interventions for
      PBH.

      Participation in this study will take place over four visits, which will include the
      following:

        -  Detailed history, physical exam, and laboratory testing to determine study eligibility

        -  Assessment of glucose patterns using a masked continuous glucose monitor;

        -  Analysis of a stool sample (collected at home);

        -  Measuring glucose and hormone levels in response to a meal;

        -  Measuring glucose and hormone levels in response to an injection of glucagon;

        -  Measuring hormone levels while we gradually lower glucose levels, and during a
           controlled period of a low glucose level (hypoglycemic clamp).

      We will test the hypothesis that counterregulatory hormone responses are impaired in
      individuals with PBH, and that differences in the intestinal bacteria (microbiome) and
      hormones produced in response to a meal may contribute to this condition.

    <measure>Metabolic responses during experimental hypoglycemia induced by hypoglycemic clamp and/or mixed meal testing</measure>
    <time_frame>July 2023</time_frame>
    <description>Metabolites will be measured at set time points after the start of insulin or mixed meal. For the hypoglycemic clamp, a time-trend analysis will be performed to identify the glucose level at which each metabolite rises significantly above the linear average of its preceding values. Linear mixed effects modeling will be utilized to identify group- and time-dependent differences in metabolite responses. Data will be checked to ensure variables conform to assumptions of the analysis. Sensitivity analysis will determine whether missing data are randomly associated with clinical or experimental phenotypes, and assess the impact of missing data on conclusions. Relationships between clinical and metabolic variables will be analyzed using Pearson correlation, and adjusted for multiple comparisons using Benjamini-Hochberg testing.</description>

    <description>This test will assess hormonal responses to hypoglycemia. Participants will arrive after an overnight fast. After baseline blood sampling, an infusion of insulin and glucose will be started, and infusions will be adjusted to allow glucose levels to drop very gradually. Blood samples will be collected for measurement of hormonal responses to lowering of glucose. This test will allow us to determine whether secretion of hormones which counteract hypoglycemia (counterregulatory hormones) is reduced in patients with PBH as compared with other groups.</description>
