  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The PainTEQ study is a prospective, multi-site, prospective, single arm study intended to
      collect clinical data outcomes data associated with the treatment of sacroiliac disease with
      the LinQ fusion procedure. Data will be collected using self-report measures including the
      visual analog scale (VAS) for pain assessment where the participant is asked to place a line
      perpendicular to the VAS line at the point that represents their pain intensity. Using a
      ruler, the score is determined by measuring the distance (mm) on the 10-cm line between the
      &quot;no pain&quot; anchor and the patient's mark, providing a range of scores from 0-100. Other
      self-report questionnaires will be administered including the Oswestry Disablity Index (ODI)
      to measure low-back pain and disability, and the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement
      Information System 29 (PROMIS 29) to measure physical, mental, and social health and
      well-being.

    <description>2. Change in Oswestry Disability Index at 6 months follow up ODI assesses disability and has 10 sections, each with a point range from 0 (minimum) to 5 (maximum). A higher score translates to a higher percentage, meaning more disability (100% maximum). A lower score translates to a lower percentage, meaning less disability (0% minimum).</description>

    <description>3. Change in PROMIS-29 at 6 months follow up. PROMIS 29 assesses pain intensity using a 0-10 numeric rating scale (11 point scale), where a higher score equates to more pain. Other health domains are scored using a Likert scale, where higher scores represent more of the specific domain being measured.</description>
