  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study about the effects of blueberries on the health of children who do
      not eat much fruits and vegetables. By doing this study, we hope to find out what nutrients
      from blueberries appear in the blood and urine of the child

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double blinded randomized control trial aiming to characterize the profile of
      polyphenol-derived metabolites in plasma and urine for children ages 11-12 years supplemented
      short term with wild blueberry powder. The study will assess if a short-term supplementation
      (5 days) with wild blueberry powder impacts immune responses as well as markers for
      cardiovascular and bone health. Up to 44 children will be recruited. The participants will
      attend three visits at Arkansas Children's Nutrition Center.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Plasma and urine levels of blueberry derived polyphenols and their metabolites</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Blood will be collected twice following an overnight fast. Twelve-hour urine will be collected twice by participants at home. Plasma and urine samples will be analyzed using mass spectrometry to identify blueberry-derived polyphenols and their levels</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number and percentage of lymphocytes cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4), lymphocytes cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8) and natural killer (NK) cells</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Mitogen stimulated blood will be stained with combinations of fluorochrome-labeld antibodies and analyzed by flow cytometry. Absolute and relative number of CD4, lymphocytes CD8 and natural killer (NK) will be compared between groups.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>T-lymphocyte responsiveness to immune stressors</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Blood will be collected following an overnight fast after 5 days on the intervention. Whole blood will be cultured and cells stressed with E. coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce cytokine release from immune cells. Cytokines will be assayed using electrochemiluminescence based detection platform with multiplexed immunoassays, and their levels compared between study groups.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Endothelial function by brachial artery flow mediated dilation</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Endothelial-dependent flow-mediated vasodilation of the brachial artery will be measured using high resolution ultrasound at enrollment and after 5 days on the intervention. This technology uses sound waves (ultrasound) to visualize the diameter of the brachial artery. A baseline image of the brachial artery will be recorded at rest. A blood pressure cuff will be placed around the lower arm and the cuff will be inflated to 50 mmHg above systolic pressure for 5 minutes, followed by rapid deflation of the cuff. The diameter of the brachial artery will be measured from ultrasound images captured throughout the 8 minute recording protocol. The percent change in the brachial artery will be compared between and within groups.</description>
