  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The modern treatment of meibomian gland dysfunction(MGD) is based on anti-inflammatory drops
      or oral antibiotics for decreasing dry eye disease (DED) associated inflammation, warm
      compresses for liquefying the thicker meibum, and lid hygiene for reducing the bacterial
      overload. But, such treatments have shown limited effectiveness to a large proportion of
      patients with MGD, due to the multifactorial background of the disease. Thus, alternative
      approaches aiming at different aspects of the DED pathophysiology are needed.

      Elimination of posterior lid-margin hyperemia with telangiectasia could be a treatment target
      for reducing the secretion of inflammatory mediators in the course of MGD. Using the
      mechanism of photocoagulation via selective thermolysis, laser light could contribute to the
      destruction of abnormal vessels at the posterior lid-margin and thus, the reduction of
      inflammation. Recently, sub-threshold (micropulse) laser photocoagulation was introduced in
      ophthalmology and offers significant clinical advantages compared to conventional continuous
      wave (CW) approach, preventing laser induced thermal damage and related treatment side
      effects.

      This study investigates the effect of sub-threshold (micropulse) laser treatment for dry eye
      disease due to meibomian gland dysfunction combined with increased eyelid margin vascularity.

    <description>The lower eyelid margin of the clinically worse eye was selected for treatment. A slit lamp based 532 nm optically pumped dual diode solid state SP-Mode (subthreshold) laser system was used. After cleaning eyelids with a cosmetic face wash, a drop of proparacaine hydrochloride 0.5% was then administered onto the conjunctival sac. No eye or cornea shield was used, since laser light was directly aimed at telangiectasias.
The treatment parameters were set with 50 μm spot size and 200 ms duration with 30% duty cycle. The power ranged from 1500 to 1700 mW with monospot micropulse model and a just visible destruction of the telangiectatic vessels served as the threshold burn.
After the procedure, the patient received corticosteroid ointment for 5 days on both eyes and was advised to continue applying her pre-treatment medication on both eyes.</description>
