      The objective of this trial is to determine the maximum feasible dose (MFD) for further
      development of BI 764524 in patients with pan retinal coagulation treated proliferative
      diabetic retinopathy (PDR) patients with diabetic macular ischemia(DMI) based on the primary
      endpoint occurrence of dose limiting events (DLE) during MFD evaluation period of 7 days
      (SRD) or 28 days after last administration (MRD) and to investigate the safety, tolerability
      and early biological response after IVT injections of BI 764524.

    <masking_description>This trial consists of a single rising dose (SRD) part followed by an multiple rising dose (MRD) part. SRD part is non-randomized, open-label, and uncontrolled with a single group assignment intervention model (=1 arm).
MRD part is single-masked, randomized and sham-controlled (ratio 2:1). Parties masked in the MRD part are participant and masked site staff (including investigator). The Intervention model in the MRD part is active group versus sham injection (=2 arms).</masking_description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Single rising dose (SRD) and multiple rising dose (MRD) part:

          -  Pan-retinal photo coagulation treated proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR)
             participants with either no or inactive retinal neovascularization per investigator
             judgement in the study eye

          -  Male or female participants of age ≥ 18 years

          -  HbA1c of ≤ 12.0%

          -  Best-corrected Visual activity (VA) in the non-study eye better than best-corrected VA
             in the study-eye, if both eyes are eligible and have identical VA the investigator may
             select the study eye.

          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) and men able to father a child must be ready
             and able to use two methods of contraception with at least one of them being a highly
             effective methods of birth control per ICH M3 (R2) that result in a low failure rate
             of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly. A list of contraception
             methods meeting these criteria is provided in the patient information and in the
             clinical trial protocol.

             --A woman is considered of childbearing potential (WOCBP), i.e. fertile, following
             menarche and until becoming postmenopausal unless permanently sterile. Permanent
             sterilisation methods include hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy and bilateral
             oophorectomy. Tubal ligation is NOT a method of permanent sterilisation. A
             postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 2 years without an alternative
             medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal
             range may be used to confirm a post-menopausal state in women not using hormonal
             contraception or hormonal replacement therapy. However in the absence of 2 years of
             menorrhea, a single FSH measurement is sufficient.

          -  Signed and dated written informed consent in accordance with ICH Harmonized Guideline
             for Good Clinical Practice (ICH GCP) and local legislation prior to admission to the
             trial

        SRD part only:

          -  Evidence of diabetic macular ischemia (DMI) per investigator´s judgement, defined as
             any degree of disruption of retinal vascularity in superficial and/or deep retinal
             plexus in OCTA

          -  Best-corrected VA ≤55 letters (20/80) or worse

        MRD part only:

          -  Presence of significant DMI: Large foveal avascular zone defined as those with ≥0.5
             square millimeter (mm2) area in superficial capillary plexus (SCP) present on optical
             coherence tomography angiography. If FAZ is &lt;0.5mm2 then enlarged peri-foveal
             intercapillary space in at least 1 quadrant will be sufficient.

          -  Best-corrected VA ≤ 70 letters 20/40 or worse

        Exclusion Criteria:

        SRD part only:

          -  Participants receiving intravitreal (IVT) injections for active diabetic macular edema
             (DME, injections: anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), steroids) and
             macular laser in the study eye in the previous 3 months prior to enrolment

          -  Participants receiving anti-VEGF IVT injections for active PDR in the study eye in the

             history of high myopia &gt; 8 diopters in the study eye. Anterior segment and vitreous
             abnormalities in the study eye that would preclude adequate observation with SD-OCT

          -  Any prior intraocular surgery in the study eye other than uneventful lens replacement

             laser in the study eye in the previous 3 months prior to enrolment

          -  Participants receiving anti-VEGF IVT injections for active PDR in the study eye in the
             previous 3 months prior to enrolment

          -  Heavily lasered macula in the study eye per investigator's judgement
