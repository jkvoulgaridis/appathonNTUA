  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous research has shown that YouTube is a poor source of high-quality medical
      information. This is likely because there is no regulation of the content on YouTube and
      relatively little of the content is posted by qualified medical professionals. It is known
      that up to 30% of patients use the internet to research the procedure they will be having and
      given the increasing popularity of YouTube we suspect many patients are using YouTube or
      similar sites as a source of information prior to elective surgery. There are likely a number
      of patient factors that contribute to patients seeking out videos as a source of
      pre-operative medical information. Patient age, which is generally inversely correlated to
      computer literacy, may have a role. Patient anxiety and pre-operative worrying may cause a
      patient to turn to the internet to search for information, and the poor overall quality of
      the content available may worsen pre-operative anxiety.

      The primary objective of this study is to determine if providing patients with a reliable,
      high-quality video about their condition and operation prior to surgery reduces pre-operative
      anxiety. Secondary aims are to determine the percentage of patients that independently seek
      out videos online as a source of medical information prior to elective hand surgery, identify
      patient attributes that are associated with this behavior, and understand if introducing high
      quality pre-surgical videos has an impact on post-operative patient outcomes and/or patient
      engagement. The investigators hypothesize that providing patients with high-quality
      pre-operative videos will reduce pre-operative anxiety. Its is also expected that patients
      who seek out videos on their own for pre-operative medical information will be younger and
      have higher anxiety levels and pain catastrophizing scores. Additionally, the investigators
      hypothesize that patients who watch high-quality pre-operative videos may have better short
      term post-operative outcomes and greater engagement in their care than their counterparts
      that did not watch videos or who sought out videos on their own.
