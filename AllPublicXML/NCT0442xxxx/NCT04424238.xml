      A multicenter, randomized controlled trial was conducted to investigate whether health
      education and life style management through WeChat group chat was more effective in
      controlling blood glucose (BG) than standard clinic prenatal care in women with GDM.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) can be well controlled by health education and life
      style management, expecting a better pregnancy outcome. But standard clinic prenatal care
      which consist of clinic visit every two weeks may not give full play to the effects of GDM
      management. Telemedicine shows its potential to fill this gap. A multicenter, randomized
      controlled trial was designed to investigate whether health education and life style
      management through WeChat group chat was more effective in controlling blood glucose (BG)
      than standard clinic prenatal care in women with GDM. Women with GDM diagnosed by oral
      glucose tolerance test between 23-30+6 gestational weeks were randomized to a WeChat group
      chat-based blood glucose management group or routine clinic prenatal care. In PUMCH,
      investigators also equip CGM for m-health group allowing a more detailed BG information. The
      primary outcome was change of glycemic qualification rate during follow up period in both
      groups. The second outcome was pregnancy outcomes. Also, a case-control study is designed to
      compare the glucose control status between rice-richen meal and wheaten-richen meal, and all
      other macronutrients and micronutrients are all calculated and same between two groups, which
      may provide more clues for type of carbohydrate recommendation for Chinese women with GDM.

    <description>pregnancy's prenatal care appointment would be changed to once every two weeks when diagnosed with GDM. Doctors generally ask GDM women record their daily diet, exercise, weight, BG and blood pressure for at least three days between two visits and give lifestyle guidance according to the records. If they fail to show diaries, doctors would ask them come back with record next week. If BG control is poor, medicine intervention would be considered.</description>
