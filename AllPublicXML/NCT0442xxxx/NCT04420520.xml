      Determining the Prevalence of Molar Incisor Hypomineralization Among a Group of Egyptian
      Children in Fayoum Governorate Schools via clinical examination.

      Participants from primary and preparatory schools in Fayoum governorate will be included in
      the study and Clinical examination will be carried out in the school laboratory or an empty
      class, in day light for both genders.

      Teeth will be cleaned gently using gauze and wet with saliva during examination. A disposable
      diagnostic set (mirror, probe) will be used for each patient where mirrors will be used for
      proper visualization especially for maxillary teeth. Blunt explorers will be used to aid in
      tactile sensation if needed, as during the differentiation between rough and smooth enamel
      edges and/or during the inspection of the caries extent if it exists. No diagnostic
      radiographs will be taken.

      The results of the study will be regularly monitored by the supervisors who will have full
      access to these results.
