  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Congenital malformations of the orofacial area are the most common congenital malformations
      in children with an incidence of 1.8 children with orofacial cleft per 1000 healthy births in
      the Czech Republic. The care of children with cleft facial defects is multidisciplinary,
      centralized and takes place from birth to adulthood. At the University Hospital Brno, the
      treatment for patients with orofacial cleft is provided by the Cleft Center (CC) of the
      University Hospital Brno. The main specialties that form the basis of CC include plastic
      surgery, pediatric anesthesiology and neonatology. Patients with facial cleft defects are
      divided into 2 main groups based on the embryological causes of clefts: 1/ patients with
      cleft lip, jaw with or without cleft palate (total cleft) and 2/ patients with isolated cleft
      soft and hard palate. Anesthesia in children with orofacial clefts is specific not only to
      the age of the patients, but mainly to the cleft itself. Anesthesiology management, and
      especially intubation of these patients, are often difficult due to the nature of the defect
      with high incidence of complications such as difficult airway, desaturation, laryngospasm or
      bradycardia. In addition, tissue damage including soft tissue of the lip, alveolar arch,
      palate and nasal septum as well as skeleton of the premaxilla and nasal septum during
      intubation is seen in approximately 90% of patients. To facilitate intubation, improve
      anesthesiology management and safety of pediatric patients with orofacial cleft,
      investigators will develop an individualized protective tray from a silicone material, that
      will be used during intubation to cover the defect of the alveolar arch and palate. A mold
      for casting of a protective tray, will be created on a 3D printer on bases of 3D scan. Use of
      the protective tray would facilitate intubation, decrease anesthesiologic complications and
      protect soft and hard tissues of the cleft palate and upper jaw during intubation.

      After approval by the Ethics Committee of the Brno University Hospital and registration at
      clinicaltrials.gov, the study will include patients meeting inclusive criteria for whom
      primary surgery for a cleft facial defect will be indicated.

      Patients will be divided into two groups based on the type of surgery. Group 1 will include
      patients with unilateral or bilateral cleft lip and alveolus (U/BCLA) or unilateral or
      bilateral cleft lip, alveolus and palate (total cleft; U/BCLAP) who underwent primary lip
      reconstruction within 0-3 months of age. Group 2 will include patients with isolated cleft
      palate (ICP) and patients with U/BCLAP who underwent primary cleft reconstruction between 6
      and 18 months of age.

      Patients in the pediatric plastic surgery clinic of the Department of Pediatric Surgery,
      Orthopedics and Traumatology will be randomized with a 1:1 allocation based on the day of
      operation to the intervention group (3D protective obturator) and the control group (standard
      procedure without the 3D obturator). Patients enrolled in the intervention group will have an
      intraoral scan of the palate, alveolar arch, and upper vestibular area before surgery. Based
      on this 3D visualization of precise anatomical conditions in the oral cavity, a form
      (negative unique impression of the upper jaw and palato-alveolar conditions) for casting of a
      protective obturator (splint), used during intubation to cover the defect of the alveolar
      arch and palate will be created on a 3D printer, in cooperation with the Faculty of
      Mechanical Engineering (Department of Mechanics of Bodies, Mechatronics and Biomechanics) of
      Brno University of Technology. For the production of the obturator, a silicone certified for
      use in the oral cavity will be used.

      The main objective of the research will be to find out how the use of a protective obturator
      (splint) will improve the protection of tissues at the cleft site and whether intubation will
      be facilitated in pediatric patients with orofacial clefts with congenital atypical
      anatomical conditions in the oral cavity.
