      Introduction:

      The pharmacodynamic properties of enoximone could be beneficial for patients with an Acute
      Exacerbation COPD (AE-COPD). This research will focus on patients suffering of a severe
      AE-COPD and the bronchodilatory and inotropic effects of lower doses of enoximone. The main
      objective of the pilot study is to investigate if there is a bronchodilatory effect of
      enoximone in patients with AE-COPD. Secondary objective is to investigate a dose
      responsiveness in a range between 0.5 and 1.5 mg/kg enoximone.

      Methods:

      The study design is a prospective interventional non-randomized clinical series study
      involving patients admitted and intubated at the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with an AE-COPD.
      Patients will receive three times a dose of 0.5 mg/kg enoximone with a one-hour-interval. The
      primary objective is a reduction in auto-positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) after
      enoximone compared to baseline. A dose-titration will test for dose dependency. Secondary
      objectives are a reduction in ventilator pressures, a reduction in pulmonary artery pressures
      and an increase in cardiac output.

      Ventilator will be set during the study period at Volume Controle, 6 ml/kg, 5 PEEP and a
      respiratory rate of 15 bpm with an I:E-ratio of 1:2.

      Salbutamol/ipratropium bromide and magnesium sulphate will be administered at baseline (t=0h)
      and measurements will be made for an hour.

      At T=1h the first dose of 0.5 mg/kg enoximone will be administered and will be repeated at
      T=2h and T=3h. Ventilator derived variables will be obtained every fifteen minutes and
      echocardiography, arterial and central venous bloodgas analyses every hour until t=6h.
