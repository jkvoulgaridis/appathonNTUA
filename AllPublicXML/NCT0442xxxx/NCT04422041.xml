      Introduction. Very early postnatal discharge is defined as a hospital stay of the
      mother-child dyad of less than 24 hours. It is usually performed in public institutions of
      low-income countries due to high birth rates; it has not been associated to a higher
      proportion of neonatal admissions, however, very early discharge might increase this risk.
      The objective of this study was to compare the rate hospital readmission in patients with
      very early vs early postnatal discharge.

      Methods A prospective, randomized clinical study was performed with healthy term infants born
      in a hospital in Mexico from July 2016 to June 2018. Sample was randomized into two groups, a
      very early discharge group (&lt;24 hours) and an early discharge group (24-48 hours). Hospital
      readmission rate was analyzed in both groups.
