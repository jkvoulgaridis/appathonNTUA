  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several lines of evidence suggest that unhealthy sleep patterns contribute to depressive
      symptoms through disruption of brain networks that regulate emotional functions. However, we
      do not yet know to what degree the emotion regulation brain network is modified by the
      restoration of sleep, or whether the degree to which a sleep intervention modifies these
      neural targets mediates reductions in other depressive symptoms including suicidality.

      The overall aim is to test the efficacy of an established sleep intervention (Cognitive
      Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I)) in reducing depressive symptoms through improving
      emotion regulation brain function in individuals with elevated depressive symptoms and
      clinically meaningful sleep disturbance.

      In this study, we will assess feasibility of recruitment and retention as well as target
      engagement. Target engagement is defined as the treatment effect on increasing mPFC-amygala
      connectivity, and/or decreasing amygdala reactivity during emotion reactivity and regulation
      paradigms. Participants will be 70 adults experiencing at least moderate sleep disturbances
      and who also have elevated anxious and/or depressive symptoms. Emotion distress and sleep
      disruption will be assessed prior to, and weekly while receiving six Cognitive Behavioral
      Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) across a period of 8 weeks. CBT-I improves sleep patterns
      through a combination of sleep restriction, stimulus control, mindfulness training, cognitive
      therapy targeting dysfunctional beliefs about sleep, and sleep hygiene education. Using fMRI
      scanning, emotion regulation network neural targets will be assayed prior to and following
      completion of CBT-I treatment.

    <measure>Change in Beck Depression Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at week 0 and week 11</time_frame>
    <description>This measure is of the Beck Depression Inventory-II total score after excluding one sleep item. The average item score for the remaining 20 items will be multiplied by 21 (the original number of items), to create a modified depression scale that maintains the original range (ranges: 0-13 minimal, 14-19 mild, 20-28 moderate, and 29-63 severe).
The BDI-II is a 21-item self-report scale with high validity and reliability that assesses the severity of depression symptoms. The depression items consist of: sadness, pessimism, past failure, loss of pleasure, guilty feelings, punishment feelings, self-dislike, self-criticalness, suicidal thoughts or wishes, crying, agitation, loss of interest, indecisiveness, worthlessness, loss of energy, irritability, changes in appetite, concentration difficulty, tiredness or fatigue, and loss of interest in sex. Items are scored from 0 to 3, and higher scores indicate greater levels of severity.</description>

    <measure>Change in PSG Sleep Efficiency</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at week 0 and week 11</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep efficiency (SE) is the percentage of total time in bed actually spent sleeping. Based on the overnight PSG sleep recording, SE will be calculated as the total time (minutes) spent asleep (sum of Stages N1, N2, N3, and REM) divided by the total time (minutes) in bed, and multiplied by 100.</description>

    <measure>Change in Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at week 0 and week 11</time_frame>
    <description>The Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale is a 12-item checklist that was designed to quantify the severity of suicidal ideation and behavior. It is composed of two parts. The first six questions ask about suicidal ideation and behavior in the past month while the last six questions ask about suicidal ideation and behavior since the last visit. The CSSRS has been proven to be reliable and valid. It has also been shown to have high sensitivity and specificity to the different suicidal behavior classifications.</description>

Items are scored from 0 to 4 (0 = no problem, 4 = very severe problem). Score ranges of insomnia are: 0-7 absent, 8-14 sub-threshold, 15-21 moderate, and 22-28 severe. The ISI has good validity and reliability.</description>

    <measure>Change in Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia (RSA)- measured by PSG</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at week 0 and week 11</time_frame>
    <description>RSA is the phenomenon of an increased heart rate during inhalation and a decreased heart rate during exhalation. Since these fluctuations are controlled mainly by vagal influences on the heart, RSA serves as a reliable metric for measuring parasympathetic activity. RSA has been proven to be a reliable measure of emotion regulation and emotional responding in numerous studies.</description>

    <description>Participants will meet with a psychologist once a week for six weeks to complete a brief CBT-I intervention. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia consists of a cognitive therapy and a behavioral therapy. The cognitive therapy is designed to identify incorrect ideas about sleep, challenge their validity, and replace them with correct information. This therapy tries to reduce worry, anxiety, and fear that one won't sleep by providing accurate information about sleep. The behavioral therapy increases sleep quality by limiting excessive time spent in bed to increase homeostatic sleep drive and sleep consolidation.</description>
