    <textblock>
      The Child Perceptions Questionnaire (CPQ) is a widely used reliable measurement that provides
      for practitioners to assess child's current emotional, social, and functional well-being. The
      aim of the present study was to develop a translated version of CPQ8-10 into Turkish language
      and evaluate its reliability, validity, and reproducibility.

    <textblock>
      The CPQ8-10 was translated into Turkish as recommended in the literature. The intraclass
      correlation coefficient (ICC) was used for the test-retest reliability. The internal
      consistency was evaluated using Cronbach's alpha Coefficient. Construct validity and
      discriminant validity were calculated, exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory
      factor analysis (CFA) were employed.

    <description>The questionnaire has two general questions about the sex and age of the child. The CPQ8-10 was originally composed of 25 items. Responses are recorded using a Likert scale ranging from 1 to 4: &quot;Never&quot;=0; &quot;Once or twice&quot;=1; &quot;Sometimes&quot;=2; &quot;Often&quot;=3; and &quot;Every day or almost every day&quot;=4. The total CPQ8-10 score is calculated by summing all items from four domains, which ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating worse oral health quality of life and lower scores indicating better oral health quality of life.</description>
