  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to determine if treatment with high-dose aflibercept
      (HD) at intervals of 12 or 16 weeks provides non-inferior best corrected visual acuity (BCVA)
      compared to aflibercept dosed every 8 weeks.

      The secondary objectives of the study are as follows:

        -  To determine the effect of HD vs. aflibercept on anatomic and other visual measures of
           response

        -  To evaluate the safety, immunogenicity, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of aflibercept
