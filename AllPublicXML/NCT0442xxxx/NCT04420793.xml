  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depressed patients talk differently when they are depressed compared to when they are well.
      But it is hard to actually measure what the differences are. The study team will record voice
      samples from patients with mood disturbances, like depression, over the course of their
      receiving an electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) series. The study team will try and measure or
      quantify exactly what has changed in their speech and voice. The study team will choose ECT
      as it is one of the most effective and rapid treatment for depression. The study team will
      use a service provided by a company, NeuroLex, who has complex computer programs (artificial
      intelligence, AI) to analyze the voice samples.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Any candidate for electroconvulsive therapy who is about to initiate their ECT course
             at Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) for a clinically indicated diagnosis

          -  Age 18 to 90 years old

          -  Able to speak and understand English

          -  Able to give consent to participate in the study

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Any medical condition that limits the ability to speak or speak clearly, for example a
             history of head and/or neck cancer, spinal cord injury affecting speech, amyotrophic
             lateral sclerosis, or those with absence of critical anatomical structures involved in
             speech.

          -  Any voice characteristics that may limit the ability to speak English clearly
             including speech impediments or heavy accents (as evidenced by the pronunciation of
             the English language in such a non-standard way that research staff). If study staff
             have significant difficulty understanding the participant's responses in conversation,
             this may warrant exclusion.

          -  Patients who are receiving ECT by involuntary order, by order of their guardian, or by
             a court order, as evidenced by patient report or brief chart review.

          -  Patients who elect to not receive their full course of ECT at MUSC.
