  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed minimal diagnostic criteria for myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and potential
      pre-MDS conditions has been released by an international consensus group. Based on the
      criteria, patients with persistent cytopenia could be diagnosed with MDS, CCUS and ICUS.
      However, the process and outcome of pre-MDS conditions (CCUS, ICUS) is still to be
      characterized in Chinese population. We design this prospective observational study to
      explore the disease process and outcome in ICUS and CCUS patients.

    <description>Transformation is defined as progression from ICUS to CCUS, ICUS to MDS or CCUS to MDS. All patients are followed-up since entry into this trial and transformation events are recorded. Cumulative transformation rate is defined for all patients and estimated by competing risk methods.</description>

    <description>Defined for all patients entry into this trial; measured from the date of entry into this trial to the date of progression or death from any cause; patients not known to have any of these events are censored on the date they were last examined.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with cytopenia of any degree in one or more lineages: erythrocytes,
             neutrophils, or platelets. And the cytopenia has to be persistent (â‰¥ 4 months) and
             lacking minimal diagnostic criteria of MDS.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with cytopenia which could be explained by any other hematologic or
             non-hematologic disease.
