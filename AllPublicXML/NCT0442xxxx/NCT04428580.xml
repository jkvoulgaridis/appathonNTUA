  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a critical need to disseminate efficacious psychosocial treatments for mental
      disorders as there is a significant gap between evidenced-based approaches and common
      clinical practice. One example of the need to improve dissemination and implementation of
      psychosocial treatments is for adolescent Anorexia Nervosa (AN), a serious mental disorder
      with an incidence rate of about 1% that can become life-threatening. Based on outcomes from a
      series of randomized clinical trials (RCTs), the first-line treatment for adolescent AN is
      Family-based Treatment (FBT); however, very few therapists are trained to use FBT for AN.
      Further, while approximately 45-50% of US mental health outpatient providers are in private
      practice, little attention has been paid to how best to train this group. Care for adolescent
      AN, in particular, is provided in private practice at high rates, because specialist programs
      in non-private settings are few and not readily accessible. Motivations, incentives, and
      rationale for learning evidence-based treatments (EBTs) differ in this group compared to
      therapists embedded in an organization or health care system. In this application, we propose
      to use an online training strategy to study the adoption of FBT to better understand factors
      that limit or enhance uptake and implementation of this treatment in private practice. We
      developed and piloted a self-directed enhanced online training (ET-FBT) aimed at improving
      therapist skills and knowledge related to key components of FBT for AN that predict patient
      outcome in a group of therapists of which 64% were in private practice. We propose to build
      on these findings to examine the feasibility of new methods to retain therapists during
      supervision, assess fidelity, and collect patient outcomes from clinicians in private
      practice. Thus, our specific aims are:

      Aim 1: The overall aim of the study is to assess the feasibility of conducting a randomized
      clinical trial comparing two implementation strategies (online training vs webinar training)
      for training clinicians in private practice in FBT for AN. We predict that those randomized
      to online training will be retained, receive supervision, and provide patient data at higher
      rates than those who receive webinar training.

      Aim 2: Patient outcomes (reflecting therapist effectiveness) will be assessed by comparing
      patient weight gain from session 1 to 4 of FBT before and after training (target for training
      effect) and compared between randomized groups. We predict a moderate efficacy signal
      difference favoring those who are received the online training. because of increased training
      in key components in the online training program.

      Aim 3: Validate training effect by examining the association between therapist fidelity to
      FBT and patient outcomes. We predict that fidelity will be correlated (target validation)
      with patient outcome. The effects of therapeutic alliance, participation in supervision, and
      self-efficacy on both fidelity and patient outcome will be explored.

      Aim 4: Explore BL factors associated with implementation processes (e.g. prior training,
      experience, family work).The primary significance of this study is its potential to increase
      the availability of FBT--the most effective treatment for adolescent AN. Increased
      availability of FBT will decrease cost, hospitalization, morbidity, mortality, and chronicity
      of the disorder.

    <description>10 lectures that are self-paced with a maximum of three months to complete with each lecture bundle comprising of 5-8 short (about 4 minutes in length), didactic videos that discuss the treatment model and provide mock therapy session video clips (modeling FBT with a typical adolescent AN case), as well as supplementary readings and videotaped role-plays. Enrollees complete each lecture bundle and complete the assignments as they move through the training at their own pace, but to have completed all within the 3-month time frame. When the training is completed, therapists will proceed to schedule post-online supervision for a minimum of 1 case and a maximum of 2 cases over the course of 3 months.</description>

    <description>1-hour weekly webinar lectures that essentially is the FBT training that is conducted in person, just recorded. There will be lectures discussing the scientific evidence supporting FBT, how therapists set up treatment for FBT, main interventions used in FBT during each phase, and recorded role-plays illustrating interventions throughout the 3 phases. Enrollees watch each webinar video as it is released weekly over a 12 week (3 month period). When the training is completed, therapists will proceed to schedule post-online supervision for a minimum of 1 case and a maximum of 2 cases over the course of 3 months.</description>
