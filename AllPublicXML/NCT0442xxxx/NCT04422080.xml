  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Keratoconus is a progressive bilateral disease leading to an apical stromal thinning and an
      irregular astigmatism by a steepening of the cornea, causing visual impairment. The causes
      are not yet well known, but it seems to be linked to several comorbidities. Keratoconus is a
      rare and for a long-time asymptomatic condition and its diagnosis needs meticulous screening
      for the early stages. Detecting it as soon as possible is a goal as it could lead to earlier
      avoiding of contributing factors such as eye rubbing and earlier treatment if needed.

      The gold standard for keratoconus screening and staging is computerized videotography. It
      gives information about anterior and posterior corneal bulging, steepening, and thinning. It
      can be completed by anterior segment optical coherence tomography, which can show corneal
      scarring. Since recently, some biometry devices can give some information about the posterior
      corneal keratometry trough swept source optical coherence tomography measures. The
      measurement of the total corneal power instead of an extrapolation lead to better precision
      in refractive results after cataract surgery in some cases. It also helped to increase our
      knowledge about posterior corneal astigmatism. In normal eyes, average posterior corneal
      astigmatism is 0.37 diopters and against the rule in 91 percent of eyes. There is a
      correlation between the magnitude of anterior and posterior astigmatism.

      In keratoconus eyes, several studies have shown that there is an alignment between axes of
      the anterior and posterior corneal astigmatism. These studies have been performed on
      computerized videotopography devices.

      The goal of this study was to confirm or deny previous observations about posterior
      astigmatism in keratoconus eyes, and to assess if the rotation of axis between anterior and
      posterior astigmatism measured by IOL Master 700Â® can be a good sign for detection of early
      stages and fruste keratoconus.
