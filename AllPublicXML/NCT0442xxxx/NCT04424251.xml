  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-stage phase II
      clinical study. The main objective is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of HSK21542
      injection and explore the recommended dose and administration frequency for subsequent Phase
      II studies in conjunction with the pharmacodynamic (PD) and pharmacokinetic (PK)
      characteristics.
