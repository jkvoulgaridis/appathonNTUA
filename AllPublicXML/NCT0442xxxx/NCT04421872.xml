  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a common postoperative complication in patients
      aged 65 and over, which refers to cognitive function changes such as memory decline and
      attention deficit after anesthesia and surgery. In severe cases, personality changes and
      social behavior decline may also occur, resulting in irreversible cognitive
      impairment.Previous studies have suggested that cognitive dysfunction after general
      anesthesia is linked to a genetic disorder of the body clock.Exosomes are cellular forms of
      cellular microvesicles containing complex RNA and proteins.Exosomes can mediate the
      expression of genes in the late transcriptional period of the clock system, and directly or
      indirectly participate in the negative regulation of rhythm expression of minute control
      genes, playing an important role in the intercellular circadian rhythm information output
      pathway.Rhythm disorders in the core biological clock system of urinary exosomes and the
      clock control genes related to kidney can early indicate circadian rhythm changes in the core
      biological clock system.The sorting and detection of urinary exosome clock information
      materials in patients has the advantages of easy access, continuous monitoring, early
      diagnosis and less damage, making urinary exosome a biomarker for the diagnosis and
      monitoring of circadian rhythm of a good kidney biological clock system.
