      This study is a Phase 1, 2-Part, Randomized, Double-Blind, Parallel-Group, Single-Dose Study
      to Compare the Pharmacokinetics, Safety and Immunogenicity of Three Subcutaneous Injection
      Formulations of Ustekinumab (CT-P43, EU approved Stelara, and US licensed Stelara) in Healthy
      Male Subjects.

      CT-P43 is being developed as a proposed biosimilar of Stelara (ustekinumab). This study will
      be conducted in 2 parts. In Part 1, subjects will be enrolled and randomized in a 1:1 ratio
      to receive a single dose (45 mg) of either CT-P43 or EU-approved Stelara to collect
      preliminary safety data for CT-P43. In Part 2, subjects will be enrolled and randomized in a
      1:1:1 ratio to receive a single dose (45 mg) of CT-P43, EU-approved Stelara, or US-licensed
      Stelara to demonstrate PK similarity. Each part will proceed independently, and subjects will
      be randomized to either Part 1 or Part 2 of the study subsequently. All subjects in Part 1
      and Part 2 will undergo the same assessments. In each treatment arm in Part 1 and Part 2, all
      subjects will receive a study drug subcutaneously via PFS. The randomization to treatment
      assignment will be stratified by study center and body weight as measured at baseline to
      balance subject weight across treatment groups. Subjects will be confined to the study center
      until all required 24-hour post-dose assessments have been completed and will be discharged
      on Day 2. Subsequent visits will be carried out on an out-patient basis up to EOS.
