  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this observational registry is to evaluate the safety and performance of the
      easyEndoTM Universal Linear Cutting Stapler and reloads from Ezisurg Medical when used to
      create anastomoses during laparoscopic bariatric surgery. The goal of the study will be
      achieved by assessing the device performance and by reporting of peri- and postoperative
      complications in a prospectively maintained database.
