  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aimed to clarify the characteristics of the intestinal and oral microbiome of
      Gestational Diabetes Mellitus(GDM) patients during the whole pregnancy, try to clarify the
      relationship between the microbiome and GDM.

  <detailed_description>

      The aims of the study are to reveal the possibly natural change of the gut and oral
      microbiome of GDM patients during pregnancy, and to explorer whether GDM happened during
      pregnancy are associated with the maternal gut and oral microbiomes. As a perspective cohort
      study, the researchers will recruit pregnant women in early pregnancy（before 13 gestational
      weeks）and following the pregnancies till delivery. The stool samples and saliva samples of
      the recruits will be collected in 9~14,24~28 and 32~37 gestational weeks separately. The
      investigators will also perform oral examination between 24~28 weeks and sample subgingival
      plaque for test. Overall, all samples will be examined use 16S rRNA gene sequencing to
      analyze microbiome. And part of the samples of GDM patients will be analyzed using
      metagenomics. Combine with the pregnancy outcomes, the differences of gut and oral microbiome
      between GDM patients and healthy women will be expected, as well as the natural change during
      pregnancy.

      stool samples were collected from objects in 3 time points：the first trimester(9-14
      gestational weeks), the second trimester(24-28 gestational weeks) and the third
      trimester(32-37 gestational weeks). All the samples were collected at home by the
      participants using a PSP Spin Stool DNA kit, and the genomic DNA was extracted. The
      researchers only amplified the hypervariable V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA genes.
