  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized, double-blind, placebo trial was adopted, and cardiopulmonary exercise load test
      (CPET) was used to detect peak oxygen uptake (PeakVO2) and exercise metabolic equivalent
      (METs) to confirm the clinical effect of Zhenyuan capsule on improving cardiopulmonary
      endurance in patients with coronary heart disease of qi deficiency and blood stasis.
