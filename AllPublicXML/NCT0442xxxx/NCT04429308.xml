  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to to compare photodynamic therapy (PDT) versus the combination
      of Jessner's solution and 35% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) chemical peels for the treatment of
      actinic keratoses on upper extremities.

      This is a randomized clinical trial. Approximately 60 participants with actinic keratoses on
      both upper arms will be randomized to have one arm receive photodynamic therapy, while the
      contralateral arm receives Jessner's solution followed immediately by 35% TCA. AKs will be
      counted before treatment and 2-8 weeks after treatment. This study is a pilot study designed
      to determine the feasibility of this procedure.

      Subjects currently living in the Chicago metropolitan area and meet inclusion/exclusion
      criteria will be considered for enrollment.
