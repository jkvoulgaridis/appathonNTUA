  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In obstetrics, postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) continues to be a major contributor to maternal
      morbidity and mortality worldwide. Uterine atony is the most common cause of PPH, and the
      prophylactic use of uterotonics, specifically oxytocin, is the standard of care for PPH
      prophylaxis. It is believed that tranexamic acid (TXA) can enhance the hemostatic process
      further by inhibiting the fibrinolytic system.

      TXA is an antifibrinolytic that has been studied in many different patient population for its
      use in reducing blood loss ranging from gynaecological and non gynaecological surgeries, to
      trauma patients. It has been found to reduce mortality in treatment of patients with PPH, and
      recent evidence have found promising results in its use for prophylaxis of PPH.
