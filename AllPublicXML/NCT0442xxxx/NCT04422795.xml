  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of a thermomechanical device
      delivering vibration and cold stimuli in lowering pain during intramatricial nail injections

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The level of pain and change in pain between each time point will be assessed using the Wong-Baker FACES scale with use of thermomechanical device delivering stimuli, without delivering stimuli, and without use of the thermomechanical device.</measure>
    <time_frame>prior to treatment, immediately after the needle insertion and 5 minutes after injection</time_frame>
    <description>Pain will be self-reported, using the Wong-Baker FACES (0-10, with 0 representing abscence of pain and 10 unbearable pain). Participants will be questioned about their level of pain in each nail prior to treatment, immediately after the needle insertion and 5 minutes after injection</description>

    <measure>Number of participants with at least one adverse event</measure>
    <time_frame>Patients will be followed for 3 days following their nail injection</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events will only include those that are determined to be related to the study device</description>
