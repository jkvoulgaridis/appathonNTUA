      This trial is an open-label, multicenter, Phase 0 trial that will enroll up to 20
      participants with recurrent high-grade glioma with FGFR1 K656E or FGFR3 K650E mutation or
      FGFR3-TACC3 translocation which are scheduled for resection. In the lead-in cohort, a total
      of 20 participants will be enrolled into the proposed phase 0 clinical trial. Participants
      will be administered infigratinib prior to surgical resection of their tumor.
