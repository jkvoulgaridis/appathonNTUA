      This is a prospective observational pilot study designed to evaluate feasibility and
      acceptability as well as preliminary efficacy of a behavioral activation intervention among
      orthopaedic trauma patients after discharge home following their injury. Behavioral
      activation is a behavioral treatment that focuses on helping participants engage in more
      rewarding and enjoyable activities. In the first session, participants will begin to identify
      domains of their life which are important to them. In the second session, participants will
      be assisted in creating an action plan to engage in more activities in one or more domains of
      importance. In session 3-8, participants will be assisted in problem solving any challenges
      they encountered in implementing their previous action plan and will develop a new action
      plan. The intervention will continue until participants achieved three action plans or reach
      the eight-session limit, whichever comes first.
