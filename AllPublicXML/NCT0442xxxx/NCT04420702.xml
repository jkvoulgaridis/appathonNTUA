  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diffusion Basis Spectrum Imaging (DBSI) represents a potential leap forward in improving
      prostate cancer early detection: a non-invasive and accurate imaging test for clinically
      significant prostate cancer.

In the per patient analysis, Gleason 7 or greater, will be the cut-off as this will be considered &quot;clinically significant&quot;. The investigators will also perform similar analyses with cut-offs of Gleason 4+3=7 or greater, as well as Gleason 6 or greater. This will serve as the sensitivity analysis.</description>
