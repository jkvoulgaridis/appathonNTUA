  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to better understand what types of transitions people with
      pancreatic cancer face when they receive chemotherapy. Again, this study defines transition
      as a change in a life situation or a status that causes a change in a person's identity,
      role, behavior, or personal relationships. Examples of transitions include changes in
      sleeping habits, anxiety, employment, relationship with a higher power, and treatment goals.

    <description>These surveys will take 5-10 minutes to complete at two time-points, T0 (baseline) and T1 (four to six weeks after baseline visit) The patient will again complete the DT and MOT-CA at a chemotherapy treatment or clinic visit, if possible, or via a telephone call with the principal investigator in the event that there are no in-person visits scheduled (Time 1).</description>
