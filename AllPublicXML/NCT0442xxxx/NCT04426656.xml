  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to use a mini-application on the popular Chinese social media mobile
      platform, WeChat, to improve HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) uptake among at-risk men who
      have sex with men (MSM). UNC investigators will work in close partnership with a
      well-established HIV special hospital and the local MSM community to understand key barriers
      to PrEP use, and develop a mobile-based intervention to increase PrEP uptake among young MSM
      in Guangzhou, China.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study includes two parts. Before the start of Part 1, a mini-app prototype for promoting
      HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) uptake will have been developed from a prior MSM
      community-driven hackathon contest. PrEP is an antiretroviral medicines-based prevention
      strategy against HIV infection, which has been proved save and effective.

      Part 1 includes in-depth interviews with 40 HIV-negative young MSM (18 and above) with a
      brief survey to collect demographic data. The interview topics include PrEP-related
      perceptions and feedback on the design of a mini-app prototype. Findings from Part 1 will
      inform refining the mini-app before the start of Part 2.

      In Part 2, a small two-arm randomized control trial with 70 young MSM (18 and above) will be
      conducted to evaluate the preliminary efficacy of the mini-app in improving PrEP-related
      perceptions and actual PrEP uptake, compared to a control group of standard of care.

      Participants in Part 2 will be followed up for 12 weeks (8 week intervention and
      after-intervention follow-up at 12th week). A subgroup of participants (n=15) from both the
      intervention arm and the control arm will receive two rounds of in-depth interviews,
      separately at the 4th and 8th week, to share their experience of using the app and changed
      perceptions and/or behaviors related to PrEP.
