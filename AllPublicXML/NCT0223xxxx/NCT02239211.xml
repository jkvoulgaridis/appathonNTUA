  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II study to determine the safety and preliminary efficacy of a human
      monoclonal antibody (BTT1023) which targets the vascular adhesion protein (VAP-1) and its use
      in the treatment of patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary sclerosing cholangitis is a progressive immune mediated biliary disease characterised
      by bile duct inflammation and fibrosis, and accompanying hepatic fibrosis. For patients with
      elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in particular, progressive disease is predicted, that
      currently results in a need for liver transplantation in the majority. No current medical
      therapy has as yet been shown to be effective in altering the natural history of disease. For
      this reason patients with PSC with elevated ALP values will be recruited to this study, to
      evaluate the impact of Vap-1 blockade by BTT1023, in an early phase study focused on
      biochemical efficacy and safety.

      This is an early phase study of BTT1023 in immune mediated liver disease, with the rationale
      to identify biochemical efficacy of effect (reduction in ALP) and safety, in an orphan
      disease indication for PSC that presently lacks any other medical therapy. The study design
      therefore focuses on identifying early biochemical efficacy signals to justify larger scale,
      randomised controlled studies over longer duration.

             duration with either a consistent MRI showing sclerosing cholangitis or a liver biopsy

             disease, without findings of high grade dysplasia

          4. In those on treatment with UDCA, therapy must be stable for at least 3 months, and at
             a dose not greater than 20 mg/kg/day. In those not on treatment with UDCA at the time
             of screening, a minimum of 8 weeks since the last dose of UDCA should be recorded

          5. Serum ALP greater than 1.5 x ULN

          6. Stable serum ALP levels (levels must not change by more than 25% from Screening Visit
             1 and Screening Visit 2)

          7. Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test prior to
             starting trial treatment. For the purposes of this trial, a female subject of
             childbearing potential is a woman who has not had a hysterectomy, bilateral
             oophorectomy, or medically-documented ovarian failure. Women ≤ 50 years of age with
             amenorrhea of any duration will be considered to be of childbearing potential

          8. All sexually active women of childbearing potential must agree to use two forms of
             highly effective method of contraception from the Screening Visit throughout the trial
             period and for 99 days following the last dose of trial drug. If using hormonal agents
             the same method must have been used for at least 1 month before trial dosing and
             subjects must use a barrier method as the other form of contraception. Lactating women
             must agree to discontinue breast feeding before trial investigational medicinal
             product administration

          9. Men, if not vasectomised, must agree to use barrier contraception (condom plus
             spermicide) during heterosexual intercourse from screening through to trial completion
             and for 99 days from the last dose of trial investigational medicinal product

         10. Patients must weigh ≥ 40 kg

             including viral hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis,
             primary biliary cirrhosis. Patients with possible overlap syndrome with autoimmune
             hepatitis are excluded if the Investigator considers autoimmune hepatitis as the
             predominant liver injury

          3. AST and ALT &gt;10 x ULN or bilirubin &gt;3 x ULN or INR &gt;1.3 in the absence of

          9. Flare in colitis activity within last 90 days requiring intensification of therapy
             beyond baseline maintenance treatment; use of oral prednisolone &gt;10 mg/day, biologics
             (i.e. monoclonal antibodies) and or hospitalisation for colitis within 90 days. Prior
             use of biologics is not a contraindication to screening

         10. Diagnosed cholangiocarcinoma or high clinical suspicion of cholangiocarcinoma either
             clinically or by imaging

         11. Concurrent malignancies or invasive cancers diagnosed within past 3 years except for
             adequately treated basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and in situ
             carcinoma of the uterine cervix

         12. Presence of a percutaneous drain or bile duct stent

         13. Major surgical procedure within 30 days of screening

         14. Prior organ transplantation

         15. Known hypersensitivity to the investigational product or any of its formulation
             excipients

         16. Unavailable for follow-up assessment or concern for subject's compliance

         17. Participation in an investigational trial of a drug or device within 60 days of
             screening or 5 half lives of the last dose of investigational drug, where the trial
             drug half-life is greater than 12 days

         18. Any other condition that in the opinion of the Investigator renders the subject a poor
             risk for inclusion into the trial

         19. Positive screening test for tuberculosis (TB) (including T-SPOT.TB TB test), unless
             respiratory review confirms false positive test results

         20. Receipt of live vaccination within 6 weeks prior to Screening Visit 2

         21. Known HIV positive status
