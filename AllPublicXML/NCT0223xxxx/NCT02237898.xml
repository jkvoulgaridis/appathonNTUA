    <textblock>
      Through a smartphone platform, financial incentives for smoking abstinence in postpartum
      women can be delivered remotely, thus minimizing the need for participants to come to the
      office to receive traditional contingency management.

      The specific aims of the proposal are:

        1. To develop through a 15-month pilot study, a novel smartphone-based system, Momba
           Smoking, that can be used in further relapse prevention trials for postpartum smokers.

        2. To determine, through a pilot randomized controlled trial, the potential feasibility,
           acceptability, and methodological parameters that are necessary to design a subsequent,
           appropriately powered, randomized controlled trial of the Momba Smoking smartphone-based
           system.

        3. To advance discovery and understanding on the use of technology to translate smoking
           cessation interventions from clinical to community settings through the training of the
           next generation of scientists.

    <description>Primary Outcome - Acceptability of the delivery of financial incentives for smoking abstinence in postpartum women through a smartphone platform as compared to traditional, in office contingency management. Acceptability of the smartphone application to low-income, pregnant women defined by the percentage of women who would recommend the site to a friend.

            <description>MoMba Contingency Management arm accesses the web-based MoMba Live Long application &amp; Sensodrone™ to research the acceptability and functionality of the app and provides remote contingency management for smoking cessation.
The Sensordrone™ carbon-monoxide (CO) sensor is a custom breath CO meter built by Sensorcon Inc. (Sensordrone, part No. SDRONEG1) that uses an electrochemical CO gas sensor to measure environmental CO. The Sensordrone is accurate within 10% with a resolution of 1 parts per million (ppm).
The MoMba Live Long app provides an interface for the Sensordrone allowing participants to complete a breath test. The app allows for verification of completion of the test through pictures and audio recording. The app also provided a platform for social support during the quitting process.
Most breath tests will be completed remotely.</description>

The Sensordrone™ carbon-monoxide (CO) sensor is a custom breath CO meter built by Sensorcon Inc. (Sensordrone, part No. SDRONEG1) that uses an electrochemical CO gas sensor to measure environmental CO. The Sensordrone is accurate within 10% with a resolution of 1 parts per million (ppm).
The MoMba Live Long app provides an interface for the Sensordrone allowing participants to complete a breath test. The app allows for verification of completion of the test through pictures and audio recording. The app also provided a platform for social support during the quitting process.
Most breath tests will be completed remotely.</description>

            <description>MoMba Contingency Management arm accesses the web-based MoMba Live Long application &amp; Sensodrone™ to research the acceptability and functionality of the app and provides remote contingency management for smoking cessation.
The Sensordrone™ carbon-monoxide (CO) sensor is a custom breath CO meter built by Sensorcon Inc. (Sensordrone, part No. SDRONEG1) that uses an electrochemical CO gas sensor to measure environmental CO. The Sensordrone is accurate within 10% with a resolution of 1 parts per million (ppm).
The MoMba Live Long app provides an interface for the Sensordrone allowing participants to complete a breath test. The app allows for verification of completion of the test through pictures and audio recording. The app also provided a platform for social support during the quitting process.
Most breath tests will be completed remotely.</description>
