  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The cause of Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy (CIPN) is still unknown. An estimated
      55-60% of patients will experience lasting symptoms affecting function for years
      post-treatment. Physical therapy is an established, effective treatment for entrapped nerves
      and neuropathic pain. This study sought to identify additional risk factors and provide
      evidence for the role of physical therapy in the treatment of CIPN.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A common side effect is chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). CIPN is a small
      fibre sensory neuropathy that develops in the hands/feet and worsens with increasing dose and
      duration of treatment. It impacts the Aβ, Aδ, and C-Fiber function involved in light touch
      and vibration sense, thermal detection and thermal pain. This results in a variety of
      positive and/or negative sensory symptoms including hypoesthesia, dysesthesias, hyperalgesia,
      allodynia and neuropathic pain. Quantitative sensory testing (QST) are a variety of
      non-invasive tests aimed at quantifying sensory perceptions used in research to clinically
      assess neuropathy. It is used for sensory detection and pain thresholds for both mechanical
      and thermal stimuli. QST provides information on large myelinated (Aβ), small thinly
      myelinated (Aδ) and unmyelinated (C-fiber) function or dysfunction. Deep pressure threshold
      measured by a pressure algometry stimulates intramuscular afferents, and can be used as a
      measure of central sensitization when used at a distant site from the site of pain. Aδ fibres
      transmit cool detection threshold, while warm detection threshold is transmitted by C-fibers.
      Both noxious heat and noxious cold transmit via C-fiber and Aδ fibers. An increased
      sensitivity to thermal pain thresholds, results in thermal hyperalgesia.

      Physical therapy treatment for nerve disorders is well established in orthopedics and plastic
      surgery for entrapment neuropathies, neuropathic pain, post-operative nerve repair and
      regeneration. Nerve gliding exercises are frequently used exercises in physical therapy to
      improve neural excursion across joints, improve pain and decrease inflammation. Patient
      reported symptoms (patient questionnaires NPRS, S-LANSS and DASH) and quantitative sensory
      testing (QST) specifically pain pressure thresholds and vibration were used for the primary
      purpose in evaluating the role for an upper extremity nerve mobilization physical therapy
      home program during chemotherapy for the prevention and management of CIPN.

      Primary Outcome Measures was the NPRS and reported as those having no vs no pain. Grip
      strength, Vibration, DASH and S-LANSS were identified outcome measures prior to the trial
      that would best describe sensory impairment and function for the physical therapy question

      Additional QST measures collected included warm/cool, Hot/Cold Pain thresholds that were used
      with the vibration data to compare quantitative data on the right and left side to evaluate
      possible a possible dual nerve disorder when combined with surgery as well as identifying
      different sensory profiles of QST data between those reporting neuropathic pain and
      non-neuropathic pain using the S-LANSS

      A sub analysis of data was completed dividing participants that remained active throughout
      compared to less active participants to evaluate the effect of exercise on sensory
      preservation. This was not an intended analysis at the beginning of the trial and these
      participants were not randomized.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With 'Pain' or 'no Pain' as Measured by the Numeric Pain Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Regression models of pain reported over time (mid-docetaxel chemotherapy- 6 months post-chemotherapy). Mid-chemotherapy time frame participants were re-assessed after the 2 round of TC and 4th round of FECD.</time_frame>
    <description>Numeric Pain Rating Scale - pain rating scale 0-10 (0= no pain to 10= most pain imaginable). Reported as percentages of participants with pain (1-10) vs no pain (0)</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH)</measure>
    <time_frame>administered on each re-assessment (pre-chemotherapy, mid-way through docetaxel chemotherapy, end of chemotherapy, 6 months post-chemotherapy) and mixed models accounted for all time points</time_frame>
    <description>A 30 item participant reported questionnaire commonly used to gauge upper limb function. Each item is scored 1-5 with 1 being 'no difficulty' and 5 being 'unable'. Overall score calculated as: [average response (sum of responses divided by number of responses) -1] x 25 to give a score out of 100. Minimum score is 30 with a maximum score of 150. The DASH was chosen because of high test-retest reliability and the responsiveness and construct validity in patients with breast cancer over other quality of life measures. A minimal clinical important difference is a change score of 15. Higher score indicates more impairment to the upper limb</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Neuropathic Pain Defined by the Self Report Version of Leeds Assessment for Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs (S-LANSS).</measure>
    <time_frame>administered on each re-assessment (Visit 1 - pre-chemotherapy, Visit 2 - half-way through chemotherapy, Visit 3 - end of chemotherapy, Visit 4 - 3 months post-chemotherapy) and mixed models accounted for all time points</time_frame>
    <description>a 7 item patient reported questionnaire and was used to confirm the presence of neuropathic pain. The score ranges from 0-19 (no symptoms=0, sever symptoms=19) with a score above 12 indicative of neuropathic pain/symptoms. S-LANSS was chosen because of its' specificity and accuracy in a cancer population. Participants were requested to answer specifically for the hands, not feet.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Vibration Sensory Analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>administered on each re-assessment (Visit 1 - pre-chemotherapy, Visit 2 - half-way through chemotherapy, Visit 3 - end of chemotherapy, Visit 4 - 6 months post-chemotherapy) and mixed models accounted for all time points</time_frame>
    <description>Vibration analysis testing for perception thresholds are specific to Aβ nerve fibres. The TSAII Vibration Sensory Analyzer (VSA): Medoc, Israel, was used. The pulp of the index finger lightly touches the sensor that delivers random and varying vibration amplitudes (µm). The participant responds &quot;yes/no&quot; to sensing the vibration. Vibration perception was selected for its sensitivity and has been suggested to be the first clinical sign of CIPN symptoms and was tested bilaterally. Low score indicates better perception while a higher score is poorer sensation. Perception score reported in micrometers (up to 4cm)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Pressure Thresholds</measure>
    <time_frame>administered on each re-assessment (Visit 1 - pre-chemotherapy, Visit 2 - half-way through chemotherapy, Visit 3 - end of chemotherapy, Visit 4 - 6 months post-chemotherapy) and mixed models accounted for all time points</time_frame>
    <description>Pressure Algometry (Somedic AB, Sweden) measured pressure/pain thresholds. A hand-held device applied perpendicular to the muscles being tested. Increasing pressure is applied until the participant determines that the sensation has changed from a feeling of pressure to a feeling of pain and force (Kpa) is recorded. When tested at a distant site from the source of pain this test measures central sensitization. Lower pressure values (more sensitive to noxious stimuli) suggest impaired central pain and/or diminished descending inhibition pathway. The left quadriceps muscle was tested as a measure of central sensitization.</description>

    <measure>Grip Strength</measure>
    <time_frame>administered on each re-assessment (Visit 1 - pre-chemotherapy, Visit 2 - half-way through chemotherapy, Visit 3 - end of chemotherapy, Visit 4 - 6 months post-chemotherapy) and mixed models accounted for all time points</time_frame>
    <description>Hand Dynamometry records grip strength in kgs and was used as a measure of function (3 trials). The dominant hand was tested using the Jamar dynamometer (Patterson medical, USA) in the 2nd handle position. All 48 participants were right handed.</description>

        <description>A 30 item participant reported questionnaire commonly used to gauge upper limb function. Each item is scored 1-5 with 1 being 'no difficulty' and 5 being 'unable'. Overall score calculated as: [average response (sum of responses divided by number of responses) -1] x 25 to give a score out of 100. Minimum score is 30 with a maximum score of 150. The DASH was chosen because of high test-retest reliability and the responsiveness and construct validity in patients with breast cancer over other quality of life measures. A minimal clinical important difference is a change score of 15. Higher score indicates more impairment to the upper limb</description>

The pulp of the index finger lightly touches the sensor that delivers random and varying vibration amplitudes (µm). The participant responds &quot;yes/no&quot; to sensing the vibration. Vibration perception was selected for its sensitivity and has been suggested to be the first clinical sign of CIPN symptoms and was tested bilaterally.

        <description>Pressure Algometry (Somedic AB, Sweden) measured pressure/pain thresholds. A hand-held device applied perpendicular to the muscles being tested. Increasing pressure is applied until the participant determines that the sensation has changed from a feeling of pressure to a feeling of pain and force (Kpa) is recorded. When tested at a distant site from the source of pain this test measures central sensitization. Lower pressure values (more sensitive to noxious stimuli) suggest impaired central pain and/or diminished descending inhibition pathway. The left quadriceps muscle was tested as a measure of central sensitization.</description>

        <description>Measuring Activity Participants were asked about their level of exercise per week at each assessment visit. Participants were considered active if they reported engaging in any form of moderate activity at least 4 times a week (consistent with recommended physical activity guidelines beyond activities of daily living such as walking to the bus or walking the dog around the block) at least 4 times per week on at least 3 out of 4 reassessment visits. Types of reported activities included cycling, running, yoga, swimming, Zumba, dance classes, and tennis. Walking was included if it was at least 30 minutes at a moderate pace. This sub-analysis re-defined the groups as 'active' and 'less active' for the comparison of vibration QST data. This was done to observe the possible impact of exercise on sensory preservation</description>

    <reported_events>
      <time_frame>Each participant was followed from one week prior to initiation of chemotherapy to 6 months post-chemotherapy. Because of delays, alterations of schedules, patients were followed on average between 8-12 months. Re-assessment data was collected 2 weeks after mid and post chemotherapy visits and the 3 and 6 month visits where scheduled from their last chemotherapy. This is slightly different for each participant due to delays, hospital admissions, etc....</time_frame>
