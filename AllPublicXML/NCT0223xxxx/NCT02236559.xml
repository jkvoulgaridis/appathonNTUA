  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this study is to determine if Vapotherm high flow nasal cannula
      therapy (HFT), when used to treat respiratory failure in the ED, is at least equivalent to
      the current standard of care for non-invasive ventilatory support, non-invasive positive
      pressure mask ventilation (NIPPV). Moreover, this study will investigate the potential that
      HFT has possible advantages over NIPPV, such as decreased time to patient stability from
      respiratory failure, and the ease of use as a first line intervention for respiratory failure
      in the ED environment.

      The hypothesis is that HFT via the Vapotherm Precision Flow will demonstrate clinical
      non-inferiority when compared to NIPPV with regard to treatment failure by way of an impact
      on ventilation indices and a lower intolerance rate, and have a positive association with
      hospital disposition and length of stay.

    <description>Patients will be fit with an oronasal mask using a fitting gauge that will be applied by a respiratory therapist or other clinician skilled in management of NIPPV. Initial pressures will be at low end of suggested range but can be increased as rapidly as necessary to alleviate respiratory distress. Targets should be to lower respiratory rate to the low 20s and achieve tidal volumes of 6-8 ml/kg ideal body weight. If patients find pressures uncomfortably high, they can be lowered as necessary by 1 to 2 cmH2O decrements to enhance tolerance. EPAP (PEEP) can also be adjusted upward as needed to reduce triggering effort (by counterbalancing auto-PEEP) or to improve oxygenation.
FIO2 will be 1.0 initially to assure adequate oxygenation, but should be adjusted promptly to maintain an FIO2 of no greater than 0.6 with an EPAP (PEEP) of not more than 10 cm H2O to maintain a PaO2 &gt; 88%.</description>

          <description>Noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (Respironics Vision V60; Philips Healthcare, Murrysville, PA) was initiated with an oronasal mask, with inspiratory and expiratory positive airway pressures (IPAP, EPAP) set at the lower end of the following settings and increased as necessary to alleviate respiratory distress: IPAP 10 to 20 cm H2O (or 5 to 15 cm H2O above EPAP), and EPAP 5 to 10 cm H2O. FiO2 was initiated at 1.0 for noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation. The target for each intervention was to decrease breathing rate to fewer than 25 breaths/min and optimize comfort, whereas FiO2 was adjusted to maintain a pulse oximetry reading (SpO2) greater than 88%. The study model provided for having a respiratory therapist at bedside for the first 4 hours, which facilitated rapid changing of settings as needed.</description>

          <description>Patients will be fit with an oronasal mask using a fitting gauge that will be applied by a respiratory therapist or other clinician skilled in management of Noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (NiPPV). NiPPV(Respironics Vision V60; Philips Healthcare, Murrysville, PA) was initiated with an oronasal mask, with inspiratory and expiratory positive airway pressures (IPAP, EPAP) set at the lower end of the following settings and increased as necessary to alleviate respiratory distress: IPAP 10 to 20 cm H2O (or 5 to 15 cm H2O above EPAP), and EPAP 5 to 10 cm H2O. FiO2 was initiated at 1.0 for noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation. The target for each intervention was to decrease breathing rate to fewer than 25 breaths/min and optimize comfort, whereas FiO2 was adjusted to maintain a pulse oximetry reading (SpO2) greater than 88%. The study model provided for having a respiratory therapist at bedside for the first 4 hours, which facilitated rapid changing of settings as needed.</description>

          <description>Patients will be fit with a Vapotherm adult nasal cannula that will be applied by a respiratory therapist or other clinician skilled in management of High Velocity Nasal Insufflation (HVNI). HVNI (Precision Flow; Vapotherm, Inc, Exeter, NH) (Figure 1) using a small-bore nasal cannula was initiated with a flow rate set to 35 L/min, with a starting temperature between 35C and 37C and FiO2 at 1.0. Adjustments in flow (up to 40 L/min) and temperature (typically between 35C and 37C) were made to alleviate respiratory distress and optimize comfort. The target for each intervention was to decrease breathing rate to fewer than 25 breaths/min and optimize comfort, whereas FiO2 was adjusted to maintain a pulse oximetry reading (SpO2) greater than 88%. The study model provided for having a respiratory therapist at bedside for the first 4 hours, which facilitated rapid changing of settings as needed.</description>

High-velocity nasal insufflation (Precision Flow; Vapotherm, Inc, Exeter, NH) (Figure 1) using a small-bore nasal cannula was initiated with a flow rate set to 35 L/min, with a starting temperature between 35C and 37C and FiO2 at 1.0. Adjustments in flow (up to 40 L/min) and temperature (typically between 35C and 37C) were made to alleviate respiratory distress and optimize comfort. The target for each intervention was to decrease breathing rate to fewer than 25 breaths/min and optimize comfort, whereas FiO2 was adjusted to maintain a pulse oximetry reading (SpO2) greater than 88%. The study model provided for having a respiratory therapist at bedside for the first 4 hours, which facilitated rapid changing of settings as needed.</description>

        <description>Evaluate the capability of HVNI, compared to NIPPV, to affect indices of ventilation. The secondary endpoint is the degree of physiologic improvement in blood oxygen and CO2 levels that signify a reduction in both hypoxemia and/or hypercapnia. Modified Borg score recorded at baseline, 30min, 1 hr, 90 min, and 4 hrs (if still on therapy) and at treatment failure/intubation (if applicable). NOTE: Due to the need for patients to be alert and able to provide this score, the number analyzed is less than the total patients in the trial.
A modified Borg scale was used to ask the patient to describe their effort on a scale of 0 to 10, where 10 is extreme discomfort.</description>

            <description>Patients will be fit with an oronasal mask using a fitting gauge that will be applied by a respiratory therapist or other clinician skilled in management of NIPPV.Noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (Respironics Vision V60; Philips Healthcare, Murrysville, PA) was initiated with an oronasal mask, with inspiratory and expiratory positive airway pressures (IPAP, EPAP) set at the lower end of the following settings and increased as necessary to alleviate respiratory distress: IPAP 10 to 20 cm H2O (or 5 to 15 cm H2O above EPAP), and EPAP 5 to 10 cm H2O. FiO2 was initiated at 1.0 for noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation. The target for each intervention was to decrease breathing rate to fewer than 25 breaths/min and optimize comfort, whereas FiO2 was adjusted to maintain a pulse oximetry reading (SpO2) greater than 88%. The study model provided for having a respiratory therapist at bedside for the first 4 hours, which facilitated rapid changing of settings as needed.</description>

            <description>Patients will be fit with a Vapotherm adult nasal cannula that will be applied by a respiratory therapist or other clinician skilled in management of HFT. High-velocity nasal insufflation (Precision Flow; Vapotherm, Inc, Exeter, NH) (Figure 1) using a small-bore nasal cannula was initiated with a flow rate set to 35 L/min, with a starting temperature between 35C and 37C and FiO2 at 1.0. Adjustments in flow (up to 40 L/min) and temperature (typically between 35C and 37C) were made to alleviate respiratory distress and optimize comfort. The target for each intervention was to decrease breathing rate to fewer than 25 breaths/min and optimize comfort, whereas FiO2 was adjusted to maintain a pulse oximetry reading (SpO2) greater than 88%. The study model provided for having a respiratory therapist at bedside for the first 4 hours, which facilitated rapid changing of settings as needed.</description>

            <description>Patients will be fit with an oronasal mask using a fitting gauge that will be applied by a respiratory therapist or other clinician skilled in management of NIPPV.Noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (Respironics Vision V60; Philips Healthcare, Murrysville, PA) was initiated with an oronasal mask, with inspiratory and expiratory positive airway pressures (IPAP, EPAP) set at the lower end of the following settings and increased as necessary to alleviate respiratory distress: IPAP 10 to 20 cm H2O (or 5 to 15 cm H2O above EPAP), and EPAP 5 to 10 cm H2O. FiO2 was initiated at 1.0 for noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation. The target for each intervention was to decrease breathing rate to fewer than 25 breaths/min and optimize comfort, whereas FiO2 was adjusted to maintain a pulse oximetry reading (SpO2) greater than 88%. The study model provided for having a respiratory therapist at bedside for the first 4 hours, which facilitated rapid changing of settings as needed.</description>

FiO2 was initiated at 1.0 for noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation. The target for each intervention was to decrease breathing rate to fewer than 25 breaths/min and optimize comfort, whereas FiO2 was adjusted to maintain a pulse oximetry reading (SpO2) greater than 88%.
