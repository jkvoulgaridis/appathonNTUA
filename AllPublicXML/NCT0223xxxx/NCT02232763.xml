  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that using Losartan would help decrease proteinuria in
      pediatric chronic kidney disease with tubular proteinuria.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children with tubular proteinuria (urine protein to creatinine ratio &gt; 0.3 mg/mg) were
      randomly assigned in 1:1 ratio to losartan or placebo treatment for 12 weeks, then crossed
      over to the opposite intervention for another three months after a washout period of 2 weeks.
      The primary outcome is the change in urinary protein-creatinine ratio from baseline to the
      end of 12 weeks. Efficacy of losartan in children with CKD with tubular proteinuria was also
      investigated with additional retrospective review of medical record.
