  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm phase II trial focused on how dabrafenib and trametinib before and after
      surgery works in treating patients with stage IIIB-C melanoma that has a specific mutation in
      the BRAF gene. Dabrafenib and trametinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some
      of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving dabrafenib and trametinib before surgery may
      make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed.
      Giving dabrafenib and trametinib after surgery may kill any remaining tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Study enrollment was stopped in April 2016 due to a substantial improvement in RFS in Arm
      B vs Arm A treated patients. The study was redesigned in August 2016 as a single-arm study
      with a new primary objective:

      To compare relapse-free survival (RFS) between patients who develop a pathologic Complete
      Response (pCR) or do not achieve a pCR following dabrafenib and trametinib neoadjuvant
      combination therapy in patients with locally advanced BRAF V600 mutated melanoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare overall survival of patients with pathologic complete response (pCR) and
      patients without pCR who are receiving dabrafenib and trametinib neoadjuvant therapy followed
      by adjuvant combination therapy.

      II. To identify biomarkers predictive of response through collection of serial blood draws
      and biopsies in patients receiving neoadjuvant dabrafenib and trametinib combination therapy.

      III. To evaluate the safety of dabrafenib and trametinib in combination in this patient
      population.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate and perform further advanced imaging analysis on magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and positron emission tomography (PET) scanned (if
      available) images collected on patients enrolled onto this study.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive dabrafenib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) and trametinib PO once daily (QD)
      for 8 weeks. After completion of 8 weeks of dabrafenib and trametinib, patients undergo
      surgery. Approximately 1 week after surgery, patients receive dabrafenib PO BID and
      trametinib PO QD for 44 additional weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year.

          -  Male subjects must agree to use one of the contraception methods listed below; this
             criterion must be followed from the time of the first dose of study medication until 4
             weeks after the last dose of study medication; however, it is advised that
             contraception be used for a total of 16 weeks following the last dose (based on the
             lifecycle of sperm); methods: a) abstinence, defined as sexual inactivity consistent
             with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject; periodic abstinence (e.g.
             calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not
             acceptable methods of contraception; b) condom (during non-vaginal intercourse with
             any partner - male or female) OR c) condom and occlusive cap (diaphragm or
             cervical/vault caps) plus spermicidal agent (foam/gel/film/cream/suppository) (during
             sexual intercourse with a female)

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of: a) non-childbearing
             potential defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or
             hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea (in
             questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone [FSH]
             &gt; 40 MlU/mL and estradiol &lt; 40 pg/mL [&lt; 140 pmol/L] is confirmatory); females on
             hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be
             required to use one of the contraception methods listed below if they wish to continue
             their HRT during the study; otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation
             of post-menopausal status prior to study enrollment; for most forms of HRT, at least
             2-4 weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this
             interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT; following confirmation of their
             post-menopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a
             contraceptive method; b) child-bearing potential and agrees to use one of the
             contraception methods listed below for an appropriate period of time (as determined by
             the product label or investigator) prior to the start of dosing to sufficiently
             minimize the risk of pregnancy at that point; female subjects must agree to use
             contraception until 4 weeks after the last dose of study medication, and must have a
             negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 14 days prior to the start of dosing

             intrauterine system (IUS) that meets the &lt; 1% failure rate as stated in the product
             label; c) male partner sterilization prior to the female subject's entry into the
             study, and this male is the sole partner for that subject; d) double barrier method:
             condom and occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) plus spermicidal agent
             (foam/gel/film/cream/suppository)
