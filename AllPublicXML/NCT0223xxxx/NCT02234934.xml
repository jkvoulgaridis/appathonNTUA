  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD) is an inherited immunodeficiency disorder which results
      from defects that prevent white blood cells from effectively killing bacteria, fungi and
      other microorganisms. Chronic granulomatous inflammation may compromise vital organs and
      account for additional morbidity. CGD is thought to affect approximately 1 in 200,000
      persons, although the real incidence might be higher due to under-diagnosis of milder
      phenotypes.

      The first gene therapy approaches in X-CGD have shown that effective gene therapy requires
      bone-marrow (BM) conditioning with chemotherapy to make space for the gene-modified cells to
      engraft. These studies demonstrated that transplantation of gene modified stem cells led to
      production of white blood cells that could clear existing infections. However, some trials
      using mouse-derived retroviral vectors were complicated by the development of myelodysplasia
      and leukemia-like growth of blood cells. This trial will evaluate a new lentiviral vector
      that may be able to correct the defect, but have much lower risk for the complication.

      This study is a prospective non-controlled, non-randomized Phase I/II clinical trial to
      assess the safety, feasibility and efficacy of cellular gene therapy in patients with chronic
      granulomatous disease using transplantation of autologous bone marrow CD34+ cells transduced
      ex vivo by the G1XCGD lentiviral vector containing the human CGD gene. Primary objectives
      include evaluation of safety and evaluation of efficacy by biochemical and functional
      reconstitution in progeny of engrafted cells and stability at 12 months. Secondary objectives
      include evaluation of clinical efficacy, longitudinal evaluation of clinical effect in terms
      of augmented immunity against bacterial and fungal infection, transduction of CD34+
      hematopoietic cells from X-CGD patients by ex vivo lentivirus-mediated gene transfer, and
      evaluation of engraftment kinetics and stability. Approximately 3-5 patients will be treated
      per site with a goal of 10 total patients to be treated with G1XCGD lentiviral vector.

      The therapeutic product to be evaluated is autologous CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells (HSC)
      modified by ex vivo transduction using the pCCLchimGP91WPRE lentiviral vector (G1XCGD
      Modified Autologous BM CD34 cells) containing the human CGD gene. The G1XCGD lentiviral
      vector is a 3rd generation self-inactivating lentiviral vector which directs gp91phox
      expression from a codon-optimized form of the CYBB gene preferentially to myeloid cells, with
      a modified WPRE (PRE4).

      G1XCGD is an integrative, 3rd generation replication-defective, self-inactivating (SIN)
      HIV-derived Lentiviral (LV) vector, with a mutated Woodchuck hepatitis virus
      Posttranscriptional Regulatory Element (WPRE) sequence. A LV vector derived from HIV-1 has
      been chosen with respect to LV natural properties: they are genetically stable, permanently
      integrate into the genome of transduced cells and provide long-term gene expression in vitro
      and in vivo. The transduction of Hematopoietic Stem Cells (HSC) with such LV can be achieved
      after limited pre-activation of the cells in short-term cultures with cytokines, in
      conditions that are compatible with the preservation of the self-renewing capacities of these
      cells. These properties make these LV suitable for ex-vivo gene therapy strategies using HSC.

      G1XCGD provirus includes a chimeric promoter designed to regulate the transgene expression in
      myeloid cells and a transgene called GP91 (also known as CYBB), which is a codon-optimized
      cDNA sequence of the human CYBB gene also known as GP91-PHOX or NOX2 gene. The promoter is a
      synthetic chimeric element created by the fusion of c-Fes and Cathepsin G minimal 5'-flanking
      regions. Cathepsin G is a serine protease stored in the azurophil granules of neutrophil
      granulocytes. Part of the chimeric promoter contains binding sites for myeloid transcription
      factors C/EBP and PU.1 from the upstream region of the transcription start site of the
      Cathepsin G gene. The other part of the chimeric promoter is a human c-Fes sequence that has
      been added to enhance the Cathepsin G promoter activity in granulocytic cells. The resulting
      chimeric promoter is able to i) regulate the expression of the GP91 transgene in myeloid
      cells in a specific manner, and ii) to effectively restore NADPH-oxidase activity in
      granulocytes, as reported by Santilli et al. (Santilli et al., 2011) and confirmed in
      preclinical studies conducted with the G1XCGD vector. The GP91 transgene codes for the 570
      amino-acid cytochrome b-245, a 91 kD beta polypeptide that is also known as the NADPH-oxidase
      catalytic subunit gp91-phox, or cytochrome b-245 heavy chain, or gp91-phox protein.

    <description>The investigational product is patient-specific and corresponds to autologous CD34+ cells transduced ex vivo with the G1XCGD vector in their final suspension. The starting materials used for the production of the investigational product consist of the viral vector and the patient's CD34+ cells.
The G1XCGD vector is used to transduce autologous CD34+ cells ex vivo. These transduced cells are then frozen, and an aliquot tested and characterized for quality. If the cell product passes release criteria, it is thawed at bedside and infused into the patient after the patient has received myelo-ablative conditioning. The cell/product dose will consist of at least 3 x 10^6 cells per kg of body weight transduced ex vivo with 1 x 10^8 IG/mL of lentiviral vector to achieve &gt; 0.3 integrated copies per cell.</description>
