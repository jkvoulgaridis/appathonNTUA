    <textblock>
      In this prospective, randomized, double blind study, the aim is to determine the efficacy of
      Linaclotide in relation to Senna in relieving the symptoms of chronic idiopathic constipation
      (CIC). Patients with CIC, (age 18 - 70) will be enrolled in the study and randomized to Senna
      or Linaclotide. Patients will be asked to complete questionnaires during the study and will
      be followed for 12 weeks. Main outcomes include number of daily bowel movements and measures
      from surveys regarding bowel habits, relief, and satisfaction.

      In this prospective, randomized, double blind study, the aim is to determine the efficacy of
      Linaclotide in relation to Senna in relieving the symptoms of chronic idiopathic constipation
      (CIC). Our hypothesis is that Senna is not inferior to Linaclotide in the treatment of CIC.
      Seventy patients aged 18-70 diagnosed with CIC and seen by a gastroenterologist affiliated
      with TriHealth or a patient of the Faculty Medical Center clinic will be included in the
      study. After enrollment, subjects will be randomized to receive either Linaclotide or Senna
      over a 12-week period after a 1 week wash-out period. During th study period, subjects will
      complete a log to record the number of daily bowel movements. The subjects will also complete
      3 validated surveys on a weekly basis: Subject's Global Assessment SGA of Relief, Subject's
      Global Assessment SGA of Bowel Habit, and SGA of Satisfaction with their Bowel Habit. A
      research nurse will meet with subjects at the beginning of the study and then at 3 monthly
      visits to administer the study medication and distribute the surveys. The main outcomes
      measures are change in # of bowel movements and SGA survey scores.

    <description>Change from before to after treatment in patient assessment of relief - The Subject's Global Assessment (SGA) of Relief was used to measure this outcome. In evaluating subject's response to SGA of relief, subject's who respond with either &quot;completely relieved&quot; or &quot;considerably relieved&quot; for at least 50% of the weeks at the end point or &quot;somewhat relieved&quot; for 100 % of the weeks at the end point will be considered responders to therapy.</description>
