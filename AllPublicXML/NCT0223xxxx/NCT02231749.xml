    <measure>Investigator-assessed Objective Response Rate(ORR) in Intermediate/Poor Risk Participants Per IRRC Using RECIST v1.1</measure>
    <time_frame>From first dose until date of documented disease progression or subsequent therapy, whichever occurs first (assessed up to June 2017, approximately 31 months)</time_frame>
    <description>ORR was defined as the proportion of randomized subjects who achieved a best response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) using the RECIST v1.1 criteria based on IRRC assessment. Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), greater than or equal to 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR</description>

    <measure>Overall Survival (OS) in Intermediate/Poor-Risk Participants With Previously Untreated Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma (mRCC)</measure>
    <time_frame>From the date of randomization to the date of death (assessed up to June 2017, approximately 31 months)</time_frame>
    <description>OS was defined as the time from randomization to the date of death from any cause. Survival time was censored at the date of last contact (&quot;last known alive date&quot;) for subjects who were alive.</description>

    <measure>Progression-Free Survival (PFS) in Intermediate/Poor-Risk Participants With Previously Untreated Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma (mRCC)</measure>
    <time_frame>From date of first dose to date of documented disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first (assessed up to June 2017, approximately 31 months)</time_frame>
    <description>PFS was defined as the time between the date of randomization and the first date of documented progression, as determined by the IRRC (as per RECIST 1.1 criteria), or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Subsequent therapy included anticancer therapy, tumor directed radiotherapy, or tumor directed surgery. Subjects who died without a reported progression were considered to have progressed on the date of their death.</description>

    <description>Overall survival is defined as the time from randomization to the date of death from any cause. For subjects that are alive, their survival time will be censored at the date of last contact (&quot;last known alive date&quot;). Overall survival will be censored for subjects at the date of randomization if they were randomized but had no follow-up. Survival follow-up will be conducted every 3 months after subject's off-treatment date.</description>

          -  Any active or recent history of a known or suspected autoimmune disease or recent
             history of a syndrome that required systemic corticosteroids (&gt;10 mg daily Prednisone
             equivalent) or immunosuppressive medications except for syndromes which would not be
             expected to recur in the absence of an external trigger. Subjects with vitiligo or
             type I diabetes mellitus or residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune thyroiditis only
             requiring hormone replacement are permitted to enroll

          -  Any condition requiring systemic treatment with corticosteroids (&gt;10 mg daily
             Prednisone equivalents) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days prior to
             first dose of study drug. Inhaled steroids and adrenal replacement steroid doses &gt;10
             mg daily Prednisone equivalents are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune
             disease
