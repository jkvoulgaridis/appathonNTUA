  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We propose a randomized, double-blind controlled trial comparing arthroscopic release with
      arthroscopic debridement for the management of chronic tennis elbow in an effort to
      definitively determine whether arthroscopic tennis elbow release is an effective treatment of
      tennis elbow, and to further provide better recommendations for the use of this procedure, in
      an effort to improve patient care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lateral epicondylitis (tennis elbow) is a common occurrence in the general population with an
      incidence of 4-7/1000/year. More recent literature describes a 1-3% rate over the course of a
      lifetime, most typically affecting individuals between the ages of 35 and 50.

      Tennis elbow is a common occurrence in the general population that causes lateral elbow pain
      and diminished grip strength, which may be debilitating. Most affected individuals achieve
      symptom resolution within 6 months to 1 year with measures such as physiotherapy,
      anti-inflammatories and corticosteroid injections, but a small subset will go on to develop
      chronic symptoms. Chronic tennis elbow can be treated surgically, by arthroscopic tennis
      elbow release (ATER), which has gained popularity in recent years as it presents a less
      invasive option, allows for direct visualization of the elbow joint for other pathology and
      has a faster return-to-work time compared to other surgical procedures. Despite its promise
      there have been no high quality studies evaluating the efficacy of arthroscopic tennis elbow
      release, bringing the actual efficacy of this procedure into question. A randomized
      controlled trial on arthroscopic tennis elbow release would provide much needed evidence in
      order to define its role in the management of tennis elbow and to help refine treatment
      protocols.

    <measure>Change in Mayo Elbow Performance Score</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to up until 24-Months Post-Operative</time_frame>
    <description>The Mayo Elbow Performance score is an outcome measure specific to the elbow to assess activities of daily living (ADLs). This outcome measure consists of 4 subscales: pain, range of motion, stability and daily function. Each section is combined for a total score out of 100 points. A higher score, indicates a better outcome.</description>

    <measure>Change in Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH)</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to up until 24-Months Post-Operative</time_frame>
    <description>The Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH), is a questionnaire that measures physical function and symptoms in those with an upper extremity disorder. The DASH is a 30 item questionnaire, each question is rated using a Likert scale. The question points are combined for a total of 100 points. A higher score indicates a worse outcome.</description>

    <measure>Change in American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Elbow (ASES)</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to up until 24-Months Post-Operative</time_frame>
    <description>The ASES is a shoulder specific assessment divided into two sections: pain and activities of daily living (ADL). Pain is recorded on a visual analogue scale (0-10), lower scores indicate better outcomes. There are 10 activities of daily living questions, each are recorded on a 4 level likert scale (0-3), which a higher score indicates a better outcome. The overall score is an equal weight of the two sections and produces a score out of 100. The higher the score, the better the outcome.</description>

    <measure>Change in Oxford Elbow Score (OES)</measure>
    <time_frame>From time of enrollment up until 2-years post-operative</time_frame>
    <description>The Oxford Elbow Score (OES) is an outcome measure specific to patients who have had elbow surgery. The OES consists of 12 questions, looking into 3 domains: elbow function, pain, and social-psychological, using a Likert scale. Questions are summed, for a total score of 100 points. A higher score indicates a better outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Grip Strength</measure>
    <time_frame>From time of enrollment up until 2-years post-operative</time_frame>
    <description>Grip strength will be measured using a hand-held dynamometer. Each participant will be asked to squeeze as much as they are comfortably able for approximately 3 seconds. 3 trials will be completed on each hand. Results will be averaged, and recorded in kilograms. Higher strength is a better outcome.</description>

    <time_frame>Ongoing from time of enrollment, up until 24-months post-operative</time_frame>
    <description>Rates of study adverse events or serious adverse events (e.g. number of reoperations) will be monitored and recorded and compared between study groups. A higher rate of adverse events indicates a worse outcome.</description>
