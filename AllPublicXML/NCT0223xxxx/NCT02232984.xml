    <measure>Number of Vectors With Phrenic Nerve Stimulation (PNS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-discharge (up to 7 days post implant)</time_frame>
    <description>The primary objective of this study was to characterize the performance of Boston Scientific (BSC) unique pacing vectors vs. BSC/St Jude Medical (STJ) common pacing vectors to prevent phrenic nerve stimulation (PNS) based on the selected pacing cathode. BSC unique vectors are those that are only available with Boston Scientific's (BSC) quadripolar (X4) CRT-Ds while common vectors are those that are available for both BSC and STJ systems.</description>

    <measure>Final Pacing Treshold at Pre-discharge</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-discharge (up to 7 days post implant)</time_frame>
    <description>Characterize the electrical performance of BSC pacing vectors using pacing thresholds. Summary statistics for LV Tip1 to LV Ring 2 pacing thresholds for the BSC pacing vectors were reported. The electrical measurements were taken using the implanted pulse generator (PG) per standard practice.</description>

    <measure>Final LV Lead Impedance at Pre-discharge</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-discharge (up to 7 days post implant)</time_frame>
    <description>Characterize the electrical performance of BSC pacing vectors using impedance measurements. Summary Statistics Were Provided for LV Tip 1 to LV Ring 2 Measurements. The electrical measurements were taken using the implanted pulse generator (PG) per standard practice.</description>

    <measure>Final Sensing Amplitude at Pre-discharge</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-discharge (up to 7 days post implant)</time_frame>
    <description>Characterize the electrical performance of BSC pacing vectors using sensing amplitudes. Summary statistics were provided for LV Tip 1 to LV Ring 2 measurements. The electrical measurements were taken using the implanted pulse generator (PG) per standard practice.</description>

    <measure>Delivery System Comparison Between ACUITY Pro and the Other Delivery Systems</measure>
    <time_frame>At time of implantation (0 to 30 days post consent signature)</time_frame>
    <description>Characterize the performance of the BSC ACUITY Pro delivery system versus competitive delivery systems in the placement of LV leads. Data collected on the use of the ACUITY Pro delivery system and competitive systems were characterized by presenting summary statistics by system (all competitive devices maybe combined for purposes of reporting), and differences between the ACUITY Pro system and competitive systems were reported as appropriate.</description>

    <description>All study patients will be implanted with a Boston Scientific (BSC) quadripolar Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT-D) and a currently approved quadripolar left ventricular lead. At the pre-discharge visit, multiple vectors will be tested in order to assess their respective performance.</description>

        Subjects will be selected from the center's general population who are indicated for a
        CRT-D. All study subjects will be implanted with the BSC DYNAGEN or INOGEN X4 CRT-D (or any
        future FDA approved BSC X4 CRT-D). Subjects may have a previously implanted/will be
        receiving an approved quadripolar left ventricular lead.

        <description>The primary objective of this study was to characterize the performance of Boston Scientific (BSC) unique pacing vectors vs. BSC/St Jude Medical (STJ) common pacing vectors to prevent phrenic nerve stimulation (PNS) based on the selected pacing cathode. BSC unique vectors are those that are only available with Boston Scientific's (BSC) quadripolar (X4) CRT-Ds while common vectors are those that are available for both BSC and STJ systems.</description>
