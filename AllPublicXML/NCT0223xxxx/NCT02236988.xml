  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To study how the body absorbs apremilast, and how this absorption is affected when the drug
      is given as different formulations. Blood samples will be taken to look at the amount of
      study drug in the blood to determine how much apremilast is absorbed by the body. This study
      is beng done to iddentify the best tablet formulation (preparation) of apremilast.

      This will be a single-center, open-label, crossover, single modified-release-dose, study in
      male subjects to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of prototype modified-release formulations
      compared to the reference immediate-release apremilast formulation. Subjects will be randomly
      assigned to a treatment sequence. A total of up to 8 test MR formulations may be evaluated.

      Group 1: 4-sequence, 4-period to compare three modified-release prototypes with the reference
      immediate-release formulation. A total of 16 subjects will be enrolled to obtain at least 12
      subjects who complete all 4 periods.

      One of two scenarios will be conducted in the second group depending on the availability of
      the modified-release formulations.

      One of two scenarios will be conducted in the second group depending on the availability of
      the modified-release formulations.

      Group 2/Scenario 1: This is a 4-sequence, 4-period design identical to Group 1. This will
      occur if all three modified-release formulations planned for Group 2 are available. A total
      of 16 subjects will be enrolled to obtain at least 12 subjects who complete all 4 periods.

      Group 2/Scenario 2: This is a 6-sequence, 3-period design. This will occur if only two
      modified-release formulations are tested in Group 2. A total of 18 subjects will be enrolled
      to obtain at least 12 subjects who complete all 3 periods.

      A third group may be enrolled to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of one or two additional
      prototype formulations (after the initial six) compared to the immediate-release formulation.
      One of two scenarios will be conducted in the third group depending on the availability of
      the prototype formulations.

      Group 3/Scenario 1: This is a 2-sequence, 2-period design that will be used if one test
      formulation is available. A total of 14 subjects will be enrolled to obtain at least 12
      subjects who complete both periods.

      Group 3/Scenario 2: This is a 6-sequence, 3-period design identical to Group 2/Scenario 2
      above. This will occur if two test formulations are available. A total of 18 subjects will be
      enrolled to obtain at least 12 subjects who complete all 3 periods.

      A fourth group may be enrolled to evaluate the PK of four additional prototype formulations
      compared to the IR formulation.

      Group 4: This is a 10-sequence, 5-period William Square design to compare four MR prototypes
      with the reference IR formulation. A total of 30 subjects will be enrolled to obtain at least
      20 subjects who complete all 5 periods.
