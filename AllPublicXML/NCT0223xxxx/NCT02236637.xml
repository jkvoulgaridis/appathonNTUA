  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this registry is to document the characteristics and management of patients
      with metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) in routine clinical practice,
      independent of treatment used. Given the rapidly evolving landscape in mCRPC treatments,
      there is a need for a current and improved understanding of how these treatments fit into the
      current treatment paradigm for mCRPC, how they are combined and sequenced, and how their
      relative effectiveness profiles emerge outside of a clinical trial setting. This will be
      based on documentation and description of sequencing of treatment initiation, termination,
      and duration; relative effectiveness of treatments; defined medical resource utilization
      (MRU) and quality-of-life parameters and follow-up for survival.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-interventional, multicenter, prospective registry of patients with a confirmed
      diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the prostate presenting with mCRPC, based on documented
      metastatic prostate cancer and documented castration resistance. Castrate-resistant prostate
      cancer is defined by disease progression despite testosterone &lt;50 ng/dL, and/or androgen
      deprivation therapy, and/or a history of orchiectomy, and may present as a continuous rise in
      prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and/or worsening of existing disease/symptoms, and/or the
      appearance of new metastases. Observational methodology will be used to capture data. The
      decision of patients to take part in the registry will not influence their medical care.
      Treatment decisions will be made at the discretion of the treating physician, per routine
      clinical practice. Only data available from routine clinical practice will be collected. It
      is expected that approximately 3,000 patients will participate in this registry. To ensure a
      patient population representative of clinical practice and to reduce selection bias, all
      patients meeting the eligibility criteria at a participating site should be consecutively
      enrolled in the registry, irrespective of their treatment. The planned total duration of the
      registry will be 5.5 years from the date that the first patient is enrolled, irrespective of
      the country or registry site. The anticipated duration of patient enrollment is 2.5 years.
      The maximum duration of follow-up for individual patients in the observational period of the
      registry will be 3 years, regardless of when they are enrolled. The 3-year period of the
      observational period will document the sequencing of systemic mCRPC treatments during routine
      clinical practice, considering the life expectancy of patients with mCRPC in the registry.
      Unless specified otherwise per local regulations, all patients must give their informed
      consent to participate in this registry before data collection (ie, data entry into the case
      report form [CRF]) is performed. Patients will be enrolled at the time of initiation of a new
      systemic mCRPC treatment or during a period when a patient is considered to be in
      surveillance according to clinical practice. Baseline data collection will include details of
      the patient's prostate cancer history and prior prostate cancer treatment. This will be
      followed by a prospective observational period during which patients may cycle through
      multiple systemic mCRPC treatment periods and periods of surveillance. During the
      observational period, data will be collected at the following time points of a patient's
      course of treatment in routine clinical practice: initiation of a new systemic mCRPC
      treatment; termination of a systemic mCRPC treatment; when the duration of a systemic mCRPC
      treatment or surveillance period is &gt;3 months, data collection will be performed at a minimum
      frequency of 3-monthly intervals during that period. Survival data will be collected for all
      patients 3 years after their enrollment or at the close of the registry, whichever occurs
      first, except for those patients who withdraw their consent prior to completing the
      observation period.

    <description>The EQ-5D-5L is an instrument for measuring health status. It consists of the descriptive system and the EQ visual Analogue scale (EQ VAS). The descriptive system comprises the same 5 dimensions (mobility, self care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression). There are 5 levels for each dimension: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems. The EQ VAS records the respondent's self-rated health on a 20 cm vertical, visual analogue scale with endpoints labeled 'the best health you can imagine' and 'the worst health you can imagine'.</description>

The FACT-G (Version 4) contains a 27-item questionnaire and is composed of 4 subscales of health-related quality-of-life: physical well-being, social/family well-being, emotional well being, and functional well-being. The prostate cancer subscale is composed of 12 items, related to prostate-specific questions, which include sexuality, bowel/bladder function, and pain. The score for each of the 39 questions ranges from 0 to 4. The total FACT-P score thus ranges from 0 to 156; a higher score indicates better QOL</description>

        Approximately 3,000 patients will be enrolled in this registry. Patients eligible for
        enrollment will be men aged at least 18 years, with a confirmed diagnosis of adenocarcinoma
        of the prostate, with documented metastatic prostate cancer and documented castration
        resistance. Patients will be enrolled at the time of initiating a new systemic anticancer
        mCRPC treatment or during surveillance; for the purpose of the registry, at enrollment,
        initiation of a new systemic mCRPC treatment is considered as ±30 days from a patient's
        baseline data collection.
