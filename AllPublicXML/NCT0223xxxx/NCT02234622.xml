      Given the limited effectiveness of current treatments and the burden PTSD places on Veterans,
      civilians and clinicians, this research aims to compare the effects of a standardized,
      traditional, holistic yoga intervention (postures, breathing, deep muscle contraction and
      relaxation practices) with a wellness program (wellness topics and physical activity) on PTSD
      symptoms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Posttraumatic Stress Disorder constitutes a substantial proportion of the burden of illness
      among Veterans. However, current PTSD treatments are not effective for all, and a significant
      number remain symptomatic despite pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. As a result, there has
      been increased interest within the military and VA in Complementary and Alternative Medicine
      approaches, such as yoga, to improve symptoms without requiring direct verbal processing of
      the trauma. Yoga provides an innovative approach to calming hyperarousal, reducing
      numbness/avoidance, and improving self-regulation of emotions, while cultivating physical and
      emotional well-being. Because of this unique approach to the biological, psychological, and
      social dimensions of PTSD, we believe that yoga interventions are poised to meet the demand
      for more effective PTSD treatment options for Veterans. Recent research indicates that yoga
      interventions can be delivered successfully to individuals who have PTSD and have the
      potential to reduce clinician rated and self-reported overall PTSD symptoms, depression and
      anxiety. However, few studies exist that have evaluated yoga for PTSD and they have involved
      small sample sizes and are either uncontrolled or waitlist/usual care controlled. Also, there
      is much variation among studies in the style and components of yoga interventions. Thus, a
      randomized controlled trial of a standardized, traditional, holistic yoga intervention is
      urgently needed to inform VA policy makers and clinicians of the potential benefits of yoga
      as an adjunct to currently available PTSD treatments.

      OBJECTIVE: The overall goal of this project is to compare the effects of a 16-week Holistic
      Yoga Program (HYP) with a 16-week Wellness Lifestyle Program (WLP) on PTSD and related
      symptoms and outcomes. This project has three specific aims: 1) to compare the effects of the
      interventions (HYP vs. WLP) on overall PTSD symptom severity; 2) compare the interventions'
      effects on PTSD-specific symptoms (anger, sleep), PTSD-related symptoms (depression, anxiety,
      pain) and related outcomes (well-being/quality of life); 3) to manualize the Holistic Yoga
      Program and training process for experienced yoga teachers to deliver HYP to individuals who
      have PTSD in order to facilitate future study and dissemination efforts.

      METHODS: This study sample will include 212 outpatients with a clinician-confirmed diagnosis
      of PTSD, recruited from the Roudebush VA Medical Center as well as metropolitan area mental
      health clinicians and military/Veterans' organizations, who will be randomly assigned to
      receive the Holistic Yoga Program (HYP) or the Wellness Lifestyle Program (WLP). The HYP will
      involve a standardized 16-week intervention consisting of: 1) in-person group yoga class
      taught by a yoga therapist (Yoga Alliance minimum 200 hour level) with trained
      assistants.Classes will include (1) yoga postures, breathing practices, deep muscle
      contraction practices, relaxation practices, and integration of scientific rational and yoga
      philosophy within the instruction; (2) video and audio recordings for home practice; and 4) a
      Participant Handbook to reinforce concepts taught during in-person sessions. The WLP is an
      attention control comprised of low intensity walking and didactics about wellness topics that
      will also encourage home practice and provide a Participant Handbook to reinforce concepts
      taught during in-person sessions.

    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 16 weeks (end of treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>The CAPS is a semi-structured clinician administered interview that measures PTSD diagnostic status and symptom severity consistent with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-Fifth Edition. Scores range 0-80 with higher scores meaning a worse outcome.</description>

    <measure>PTSD Checklist</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 16 weeks (end of treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>PTSD self-reported symptom severity will be assessed with the PTSD Checklist-5 (PCL-5), a 20-item self-report measure of the 5th version of the Diagnostic and Statistics Manual (DSM-5) symptoms of PTSD used as a measure of change in PTSD symptoms as a function of treatment. Scores range 0-80 with higher scores indicating worse outcome.</description>

    <measure>Medical Outcomes Study 12-item Sleep Scale (MOS) Problem Index II</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 16 weeks (end of treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Scale (MOS) Problem Index II is a 9-item sub-scale of the 12-item MOS self-report measure that assesses sleep quality (sleep disturbance, adequacy of sleep, and sleep quantity). The item scores of the 9-item sub-scale range from 1-6 and the sub-scale totals are converted to scores ranging 0-100, with higher scores indicating a worse outcome.</description>

    <measure>Patient Reported Outcome Measure Information System (PROMIS) - Short Form 5a</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 16 weeks (end of treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>PROMIS - short form 5a is a 5-item self-report measure to assess feelings of anger over the past 7 days. Total scores, ranging 5-25 are converted to T-scores with higher scores indicating poorer outcome. A score of 50 represents the mean. A difference of 10 from the mean indicates a difference of one standard deviation. Thus, a score of 60 is one standard deviation above the mean, while a score of 30 is two standard deviations below the mean. T-scores range from 0-100</description>

        <description>PROMIS - short form 5a is a 5-item self-report measure to assess feelings of anger over the past 7 days. Total scores, ranging 5-25 are converted to T-scores with higher scores indicating poorer outcome. A score of 50 represents the mean. A difference of 10 from the mean indicates a difference of one standard deviation. Thus, a score of 60 is one standard deviation above the mean, while a score of 30 is two standard deviations below the mean. T-scores range from 0-100</description>

          <description>PROMIS - short form 5a is a 5-item self-report measure to assess feelings of anger over the past 7 days. Total scores, ranging 5-25 are converted to T-scores with higher scores indicating poorer outcome. A score of 50 represents the mean. A difference of 10 from the mean indicates a difference of one standard deviation. Thus, a score of 60 is one standard deviation above the mean, while a score of 30 is two standard deviations below the mean. T-scores range from 0-100</description>
