    <textblock>
      Radiation in combination with Provenge based immunotherapy may improve outcomes seen on
      imaging as well as immunologic monitoring. This study will assess the effect of radiation
      therapy to augment anti-tumor responses from immune therapy with Provenge.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is common knowledge that the host can make anti-tumor immune responses, although often
      these are ineffective in causing tumor regression. Boosting these responses with
      immunotherapy is therefore an attractive, relatively benign adjunctive cancer treatment.
      Little is known in regards to how standard anti-cancer therapies like radiation therapy might
      interact with immunotherapy in a clinical setting. We are interested in knowing if the tumor
      cell death occasioned by radiation therapy might augment anti-tumor responses from the immune
      therapy, Provenge.

      The tentative assumption is that cell death following radiation therapy will stimulate
      anti-tumor immunity, which could provide a more permanent solution to curing cancer and
      discouraging tumors from spreading throughout the body. In order to find out if this
      assumption is correct, for patients undergoing radiation 28 days prior to Provenge, highly
      developed, laboratory analyses for tumor-specific immunity and imaging will be performed.

        Inclusion Criteria: Subjects will be recruited from the population of patients who are
        castrate refractory metastatic prostate cancer (mCRPC) and have made the decision to be
        treated with radiation therapy to one or more metastatic sites of concern followed at least
        28 days later by Provenge.

        Exclusion Criteria: The potential subject is unwilling or hesitant to participate for any
        reason and/or fails to complete the appropriate Informed Consent Form.
