  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a short course (five radiation treatments) of very
      focused (&quot;stereotactic&quot;) external beam radiation therapy for the treatment of early stage
      prostate cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      External beam radiation therapy for prostate cancer, while effective, takes up to 9 weeks to
      deliver on a Monday through Friday basis. Recent phase I/II studies from Seattle and Palo
      Alto using stereotactic guidance to deliver high doses of radiation to the prostate over a 1
      to 2 week period of time suggest that outcomes may be equal or superior to standard
      approaches. These data, combined with markedly improved convenience for patients, make
      radiosurgery (SBRT) for early-stage prostate cancer an enticing option. The goal of this
      study is to offer a radiosurgical option to patients within the Sharp system under the
      umbrella of an IRB-approved study.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male with any age (typically 50 to 70 years old) with a low risk disease. This is
             defined as a Gleason's score of 6 or less, clinical stage of T2a or less, and a PSA of
             less than 15. We will also include patients with Gleason's score of 3+4=7 if there are
             fewer than 2 cores positive, with no more than 5mm of tumor in aggregate dimension.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior surgery or radiotherapy for prostate cancer, PSA over 10, Gleason scores 7, 8,
             9, or 10 (except Gleason 7 as noted, above), or clinical stage T2b, T2c, T3, or T4.
