    <measure>Height Velocity SDS</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, week 26</time_frame>
    <description>Height velocity SDS scores at week 26. Height velocity is change in height per year. The height velocity was calculated as the difference between current height and height at baseline (week 0) divided by time between those measurement time points and multiplied by 365 days. Height velocity SDS was calculated using following formula: Z=[(value /M)^L - 1] / S*L; where L, M and S are median (M), skewness (L) and variation coefficient (S) of children/adolescents' height provided for each sex and age. For each subject, a standard deviation score Z (SDS) was calculated based on age and sex referring to the values L, M and S. The method is described in the WHO Multicentre Growth Reference, which also contains the values for L, M and S by age and sex. For Z (SDS) scores below −3 and above 3, the score was adjusted as described in the WHO instruction. All available data were used for the analysis including data collected after treatment discontinuation and initiation of rescue medication.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>The trial was conducted at 84 sites in 25 countries.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Eligible subjects entered an 11- to 12-week run-in period where they were to undergo a 3-4 week titration of metformin to a maximum tolerated dose of metformin (≥1000 mg and ≤2000 mg per day) followed by an 8-week maintenance period.</pre_assignment_details>
      <group_list>
        <group group_id="P1">
          <title>Liraglutide 1.8 mg</title>
          <description>After the run-in period, subjects were randomized to receive liraglutide subcutaneous injections once daily (in combination with metformin with or without basal insulin, on a background of diet and exercise) for 52 weeks (26 weeks double blind treatment period followed by a 26-week open-label extension period). The liraglutide dosing was started at 0.6 mg/day during the first week and escalated in weekly increments of 0.6 mg over the following 2-3 weeks. Dose escalation was based on tolerability, as judged by the investigator and on the average of three fasting plasma glucose (FPG) measurements performed by the subject at home on the 3 consecutive days before the dose escalation visit being &gt;6.1 mmol/L (110 mg/dL). Subjects were treated with doses of 0.6, 1.2 or 1.8 after dose escalation. Subjects treated with liraglutide for more than 3 months were asked to return for follow-up visits one and two years after the end of the open label period (after trial drug cessation at week 52).</description>
        </group>
        <group group_id="P2">
          <title>Placebo</title>
          <description>After the run-in period, subjects were randomized to receive placebo (in combination with metformin with or without basal insulin, on a background of diet and exercise) for a 26 weeks double blind treatment period. The liraglutide placebo was administered once daily subcutaneously in equivalent volume as liraglutide. After 26 weeks, participants discontinued placebo and continued treatment with metformin (with or without basal insulin) during the open-label period.</description>

          <description>After the run-in period, subjects were randomized to receive liraglutide subcutaneous injections once daily (in combination with metformin with or without basal insulin, on a background of diet and exercise) for 52 weeks (26 weeks double blind treatment period followed by a 26-week open-label extension period). The liraglutide dosing was started at 0.6 mg/day during the first week and escalated in weekly increments of 0.6 mg over the following 2-3 weeks. Dose escalation was based on tolerability, as judged by the investigator and on the average of three fasting plasma glucose (FPG) measurements performed by the subject at home on the 3 consecutive days before the dose escalation visit being &gt;6.1 mmol/L (110 mg/dL). Subjects were treated with doses of 0.6, 1.2 or 1.8 after dose escalation. Subjects treated with liraglutide for more than 3 months were asked to return for follow-up visits one and two years after the end of the open label period (after trial drug cessation at week 52).</description>

BMI SDS was calculated using the following formula: Z=[(value /M)^L - 1] / S*L; where L, M and S are median (M), skewness (L) and variation coefficient (S) of children/adolescents' BMI provided for each sex and age. For each subject, a standard deviation score Z (SDS) was calculated based on age and sex referring to the values L, M and S. The method is described in the world health organisation (WHO) Multicentre Growth Reference, which also contains the values for L, M and S by age and sex. For Z (SDS) scores below −3 and above 3, the score was adjusted as described in the WHO instruction. All available data were used for the analysis including data collected after treatment discontinuation and initiation of rescue medication.</description>

            <description>After the run-in period, subjects were randomized to receive liraglutide subcutaneous injections once daily (in combination with metformin with or without basal insulin, on a background of diet and exercise) for 52 weeks (26 weeks double blind treatment period followed by a 26-week open-label extension period). The liraglutide dosing was started at 0.6 mg/day during the first week and escalated in weekly increments of 0.6 mg over the following 2-3 weeks. Dose escalation was based on tolerability, as judged by the investigator and on the average of three fasting plasma glucose (FPG) measurements performed by the subject at home on the 3 consecutive days before the dose escalation visit being &gt;6.1 mmol/L (110 mg/dL). Subjects were treated with doses of 0.6, 1.2 or 1.8 after dose escalation. Subjects treated with liraglutide for more than 3 months were asked to return for follow-up visits one and two years after the end of the open label period (after trial drug cessation at week 52).</description>

The liraglutide dosing was started at 0.6 mg/day during the first week and escalated in weekly increments of 0.6 mg over the following 2-3 weeks. Dose escalation was based on tolerability, as judged by the investigator and on the average of three fasting plasma glucose (FPG) measurements performed by the subject at home on the 3 consecutive days before the dose escalation visit being &gt;6.1 mmol/L (110 mg/dL). Subjects were treated with doses of 0.6, 1.2 or 1.8 after dose escalation. Subjects treated with liraglutide for more than 3 months were asked to return for follow-up visits one and two years after the end of the open label period (after trial drug cessation at week 52).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in BMI Standard Deviation Score (SDS)</title>
        <description>Change in BMI SDS from baseline to week 52. BMI SDS was calculated using the following formula: Z=[(value /M)^L - 1] / S*L; where L, M and S are median (M), skewness (L) and variation coefficient (S) of children/adolescents' BMI provided for each sex and age. For each subject, a standard deviation score Z (SDS) was calculated based on age and sex referring to the values L, M and S. The method is described in the WHO Multicentre Growth Reference, which also contains the values for L, M and S by age and sex. For Z (SDS) scores below −3 and above 3, the score was adjusted as described in the WHO instruction. All available data were used for the analysis including data collected after treatment discontinuation and initiation of rescue medication.</description>

Subjects were treated with doses of 0.6, 1.2 or 1.8 after dose escalation. Subjects treated with liraglutide for more than 3 months were asked to return for follow-up visits one and two years after the end of the open label period (after trial drug cessation at week 52).</description>

            <description>After the run-in period, subjects were randomized to receive liraglutide subcutaneous injections once daily (in combination with metformin with or without basal insulin, on a background of diet and exercise) for 52 weeks (26 weeks double blind treatment period followed by a 26-week open-label extension period). The liraglutide dosing was started at 0.6 mg/day during the first week and escalated in weekly increments of 0.6 mg over the following 2-3 weeks. Dose escalation was based on tolerability, as judged by the investigator and on the average of three fasting plasma glucose (FPG) measurements performed by the subject at home on the 3 consecutive days before the dose escalation visit being &gt;6.1 mmol/L (110 mg/dL). Subjects were treated with doses of 0.6, 1.2 or 1.8 after dose escalation. Subjects treated with liraglutide for more than 3 months were asked to return for follow-up visits one and two years after the end of the open label period (after trial drug cessation at week 52).</description>

            <description>After the run-in period, subjects were randomized to receive liraglutide subcutaneous injections once daily (in combination with metformin with or without basal insulin, on a background of diet and exercise) for 52 weeks (26 weeks double blind treatment period followed by a 26-week open-label extension period). The liraglutide dosing was started at 0.6 mg/day during the first week and escalated in weekly increments of 0.6 mg over the following 2-3 weeks. Dose escalation was based on tolerability, as judged by the investigator and on the average of three fasting plasma glucose (FPG) measurements performed by the subject at home on the 3 consecutive days before the dose escalation visit being &gt;6.1 mmol/L (110 mg/dL). Subjects were treated with doses of 0.6, 1.2 or 1.8 after dose escalation. Subjects treated with liraglutide for more than 3 months were asked to return for follow-up visits one and two years after the end of the open label period (after trial drug cessation at week 52).</description>

            <description>After the run-in period, subjects were randomized to receive liraglutide subcutaneous injections once daily (in combination with metformin with or without basal insulin, on a background of diet and exercise) for 52 weeks (26 weeks double blind treatment period followed by a 26-week open-label extension period). The liraglutide dosing was started at 0.6 mg/day during the first week and escalated in weekly increments of 0.6 mg over the following 2-3 weeks. Dose escalation was based on tolerability, as judged by the investigator and on the average of three fasting plasma glucose (FPG) measurements performed by the subject at home on the 3 consecutive days before the dose escalation visit being &gt;6.1 mmol/L (110 mg/dL). Subjects were treated with doses of 0.6, 1.2 or 1.8 after dose escalation. Subjects treated with liraglutide for more than 3 months were asked to return for follow-up visits one and two years after the end of the open label period (after trial drug cessation at week 52).</description>

The liraglutide dosing was started at 0.6 mg/day during the first week and escalated in weekly increments of 0.6 mg over the following 2-3 weeks. Dose escalation was based on tolerability, as judged by the investigator and on the average of three fasting plasma glucose (FPG) measurements performed by the subject at home on the 3 consecutive days before the dose escalation visit being &gt;6.1 mmol/L (110 mg/dL). Subjects were treated with doses of 0.6, 1.2 or 1.8 after dose escalation. Subjects treated with liraglutide for more than 3 months were asked to return for follow-up visits one and two years after the end of the open label period (after trial drug cessation at week 52).</description>

For each subject, a standard deviation score Z (SDS) was calculated based on age and sex referring to the values L, M and S. The method is described in the WHO Multicentre Growth Reference, which also contains the values for L, M and S by age and sex. For Z (SDS) scores below −3 and above 3, the score was adjusted as described in the WHO instruction.

Subjects treated with liraglutide for more than 3 months were asked to return for follow-up visits one and two years after the end of the open label period (after trial drug cessation at week 52).</description>

            <description>After the run-in period, subjects were randomized to receive placebo (in combination with metformin with or without basal insulin, on a background of diet and exercise) for a 26 weeks double blind treatment period. The liraglutide placebo was administered once daily subcutaneously in equivalent volume as liraglutide. After 26 weeks, participants discontinued placebo and continued treatment with metformin (with or without basal insulin) during the open-label period.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Height SDS</title>
          <description>Change in height SDS from baseline to week 52. Height SDS was calculated using the following formula: Z=[(value /M)^L - 1] / S*L; where L, M and S are median (M), skewness (L) and variation coefficient (S) of children/adolescents' height provided for each sex and age. For each subject, a standard deviation score Z (SDS) was calculated based on age and sex referring to the values L, M and S. The method is described in the WHO Multicentre Growth Reference, which also contains the values for L, M and S by age and sex. For Z (SDS) scores below −3 and above 3, the score was adjusted as described in the WHO instruction. All available data were used for the analysis including data collected after treatment discontinuation and initiation of rescue medication.</description>

        <description>Growth (i.e., height velocity) is the change in height per year and is measured in cm/year. The height velocity was calculated as the difference between current height and height at baseline (week 0) divided by the time (in days) between those measurement time points and multiplied by 365 days.</description>

            <description>After the run-in period, subjects were randomized to receive liraglutide subcutaneous injections once daily (in combination with metformin with or without basal insulin, on a background of diet and exercise) for 52 weeks (26 weeks double blind treatment period followed by a 26-week open-label extension period). The liraglutide dosing was started at 0.6 mg/day during the first week and escalated in weekly increments of 0.6 mg over the following 2-3 weeks. Dose escalation was based on tolerability, as judged by the investigator and on the average of three fasting plasma glucose (FPG) measurements performed by the subject at home on the 3 consecutive days before the dose escalation visit being &gt;6.1 mmol/L (110 mg/dL). Subjects were treated with doses of 0.6, 1.2 or 1.8 after dose escalation. Subjects treated with liraglutide for more than 3 months were asked to return for follow-up visits one and two years after the end of the open label period (after trial drug cessation at week 52).</description>

The liraglutide placebo was administered once daily subcutaneously in equivalent volume as liraglutide. After 26 weeks, participants discontinued placebo and continued treatment with metformin (with or without basal insulin) during the open-label period.</description>

        <title>Growth (Height Velocity)</title>
        <description>Growth (i.e., height velocity) is the change in height per year and is measured in cm/year. The height velocity was calculated as the difference between current height and height at baseline (week 0) divided by the time (in days) between those measurement time points and multiplied by 365 days.</description>

The liraglutide dosing was started at 0.6 mg/day during the first week and escalated in weekly increments of 0.6 mg over the following 2-3 weeks. Dose escalation was based on tolerability, as judged by the investigator and on the average of three fasting plasma glucose (FPG) measurements performed by the subject at home on the 3 consecutive days before the dose escalation visit being &gt;6.1 mmol/L (110 mg/dL). Subjects were treated with doses of 0.6, 1.2 or 1.8 after dose escalation. Subjects treated with liraglutide for more than 3 months were asked to return for follow-up visits one and two years after the end of the open label period (after trial drug cessation at week 52).</description>

        <title>Height Velocity SDS</title>
        <description>Height velocity SDS scores at week 26. Height velocity is change in height per year. The height velocity was calculated as the difference between current height and height at baseline (week 0) divided by time between those measurement time points and multiplied by 365 days. Height velocity SDS was calculated using following formula: Z=[(value /M)^L - 1] / S*L; where L, M and S are median (M), skewness (L) and variation coefficient (S) of children/adolescents' height provided for each sex and age. For each subject, a standard deviation score Z (SDS) was calculated based on age and sex referring to the values L, M and S. The method is described in the WHO Multicentre Growth Reference, which also contains the values for L, M and S by age and sex. For Z (SDS) scores below −3 and above 3, the score was adjusted as described in the WHO instruction. All available data were used for the analysis including data collected after treatment discontinuation and initiation of rescue medication.</description>

            <description>After the run-in period, subjects were randomized to receive liraglutide subcutaneous injections once daily (in combination with metformin with or without basal insulin, on a background of diet and exercise) for 52 weeks (26 weeks double blind treatment period followed by a 26-week open-label extension period). The liraglutide dosing was started at 0.6 mg/day during the first week and escalated in weekly increments of 0.6 mg over the following 2-3 weeks. Dose escalation was based on tolerability, as judged by the investigator and on the average of three fasting plasma glucose (FPG) measurements performed by the subject at home on the 3 consecutive days before the dose escalation visit being &gt;6.1 mmol/L (110 mg/dL). Subjects were treated with doses of 0.6, 1.2 or 1.8 after dose escalation. Subjects treated with liraglutide for more than 3 months were asked to return for follow-up visits one and two years after the end of the open label period (after trial drug cessation at week 52).</description>

        <title>Height Velocity SDS- Week 104</title>
        <description>The height velocity was calculated as the difference between current height and height at baseline (week 0) divided by time between those measurement time points and multiplied by 365 days. Height velocity SDS was calculated using following formula: Z=[(value /M)^L - 1] / S*L; where L, M and S are median (M), skewness (L) and variation coefficient (S) of children/adolescents' height provided for each sex and age. For each subject, a standard deviation score Z (SDS) was calculated based on age and sex referring to the values L, M and S. The method is described in the WHO Multicentre Growth Reference, which also contains the values for L, M and S by age and sex. For Z (SDS) scores below −3 and above 3, the score was adjusted as described in the WHO instruction. This outcome is applicable only for the Liraglutide 1.8 mg treatment arm.</description>

      <time_frame>Week 0 - 104 All presented AEs are TEAEs. A TEAE was defined as an event that had onset date on or after the first day of exposure to trial product and no later than 7 days after the last day of trial product administration.</time_frame>
      <desc>Adverse events were reported per different reporting groups for treatment period and follow up period. Results are based on SAS which included subjects: who received at least one dose of liraglutide or placebo for &quot;Liraglutide 1.8 mg- Treatment period&quot; and &quot;Placebo&quot; and who received liraglutide for more than 3 months during treatment period (week 0-52) and provided follow-up data anytime during week 53-104 for &quot;Liraglutide 1.8 mg: Follow-up 1&quot;.</desc>

          <description>After the run-in period, subjects were randomized to receive liraglutide subcutaneous injections once daily (in combination with metformin with or without basal insulin, on a background of diet and exercise) for 52 weeks (26 weeks double blind treatment period followed by a 26-week open-label extension period). The liraglutide dosing was started at 0.6 mg/day during the first week and escalated in weekly increments of 0.6 mg over the following 2-3 weeks. Dose escalation was based on tolerability, as judged by the investigator and on the average of three fasting plasma glucose (FPG) measurements performed by the subject at home on the 3 consecutive days before the dose escalation visit being &gt;6.1 mmol/L (110 mg/dL). Subjects were treated with doses of 0.6, 1.2 or 1.8 after dose escalation.</description>

The liraglutide placebo was administered once daily subcutaneously in equivalent volume as liraglutide. After 26 weeks, participants discontinued placebo and continued treatment with metformin (with or without basal insulin) during the open-label period.</description>
