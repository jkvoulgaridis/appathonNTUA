  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this trial is to test if mortality of childhood bacterial meningitis can
      be reduced by slow, continuous infusion of cefotaxime initially, instead of the traditional
      bolus administration four times daily (qid), combined with high-dose paracetamol orally, when
      both treatments are executed for the first 4 days. The series will be collected at Hospital
      Pediátrico David Bernardino, Luanda, Angola.

      The recruitment of patients begins, the conditions permitting, in early 2012. The criteria
      for patient participation is a child at the age of 2 months to 15 years who presents with the
      symptoms and signs suggestive of bacterial meningitis, for whom a lumbar puncture is
      performed, and the cerebrospinal fluid analysis suggests bacterial meningitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The principal objective of the study is to examine if mortality of childhood bacterial
      meningitis can be reduced by slow continuous infusion of cefotaxime combined with high-dose
      paracetamol orally for the first 4 days (instead of the traditional qid administration of
      cefotaxime without concomitant paracetamol). Children qualifying for entry (see criteria
      below), whose guardian has given informed consent,will be randomized into 2 treatment arms
      (see details below)and receive the treatments in a double blind fashion (see details below).
      Primary and secondary outcomes (detailed below) will be evaluated according to predefined
      criteria and time points (see below).

      Results will be analyzed for all patients in ITT datasets and in prespecified subgroups
      (etiology, nutritional status, etc.) in both crude and adjusted analysis. The efficacy
      results will be expressed as OR with 95% confidence intervals.

    <description>Scores on the modified Glasgow Outcome Scale which range from a maximum of 5 (best) to a minimum of 1 (worst) points.
The Glasgow Outcome Scale categorizes the outcome after brain injury into five categories, based on the level and severeness of disability. As hearing impairment is one of the most common sequelae of bacterial meningitis, an assessment of hearing should be included when estimating the grade of disability.
Hearing thresholds (in decibel, dB) were determined by brainstem evoked response audiometry (BERA), for each ear separately.</description>

    <description>Hearing thresholds (in decibel, dB) were determined by brainstem evoked response audiometry (BERA), for each ear separately.

        <title>Status on the Modified Glasgow Outcome Scale</title>
        <description>Scores on the modified Glasgow Outcome Scale which range from a maximum of 5 (best) to a minimum of 1 (worst) points.
The Glasgow Outcome Scale categorizes the outcome after brain injury into five categories, based on the level and severeness of disability. As hearing impairment is one of the most common sequelae of bacterial meningitis, an assessment of hearing should be included when estimating the grade of disability.
Hearing thresholds (in decibel, dB) were determined by brainstem evoked response audiometry (BERA), for each ear separately.</description>
        <time_frame>Examined at discharge from hospital, except for hearing evaluations which were performed at earliest seven days since the institution of treatment, during the hospital stay. The longest hospital stay was 84 days.</time_frame>

          <description>Scores on the modified Glasgow Outcome Scale which range from a maximum of 5 (best) to a minimum of 1 (worst) points.
The Glasgow Outcome Scale categorizes the outcome after brain injury into five categories, based on the level and severeness of disability. As hearing impairment is one of the most common sequelae of bacterial meningitis, an assessment of hearing should be included when estimating the grade of disability.

      <desc>No specific events or findings, a part from the follow up-data detailed in the protocol, were considered as potential adverse events to be registered because both death, serious sequelae, and/or prolonged hospital stay, given as examples of severe adverse events, are part of the possible course of childhood bacterial meningitis, as such.
Deaths and other follow-up data were assessed by attending physician.</desc>

          <title>Infusion With Paracetamol</title>
          <description>Cefotaxime is administered as 12 hourly infusions, together with high dose paracetamol (acetaminophen)
Infusion with paracetamol: The administration of 250 mg/kg/24 hours cefotaxime during the first 4 days as continuous intravenous infusion, each single infusion lasting for 12 hours (to prevent degradation of the agent), combined with high-dose paracetamol orally; the first dose is 30 mg/kg, then 20 mg/kg every 6 hours for 4 full days.</description>

          <description>Cefotaxime is administered as bolus q.i.d. with a placebo of paracetamol
Bolus without paracetamol: The control intervention consists of 250 mg/kg/24 hours cefotaxime administered traditionally with intermittent i.v. boluses and the place bo of paracetamol orally, both repeated every 6 hours (qid) for 4 days.</description>
