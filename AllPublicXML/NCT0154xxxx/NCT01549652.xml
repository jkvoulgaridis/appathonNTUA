  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Opioid medications are commonly used for pain relief. When given over time, physical
      dependence can occur. This results in unpleasant side effects (such as agitation and nausea)
      if opioid medications are suddenly stopped. This study aims to test the use of the drug
      ondansetron to reduce the symptoms associated with opioid withdrawal and to prevent the
      progression of opioid physical dependence, thereby allowing future investigators to better
      test the role of physical dependence in the development of addiction and also possibly
      improving acceptance of abstinence-based programs for addiction.

      This study will be split into two separate investigations, aim 1 and aim 2.

      Study aim 1 (Prevention of Opioid Withdrawal) will investigate whether ondansetron, a
      5HT3-receptor antagonist, can reduce or prevent withdrawal signs and symptoms in patients
      physically dependent on opioids to treat chronic back pain. In this aim, study participants
      will be titrated onto sustained release oral morphine for 30 days after which time they will
      return to the lab to undergo naloxone-induced withdrawal with either 8 mg ondansetron
      pre-treatment (30 min prior to naloxone-induced withdrawal) or placebo. Participants will
      then return to their titrated dose of oral morphine for one week before returning for the
      second study session in which they will receive the opposite pre-treatment (8 mg ondansetron
      or placebo) 30 minutes prior to naloxone-induced withdrawal. Objective opioid withdrawal
      score (OOWS), subjective opioid withdrawal score (SOWS) and Profile of Mood States (POMS)
      will be assessed at baseline and five or seven times during the study sessions at 30 and 37
      days post titration. Beck Depression Inventory, Roland-Morris Questionnaire and State-Trait
      Anxiety Inventory and VAS Pain Score will be assessed at baseline as well as at both study
      sessions (30 and 37 days post titration).

      Study aim 2 (Prevention of Physical Dependence) will investigate whether ondansetron, a 5HT3
      receptor antagonist, can prevent physical dependence in patients taking opioids chronically
      for controlling chronic back pain. Participants will taper onto sustained release oral
      morphine for 10 days then will maintain the effective dose for twenty days (total of 30 days)
      while simultaneously taking 8 mg ondansetron or placebo three times daily with morphine dose.
      After 30 days of morphine plus 8 mg ondansetron or placebo, study participants will return to
      the lab to undergo naloxone-induced withdrawal. OOWS, SOWS, POMS, pain visual analogue scale
      (VAS), Beck Depression Inventory and Roland Morris Disability Index will be administered at
      baseline and at the beginning of each study session (30 days post titration). Furthermore
      OOWS, SOWS and POMS will be administered twice during the first study session and at least
      five times during the second study session (Day 30): at the beginning of the session, after
      IV insertion, and after naloxone-induced opioid withdrawal.

    <measure>Change in Objective Opioid Withdrawal Score (OOWS) From Baseline (Prevention of Opioid Withdrawal)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; 15 minutes following last naloxone dose</time_frame>
    <description>Originally developed by Handelsman, the Objective Opioid Withdrawal Scale (OOWS) score is a well-characterized measure of opioid withdrawal in humans, calculated as the sum of a 13-item physician assessment documenting physically observable signs of withdrawal, which are rated as present (1) or absent (0) during the observation period. The minimum score of 0 means the patient is not showing any signs of opioid withdrawal. The maximum score of 13 signifies all signs of opioid withdrawal to the largest extent possible.
Immediately prior to ondansetron or placebo administration a baseline OOWS score was taken. 30 minutes later participants received naloxone, then 15 minutes later an OOWS score was taken. If deemed necessary by the clinician, participants may have received a second naloxone dose (25 minutes following 1st naloxone dose), then 15 minutes later an OOWS score was taken. Change from the baseline OOWS score to the score assessed following the last naloxone dose is reported.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline; 15 minutes following last naloxone dose</time_frame>
    <description>The Subjective Opioid Withdrawal Score (SOWS) score is calculated as the sum of 16 subjective patient-reported symptom scores rated on a scale of 0 to 4 (0=not at all, 4=extremely) based on what subjects were experiencing at the time of testing. A maximum score of 64 would suggest the patient is experiencing the symptoms of withdrawal to the maximum extent possible while the lowest score of 0 would suggest the patient is not experiencing any of the symptoms of withdrawal. Immediately prior to ondansetron or placebo administration a baseline SOWS score was taken. 30 minutes later participants received naloxone, then 15 minutes later an SOWS score was taken.

    <measure>Profile of Mood States (POMS) Change in Score From Baseline (Prevention of Opioid Withdrawal)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; 15 minutes following last naloxone dose</time_frame>
    <description>Profile of Mood States (POMS) is a 65-question survey of how participants have been feeling over the past week, assessing tension, depression, anger, fatigue, confusion and vigor. Each question is on a 5-point scale: 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely). Overall score range: 0 to 200 (lower scores corresponding to fewer symptoms), calculated by adding total scores for tension, depression, anger, fatigue and confusing, and subtracting that total score from the total score for vigor. Immediately prior to ondansetron or placebo administration a baseline POMS score was taken. 30 minutes later participants received naloxone, then 15 minutes later a POMS score was taken. If necessary (as deemed by the clinician), participants may have received a second naloxone dose (25 minutes following 1st naloxone dose), then 15 minutes later an POMS score was taken.

          <title>Prevention of Opioid Withdrawal-Ondansetron</title>
          <description>Chronic back pain patients titrated onto sustained release oral morphine for 30 days, then were randomized to take either ondansetron 8 mg or matching placebo thirty minutes prior to naloxone-induced withdrawal in clinic (naloxone dose: 0.4 mg/70 kg; if deemed necessary by the clinician to induce withdrawal, a second naloxone dose may be administered at 0.8 mg/70 kg). Participants returned to their titrated morphine dose for one week and then returned for the opposite pre-treatment followed by naloxone-induced withdrawal in clinic. Participants then tapered back to their original dose of morphine for one week.
Data regarding how many participants received ondansetron first versus placebo first are not accessible.</description>

        <title>Change in Objective Opioid Withdrawal Score (OOWS) From Baseline (Prevention of Opioid Withdrawal)</title>
        <description>Originally developed by Handelsman, the Objective Opioid Withdrawal Scale (OOWS) score is a well-characterized measure of opioid withdrawal in humans, calculated as the sum of a 13-item physician assessment documenting physically observable signs of withdrawal, which are rated as present (1) or absent (0) during the observation period. The minimum score of 0 means the patient is not showing any signs of opioid withdrawal. The maximum score of 13 signifies all signs of opioid withdrawal to the largest extent possible.
Immediately prior to ondansetron or placebo administration a baseline OOWS score was taken. 30 minutes later participants received naloxone, then 15 minutes later an OOWS score was taken. If deemed necessary by the clinician, participants may have received a second naloxone dose (25 minutes following 1st naloxone dose), then 15 minutes later an OOWS score was taken. Change from the baseline OOWS score to the score assessed following the last naloxone dose is reported.</description>

Based on the mean observed OOWS score during withdrawal during the placebo session and the variance of that mean score and assuming a paired data analysis and an alpha of 0.05, we found that we had 80% power to detect a treatment effect as low as 25% reduction in OOWS.</groups_desc>

        <title>Change in Subjective Opioid Withdrawal Score (SOWS) From Baseline (Prevention of Opioid Withdrawal)</title>
        <description>The Subjective Opioid Withdrawal Score (SOWS) score is calculated as the sum of 16 subjective patient-reported symptom scores rated on a scale of 0 to 4 (0=not at all, 4=extremely) based on what subjects were experiencing at the time of testing. A maximum score of 64 would suggest the patient is experiencing the symptoms of withdrawal to the maximum extent possible while the lowest score of 0 would suggest the patient is not experiencing any of the symptoms of withdrawal. Immediately prior to ondansetron or placebo administration a baseline SOWS score was taken. 30 minutes later participants received naloxone, then 15 minutes later an SOWS score was taken. If necessary (as deemed by the clinician), participants may have received a second naloxone dose (25 minutes following 1st naloxone dose), then 15 minutes later an SOWS score was taken. Change from the baseline SOWS score to the score assessed following the last naloxone dose is reported</description>

        <title>Profile of Mood States (POMS) Change in Score From Baseline (Prevention of Opioid Withdrawal)</title>
        <description>Profile of Mood States (POMS) is a 65-question survey of how participants have been feeling over the past week, assessing tension, depression, anger, fatigue, confusion and vigor. Each question is on a 5-point scale: 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely). Overall score range: 0 to 200 (lower scores corresponding to fewer symptoms), calculated by adding total scores for tension, depression, anger, fatigue and confusing, and subtracting that total score from the total score for vigor. Immediately prior to ondansetron or placebo administration a baseline POMS score was taken. 30 minutes later participants received naloxone, then 15 minutes later a POMS score was taken. If necessary (as deemed by the clinician), participants may have received a second naloxone dose (25 minutes following 1st naloxone dose), then 15 minutes later an POMS score was taken. Change from the baseline POMS score to the score assessed following the last naloxone dose is reported.</description>

        <title>Change in Objective Opioid Withdrawal Score From Baseline (Prevention of Physical Dependence)</title>
        <description>Originally developed by Handelsman, the OOWS score is a well-characterized measure of opioid withdrawal in humans, calculated as the sum of a 13-item physician assessment documenting physically observable signs of withdrawal, which are rated as present (1) or absent (0) during the observation period. The maximum score is 13 and suggests the patient is showing all signs of opioid withdrawal to the largest extent possible. The minimum score of 0 suggests the patient is not showing any signs of opioid withdrawal.
Immediately prior to ondansetron or placebo administration a baseline OOWS score was taken. 30 minutes later participants received naloxone, then 15 minutes later an OOWS score was taken. If necessary (as deemed by the clinician), participants may have received a second naloxone dose (25 minutes following 1st naloxone dose), then 15 minutes later an OOWS score was taken. Change from the baseline OOWS score to the score assessed following the last naloxone dose is reported.</description>

            <description>Chronic back pain patients titrated onto sustained release oral morphine for 30 days; during morphine treatment, participants were randomized to take either ondansetron 8 mg or matching placebo three times daily along with the oral morphine treatment. After thirty days, participants returned to the lab to undergo naloxone-induced withdrawal in clinic (naloxone dose: 0.4 mg/70 kg; if deemed necessary by the clinician to induce withdrawal, a second naloxone dose may have been administered at 0.8 mg/70 kg). Participants then tapered back to their original dose of morphine for one week.</description>

        <description>(Profile of Mood States) POMS is a 65-question survey of how participants have been feeling over the past week, assessing tension, depression, anger, fatigue, confusion and vigor. Each question is on a 5-point scale: 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely). Overall score range: 0 to 200 (lower scores corresponding to fewer symptoms), calculated by adding total scores for tension, depression, anger, fatigue and confusing, and subtracting that total score from the total score for vigor. Immediately prior to ondansetron or placebo administration a baseline POMS score was taken. 30 minutes later participants received naloxone, then 15 minutes later a POMS score was taken. If necessary (as deemed by the clinician), participants may have received a second naloxone dose (25 minutes following 1st naloxone dose), then 15 minutes later an POMS score was taken. Change from the baseline POMS score to the score assessed following the last naloxone dose is reported.</description>
