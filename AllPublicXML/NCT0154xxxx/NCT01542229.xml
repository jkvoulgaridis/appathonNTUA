  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As in the general population, there is no clear standard of care within Veterans Affairs
      Medical Centers for treating posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among individuals with
      severe mental illness (SMI). This is a considerable issue because trauma, posttraumatic
      stress disorder (PTSD), and severe psychiatric comorbidity are particularly common among
      Veterans and this symptom presentation clearly exacerbates the overall course and severity of
      mental illness. This study is significant in that it proposes to establish the efficacy of a
      frontline exposure based intervention for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), Prolonged
      Exposure, for improving critical clinical, quality of life, and cost outcomes among Veterans
      with severe mental illness (SMI) enrolled in VA healthcare. Collectively, it is anticipated
      that these data will establish a much needed clinical course of action for what is considered
      a vulnerable yet highly underserved patient population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overarching aim of this proposal is to compare the efficacy of Prolonged Exposure for
      posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) plus treatment as usual (PE+TAU) relative to treatment
      as usual (TAU) alone using a randomized, between groups, repeated measures design. One
      hundred fifty six (156) ethnically/racially diverse male and female Veterans with
      posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and severe mental illness (SMI) will be recruited from
      the Charleston VA and affiliated Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs) during the study
      time frame. For the investigators' study purposes, severe mental illness (SMI) is defined as
      (1) the presence of a past year Diagnostic Statistical Manual (DSM-IV) Axis I diagnosis of
      schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder, or severe depression (2) resulting
      in persistent impairment in self-care, work, or social functioning. Veterans will be
      randomized 1:1 to one of two conditions: PE+TAU or TAU. The active intervention phase is 12
      weeks. Veterans randomized to treatment as usual (TAU) will receive support services through
      the VA potentially inclusive of case management, psychotropic medication management, and/or
      supportive counseling and Veterans randomized to prolonged exposure (PE) plus treatment as
      usual (TAU) will receive 12 weekly sessions of prolonged exposure (PE) in addition to
      treatment as usual (TAU). All participants will be assessed at baseline, 6 weeks,
      post-treatment, and at 3 and 6 months. Additionally, they will complete two self report forms
      during sessions 3, 6, and 9.

    <measure>Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Checklist (PCL)</measure>
    <time_frame>pre to post treatment (12 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The PTSD Checklist (PCL) is a 17-item self-report measure of PTSD symptoms based on DSM-IV criteria. Total scores on the PCL were used, and total scores range from 17 to 85 with higher scores indicative of greater PTSD severity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinician Administered Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Scale (CAPS)</measure>
    <time_frame>pre to post treatment (12 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinician Administered PTSD (Posttraumatic Stress Disorder; PTSD) Scale (CAPS) is a 30-item structured interview that corresponds to DSM-IV criteria for PTSD. The CAPS can be used to make a current (past month) or lifetime diagnosis of PTSD or to assess symptoms over the past week/month. The CAPS was used to measure current PTSD (yes/no diagnosis) as well as total PTSD severity (scores range 0-136, with higher scores indicative of more severe PTSD).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II)</measure>
    <time_frame>pre to post treatment (12 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The Beck Depression Inventory-II is a 21 item measure of depressive severity. Total BDI-II scores were used. Scores on the BDI-II range from 0 to 63 with higher scores indicative of greater symptom severity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale-Extended (BPRS-E)</measure>
    <time_frame>pre to post treatment (12 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale-Extended (BPRS-E) is a 24 item measure of psychopathology across several dimensions (i.e., delusions, motor hyperactivity, withdrawal and blunted affect, self-neglect, etc.) and is a commonly used measure for severely and persistently ill patient populations. Total BPRS scores were used and can range from 24 (score of 1 on all items, symptom not present) to 168 (score of 7 on all items, extremely severe).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Veterans SF 12 Health Survey (SF-12)</measure>
    <time_frame>pre to post treatment (12 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The Veterans SF 12 Health Survey (SF-12) is a valid and reliable instrument to measure quality of life and/or functional status in Veterans. The SF-12 was used to track changes in general mental [MCS mental component score) and physical health (PCS physical component score) functioning. Scores on the SF-12 scales range from 0 to 100 once converted and higher scores are indicative of better mental and physical health. The MCS score was used in the current analyses.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pittsburgh Seep Quality Index</measure>
    <time_frame>pre to post treatment (12 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is a 19-item commonly used and well validated self-report measure of sleep quality and disturbance. Scores on the PSQI range from 0 to 21, with ratings of 5 or higher indicative of poor sleep quality. Item 9, assessing overall quality of sleep, was used in current analyses. Scores on this item range from 0 to 3, with higher scores indicative of worse sleep quality.</description>

        <description>The Clinician Administered PTSD (Posttraumatic Stress Disorder; PTSD) Scale (CAPS) is a 30-item structured interview that corresponds to DSM-IV criteria for PTSD. The CAPS can be used to make a current (past month) or lifetime diagnosis of PTSD or to assess symptoms over the past week/month. The CAPS was used to measure current PTSD (yes/no diagnosis) as well as total PTSD severity (scores range 0-136, with higher scores indicative of more severe PTSD).</description>

Scores on the SF-12 scales range from 0 to 100 once converted and higher scores are indicative of better mental and physical health. The MCS score was used in the current analyses.</description>

        <description>The Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D) is a 17, 21, or 24 item measure of depression severity. In the 17-item version, which was used, nine of the items are scored on a five-point scale, ranging from 0 to 4; and 8 of the items are scored on a 3-point scale, ranging from 0 to 2. Total scores on the HAM-D are summed and range from 0-53 with higher scores reflective of more severe depressive symptoms.</description>

It yields a total score as well as 6 scale scores: Non-acceptance of emotional responses; Difficulties engaging in goal directed behavior; Impulse control difficulties; Lack of emotional awareness; Limited access to emotion regulation strategies; and Lack of emotional clarity. Item scores range from 1 &quot;almost never&quot; to 5 &quot;almost always&quot; with total summed scores ranging from 36 to 180, and higher scores reflective of greater emotion regulation difficulties.</description>

The scale has 11 items and is based on the patient's subjective report of his or her clinical condition. Additional information is based upon clinical observations made during the course of the clinical interview. There are four items that are graded on a 0 to 8 scale (irritability, speech, thought content, and disruptive/aggressive behavior), while the remaining seven items are graded on a 0 to 4 scale. Scores range from 0 to 60 and are summed with higher scores reflective of higher symptom severity.</description>
