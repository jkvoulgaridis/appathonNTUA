    <textblock>
      The main research question of the study is whether a family-based, life-skills focused
      psychosocial intervention is effective in reducing psychological distress and stigma and
      improving inter-personal relations and functioning among war-affected children in the
      Democratic Republic of Congo.

    <measure>Reduction in Post-traumatic Stress Reaction Symptoms Among Participants</measure>
    <time_frame>1-week before intervention, 3-weeks later</time_frame>
    <description>To assess post-traumatic stress reaction symptoms the 8-item Impact of Events Scale (CRIES-8) was used (Yule, 1997). Respondents indicating how frequently they experience a symptom on a 4-point Likert scale (0, 1, 2, 3). Thus the minimum score was 0 while the maximum score was 24. A high score indicates a high level of post-traumatic stress symptoms. This 8-item CRIES, which was designed for children over 7 years of age, has an identical factor structure to the 22-item version (Yule, 1997) which was previously validated with a sample of 1,046 war-affected adolescents in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (Mels, Derluyn, Broekaert &amp; Rosseel, 2010) (internal reliability range: 0·79 to 0·84; Cronbach's alpha for the total scale: 0·93). In the current study, internal consistency was 0·557.</description>

    <measure>African Youth Psychosocial Assessment Inventory - Depression and Anxiety Subscales</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-intervention, 3 weeks later</time_frame>
    <description>Internalising symptoms were assessed using the African Youth Psychosocial Assessment Instrument (AYPA) (Betancourt et al., 2009).This 17 item Likert (0 = minimum, 51 = maximum) measure was developed in northern Uganda after extensive qualitative consultation with young people, caregivers and mental health workers. A high score on the AYPA indicates a high level of internalizing symptoms. It is the only African developed, validated questionnaire available, had been used in separate studies with war-affected children in the DR Congo (McMullen et al., 2013; O'Callaghan, McMullen, Shannon, Rafferty &amp; Black; 2013) and includes symptoms of distress which do not appear in Western-developed measures (e.g. muttering to oneself, feeling pain in your heart, sitting with your head in your hand etc.). Test-retest reliability (carried out with a subset of 30 participants) for the AYPA was 0·91, inter-rater reliability was 0·58 (n = 26) and internal consistency was 0·787 (internalising symptoms).</description>

Respondents indicating how frequently they experience a symptom on a 4-point Likert scale (0, 1, 2, 3). Thus the minimum score was 0 while the maximum score was 24. A high score indicates a high level of post-traumatic stress symptoms. This 8-item CRIES, which was designed for children over 7 years of age, has an identical factor structure to the 22-item version (Yule, 1997) which was previously validated with a sample of 1,046 war-affected adolescents in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (Mels, Derluyn, Broekaert &amp; Rosseel, 2010) (internal reliability range: 0·79 to 0·84; Cronbach's alpha for the total scale: 0·93).

          <title>African Youth Psychosocial Assessment Inventory - Depression and Anxiety Subscales</title>
          <description>Internalising symptoms were assessed using the African Youth Psychosocial Assessment Instrument (AYPA) (Betancourt et al., 2009).This 17 item Likert (0 = minimum, 51 = maximum) measure was developed in northern Uganda after extensive qualitative consultation with young people, caregivers and mental health workers. A high score on the AYPA indicates a high level of internalizing symptoms. It is the only African developed, validated questionnaire available, had been used in separate studies with war-affected children in the DR Congo (McMullen et al., 2013; O'Callaghan, McMullen, Shannon, Rafferty &amp; Black; 2013) and includes symptoms of distress which do not appear in Western-developed measures (e.g. muttering to oneself, feeling pain in your heart, sitting with your head in your hand etc.). Test-retest reliability (carried out with a subset of 30 participants) for the AYPA was 0·91, inter-rater reliability was 0·58 (n = 26) and internal consistency was 0·787 (internalising symptoms).</description>

    <reported_events>
      <time_frame>Participants were informally monitored (through thrice weekly check-ins with the village leaders who were supporting the intervention) to ensure that the study intervention was not causing harm or resulting in Adverse Events for people in either the intervention or waiting-list control group. No Adverse Events were reported to the team during the duration of the study or in the study month follow-up.</time_frame>
      <desc>Although all participants faces a real and concerning threat of abduction by rebel units operating in the area, during the study no abductions of participants took place and the two villages where the interventions occurred were not attacked. It must also be stated that although these were Serious Adverse Risks being faced by participants these risks were not created by the study and participants were free to leave their villages at any time, should they feel that this was necessary.</desc>
