  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if everolimus combined with reduced exposure CNI
      (TAC) is efficacious and safe and will support corticosteroid elimination compared to a
      standard exposure CNI (TAC) + MMF + steroid regimen after paediatric kidney transplantation.
      An additional purpose of the study is to assess the effect of the combination of EVR and
      reduced exposure CNI (TAC) on renal function.

      This study is part of the requirements of the Paediatric Investigational Plan approved by
      Paediatric Committee at the European Medicines Agency (PDCO/EMA) on September 10, 2010, and
      is intended to support the indication of everolimus in the prevention of acute rejection in
      paediatric recipients of a renal transplant.

    <description>Evaluation of the potential effects upon the bone growth. The Z-score is a statistical tool which helps to assess data (here child growth parameters) relative to a reference or standard population. The Z-score describes the distance and direction of an observation away from the population median (or mean, however, here the median was used). A negative Z-score shows that data are lower than the median of the standard population, a positive Z-score shows that data are higher than the median of the standard population, and a Z-score of zero shows that the data are equal to the median of the standard population. The more the Z-score is distant from 0, the more expressed is for example underweight or overweight.</description>

          5. Patients who are treated with drugs that are strong inducers or inhibitors of
             cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and can not discontinue the treatment (see Appendix 6 for
             list of medications).

          6. Patients with nephrotic range proteinuria (protein to creatinine ratio ≥2.0 mg/mg or

        <description>Evaluation of the potential effects upon the bone growth. The Z-score is a statistical tool which helps to assess data (here child growth parameters) relative to a reference or standard population. The Z-score describes the distance and direction of an observation away from the population median (or mean, however, here the median was used). A negative Z-score shows that data are lower than the median of the standard population, a positive Z-score shows that data are higher than the median of the standard population, and a Z-score of zero shows that the data are equal to the median of the standard population. The more the Z-score is distant from 0, the more expressed is for example underweight or overweight.</description>

          <description>Evaluation of the potential effects upon the bone growth. The Z-score is a statistical tool which helps to assess data (here child growth parameters) relative to a reference or standard population. The Z-score describes the distance and direction of an observation away from the population median (or mean, however, here the median was used). A negative Z-score shows that data are lower than the median of the standard population, a positive Z-score shows that data are higher than the median of the standard population, and a Z-score of zero shows that the data are equal to the median of the standard population. The more the Z-score is distant from 0, the more expressed is for example underweight or overweight.</description>
