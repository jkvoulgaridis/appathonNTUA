    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) Score at Week 12- Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The EASI score was used to measure the severity and extent of AD and measured erythema, infiltration, excoriation and lichenification on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper and lower extremities. The total EASI score ranges from 0 (minimum) to 72 (maximum) points, with the higher scores reflecting the worse severity of AD. The efficacy data were set to be missing after use of rescue medication and after early termination visit for participants who prematurely discontinued study treatment. All missing values were imputed by LOCF.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) Score of &quot;0&quot; or &quot;1&quot; at Week 12- LOCF</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>IGA is an assessment scale used to determine severity of AD and clinical response to treatment on a 5-point scale (0 = clear; 1 = almost clear; 2 = mild; 3 = moderate; 4 = severe) based on erythema and papulation/infiltration. Therapeutic response is an IGA score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear). The efficacy data were set to be missing after use of rescue medication and after early termination visit for participants who prematurely discontinued study treatment. All missing values were imputed by LOCF.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved at Least a 50% Reduction From Baseline in the EASI Score (EASI-50) at Week 12- LOCF</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The EASI score was used to measure the severity and extent of AD and measured erythema, infiltration, excoriation and lichenification on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper and lower extremities. The total EASI score ranges from 0 (minimum) to 72 (maximum) points, with the higher scores reflecting the worse severity of AD. EASI-50 responders were the participants who achieved ≥50% overall improvement in EASI score from baseline to Week 12. The efficacy data were set to be missing after use of rescue medication and after early termination visit for participants who prematurely discontinued study treatment. All missing values were imputed by LOCF.</description>

    <description>IGA is an assessment scale used to determine severity of AD and clinical response to treatment on a 5-point scale (0 = clear; 1 = almost clear; 2 = mild; 3 = moderate; 4 = severe) based on erythema and papulation/infiltration.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Percent Body Surface Area (BSA) Affected by Atopic Dermatitis (AD) at Week 12 - LOCF</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>BSA affected by AD was assessed for each section of the body (the possible highest score for each region was: head and neck [9%], anterior trunk [18%], back [18%], upper limbs [18%], lower limbs [36%], and genitals [1%]). It was reported as a percentage of all major body sections combined. The efficacy data were set to be missing after use of rescue medication and after early termination visit for participants who prematurely discontinued study treatment. All missing values were imputed by LOCF.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Scoring Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) Score at Week 12- LOCF</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>SCORAD is a clinical tool for assessing the severity of AD developed by the European Task Force on Atopic Dermatitis (Severity scoring of atopic dermatitis: the SCORAD index). Consensus Report of the European Task Force on Atopic Dermatitis. Dermatology (Basel) 186 (1): 23-31. 1993. Extent and intensity of eczema as well as subjective signs (insomnia, etc.) are assessed and scored. Total score ranges from 0 (absent disease) to 103 (severe disease). The efficacy data were set to be missing after use of rescue medication and after early termination visit for participants who prematurely discontinued study treatment. All missing values were imputed by LOCF.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) to Week 12- LOCF</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Pruritus NRS was an assessment tool that was used to report the intensity of a participant's pruritus (itch), both maximum and average intensity, during a 24-hour recall period. Participants were asked the following question: how would a participant rate his itch at the worst moment during the previous 24 hours (for maximum itch intensity on a scale of 0 - 10 [0 = no itch; 10 = worst itch imaginable]). The efficacy data were set to be missing after use of rescue medication and after early termination visit for participants who prematurely discontinued study treatment. All missing values were imputed by LOCF.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in 5-D Pruritus Scale at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The 5-D Pruritus Scale is a 1-page, 5-question tool used in clinical trials to assess 5 dimensions of background itch: degree, duration, direction, disability, and distribution. Each question corresponds to 1 of the 5 dimensions of itch; participants were to rate their symptoms over the preceding 2-week period on a 1 to 5 scale, with 5 being the most affected. After the summation of individual score, the total score ranges from 5 (least affected) to 25 (most affected).</description>

Each question corresponds to 1 of the 5 dimensions of itch; participants were to rate their symptoms over the preceding 2-week period on a 1 to 5 scale, with 5 being the most affected. After the summation of individual score, the total score ranges from 5 (least affected) to 25 (most affected).</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved at Least a 50% Reduction From Baseline in the EASI Score (EASI-50) at Week 12- LOCF</title>
          <description>The EASI score was used to measure the severity and extent of AD and measured erythema, infiltration, excoriation and lichenification on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper and lower extremities. The total EASI score ranges from 0 (minimum) to 72 (maximum) points, with the higher scores reflecting the worse severity of AD. EASI-50 responders were the participants who achieved ≥50% overall improvement in EASI score from baseline to Week 12. The efficacy data were set to be missing after use of rescue medication and after early termination visit for participants who prematurely discontinued study treatment. All missing values were imputed by LOCF.</description>

Participants were asked the following question: how would a participant rate his itch at the worst moment during the previous 24 hours (for maximum itch intensity on a scale of 0 - 10 [0 = no itch; 10 = worst itch imaginable]). The efficacy data were set to be missing after use of rescue medication and after early termination visit for participants who prematurely discontinued study treatment.
