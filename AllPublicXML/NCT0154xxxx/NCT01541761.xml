  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness of a primary
      care, family-centered child obesity prevention program beginning in pregnancy and continuing
      throughout the first three years of life compared to routine standard of care. The study aims
      to reduce the prevalence of obesity at age three, improve child diet composition and healthy
      lifestyle behaviors. Pregnant women will be enrolled from a large urban medical center
      serving primarily low-income immigrant Latino families. The intervention &quot;Starting Early&quot;
      will consist of three components. 1) Family Groups: interactive groups coordinated with the
      child's primary care visits and led by a Nutritionist/ Child Developmental Specialist. 2)
      Nutritional Video: a culturally-specific bilingual early nutrition video will be incorporated
      into family group discussions. 3) Plain Language Handouts: given to reinforce the curriculum
      from the family groups.

      The proposed research included in the funding continuation is titled: &quot;Starting Early:
      Expansion of a Primary Care-Based Early Child Obesity Prevention Program&quot;. It adds three
      major components to the current project: 1) Following the original Starting Early cohort
      until age 5; 2) Developing and piloting an extended Starting Early preschool intervention for
      children aged 3-5 years.; 3) Developing and piloting an extended Starting Early prenatal
      intervention for women in the 1st trimester of pregnancy. A new cohort of 200 women in the
      first trimester of pregnancy will be recruited for the prenatal intervention; all women will
      receive the intervention in this feasibility trial.

      Hypothesis: Compared to controls, the intervention group will show reduced obesity and
      improved parent feeding knowledge and increased healthy feeding attitudes, styles and
      practices

      Expected outcomes include: (1) Reduction in the prevalence and degree of obesity. (2)
      Improvement in child diet composition. (3) Improvement in parent feeding knowledge,
      attitudes, styles and practices including. (4) Improvement in lifestyle behaviors, such as
      sleep, screen time and physical activity, associated with increased risk of obesity. (5)
      Improvement in parent diet.

      Our secondary objective is to understand the mechanisms by which changes in parent knowledge
      and behavioral factors mediate impacts of the intervention on childhood obesity. We will also
      study relationships between potential moderators and intervention impacts. The new components
      of the expanded Starting Early Program will be feasible: Families will participate in the
      preschool intervention, and pregnant women will enroll in the prenatal intervention.
