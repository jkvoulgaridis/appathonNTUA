  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial designed to assess the efficacy of a novel smartphone
      application as an automated reminder tool in improving the quality of bowel preparation for
      patients undergoing outpatient colonoscopies. The investigators will be comparing the
      smartphone application to traditional instructions for bowel preparation. The quality of
      bowel preparation will be assessed using the Ottawa and Aronchick bowel preparation scales.

      This is a randomized controlled trial designed to assess the efficacy of a novel smartphone
      application as an automated reminder tool in improving the quality of bowel preparation for
      patients undergoing outpatient colonoscopies at an academic teaching hospital in Kingston,
      Ontario.

      The intervention under investigation is the use of a novel smart phone application which
      serves as an automated reminder system for patients undergoing outpatient colonoscopies. The
      application requires the patients to enter the date and time of the colonoscopy appointment
      and automatically populates the patients' phones with calendar reminders as well as
      pre-recorded messages regarding cessation of solid food intake, the need for clear fluid
      intake, as well as timing of their bowel regimens starting 7 days prior.

      The design of this study is a prospective, randomized controlled trial with single blinding
      (endoscopist). Eligible participants will be randomized into either the control (routine
      paper instructions) or the intervention group (smart phone application). Those who are
      randomized into the intervention group will be provided with specific instructions to
      download and setup the smart phone application at least 7 days prior to their scheduled
      appointment. Upon arrival to their appointment, participants in both groups will be asked to
      complete a survey confirming the adherence to either paper instructions or instructions
      provided by the smart phone application.

      The primary outcome of this study is the adequacy of the bowel preparation, as assessed by
      using the Ottawa and Aronchick bowel preparation scales, which have been previously validated
      and are in common usage for colonoscopy procedures. Secondary outcomes include rate of polyp
      detection, rate of cecal intubation, and patient reported ease of use and adherence to the
      bowel regimen instructions.
