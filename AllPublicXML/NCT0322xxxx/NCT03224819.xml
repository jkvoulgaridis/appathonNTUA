    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human, open-label, phase 1, sequential dose escalation study. AMG 673 will
      be evaluated as a short term intravenous (IV) infusion in adult subjects with
      relapsed/refractory AML. The study will be conducted at approximately 7 sites in the United
      States, Australia and Germany.

In general, Amgen does not grant external requests for individual patient data for the purpose of re-evaluating safety and efficacy issues already addressed in the product labelling. Requests are reviewed by a committee of internal advisors. If not approved, a Data Sharing Independent Review Panel will arbitrate and make the final decision. Upon approval, information necessary to address the research question will be provided under the terms of a data sharing agreement.
