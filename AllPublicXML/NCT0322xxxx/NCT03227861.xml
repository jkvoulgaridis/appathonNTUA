Events with Grade 3 or higher (3=Severe; 4=life-threatening; 5=fatal) are events that significantly interrupt usual daily activity, require systemic drug therapy/other treatment and are, in many situations, considered unacceptable or intolerable events.</description>

Investigator reviewed antiretroviral screening/baseline resistance data at Week 4, depending on availability of screening/baseline HIV genotypic drug resistance testing results from central laboratory. Participants who do not show full sensitivity to all drugs in the fixed-dose combination (FDC) study regimen according to the susceptibility assessment in the Genosure Prime report will be contacted to return to study site for early study treatment discontinuation (ESTD). Participants with identified resistance to lamivudine/Emtricitabine, attributed to the presence of the M184I/V mutation alone will be permitted to remain in the study.</description>

The HIVTSQ items are summed up to produce a treatment satisfaction score (0 to 60) and an individual satisfaction rating for each item (0 to 6). The higher the score, the greater the treatment satisfaction.</description>
