    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, pilot trial to test the safety and efficacy of transplantation of
      hearts from HCV seropositive non-viremic (HCV Ab+/NAT-) and HCV seropositive viremic (HCV
      Ab+/NAT+) donors to HCV seronegative recipients on the heart transplant waitlist. Treatment
      and prophylaxis will be administered, using a transmission-triggered approach for the first
      scenario (HCV Ab+/NAT- donors, arm 1) and a prophylaxis approach for the later scenario (HCV
      Ab+/NAT+ donors, arm 2).

      This is a prospective, single center, pilot, open-label study of transplantation of hearts of
      HCVAb+ donors to HCVAb- recipients with subsequent therapy with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir
      (Epclusa®). Recipients of a heart from HCVAb+/NAT- donors is ARM 1 or the
      transmission-triggered arm of the study. In this arm, the study will monitor transmission of
      HCV by measuring HCV RNA in heart transplant recipients. If HCV RNA is detected, indicating
      transmission of HCV, recipients will be treated with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir (Epclusa®) for 12
      weeks. Virological response will be assessed at 4 weeks, end of treatment and 12 weeks after
      completion of therapy.

      Recipients of a heart from HCVAb+/NAT+ donors will be in ARM 2 or the prophylaxis arm of the
      study. In this arm, patients will be started on a 12-week course of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir
      (Epclusa®) on post-operative day 1 and will undergo close monitoring of HCV RNA for evidence
      of transmission as well as monitoring of adverse events from therapy.

    <description>HCV seropositive non-viremic (HCV Ab+/NAT-) donor hearts to HCV seronegative recipients.
Heart recipients will be monitored for HCV for one year following transplant. When HCV RNA is detected, the transmission-triggered treatment phase will be initiated.
Recipients will be treated with 12-week oral course of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir (Epclusa®), a fixed-dose combination of a nucleotide analogue HCV NS5B polymerase inhibitor (sofosbuvir - 400mg) and a NS5A inhibitor (velpatasvir - 100mg).
