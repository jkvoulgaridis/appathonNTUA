  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, 5-visit, partial subject masked, 2x3 bilateral crossover,
      dispensing clinical trial. During the study, each test article will be worn in a daily wear
      modality for at least 6 hours per day and 5 days per week for approximately 2 weeks each. The
      subject will wear either the Test or Control article twice and the other study article once.
      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate that the Test lens works as well, if
      not better compared to the Control lens with respect to CLUE (Contact Lens User Experience)
      comfort, Slit Lamp findings, and Distance Monocular logMAR Visual Acuity. This study will
      also aim to show acceptable lens fit for subjects wearing the Test lens.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Comfort</measure>
    <time_frame>2-Week Follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Overall comfort was assessed using the Contact Lens User Experience™ (CLUE) questionnaire. CLUE is a validated patient-reported outcomes (PRO) questionnaire to assess patient-experience attributes of soft contact lenses (comfort, vision, handling, and packaging) in a contact-lens wearing population in the US, ages 18-65. Derived CLUE scores using Item Response Theory (IRT) follow a normal distribution with a population average score of 60 (SD 20), where higher scores indicate a more favorable/positive response with a range of 0-120. The average comfort score from the 3 study periods was reported.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Distance Monocular LogMAR Visual Acuity</measure>
    <time_frame>2-Week Follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Distance Monocular LogMAR visual acuity was assessed at 4 meters using an ETDRS chart at the 2-week follow-up for each subject eye during each of the three study periods. The average visual acuity for each lens type from the 3 study periods was reported.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Contact Lens Fitting Acceptance Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2-Week Follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Contact lens fitting acceptance was assessed for each subject eye using a biomicroscope at post lens insertion and the 2-week follow-up. Lens fit was a binary variable where acceptable lens fit=1 and unacceptable lens fit=0. The proportion of eyes with acceptable lens fit was reported for each lens. The lens fit acceptance rate for both post lens fitting at the 2-week follow-up was reported for each lens type.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Grade 3 or Higher Slit Lamp Findings</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2-Week Follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Slit Lamp Findings (SLF) were assessed using a biomicroscope and was graded using the FDA grading scale (Grade: 0, 1,2, 3 and 4) with grade 0 represents the absence of findings and 1 to 4 representing successively worse findings (i.e. Grade 1 = trace, Grade 2 = Mild, Grade 3 = moderate and Grade 4 = severe). This was performed on each subject eye at every study visit (baseline, unscheduled visits and 2-week follow-up). The data was then dichotomized into two groups. Those with grade 3 or higher and those with grade 2 or lower. The number of SLF with grade 3 or higher by lens was reported.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Quality of Vision</measure>
    <time_frame>2-Week Follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Overall quality of vision was assessed using the Contact Lens User Experience™ (CLUE) questionnaire. CLUE is a validated patient-reported outcomes (PRO) questionnaire to assess patient-experience attributes of soft contact lenses (comfort, vision, handling, and packaging) in a contact-lens wearing population in the US, ages 18-65. Derived CLUE scores using Item Response Theory (IRT) follow a normal distribution with a population average score of 60 (SD 20), where higher scores indicate a more favorable/positive response with a range of 0-120. The average vision score from the 3 study periods was reported.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Handling</measure>
    <time_frame>2-Week Follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Overall Handling was assessed using the Contact Lens User Experience™ (CLUE) questionnaire. CLUE is a validated patient-reported outcomes (PRO) questionnaire to assess patient-experience attributes of soft contact lenses (comfort, vision, handling, and packaging) in a contact-lens wearing population in the US, ages 18-65.

        <title>Overall Comfort</title>
        <description>Overall comfort was assessed using the Contact Lens User Experience™ (CLUE) questionnaire. CLUE is a validated patient-reported outcomes (PRO) questionnaire to assess patient-experience attributes of soft contact lenses (comfort, vision, handling, and packaging) in a contact-lens wearing population in the US, ages 18-65. Derived CLUE scores using Item Response Theory (IRT) follow a normal distribution with a population average score of 60 (SD 20), where higher scores indicate a more favorable/positive response with a range of 0-120. The average comfort score from the 3 study periods was reported.</description>

        <title>Number of Grade 3 or Higher Slit Lamp Findings</title>
        <description>Slit Lamp Findings (SLF) were assessed using a biomicroscope and was graded using the FDA grading scale (Grade: 0, 1,2, 3 and 4) with grade 0 represents the absence of findings and 1 to 4 representing successively worse findings (i.e. Grade 1 = trace, Grade 2 = Mild, Grade 3 = moderate and Grade 4 = severe). This was performed on each subject eye at every study visit (baseline, unscheduled visits and 2-week follow-up). The data was then dichotomized into two groups. Those with grade 3 or higher and those with grade 2 or lower. The number of SLF with grade 3 or higher by lens was reported.</description>

        <title>Overall Quality of Vision</title>
        <description>Overall quality of vision was assessed using the Contact Lens User Experience™ (CLUE) questionnaire. CLUE is a validated patient-reported outcomes (PRO) questionnaire to assess patient-experience attributes of soft contact lenses (comfort, vision, handling, and packaging) in a contact-lens wearing population in the US, ages 18-65. Derived CLUE scores using Item Response Theory (IRT) follow a normal distribution with a population average score of 60 (SD 20), where higher scores indicate a more favorable/positive response with a range of 0-120. The average vision score from the 3 study periods was reported.</description>
