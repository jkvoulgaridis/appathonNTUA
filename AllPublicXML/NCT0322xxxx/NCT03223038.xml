  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-site study of how nutrition is delivered to critically ill patients in
      pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) around the world. Each site will include mechanically
      ventilated children in their respective PICUs and record the details of what type and amount
      of nutrition was received. These details will be compared to goals designated by the
      clinicians caring for each patient. Data will be entered in a secure online remote data
      capture tool and managed by the lead researchers in Pediatric Critical Care Nutrition at
      Boston Children's Hospital, Nilesh Mehta, MD and Lori Bechard, PhD, RD. Data will be analyzed
      to better understand how different types and amounts of nutrition impact important PICU
      outcomes such as length of stay, ventilator time, incidence of infections, and mortality.

      Specific aim 1: To examine the impact of energy and protein adequacy on clinical outcomes.

      Specific aim 2: To describe world-wide patterns of nutritional therapies in the
      PICU.environment: use of guidelines/use of adjuncts (acid suppression, motility,
      etc.)/glycemic control strategy/etc. To describe these practices in subgroups of: cardiac,
      surgical, medical, oncology/stem cell transplant patients in the PICU.

      Specific aim 3: To examine enteral nutrition practices, including timing, route (gastric vs.
      post pyloric), adjuncts, and enteral nutrition (EN) intolerance definitions, in PICU patients
      worldwide Specific aim 4: To examine the current practices around parenteral nutrition
      prescription during the first week of critical illness in the PICU; time of initiation (early
      vs. late), rationale, threshold for initiation.

      Primary predictor: nutritional adequacy (energy, protein) Secondary predictors: nutritional
      status, use of guidelines/site level indicators (location, staffing), use of adjuncts (acid
      suppression, motility, etc.), EN intolerance, subgroups (cardiac, surgical, medical,
      oncology/stem cell transplant), EN route/timing
