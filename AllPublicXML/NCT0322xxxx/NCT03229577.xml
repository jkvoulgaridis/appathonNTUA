  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Yale College Emotional Intelligence project aims to highlight the beneficial impact of
      wellness programs for Yale students. The investigators will examine the benefits of 3
      empirically-validated programs (Emotional Intelligence, Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction
      (MBSR) &amp; SKY Yoga Breathing) for Yale students on measures of general well-being (e.g.
      perceived stress, gratitude etc). The study will also include a no-treatment control group as
      a comparative measure to the well-being programs. The goal of the study is to show how each
      program benefits student well-being over time. Pre-intervention and post-intervention data
      will be collected. The hypothesis is that all 3 workshops will decrease stress and improve
      well-being and that the manner in which each workshop will do so may be different (e.g. MBSR
      will benefit student well-being by increasing mindfulness and self-compassion whereas
      Emotional Intelligence may benefit student well-being by improving cognitive emotion
      regulation). Given the current state of mental health challenges and stress on college
      campuses, the goal of this randomized-controlled trial is to strengthen the literature on
      wellness programs for students and to show that student well-being can significantly increase
      through effective interventions.

    <measure>Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire Short Form</measure>
    <time_frame>11 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The MASQ-Short contains 30 questions with three subscales that measure: general distress, depressive symptoms, and anxious symptoms. All individual items are rated on a scale 1 to 5, where 1 indicates the individual has not felt this way at all during the past week and 5 indicates that they have felt this way extremely. The total possible score for the scale is 150 and the minimum is 30. The three sub scales are totaled together to create the total score (each contains 10 questions). The minimum and maximum scores for the subscales are 10 and 50 respectively.</description>
