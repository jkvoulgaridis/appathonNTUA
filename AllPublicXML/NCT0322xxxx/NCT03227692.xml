      The purpose of this study is to compare the accuracy of knee component alignment between
      patients operated with iASSIST Knee (Investigational group) versus patients operated without
      iASSIST Knee (Control group) using the same implant system.

      Objective： To compare the accuracy of knee component alignment between patients operated with
      iASSIST Knee (Investigational group) versus patients operated without iASSIST Knee (Control
      group) using the same implant system.

      Endpoint： Primary： The alignment accuracy of the knee femoral and tibial components at 6
      months for the investigational group compared to the control group.

      Secondary：Health Status after TKA, Operating Room efficiency and Complication rate after TKA
      for the investigational group compared to the control group.

The pre-operative questions reflect the patient's opinion on the extent to which the patient expects that operation will improve knee pain, and ability to perform activities of daily living and recreational activities. The post-operative questions reflect the extent to which postoperative outcome has met the patient's pre-operative expectations with respect to pain and function.
The score ranges from 3 to 15. Higher score means better outcomes.</description>

          <description>KSS-Patient Expectations is patient-derived score and is a three-question fifteen-point scale that is collected pre-operatively and post-operatively. The pre-operative questions reflect the patient's opinion on the extent to which the patient expects that operation will improve knee pain, and ability to perform activities of daily living and recreational activities. The post-operative questions reflect the extent to which postoperative outcome has met the patient's pre-operative expectations with respect to pain and function.
The score ranges from 3 to 15. Higher score means better outcomes.</description>

        <description>KSS-Patient Expectations is patient-derived score and is a three-question fifteen-point scale that is collected pre-operatively and post-operatively. The pre-operative questions reflect the patient's opinion on the extent to which the patient expects that operation will improve knee pain, and ability to perform activities of daily living and recreational activities. The post-operative questions reflect the extent to which postoperative outcome has met the patient's pre-operative expectations with respect to pain and function.
The score ranges from 3 to 15. Higher score means better outcomes.</description>
