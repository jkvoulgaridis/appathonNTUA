    <textblock>
      Patients who have concussions exhibit an array of symptoms, also known as post-concussive
      symptoms, including headaches, feeling slowed down or foggy and difficulty with
      concentration. This study aims to determine if cranial osteopathy can provide additional or
      expedited symptom relief when accompanying current conventional treatments. The patients will
      be identified through routine clinical contact. If patients are found to be eligible and
      agree to participate, they receive a single session of cranial osteopathy in addition to
      their usual care through the concussion program.

    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Post Concussion Symptom Scale (PCSS) is a scale used to subjectively measure concussion symptoms. The minimum score is 0 and the maximum score is 132 (a maximum score of 6 for 22 items). The higher the value the worse the symptom. Twenty-two possible symptoms are graded and are the following:Headache, Nausea, Vomiting, Balance Problems, Dizziness, Lightheadedness, Fatigue, Trouble falling asleep, Sleeping more than usual, Sleeping less than usual, Drowsiness, Sensitivity to light, Sensitivity to noise, Irritability, Sadness, Nervous/Anxious, Feeling more emotional, Numbness or tingling, Feeling slowed down, Feeling like &quot;in a fog,&quot; Difficulty concentrating, Difficulty remembering, and/or Visual problems. Total score can range from 0 to 132. Units of a scale is used.</description>

          <description>The treatment was performed with the patient lying comfortably in a supine position. The examiner’s hand was initially placed at the occipito-atlantal junction of the top of the cervical spine to evaluate for fascial restrictions. Any palpated restrictions were released using a technique of myofascial release, where no passive or active range of motion was performed to the cervical region. Once the occipito-atlantal junction was determined to be free of restrictions, fingers were placed on the head using the Vault Hold (Figures 1 &amp; 2). The Vault Hold was used for the administration of the procedure as is standard in osteopathic manipulative medicine by bilateral finger placement: thumbs are off the head, index fingers on the temporal bones, middle fingers on the sphenoid bones, ring fingers on the mastoid and the 5th fingers on the occipital bone.
