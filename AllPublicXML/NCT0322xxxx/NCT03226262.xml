  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, observational, multi-center, single-arm, clinical trial designed to
      assess the efficacy of FFRangio in measuring FFR obtained from angiography compared to
      Invasive FFR for diagnosing hemodynamically significant coronary stenosis.

    <intervention_name>FFRangio</intervention_name>
    <description>FFRangio is a non-invasive image-based software device that provides physicians with a quantitative analysis of functional significance of the coronary lesion, similar to invasive FFR (Fractional Flow Reserve), and a qualitative three-dimensional model of the demonstrated coronary arteries, during routine PCI procedure. The CathWorks FFRangio software device is able to perform all required processing and calculations, based only on angiography images and hemodynamics information that are acquired during the coronary catheterization procedure.
The CathWorks FFRangioTM technology does not require any additional use of invasive devices, or any additional vasodilation treatment, as required by other known FFR techniques.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <study_pop>
      <textblock>
        Subjects with stable angina, unstable angina or NSTEMI who are referred to coronary
        angiography and have an invasive FFR measurement with vasodilation in at least one coronary
        artery. Each subject will undergo both the standard invasive FFR and the investigational
        FFRangio.
