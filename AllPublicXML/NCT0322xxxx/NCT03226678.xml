          4. Hemoglobin &lt;11 g/dL.

          5. Signs of hemolysis with abnormal values by any of the hemolytic markers:

          6. Women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP) (defined as any female who has experienced
             menarche and who is NOT permanently sterile or postmenopausal. Postmenopausal is

          7. Males must agree to use protocol defined methods of contraception and agree to refrain
             from donating sperm for the duration of the study and 60 days after their last dose of

                  vaccinations)

               2. Streptococcus pneumoniae (Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and Pneumococcal
                  polysaccharide vaccine 23 [PCV13 and/or PPSV23, respectively])

               3. Haemophilus influenzae Type B (Hib) vaccine

               1. Neisseria meningitides types A, C, W, Y and type B must be administered prior to
                  dosing on Day 1. A booster is administered after at least 8 weeks (Day 56; for
                  both vaccinations).

             an AST or ALT level &gt; 2x upper limit of normal. Please note elevated indirect
             bilirubin due to hemolysis is not an exclusion criteria.

          4. Elevated bilirubin not due to active hemolysis. Any elevation of bilirubin &gt;ULN will
             require Sponsor review and approval for subject enrollment into the trial.

          5. Active aggressive lymphoma requiring therapy or an active non-lymphatic malignant
             disease other than basal cell carcinoma or carcinoma in situ (CIS) of the cervix.
