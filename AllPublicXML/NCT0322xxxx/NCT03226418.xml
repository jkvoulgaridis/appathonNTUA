      This phase II trial of the impact of clinicogenetic risk-stratified management on outcomes of
      acute myeloid leukemia in older patients is to determine the rate of complete remission and
      mortality at 90 days in the entire cohort of older patients (≥60 years) with newly diagnosed
      acute myeloid leukemia, who receive clinicogenetic risk-stratified therapy allocation.

      Subjects will receive standard of care intensive or low-intensity induction based on
      cytogenetic and geriatric assessment-based risk stratification.

      Subjects will be evaluated for disease status, survival, quality of life and neurocognitive
      status for 90 days and then followed for a total of 2 years for survival data.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the rate of complete remission and mortality at 90 days in the entire cohort
      of older patients (&gt;= 60 years) with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who receive
      clinicogenetic risk-stratified therapy allocation.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the rate of complete remission and mortality at 90 days in subsets of older
      patients who receive intensive and low-intensity chemotherapy.

      II. To assess the impact of baseline functional status (measured by geriatric assessment) on
      the rate of complete remission and mortality at 90 days in older patients, who receive
      clinicogenetic risk-stratified therapy allocation.

      III. To evaluate the influence of baseline functional status on the quality of life, grades 3
      and 4 toxicities (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] version 4.03 grades)
      and neurocognitive status at baseline and at 90 days in older patients.

      IV. To determine the symptom burden at diagnosis and 10, 30 and 90 days following initiation
      of chemotherapy.

      V. To determine proportion of patients with impairments detected by geriatric assessment.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 or 2 groups based on cytogenetic and geriatric
      assessment-based risk stratification.

      GROUP I:

      INTENSIVE INDUCTION THERAPY: Patients receive cytarabine intravenously (IV) on days 1-7 and
      idarubicin over 10-15 minutes on days 1-3 (7+3), or liposome-encapsulated
      daunorubicin-cytarabine IV over 90 minutes on days 1, 3 and 5. Gemtuzumab or midostaurin are
      added to 7+3 as per the standard of care. Treatment continues for 1 course in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      INTENSIVE CONSOLIDATION THERAPY: Patients who go into remission, receive cytarabine IV over
      1-3 hours twice daily (BID) on days 1, 3, and 5. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for 2-4
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients treated with
      liposome-encapsulated daunorubicin-cytarabine receive liposome-encapsulated
      daunorubicin-cytarabine IV over 90 minutes on days 1 and 3. Treatment repeats every 5-8 weeks
      for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      GROUP II:

      LOW-INTENSITY INDUCTION: Patients receive oral venetoclax and azacitidine IV on days 1-7 or
      decitabine IV on days 1-5. Alternate standard of care low-intensity therapies are allowed at
      the discretion of treating physician. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for 1-4 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      LOW-INTENSITY CONSOLIDATION: Patients who achieve complete remission, receive oral venetoclax
      and azacitidine IV on days 1-7 or decitabine IV on days 1-5 or other standard of care
      low-intensity chemotherapy. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for 3 or more courses in the
      absence of disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or receipt of allogeneic stem cell
      transplant.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for up to 2 years.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

          1. A new diagnosis of de novo, secondary or treatment-related AML, other AML equivalent
             such as myeloid sarcoma, myelodysplastic syndrome in transformation to AML, or
             high-grade treatment-related myeloid neoplasm

          2. Patients aged ≥60 years

          3. Karnofsky Performance Status ≥60%

          4. Subjects must be able and willingly give signed informed consent

        Exclusion criteria:

          1. Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Patients with brief exposure to all-trans retinoic
             acid (ATRA), arsenic trioxide (ATO) or similar product for suspected APL, who later
             turn out not to have APL, are eligible for the study.

          2. Relapsed or refractory AML, who require salvage therapy

          3. Prior exposure to decitabine or azacitidine will be an exclusion criterion for the use
             of decitabine or azacitidine alone.

          4. Patients, who require urgent initiation of chemotherapy (other than debulking agent
             such as hydroxyurea or cyclophosphamide) due to leukemia-related emergencies such as
             leukostasis, or disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. Patients will not be excluded
             solely based on prior use of debulking agent. Prior or current use of leukapheresis
             will be allowed.

          5. Uncontrolled serious infection at the time of enrollment. Infections are considered
             controlled if appropriate therapy has been instituted and, at the time of enrollment,
             patients do not have signs of infection progression. Progression of infection is
             defined as hemodynamic instability attributable to sepsis, new symptoms, worsening
             physical signs or radiographic findings attributable to infection. Persisting fever
             without other signs or symptoms will not be interpreted as progressing infection

          6. Uncontrolled clinically significant arrhythmia, myocardial ischemia or congestive
             heart failure within the past 2 weeks, that is considered by the treating physician as
             a contraindication for initiation of chemotherapy.

          7. Ejection fraction &lt;45% will be an exclusion criteria for intensive chemotherapy. Such
             patients may receive low intensity therapy.

          8. Clinically significant kidney (e.g. GFR ≤45ml/minute or Creatinine of ≥2 mg/dl) or
             liver dysfunction (e.g. AST/ALT and/or bilirubin ≥2 times ULN) at the time of
             enrollment that may prevent from safely using chemotherapy. Such patients may be
             allowed to receive low-intensity chemotherapy. Patients with elevated bilirubin
             secondary to Gilbert syndrome will not be excluded.

          9. Any other condition that may not allow safe use of chemotherapy based on the clinical
             judgment of the treating oncologist.
