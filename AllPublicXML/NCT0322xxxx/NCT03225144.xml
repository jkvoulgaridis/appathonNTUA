      Background:

      Neurodegenerative disorders can lead to problems in movement or memory. Some can cause
      abnormal proteins to build up in brain cells. Researchers want to understand whether these
      diseases have related causes or risk factors.

      Objective:

      To test people with movement or thinking and memory problems to see if they are eligible for
      research studies.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 18 and older with a neurodegenerative disorder associated with accumulation of
      TDP-43 or Tau proteins

      Design:

      Participants will have a screening visit. This may take place over 2-3 days. Tests include:

      Medical history

      Physical exam

      Questions about behavior and mood

      Tests of memory, attention, concentration, and thinking

      Movement measurement. The speed at which participants can stand up from a chair, tap their
      finger and foot, and walk a short distance will be measured. Some movements will be
      videotaped. They will be videotaped while they speak and read a paragraph.

      Blood tests. This might include genetic testing.

      Lung and breathing tests

      MRI. They will lie on a table that slides into a cylinder that takes pictures of the body.
      Some participants will get a dye through IV.

      Electromyography. A thin needle will be inserted into the muscles to measure electrical
      signals.

      Nerve tests. Small electrodes on the skin record muscle and nerve activity.

      A small piece of skin may be removed.

      A skin or blood sample may be taken to create stem cells.

      Optional lumbar puncture. A needle will be inserted into the space between the bones of the
      back to collect fluid.

      If participants are not eligible for current studies, they may be contacted in the future.

      Objectives

      The primary objective is to evaluate patients referred with a diagnosis of frontotemporal
      dementia (FTD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), or related adult-onset neurodegenerative
      disorder to assess patient eligibility for ongoing protocols. The secondary objective is to
      develop and maintain a registry of characterized patients and presymptopmatic carriers of
      gene mutations that cause ALS or FTD. An exploratory objective is to obtain biospecimens from
      clinically characterized patients to carry out laboratory-based studies aimed at
      understanding the molecular pathways and genetic overlap between these neurodegenerative
      disorders.

      Study population

      Adults referred with clinical diagnoses of frontotemporal dementia, motor neuron disorder, or
      related adult-onset neurodegenerative disorder. Presymptomatic carriers of genes that cause
      familial FTD or ALS.

      Design

      Participants will all undergo clinical tests to confirm diagnoses and to stage disease
      severity, including a standard battery of tests to measure cognitive and motor function.
      Participants may opt-in for research procedures such as phlebotomy, skin biopsy, and

      lumbar puncture to obtain biospecimens for laboratory research, and magnetic resonance
      imaging or transcranial magnetic stimulation may be used to explore biomarkers of disease.

      Outcome measures

      Clinical information will be analyzed as part of our research to identify common features and
      differences among participants.

             frontotemporal lobar degeneration, primary progressive aphasia, semantic dementia,
             motor neuron disorder, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, progressive bulbar palsy,

             radiculopathy or other significant neurological abnormalities.
