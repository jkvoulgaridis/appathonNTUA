      The focus of this study is to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary impact
      of a 12-week, telephone-delivered, positive psychology (PP)-based health behavior
      intervention in a group of patients with mild to moderate heart failure (HF), compared to a
      motivational interviewing- (MI-) based education condition and treatment as usual (TAU).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are proposing a study that will focus on the implementation of a novel
      PP-based health behavior intervention that is adapted for patients with HF. The MGH inpatient
      units, MGH Heart Center, and MGH primary care clinic outpatients will serve as the source of
      participants for the study, with patients who have a diagnosis of HF serving as potential
      participants. The investigators will enroll 60 HF patients, who will take part in a 12-week
      PP-based health behavior intervention.

      In this project, the investigators hope to do the following:

        1. Test a 12-week, telephone-delivered health behavior intervention utilizing PP exercises
           and systematic goal-setting in a three-arm, randomized, controlled pilot trial in
           patients with mild to moderate HF (N=60).

        2. Determine whether this optimized intervention is feasible in a small cohort of HF
           patients.

        3. Explore potential benefits of the intervention on outcomes of interest (e.g.,
           psychological health, functioning, and health behavior adherence) compared to a
           motivational interviewing- (MI) based education condition and treatment as usual (TAU).

      Baseline information about enrolled participants will be obtained from the patients, care
      providers, and the electronic medical record as required for characterization of our
      population. This information will include data regarding medical history (history of prior
      acute coronary syndrome, coronary artery disease, coronary artery bypass graft, congestive
      HF, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and current smoking), current medical
      variables (renal function, left ventricular ejection fraction, NYHA class), medications, and
      sociodemographic data (age, gender, race/ethnicity, living alone).

      Participants will undergo two in person visits during which they will meet with study staff
      in person (or if preferred over the phone). In their first visit, they will answer
      questionnaires related to psychological and physical health and functioning and will be asked
      to wear an accelerometer for one week to measure their baseline physical activity. At their
      second in-person visit, they will be randomized to receive (1) the PP-based health behavior
      intervention, (2) the MI-based educational condition, or (3) TAU. Participants in the TAU
      group will not receive any additional intervention but will complete follow-up phone calls at
      12 and 24 weeks.

      Following randomization, participants in the two treatment groups will be provided a
      treatment manual corresponding with their treatment condition with weekly exercises, along
      with a copy of the Learning to Live with Heart Failure guide. The appropriate intervention
      will be introduced, and the first exercise will be assigned. Finally, participants in both
      treatment groups will receive a personal step counter to use over the course of the study.

      Following the second in-person visit, participants in the PP-based intervention and MI-based
      control condition groups will complete twelve 30- to 45-minute weekly phone sessions with a
      study trainer. The phone sessions primarily will include a review of the prior week's session
      content and a discussion of the rationale and assignment of the next week's
      exercise/assignment.

      At Weeks 12 and 24, a member of the study staff will call participants to repeat the
      self-report questionnaires that were administered at baseline. At these two time points,
      participants also will be asked to wear an accelerometer for an additional 7 days to measure
      physical activity.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult patients with NYHA class I, II, or III HF admitted to an MGH inpatient unit or
             outpatients at the MGH Heart Center or MGH-affiliated primary care clinic. Patients
             with NYHA class IV HF have ongoing HF symptoms at rest, making it difficult for them
             to increase physical activity and other health behaviors; therefore, they will not be
             included. HF diagnosis will be confirmed via chart review and with the patient's
             treatment team as needed.

          -  Suboptimal adherence to health behaviors. This will be defined as a total score of ≤15
             on three Medical Outcomes Study Specific Adherence Scale (MOS) items regarding
             diet/exercise/medications. The MOS has been used in multiple prior studies assessing
             adherence in cardiac patients, including our own studies in this population. This
             threshold score on the MOS will ensure that all participants will have the potential
             to improve their health behaviors.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Cognitive deficits impeding a participant's ability to provide informed consent or
             participate, assessed via a 6-item cognitive test that is sensitive and specific for
             screening for cognitive impairment in research participants.

          -  Medical conditions precluding interviews or likely to lead to death within 6 months.

          -  Inability to speak English, inability to read or write, inability to walk, or lack of
             a telephone.

          <title>PP-based Health Behavior Intervention</title>
          <description>Participants will undergo a 12-week, Positive Psychology (PP)-based health behavior intervention. Each weekly session will include (a) a review of the week’s PP exercise, (b) a discussion of the rationale of the next week’s PP exercise through a guided review of the PP manual, and (c) assignment of the next week’s PP exercise. Additionally for the goal-setting portion, participants will (a) review their goals and behaviors from the prior week, (b) discuss techniques for improving health behavior adherence (e.g., monitoring physical activity, reading nutrition labels), and (c) set goals for the next week.
PP-based health behavior intervention: The positive psychology exercises include 3 modules: gratitude-based activities, strength-based activities, and meaning-based activities. The goal-setting portion of the program focuses primarily on physical activity (8 weeks) but also includes 4 weeks focusing on diet and medication adherence.</description>

          <description>The Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) is a well-validated questionnaire of health status in HF. The full scale will be used to measure HF-specific health-related QoL (HRQoL), and an eight-question subset of the KCCQ will be used as a measure of HF symptoms (QoL score range: 0-100; total symptom score range: 0-100). Higher QoL scores indicate better HF specific health-related QoL, and higher total symptom scores indicate fewer symptoms.</description>

        <title>Change in PANAS Scores (Primary Psychological Outcome)</title>
        <description>The positive affect items on the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), a well-validated scale used in other intervention trials and in patients with HF, will be used to measure positive affect (Range: 10-50). Change was calculated by subtracting the score at baseline from the score at 12 and 24 weeks. Higher scores indicate higher levels of positive affect.</description>

            <title>PP-based Health Behavior Intervention</title>
            <description>Participants will undergo a 12-week, Positive Psychology (PP)-based health behavior intervention. Each weekly session will include (a) a review of the week’s PP exercise, (b) a discussion of the rationale of the next week’s PP exercise through a guided review of the PP manual, and (c) assignment of the next week’s PP exercise. Additionally for the goal-setting portion, participants will (a) review their goals and behaviors from the prior week, (b) discuss techniques for improving health behavior adherence (e.g., monitoring physical activity, reading nutrition labels), and (c) set goals for the next week.
PP-based health behavior intervention: The positive psychology exercises include 3 modules: gratitude-based activities, strength-based activities, and meaning-based activities. The goal-setting portion of the program focuses primarily on physical activity (8 weeks) but also includes 4 weeks focusing on diet and medication adherence.</description>

          <description>The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)-anxiety subscale was be used to measure anxiety. This is a well-validated scale with few somatic symptom items that can confound mood/anxiety assessment in medically-ill patients (Range: 0-21). Change was calculated by subtracting the score at baseline from the score at 12 weeks and 24 weeks. Higher scores indicate higher levels of anxiety.</description>

        <description>The Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) is a well-validated questionnaire of health status in HF. The full scale will be used to measure HF-specific health-related QoL (HRQoL), and an eight-question subset of the KCCQ will be used as a measure of HF symptoms (QoL score range: 0-100; total symptom score range: 0-100). Change was calculated by subtracting the score at baseline from the score at 12 weeks and 24 weeks. Higher QoL scores indicate better HF specific health-related QoL, and higher total symptom scores indicate fewer symptoms.</description>

        <title>Changes in SF-12 Scores</title>
        <description>The Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-12 (SF-12) will be used to measure quality of life. This is an instrument which has been used in multiple cardiac studies in the past (SF-12 Mental Composite Score and Physical Composite Score Range: 0-100 each). Change was calculated by subtracting the score at baseline from the score at 12 weeks and 24 weeks. Higher scores indicate higher level of health related QoL.</description>

            <description>Participants will undergo a 12-week, PP-based health behavior intervention. Each weekly session will include (a) a review of the week’s PP exercise, (b) a discussion of the rationale of the next week’s PP exercise through a guided review of the PP manual, and (c) assignment of the next week’s PP exercise. Additionally for the goal-setting portion, participants will (a) review their goals and behaviors from the prior week, (b) discuss techniques for improving health behavior adherence (e.g., monitoring physical activity, reading nutrition labels), and (c) set goals for the next week.
PP-based health behavior intervention: The positive psychology exercises include 3 modules: gratitude-based activities, strength-based activities, and meaning-based activities. The goal-setting portion of the program focuses primarily on physical activity (8 weeks) but also includes 4 weeks focusing on diet and medication adherence.</description>

          <title>PP-based Health Behavior Intervention</title>
          <description>Participants will undergo a 12-week, PP-based health behavior intervention. Each weekly session will include (a) a review of the week’s PP exercise, (b) a discussion of the rationale of the next week’s PP exercise through a guided review of the PP manual, and (c) assignment of the next week’s PP exercise. Additionally for the goal-setting portion, participants will (a) review their goals and behaviors from the prior week, (b) discuss techniques for improving health behavior adherence (e.g., monitoring physical activity, reading nutrition labels), and (c) set goals for the next week.
PP-based health behavior intervention: The positive psychology exercises include 3 modules: gratitude-based activities, strength-based activities, and meaning-based activities. The goal-setting portion of the program focuses primarily on physical activity (8 weeks) but also includes 4 weeks focusing on diet and medication adherence.</description>
