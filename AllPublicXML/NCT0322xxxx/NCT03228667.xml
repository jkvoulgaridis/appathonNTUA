  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase IIb, single-arm, multicohort, open-label multicenter study of ALT-803 in
      combination with an FDA-approved PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor in patients with advanced
      cancers who have progressed following an initial response to treatment with PD-1/PD-L1
      checkpoint inhibitor therapy. All patients will receive the combination treatment of
      PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor plus ALT-803 for up to 16 cycles. Each cycle is six weeks in
      duration. All patients will receive ALT-803 once every 3 weeks. Patients will also receive
      the same checkpoint inhibitor that they received during their previous therapy. Radiologic
      evaluation will occur at the end of each treatment cycle. Treatment will continue for up to 2
      years, or until the patient experiences confirmed progressive disease or unacceptable
      toxicity, withdraws consent, or if the Investigator feels it is no longer in the patient's
      best interest to continue treatment. Patients will be followed for disease progression,
      post-therapies, and survival through 24 months past administration of the first dose of study
      drug.

                  of study treatment. Non-childbearing is defined as greater than one year
                  postmenopausal or surgically sterilized.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with CNS metastases with the following exceptions:

          -  Patient untreated CNS metastases with 4 or fewer sites of disease, with no single site
             larger than 20mm, are eligible if they are asymptomatic and not requiring steroids at
             any dose. Patients with asymptomatic CNS metastases may be treated with radiosurgery
             before or during therapy on trial without treatment delays.

          -  Patients with treated, symptomatic CNS metastases are eligible if they are
             neurologically returned to baseline (except for residual signs or symptoms related to
             the CNS treatment) for at least 2 weeks prior to registration AND either off
             corticosteroids, or on a stable or decreasing dose of ≤ 10 mg daily prednisone (or
             equivalent).

          -  New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV heart failure, uncontrollable
             supraventricular arrhythmias, any history of a ventricular arrhythmia, or other
             clinical signs of severe cardiac dysfunction

          -  Symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, or myocardial
             infarction within 6 months of enrollment

          -  Known autoimmune disease requiring active treatment.

          -  History of interstitial lung disease and/or immune mediated pneumonitis

          -  Known HIV-positive

          -  Active systemic infection requiring parenteral antibiotic therapy

          -  Positive hepatitis C serology or active hepatitis B infection

          -  Any ongoing toxicity from prior anti-cancer treatment that, in the judgement of the
             investigator, may interfere with study treatment. All toxicities attributed to prior
             anti-cancer therapy other than alopecia and fatigue must resolve to grade 1 (NCI CTCAE
             version 4) or baseline prior to enrollment. Eligible patients must not require more
             than 10 mg/day prednisone (or equivalent dose).

          -  Previous malignancies (except non-melanoma skin cancers, in situ bladder cancer, in
             situ gastric or in situ colon cancers, in situ cervical cancers/dysplasia or breast
             carcinoma in situ) unless a complete remission was achieved at least 1 year prior to
             study entry and no additional therapy is required or anticipated to be required during
             the study period

          -  No other illness that in the opinion of the investigator would exclude the subject
             from participating in the study

          -  Patients in which treatment with PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor is contraindicated

          -  Patients who have received another investigational agent within the previous 3 months

          -  Women who are pregnant or nursing
