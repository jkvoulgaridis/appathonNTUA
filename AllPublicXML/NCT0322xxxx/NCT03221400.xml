    <textblock>
      Protocol PEN-866-001 is an open-label, multi-center, first-in-human Phase 1/2a study
      evaluating PEN-866 in patients with advanced solid malignancies whose disease has progressed
      after treatment with previous anticancer therapies.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phase 1 will employ an adaptive model guided with overdose control principle to make dose
      recommendations and estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).

      Phase 2a begins once all patients treated in Phase 1 have been assessed for safety and the
      Safety Review Committee (SRC) has reviewed all safety data and recommends continuing with
      Phase 2a. PEN-866 will be evaluated using the recommended Phase 2 dose identified by the SRC
      at the conclusion of Phase 1 based on the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic, and
      pharmacodynamics profile of PEN-866 during Phase 1.
