  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, cross over study aims to find out the benefits of delivering triple therapy
      using a single ELLIPTA® DPI (fixed-dose combination triple therapy) versus delivering triple
      therapy using two different types of inhalers (open triple therapy) including DISKUS® with
      HandiHaler® to subjects with COPD. Correct inhaler use, critical errors and performance
      attributes will also be assessed. Approximately 240 subjects with COPD will be randomized in
      the study. The study will be conducted in 3 visits and will be completed in approximately 56
      days. At Visit 1 (Day 1) and Visit 2 (Day 28) subjects will be randomized to receive a
      placebo ELLIPTA inhaler once daily (QD) or a placebo DISKUS twice daily (BID) with placebo
      HandiHaler QD inhaler in 1:1 ratio in a cross-over manner for the study period (28 days for
      each period). At Visit 3 (Day 56), subjects will be asked to complete preference
      questionnaire 1 or 2. There will be no active treatment and subjects will continue to take
      their own prescribed COPD maintenance and rescue medication during the entire study period.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Zero Errors After 28 Days of Inhaler Use in Each Treatment Phase (Primary Estimand: Hypothetical)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 56</time_frame>
    <description>A checklist for correct use of each inhaler was developed in Patient Instruction Leaflets (PIL's). Participants were guided by trained health care provider (HCP) to demonstrate correct use of inhaler. Baseline assessment was conducted when participant initially dispensed the inhaler. Second assessment was conducted after each 28day dosing period. Correct Use Check list was completed by HCP at each visit. Primary hypothetical estimand is the estimate of treatment effect of all participants who stayed on their randomized study device sequence and did not change their standard COPD maintenance medication device to one delivered via ELLIPTA, DISKUS or HANDIHALER, throughout both 28 day treatment periods. Participants could attend visit without the device/s they were randomised to, in which case correct use cannot be assessed as described in the protocol. Participants who completed error assessments for both randomized treatment groups and experienced no intercurrent events were included</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>This is a randomized, multi-center, open-label study comparing placebo ELLIPTA with placebo DISKUS + HandiHaler to assess correct inhaler use in participants with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). A total of 17 centers across United States participated in the study.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Out of 240 randomized participants (par), 239 entered the study as 1 par was randomized in error. In order to minimize potential bias the order of placebo devices &amp; order of responses, in preference questionnaire (PQ), was randomized in a crossover design. All par on study received placebo only &amp; participant flow reflects this as the only treatment</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Zero Errors After 28 Days of Inhaler Use in Each Treatment Phase (Primary Estimand: Hypothetical)</title>
        <description>A checklist for correct use of each inhaler was developed in Patient Instruction Leaflets (PIL's). Participants were guided by trained health care provider (HCP) to demonstrate correct use of inhaler. Baseline assessment was conducted when participant initially dispensed the inhaler. Second assessment was conducted after each 28day dosing period. Correct Use Check list was completed by HCP at each visit. Primary hypothetical estimand is the estimate of treatment effect of all participants who stayed on their randomized study device sequence and did not change their standard COPD maintenance medication device to one delivered via ELLIPTA, DISKUS or HANDIHALER, throughout both 28 day treatment periods. Participants could attend visit without the device/s they were randomised to, in which case correct use cannot be assessed as described in the protocol.

The participant could withdraw from randomised study device sequence and therefore withdraw from the study
The participant could change their standard COPD maintenance medication device to one delivered via ELLIPTA, DISKUS or HANDIHALER; these subjects should have been withdrawn from the study according to the protocol.
The participant could attend the visit without the device/s they were randomised to, in which case correct use cannot be assessed as described in the protocol.

        <description>The occurrence of each type of error for each inhaler (ELLIPTA, DISKUS or HANDIHALER) were evaluated based on the information collected in Correct Use Checklists. Primary estimand is the treatment effect estimated in participants who stayed on their randomised study device sequence &amp; did not change their standard COPD maintenance medication device to one delivered via ELLIPTA, DISKUS or HANDIHALER, throughout both 28 day treatment periods. The participant could attend the visit without the device/s they were randomised to, in which case correct use cannot be assessed as described in the protocol. For primary estimand, a sensitivity analysis using Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test was performed on participants with discordant results. Only those participants who completed error assessments for both randomized treatment groups &amp; experienced no intercurrent events were included.

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Atleast One Error After 28 Days of Inhaler Use in Each Treatment Phase (Primary Estimand: Hypothetical)</title>
        <description>Primary estimand is the treatment effect estimated in participants who stayed on their randomised study device sequence and did not change their standard COPD maintenance medication device to one delivered via ELLIPTA, DISKUS or HANDIHALER, throughout both 28 day treatment periods. The participant could attend the visit without the device/s they were randomised to, in which case correct use cannot be assessed as described in the protocol. For primary estimand, a sensitivity analysis using Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test was performed on participants with discordant results. Only those participants who completed error assessments for both randomized treatment groups and experienced no intercurrent events were included</description>

Participants continued to take their own prescribed COPD medication and rescue medications for the entire 56-day study period. All participants on study received placebo only and participant flow reflects this as the only treatment.</description>

          <title>Number of Errors for Each Treatment Group in Participants With One or More Errors After 28 Days of Use (Primary Estimand: Hypothetical)</title>
          <description>Participants were provided with the PIL, explaining correct use of the inhaler. Overall error includes both critical and non-critical errors. Assessment of errors was conducted by HCP trained in the correct inhaler use of the three inhalers based on the checklist of errors. Primary estimand is the treatment effect estimated in participants who stayed on their randomised study device sequence and did not change their standard COPD maintenance medication device to one delivered via ELLIPTA, DISKUS or HANDIHALER, throughout both 28 day treatment periods. The participant could attend the visit without the device/s they were randomised to, in which case correct use cannot be assessed as described in the protocol. For primary estimand, a sensitivity analysis using Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test was performed on participants with discordant results. Only those participants who completed error assessments for both randomized treatment groups and experienced no intercurrent events were included.</description>

        <description>Assessment of errors was conducted by health care professionals trained in the correct inhaler use of the three inhalers based on the checklist of errors. The median of overall errors made by each participant was assessed for ELLIPTA and DISKUS + HandiHaler both on Day 1 and Day 28. The difference was calculated by subtracting values of Day 28 from Day1 for each treatment regimen. Only those participants who completed error assessments for both randomized treatment groups and experienced no intercurrent events were included.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Zero Critical Errors After 28 Days of Each Treatment Group Use (Primary Estimand: Hypothetical)</title>
        <description>A checklist for correct use of each inhaler was developed based on the steps identified in the PIL. A critical error was defined as an error that was most likely to result in no, or a significantly reduced amount, of medication being inhaled by the participant. Primary estimand is the treatment effect estimated in participants who stayed on their randomised study device sequence and did not change their standard COPD maintenance medication device to one delivered via ELLIPTA, DISKUS or HANDIHALER, throughout both 28 day treatment periods. The participant could attend the visit without the device/s they were randomised to, in which case correct use cannot be assessed as described in the protocol.
