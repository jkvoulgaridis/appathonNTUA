  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of TAK-831 when
      administered as multiple oral doses at escalating dose levels in healthy participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, investigator and participant blinded, sponsor unblinded,
      placebo-controlled, study of the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of TAK-831 in up
      to 48 healthy volunteers, with 8 subjects in each of the 6 cohorts.

      In each cohort, participants will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive TAK-831 or placebo.
      Two formulations, oral suspension and tablet will be tested in this study. Both blood and
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples will be collected from selected cohorts (CSF cohorts); for
      the rest of the cohorts, only blood samples will be collected (non-CSF cohorts).

      This single-center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to
      participate in this study is 58 days. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic,
      and 30 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.

    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (example, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. A TEAE is defined as an AE with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug.</description>

          2. The participant is a healthy male or female not of childbearing potential adult who is
             aged 18 to 55 years, inclusive, at the time of informed consent and first study drug
             dose.

          3. A male participant who is non-sterilized and sexually active with a female partner of
             childbearing potential agrees to use adequate contraception from signing of informed
             consent throughout the duration of the study and for 90 days plus half-lives (95 days)

             systolic and 50 to 90 mm Hg for diastolic, confirmed on repeat testing within a
             maximum of 30 minutes, at the Screening Visit or Check-in.

         10. Has a resting heart rate outside 40 to 100 beats per minute confirmed on repeat
             testing within a maximum of 30 minutes, at the Screening Visit or Check-in (heart rate

             the past 6 months, or &quot;yes&quot; on any item of the Suicidal Behavior section, except for
             the &quot;Non-Suicidal Self-Injurious Behavior&quot;, if this behavior occurred in the past 2
             years.

             Additional Exclusion Criteria for Cohort(s) with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Collection:

         12. Has had CSF collection performed within 30 days before Check-in.

         13. Has a history of clinically significant back pain and/or injury.

         14. Has local infection at the puncture site.

         15. Has thrombocytopenia or other suspected bleeding tendencies noted before procedure.

         16. Has developed signs and symptoms of spinal radiculopathy, including lower extremity
             pain and paresthesia.

         17. Has any focal neurological deficit that might suggest an increase in intracranial
             pressure.

         18. Has any abnormal findings on ophthalmological assessment/fundoscopy suggestive of
             raised intracranial pressure (that is, optic disc swelling/edema; (uncontrolled)
             hypertensive retinopathy).

         19. Suffers regularly from moderate to severe headaches requiring analgesics.

         20. Has lower spinal malformations (on physical examination or lumbar spine radiography),

        <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (example, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. A TEAE is defined as an AE with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug.</description>
