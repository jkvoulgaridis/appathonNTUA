      Early life exposures may lead to adverse effects on health in later life. The Boston birth
      Cohort study is designed to study a broad array of early life factors and their effects on
      pregnancy, infancy, and child health outcomes.

    <textblock>
      Any woman admitted to the Labor and Delivery floor at the Boston Medical Center (BMC) who
      delivers a singleton live infant and meets our case (gestational age &lt;37 weeks or birthweight
      &lt;2,500 grams) or control (full term birth with birthweight &gt;2,500 grams) criteria will be
      eligible.

      Postnatal follow-up of enrolled children is conducted from birth to age 21 years.

      The Boston Birth Cohort has high-quality biospecimen collection, and comprehensive
      epidemiological, clinical, and environmental exposure data via standardized questionnaire
      interview, measurements, and review of the electronic medical records.
