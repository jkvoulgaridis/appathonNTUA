  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is the 5th leading cause of global death, and is major risk factors for many chronic
      diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, hypertension and cancer. Obesity
      is caused by an imbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure, and it is widely
      agreed to be a consequence of a gene by environment interaction. Although on average obesity
      rates are increasing, the shape of the distribution of adiposity is changing: it is becoming
      more right skewed. This is because there is a population of very lean subjects that has
      remained almost unchanged by the epidemic. The investigators have called these very lean
      individuals that are resistant to the epidemic and sustain a BMI &lt; 18.5 kg/m2 'super lean'
      subjects. We have very little understanding of the lifestyles of these individuals and how
      they are able to maintain their super lean phenotype, and whether the basis of their leanness
      is primarily genetics.

      In this study, the investigators will recruit a sample of 150 super lean healthy volunteers
      with a BMI &gt;15 and &lt; 18.5 kg/m2 aged 20-40 years, in parallel with an age matched group of
      150 healthy subjects with a BMI ≥22 and &lt; 25 kg/m2 as the control group. The investigators
      will screen out any individuals with eating disorders. In both groups, the investigators will
      study their lifestyles in particular focusing on their physical activity patterns and their
      food intake choices (monitored via food intake diaries and supported by metabolomics analyses
      of their urine to detect biomarkers of different food groups). Saliva samples will be
      collected for genotyping. The investigators will SNP genotype the individuals for 30 known
      polymorphic loci previously linked to obesity to establish if they have a particular genetic
      profile linked to their lean phenotype.
