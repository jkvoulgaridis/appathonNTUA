  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Substance use disorders (SUDs) are a prevalent and impairing condition, particularly among
      trauma exposed individuals. The current proposal aims to address the critical need for
      targeted direct SUD prevention in this population by intervening on a novel, malleable risk
      factor for SUD common among trauma-exposed individuals: sleep disturbance. Sleep disturbance
      prospectively predicts the development of SUD and may confer risk for SUD by increasing
      stress reactivity, decreasing decision-making abilities, and ultimately promoting substance
      use to relieve negative affect, a core etiological factor in SUD. However, to our knowledge,
      no experimental studies have determined whether improving sleep leads to reductions in SUD
      risk. As such, the current study will use a randomized controlled trial design to test the
      effects of brief behavioral treatment for insomnia (BBTI) against a waitlist control among a
      sample of trauma-exposed young adults with poor sleep and risk for SUD (N = 60). We aim to
      determine the direct and indirect effects of condition (BBTI vs. waitlist control) on SUD
      symptoms, substance use-related problems, coping motives, and posttraumatic stress symptoms
      through improvements in sleep. Furthermore, we will test direct and indirect effects of
      condition on theoretically proposed mechanisms underlying the association between sleep
      disturbance and SUD risk (i.e., stress reactivity, cravings in response to stress).
