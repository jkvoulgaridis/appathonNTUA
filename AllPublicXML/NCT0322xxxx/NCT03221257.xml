      A Phase II multi-center, double-blind, parallel group, randomized and placebo-controlled
      clinical trial addressing the treatment of patients with active and symptomatic
      Scleroderma-related interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD). Patients who are either treatment
      naive or only recently started treatment (&lt;/= 6 months of prior treatment) will be randomized
      in a 1:1 assignment to receive either oral mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and a placebo (Plac)
      or a combination of oral MMF and oral pirfenidone (PFD), with both regimens administered for
      18 months. The primary hypothesis is that the rapid onset and anti-fibrotic effects of PFD,
      which have been observed in the treatment of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF), will
      complement the delayed antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive effects of MMF, to produce a
      significantly more rapid and/or greater improvement in lung function over time than occurs in
      patients receiving control therapy with MMF and Plac.

             Clinical Trial Consortium Gastrointestinal Scale (UCLA SCTC GIT), Version 2.0.

             Participants with uncontrolled heartburn or GERD that is amenable to medical
             management may be eligible if repeat testing within the maximal 90-day screening
             period meets this criteria.

             intercourse completely). If a subject chooses abstinence, then a second reliable means
             of contraception is not needed.

         15. Prior use of potential disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) according to the
             following exposure rules:

               1. Use of oral cyclophosphamide (CYC), MMF, azathioprine or other oral or short
                  half-life DMARDs (as detailed in Protocol Section 7.5.1a) for more than 6 months
                  in the past year as determined at the time of the initial screening visit.

               2. Treatment with more than three intravenous doses of CYC, one treatment course of
                  Rituximab or other intravenous or injectable DMARDs (as detailed in Protocol
                  Section 7.5.1b) in the past year.

               3. More distant history of treatment with a DMARD is allowed as long as the patient
                  has a new diagnosis/new episode of active SSc-ILD since stopping that treatment
                  and meets the criteria noted in 15a or 15b. .

         16. Use of CYC, MMF, azathioprine, Rituximab or other DMARD (as defined in Protocol
             Section 7.5.1a&amp;b) in the 30 days prior to their baseline visit unless the patient is
             on MMF and the responsible physician indicates that continued use is in the best
             clinical interest of the patient.

         17. Active infection (lung, ulcers or elsewhere) whose management would be compromised by
             immunosuppression.

         18. Other serious concomitant medical illness (e.g., active malignancy within the past 5
             years other than surgically-removed local skin cancer such as a basal cell carcinoma),
             chronic debilitating illness (other than SSc), unreliability or drug abuse that might
             compromise the patient's participation in the trial.

         19. Current use, or use within the 30 days prior to their baseline visit, of prednisone
             (or equivalent) in doses &gt;10 mg/day.

         20. Smoking of cigars, pipes, or cigarettes during the past 6 months.

         21. Use of contraindicated medications, including medications with putative
             disease-modifying properties that do not meet the exposure limits described in
             Exclusion Criteria #15 and #16, moderate or strong inhibitors of cytochrome P450 (CYP)
             isozyme 1A2 (CYP1A2) (note ciprofloxacin allowed up to a dose of 500 mg twice daily),
             and moderate inducers of CYP1A2 (such as tobacco smoke or phenytoin). See Protocol
             Section 7.5 for complete list.
