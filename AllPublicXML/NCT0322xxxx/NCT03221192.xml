  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nasal polyposis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the nose and sinuses. GlaxoSmithKline
      (GSK) is embarking on a clinical program to assess treatment of severe, recurrent nasal
      polyps with an anti-interleukin-5 (anti-IL5) (mepolizumab). Subject specific symptomatic
      endpoints will form the basis for the assessment of treatment benefit of nasal polyp
      therapies. However, there is a lack of published qualitative data regarding nasal polyps to
      understand the symptoms or health-related quality of life (HRQoL) impacts. This
      cross-sectional qualitative study aims to address this unmet gap by conducting
      semi-structured combined concept elicitation (CE) and cognitive debriefing (CD) telephone
      interviews and real-time data capture. The combined CE and CD interviews (each 90 minutes in
      duration) will investigate the subject experience of nasal polyps, and the relevance and
      understanding of existing patient-reported outcomes (PRO) instruments. The real-time data
      capture conducted over a 10 day period, will investigate the subject experience of the
      symptoms, HRQoL impacts and treatment of nasal polyps and any day-to-day variability that
      exists in these experiences in 'real time'. Twenty adult subjects in the United States (US),
      and 10 adult subjects in Germany with severe, recurrent nasal polyps will participate in the
      CE and CD interviews section of the study and of these, 10 subjects from US will also
      complete real-time data capture app task.

    <measure>Number of Participants Who Reported Primary Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 120 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>During the CE section of the interview, participants were asked a series of broad open-ended questions designed to encourage them to talk openly and as spontaneously as possible about their experience of having nasal polyps. In addition, participants were asked more focused questions designed to probe on issues that they may not have mentioned during the course of the interview spontaneously or concepts/statements that required additional clarification. The interviews were transcribed/translated verbatim and qualitative analysis was conducted using Atlas Ti. The symptoms which were most frequently reported spontaneously and were also reported to either be the most frequent, bothersome or worst were categorized as primary symptoms. Number of participants who reported each of the primary symptom is presented.</description>

        <description>During the CE section of the interview, participants were asked a series of broad open-ended questions designed to encourage them to talk openly and as spontaneously as possible about their experience of having nasal polyps. In addition, participants were asked more focused questions designed to probe on issues that they may not have mentioned during the course of the interview spontaneously or concepts/statements that required additional clarification. The interviews were transcribed/translated verbatim and qualitative analysis was conducted using Atlas Ti. The symptoms that were reported by fewer participants and less frequently mentioned spontaneously by participants during the interviews were classified as secondary symptoms. Number of participants who reported each of the secondary symptoms is reported.</description>

The participants evaluated their overall symptom severity, or the severity of individual symptoms of nasal polyps along a continuum, typically of 10 centimeter (cm) or 100 millimeter (mm) whereby 0 represents 'no symptom' and 10 or 100 represents 'as bad as you can imagine' respectively.

        <title>Number of Participants Who Reported Symptoms Assessed by VAS to be Relevant to Their Condition</title>
        <description>Participants were required to complete six VAS assessments (overall symptom VAS and single item VAS) as a part of the CD interview. The participants evaluated their overall symptom severity, or the severity of individual symptoms of nasal polyps along a continuum, typically of 10 cm or 100 mm whereby 0 represents 'no symptom' and 10 or 100 represents 'as bad as you can imagine' respectively. Participants were asked to speak aloud their thoughts as they read the instructions and completed the questions. After completion of each think-aloud exercise, participants were also probed about the relevance of VAS items. Relevance was determined based on participants personal descriptions and related discussion of their experience of each symptom or impact during CD interview. It was also determined via the rating of a given symptom/impact on each measure as greater than a score of zero. Number of participants who reported the symptoms assessed by VAS to be relevant are presented.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Who Reported Symptoms Assessed by SNOT-22 as Relevant to Their Condition</title>
        <description>Participants were required to complete SNOT-22 assessment as a part of the CD interview. The SNOT-22 contains 22 nose, sinus, and general HRQoL items and is used to measure health-related quality of life associated with rhinosinusitis with or without nasal polyps. Within the SNOT-22, participants were required to indicate the level to which each listed nasal, sinus or HRQoL experience has been affected on a 6-point scale ranging from 0 (No problem) to 5 (Problem as bad as it can be). Number of participants who reported the symptoms assessed by SNOT-22 to be relevant to their condition are presented.</description>

          <description>Participants completed SNOT-22 as a part of the CD interview. The SNOT-22 contains 22 nose, sinus, and general HRQoL items and is used to measure health-related quality of life associated with rhinosinusitis with or without nasal polyps. Within the SNOT-22, participants were required to indicate the level to which each listed nasal, sinus or HRQoL experience has been affected on a 6-point scale ranging from 0 (No problem) to 5 (Problem as bad as it can be). Participants were asked if they felt any items were missing from SNOT-22. Number of participants who reported missing items in SNOT-22 is presented.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Reporting Symptom Variability-Application (App) Task</title>
        <description>Participants took part in an app-based real-world data capture activity. The participants were required to download an app to their smart phone or tablet. Data capture was conducted over a 10-day period during which participants were required to complete a series of questions/tasks via the smartphone/tablet application in real-time. The questions/tasks were designed to explore the experience of nasal polyps. Participants provided responses to the questions using a variety of methodologies including video, audio, text and photographic responses with captions. Participants completed a number of tasks across 10 days, which explored how nasal polyp symptoms and impacts varied across a full day (within day variability) or assess the day to day variability (between day variability). Number of participants reporting within day and between-day symptom variability is reported.</description>
