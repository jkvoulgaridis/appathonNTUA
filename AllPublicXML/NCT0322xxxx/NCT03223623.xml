  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Little is known about the problems in brain function in focal hand dystonia (FHD) or complex
      regional pain syndrome (CRPS) dystonia. It is unclear why some CRPS patients develop dystonia
      but others do not. Researchers want to learn which area of the brain is involved in CRPS
      dystonia compared with FHD.

      Objectives:

      To understand why people with CRPS develop dystonia, and if these reasons are different in
      people with FHD.

      Eligibility:

      Adults ages 18 - 70 with CRPS dystonia OR with CRPS without dystonia OR with FHD and Healthy
      volunteers of similar age.

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with physical exam, neurological exam, and medical history.
      They may give a urine sample and will answer questions.

      Participants can have 4 - 5 outpatient visits or stay at the clinical center for
      approximately 5-6 days.

      Participants will have MRI scans. They will lie on a table that slides in and out of a
      scanner that takes pictures of their brain. They will do small tasks or be asked to imagine
      things during the scanning.

      Participants will have transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) sessions for a few hours, with
      breaks. A brief electrical current passing through a well insulated wire coil on the scalp
      creates a magnetic pulse. This affects brain activity. Participants may do small tasks during
      TMS.

      Participants will have the electrical activity of their muscles measured during TMS sessions.
      Small sticky pads will be attached to their hands and arms.

      Participants ability to feel 2 separate stimuli as different will be tested by using a weak
      electrical shock to their fingers. They will also be asked to feel small plastic domes with
      ridges, that may cause discomfort.

      Objective:

      Detailed evaluation of pathophysiology of Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) dystonia
      compared to Focal Hand Dystonia (FHD) with focus on the involvement of the parietal area, and
      to investigate differences in cortical mapping in the sensory and motor cortices between FHD
      and healthy volunteers.

      Study population:

      The study will enroll patients with (FHD), CRPS dystonia, CRPS without dystonia and Healthy
      Volunteers (HVs).

      Design:

      Prospective study using MRI and Physiology experiments using EMG and TMS based protocols to
      evaluate the differences between the groups.

      Outcome measures:

      The evaluation using fMRI will be performed under 3 conditions; 1. Rest 2. Voluntary activity
      3. Motor imagery task.

      Outcome measures (fMRI based):

        -  We will explore the differences in BOLD signal in the parietal lobe, in CRPS dystonia
           compared to FHD, in the different conditions. We will look for changes in the BOLD
           signal in the parietal sensorimotor integration area.

        -  We will further explore the differential activation in CRPS dystonia vs CRPS without
           dystonia to identify any specific features inherent to patients with CRPS dystonia
           compared to CRPS alone.

        -  We will use vascular occupancy imaging (VASO) to explore differences of detailed
           cortical mapping of neural structures between FHD and healthy volunteers.

      The Physiology experiments aim to explore abnormalities and differences in the baseline motor
      cortical excitability between the groups and evaluated the influence of continuous Theta
      Burst Stimulation (cTBS) on these measures. We will study the influence of cTBS on the
      phenomenon Cortical Silent Period ( cSP) in CRPS dystonia and FHD.

      We will also be studying the baseline Spatial and Temporal Discrimination (SDTs and TDTs),
      which are measures of sensory surround inhibition. TDT and SDT abnormalities have been noted
      to be endophenotypic of dystonia, however the comparative characteristics between FHD and
      CRPS dystonia are not known.

      Physiology outcomes:

        -  Baseline differential influences of PMv and IPL on motor cortical excitability and
           changes after cTBS of dIPL.

        -  Baseline cortical Silent Period (cSP) in the involved and uninvolved limb in FHD and
           CRPS dystonia and the influence of cTBS on cSP between the groups in the involved limb.

        -  The TDTs/ SDTs in both the involved and uninvolved limbs in FHD and CRPS dystonia
           compared to HVs.
