      This phase I pilot trial studies how well atezolizumab, pemetrexed disodium, cisplatin, and
      surgery with or without radiation therapy works in treating patients with stage I-III pleural
      malignant mesothelioma. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may
      help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor
      cells to grow and spread. Pemetrexed disodium may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking
      some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin,
      work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by
      stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving atezolizumab,
      pemetrexed disodium, and cisplatin before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the
      amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed. Giving atezolizumab after surgery may kill
      any remaining tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate if the regimen of neoadjuvant cisplatin-pemetrexed disodium
      (pemetrexed)-atezolizumab, surgery +/- radiation, then maintenance atezolizumab is feasible
      and safe for patients with resectable malignant pleural mesothelioma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate progression free survival (both by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
      Tumors [RECIST] 1.1 and also using a modified RECIST for pleural tumors) in patients with
      resectable malignant pleural mesothelioma treated with a regimen of neoadjuvant
      cisplatin-pemetrexed-atezolizumab, surgery +/- radiation, followed by one year of maintenance
      atezolizumab.

      II. To evaluate overall survival in patients with resectable malignant pleural mesothelioma
      treated with a regimen of neoadjuvant cisplatin-pemetrexed-atezolizumab, surgery +/-
      radiation, followed by one year of maintenance atezolizumab.

      III. To evaluate response rate (confirmed and unconfirmed, complete and partial, both by
      RECIST 1.1 and also using a modified RECIST for pleural tumors) in the subset of this patient
      population with measurable disease.

      TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the association between immunohistochemical (IHC) expression of PD-L1 in
      tumors and clinical outcomes in mesothelioma patients treated with trimodality/bimodality
      therapy including atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1).

      II. To evaluate the association between expression of immune-related genes identified by
      Immune Nanostring (depending on ribonucleic acid [RNA] availability) and clinical outcomes in
      mesothelioma patients treated with trimodality/bimodality therapy including atezolizumab.

      III. To evaluate the association between multiplex immunofluorescence (IF) of up to 10 immune
      markers in two panels and clinical outcomes in mesothelioma patients treated with
      trimodality/bimodality therapy including atezolizumab.

      OUTLINE:

      NEOADJUVANT: Patients receive atezolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes, pemetrexed
      disodium IV over 10 minutes, and cisplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1. Cycles repeats every 21
      days for 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unexpected toxicity.

      SURGERY: Within 21-90 days after completion of neoadjuvant therapy, patients undergo
      extrapleural pneumonectomy (EPP) or pleurectomy/decortication (PD). Patients who undergo EPP
      will then undergo radiation therapy (RT).

      MAINTENANCE: Within 90 days after completion of either PD or radiation (post-EPP), patients
      receive atezolizumab IV over 60 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 1
      year in the absence of disease progression or unexpected toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for up to 3 years.

          -  Patient must have stage I-III malignant pleural mesothelioma that is deemed resectable
             and must be planning to undergo pleurectomy decortication (P/D) or extrapleural
             pneumonectomy (EPP)

          -  Patient must have epithelioid or biphasic histology (sarcomatoid histology is
             excluded); histologic diagnosis and typing of mesothelioma requires at least a core
             needle biopsy or surgical biopsy of the pleura via thoracoscopy and small thoracotomy;
             cytology only will not be regarded as sufficient for the diagnosis

             basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, adequately treated
             stage I or II cancer from which the patient is currently in complete remission, or any
             other cancer from which the patient has been disease free for three years

          -  Patients must not be pregnant or nursing due to the potential teratogenic side effects
             of the protocol treatment; women of reproductive potential and men must have agreed to
             use an effective contraceptive method for the duration of study treatment and for 5
             months (150 days) after the last dose of atezolizumab; a woman is considered to be of
             &quot;reproductive potential&quot; if she has had menses at any time in the preceding 12
             consecutive months; in addition to routine contraceptive methods, &quot;effective
             contraception&quot; also includes heterosexual celibacy and surgery intended to prevent
             pregnancy (or with a side effect of pregnancy prevention) defined as a hysterectomy,
             bilateral oophorectomy or bilateral tubal ligation; however, if at any point a
             previously celibate patient chooses to become heterosexually active during the time
             period for use of contraceptive measures outlined in the protocol, he/she is
             responsible for beginning contraceptive measures

          -  Patient must NOT have a history of severe allergic, anaphylactic, or other
             hypersensitivity reactions to chimeric or humanized antibodies or fusion proteins

          -  Patient must NOT have a known hypersensitivity or allergy to biopharmaceuticals
             produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells or any component of the atezolizumab

          -  Patients must not have active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment
             in past two years (i.e., with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or
             immunosuppressive drugs); replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or
             physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency,
             etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment; autoimmune diseases include, but
             are not limited to, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory
             bowel disease, vascular thrombosis associated with antiphospholipid syndrome,

             evidenced by testing performed within 28 days prior to registration; patients with
             past or resolved HBV infection are eligible; active HBV is defined as having a
             positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) test; past or resolved HBV is defined as
             having a negative HBsAG test and a positive total hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb)

          -  Patient must NOT have a known positive test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV);
             patients do not need to be screened for HIV; patients with HIV are excluded due to a
             potential incompetent immune system and need for medications that could interfere with
             the treatment and immunotherapy

          -  Patient must not have significant cardiovascular disease, such as New York Heart
             Association cardiac disease (class II or greater), myocardial infarction within 3

             given the higher risks associated with surgical resection

          -  Patient must not receive live, attenuated influenza vaccine within 4 weeks prior to
             registration or at any time during the study and until 5 months after the last dose of
