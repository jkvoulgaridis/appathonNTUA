      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate safety and effectiveness of the Tricuspid
      Valve Repair System (TVRS) for treating symptomatic moderate or greater tricuspid
      regurgitation (TR) in patients currently on medical management and who are deemed appropriate
      for percutaneous transcatheter intervention.

      This is a prospective, single arm, multi-center study.

      A minimum of 85 subjects will be prospectively enrolled into this single arm study in
      approximately 25 sites, in Europe, Canada and the United States. Patients will be seen for
      follow-up visits at discharge (≤ 7 days post index procedure), 30 days, 6 months, 1,2,3
      years. Whereas, in United States patients will be followed-up till 5 years.
