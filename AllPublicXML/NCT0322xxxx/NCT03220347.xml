      Study CC-90010-ST-001 is an open-label, Phase 1a, dose escalation and expansion,
      First-in-human (FIH) clinical study of CC-90010 in subjects with advanced or unresectable
      solid tumors and relapsed and/or refractory advanced Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). The dose
      escalation part (Part A) of the study will explore escalating oral doses of CC-90010 to
      estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of CC-90010. The expansion part (Part B) will
      further evaluate the safety and efficacy of CC-90010 administered at or below the MTD in the
      following cohorts:

      Cohort 1: relapsed and/or refractory DLBCL approximately 20-25 evaluable subjects at 45 mg
      CC-90010 4-days-on/24-days-off in each 28-day cycle Cohort 2: advanced BCC -enrollment
      stopped due to recruitment challenges Cohort 3: relapsed and/or refractory DLBCL
      -approximately 15 evaluable subjects at 30mg CC-90010 3-dayson/11-days-offin each 28-day
      cycle The food effect assessment (Part C, Spain only) will evaluate the impact of food on
      CC-90010 when administered at the RP2D of 45 mg 4-days-on/24-days-off (180 mg per 28-day
      cycle), by comparison of the PK parameters following fasted and fed (high-fat, high-calorie
      meal) conditions.

      Parts A, B and C will consist of 3 periods: Screening, Treatment and Follow-up.

      Screening Period:

      The Screening Period starts 28 days (± 3 days) prior to first dose of CC-90010. The informed
      document (ICD) must be signed and dated by the subject and the administering staff prior to
      the start of any other study procedures. All screening tests and procedures must be completed
      within the 28 days (±3 days) prior to the first dose of CC-90010.

      Treatment Period:

      During the Treatment Period, CC-90010 was initially administered orally once daily for 3
      consecutive days followed by 4 consecutive days off drug every week (3/7-days schedule) in
      each 28-day cycle in Part A. Alternative dosing schedules (eg, 2-days-on/5-days- off each
      week, 3-days-on/4-days-off every other week, 4-days on/24 days off) may be evaluated one
      dosing schedule at a time or ≥ 2 dosing schedules given in parallel, based on the review of
      available safety, PK, pharmacodynamic (PD), and efficacy data by the SRC.

      Following completion of dose escalation in Part A, selected expansion cohorts will receive
      CC-90010 in Part B. The SRC determined the RP2D for Part B to be 45 mg CC-90010 given once
      daily for 4 consecutive days on followed by 24 consecutive days off (4-days-on/24-days-off)
      in each 28-day cycle. A cohort s of up to approximately 20-25 subjects with relapsed and/or
      refractory DLBCL (Cohort 1) will be enrolled in Part B expansion.

      Enrollment in advanced BCC (Cohort 2) will be stopped due to recruitment challenges. An
      additional cohort of approximately 15 evaluable subjects with R/R DLBCL (Cohort 3) will be
      enrolled under an alternative dosing regimen of 30 mg CC-90010 3days-on/11-days off in each
      28-day cycle. The food effect assessment (Part C, Spain only) will evaluate the impact of
      food on CC-90010 when administered at the RP2D of 45 mg 4-days-on/24-days-off, by comparison
      of PK parameters following fasted and fed (high-fat, high-calorie meal) conditions in
      approximately 24 subjects with advanced solid tumors.

      Follow-up Period:

      In the Follow-up Period, subjects will be followed for 28 days (± 3 days) after the last dose
      of CC-90010 for safety.

      After the Safety Follow-up visit, all subjects will be followed every subsequent 3 months (±
      2 weeks) for survival follow-up for up until 2 years or until death, lost to follow-up, or
      the End of Trial, whichever occurs first.

        significant medical condition that would prevent the subject from participating (or
        compromise compliance) in the study or would place the subject at unacceptable risk if
        he/she were to participate in the study.

        16. Patients with poor bone marrow reserve as assessed by the Investigator such as in the
        following conditions:
