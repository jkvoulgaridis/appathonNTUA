  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a single arm trial with before-after comparison design. Three groups of
      patients with hypertension will be recruited: not taking antihypertension drugs and having
      normal renal function, taking antihypertension drugs and having normal renal function, and
      having abnormal renal function without regards of antihypertension drugs use. Each group
      includes 30 patients. Based on renal function test, the investigators provide the Manlikang
      containing potassium chloride to patients with normal renal function, and provide the
      Manlikang not containing potassium chloride to patients with abnormal renal function. All
      hypertension patients will use the formula salt with very low sodium (Manlikang) for six
      weeks, and will be followed up at 1, 2, 4 and 6 weeks. The primary outcome will be the
      decrease of patients' systolic blood pressure at the end of the trial.
