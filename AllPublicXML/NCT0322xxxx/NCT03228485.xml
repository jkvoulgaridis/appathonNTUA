    <textblock>
      This study assesses the feasibility, and acceptability of a (mobile) application for men
      presenting at their physician's office with LUTS/BPH; starting with medical therapy and naïve
      for treatment. Patients will be enrolled in the study by their physician (GP or urologist).
      The patients will receive a daily medication reminder including frequent feedback on
      medication adherence. Furthermore, standard questionnaires will be filled out via the
      application. The hypothesis of this pilot study is that application is feasible and accepted
      in this group of patients.

      Rationale:

      One of the next developments in healthcare is digitalization, including (mobile) applications
      that could support healthcare providers. A significant number of aging men suffer from lower
      urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), often caused by benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH). LUTS/BPH is
      primarily treated by physicians (GPs or Urologists). Optimal evaluation of patients with
      LUTS/BPH, treatment selection and follow-up by the physicians and medication adherence are
      essential in the management of LUTS. This pilot project represents a strong collaboration
      between a urological association, urologists, and physicians in supporting healthcare
      improvement for LUTS/BPH with the use of a (mobile) application. The hypothesis is that the
      (mobile) application can support the patient in medication adherence and improve the
      adherence by feedback and that the application can help to collect objective disease
      information with electronic questionnaires.

      Objectives:

      The primary objective is to assess the feasibility, and acceptability of a (mobile)
      application for men presenting at their general practitioner/or urologist with LUTS/BPH who
      are either: under treatment, or who may require medical therapy for the first time.

      The secondary objectives are to identify potential gaps, clarify controversial points of the
      application, to document the communication between patients, physicians and supervising
      urologists in order to optimize (if necessary) the application, to assess medication
      adherence and to record if treatment provided by physicians is in compliance with the
      guidelines recommendations.

    <description>The feasibility is assessed by the application use for men presenting at their general practitioner/or urologist with LUTS/BPH who are either: under treatment, or who may require medical therapy for the first time. The patient application will be judged as Definitely Feasible if the study is completed for ≥70% eligible patients, Possibly Feasible (completed for 50-69% eligible patients) or Not Feasible (completed for &lt;50%).</description>

    <description>In order to assess the acceptance and satisfaction of the mobile application including the application subjective quality and perceived impact, a questionnaire will be used. This questionnaire is based on a standardized application rating questionnaire, namely the user Mobile Application Rating Scale (uMARS). Outcomes are described and compared between centers.</description>

        The population will be men, age ≥ 40, presenting at their physician's office with LUTS/BPH
        symptoms and are either: a) treatment naïve for LUTS/BPH or b) under medical treatment.

        The study will be conducted by five centers in five countries: Institute for Monitoring of
        Urogenital Diseases in Larissa, Greece, the Istanbul Medipol University in Turkey, the
        Hospital Universitario la Zarzuela in Spain, the Hospital de San António in Portugal, and
        the University of Florence in Italy. The participating physicians will be from these areas
        and thus so will the participants.
