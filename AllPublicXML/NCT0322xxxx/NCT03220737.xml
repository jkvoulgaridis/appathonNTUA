  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      VAXCHORA (Cholera Vaccine, Live, Oral) is a vaccine indicated for active immunization against
      disease caused by Vibrio cholerae serogroup O1. VAXCHORA is approved for use in adults 18
      through 64 years of age travelling to cholera-affected areas. The primary goals of this Phase
      4 study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of VAXCHORA in children ages 2 years to
      &lt;18 years of age in developed countries.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, single-crossover study with three age cohorts and two treatment groups within each cohort.
The main study consists of a screening period of 30 days, a treatment period from Day 1 to Day 29, and a follow-up period through Day 181. Cohort 1 has an optional sub-study consisting of a long-term follow-up period through Day 730.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>The study will be conducted as a double-blind study through 181, where neither the sponsor, the statistical team, study volunteer subjects, nor clinical site personnel (except for the unblinded staff) will know subjects' treatment assignment. Once each subject has reached their Day 181 visit they will be individually unblinded.</masking_description>
