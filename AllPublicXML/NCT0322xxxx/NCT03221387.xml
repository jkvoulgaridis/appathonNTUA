  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Humidified Nasal High-flow with Oxygen (HNHF-O2) therapy has been reported to have acute
      beneficial effects in patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure who have been hospitalized.
      The usefulness of this therapy in the outpatient setting is unproven. This pilot study will
      test the feasibility of using this therapy in the outpatient setting and its effects on
      sleep.

    <textblock>
      Humidified Nasal High-flow with Oxygen (HNHF-O2) therapy has been reported to have acute
      beneficial effects in patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure. HNHF-O2 may be beneficial
      in patients with COPD and chronic impairments in gas exchange, both hypoxemia as well as
      hypercapnia. HNHF-O2 may decrease work of breathing, reduce dyspnea, improve airway
      humidification, and potentially stabilize or reduce carbon dioxide levels. However, there is
      limited data showing the chronic effects of HNHF-O2 in patients with hypercapnic respiratory
      failure, specifically those discharged to home following hospitalization for an acute
      exacerbation. Data that demonstrates that HNHF-O2 is well tolerated, and stabilizes or
      improves gas exchange long term in patients with COPD is lacking. Similarly, data that
      demonstrates that this therapeutic regimen is feasible to provide to patients in the home
      environment are lacking. This is an open-labeled pilot study of thirty patients to determine
      the safety and feasibility of using the device in the outpatient management of patients with
      COPD. A subset of ten patients will have serial sleep studies to determine the effects, if
      any, on sleep.

    <description>While in the clinic High Flow Nasal Cannula oxygen will be passed through a heated humidifier (AIRVO-2, Fisher and Paykel Healthcare) and applied continuously through large-bore binasal prongs (Optiflow+ Fisher and Paykel Healthcare), with a gas flow rate of 20-35 liters per minute or as high as the patient will tolerate and an FiO2 to keep arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) &gt; 90%. Temperature will be adjusted based on patient's comfort and range from 34-37 degrees based on prior experience. The subject will be discharged to home and instructed to use the high flow nasal cannula system at night and during the daytime while at home and resting.</description>
