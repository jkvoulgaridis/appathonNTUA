  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of two strengths of
      Lacripep™ ophthalmic solution versus placebo administered three times daily for four weeks in
      subjects with a diagnosis of Dry Eye associated with documented Primary Sjögren's Syndrome

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-masked, parallel-group study.
      Subjects will be randomized into three treatment groups: 0.005%, or 0.01% Lacripep™, or
      placebo in a 1:1:1 ratio.

An anchor in the middle at 50 mm representing their symptom severity at the last visit. The 50 mm scale to the left of the anchor located in the center of the scale will measure worsening symptoms (a negative value) and the 50 mm scale to the right of the anchor located in the center of the scale will measure improving symptoms (a positive value).
