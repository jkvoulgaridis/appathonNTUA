  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to learn whether genetics plays a role in predicting response to
      a commonly used and FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approved medication for lowering
      triglycerides and cholesterol. The hypothesis: The pharmacogenetics of genes which affect
      drug metabolism (how the body handles the drug) and drug targets (how the drug acts on the
      body) influences how a person responds to the lipid lowering medication-fenofibrate.

      The investigators seek to screen over 200 subjects for select candidate genes to serve as a
      source of subjects which may participate in a genotype guided investigation as to the
      predictability of response based on genotype. Response endpoints relate to lipid parameters
      and other variables of interest to cardiovascular endpoints. Subjects with genotypes of
      interest would then be enrolled into a short term clinical trial evaluating their response to
      fenofibrate based on their genetic profile ascertained from the screening phase.
