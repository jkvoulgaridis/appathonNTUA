    <textblock>
      This research study will examine the usefulness of groups in reducing stress and helping
      individuals with HIV to stay healthy and avoid problems associated with sexually transmitted
      diseases. We hope to discover whether being in a group is effective in reducing
      stress-related symptoms and promoting healthy behaviors.

    <textblock>
      This is a risk reduction intervention for adults who are living with HIV, are experiencing
      trauma-related stress symptoms, and are at risk for HIV transmission. By first treating
      trauma symptoms, the effects of a skills-building HIV risk reduction intervention for adults
      experiencing trauma-related symptoms such as hyperarousal, dissociation, and avoidance will
      be enhanced. This is based on a model the proposes trauma-related symptoms have direct
      effects on HIV risk behavior. Therefore, the successful treatment of trauma-related symptoms
      will facilitate HIV risk behavior change.

    <description>Participants received standard medical care, which in most clinics included informational brochures provided by physicians and clinic staff. Participants were given HIV prevention information and materials in English and Spanish and were provided referrals for services. Each individual completed assessments at immediate post intervention, 3-, 6-, and 12- months. At the end of the 12-month assessment, the wait-list control participants participated in the Trauma + HIV group arm.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Eight, 90 minute group sessions. Three of the sessions focused on health education (e.g., medication adherence, nutrition, exercise) and five focused on HIV prevention skills (e.g., condom skills, communication, social support). Each individual completed assessments at immediate post intervention, 3-, 6-, and 12- months. At the end of the 12-month assessment, the participants in this arm were given the option to receive the 3 trauma-focused sessions from the Trauma + HIV group arm.</description>

    <description>The same format as the HIV Prevention arm with eight, 90 minute group sessions. The participants received the same five HIV prevention skills sessions along with three sessions that focused on reducing trauma-related stress (e.g., breathing training, relaxation exercises, grounding exercises, coping, trauma-related triggers). Each individual completed assessments at immediate post intervention, 3-, 6-, and 12- months.</description>
