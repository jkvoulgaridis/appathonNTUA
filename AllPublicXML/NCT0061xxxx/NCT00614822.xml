      The purpose of this study is to look for an improvement in progression free survival with the
      combination of bevacizumab, carboplatin and pemetrexed in patients with newly diagnosed
      advanced/metastatic non small cell lung cancer. Overall survival and safety will also be
      assessed.

      Carboplatin: AUC 5 IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1 Pemetrexed: 500mg/M2 IV over 10 minutes on
      day 1 Bevacizumab: 15mg/kg IV over 90 minutes on day 1 (if rate is tolerated the 2nd dose may
      be decreased to 60 minutes and subsequent doses to 30 minutes This regimen will be
      administered every 6 weeks for up to a maximum of 6 cycles if the patient tolerates the
      treatment and has stable disease. Bevacizumab will be continues if tolerated for up to 1 year
      at every 3 week intervals.

      Folic acid 1mg by mouth daily, Vitamin B12 1000 ug IM every 9 weeks and Dexamethasone 4mg by
      mouth twice a day and and antiemetic may be prescribed by the physician investigator to help
      reduce side effects associated with the Pemetrexed. The Folic acid and Vitamin B12 will
      continue until 3 weeks after the end of treatment.

      Physical exams, vital signs and blood work will be done prior to each chemotherapy cycle. A
      urine dipstick to check for protein in the urine will be done prior to the first treatment
      and before cycles 3 and 5. A CAT scan of the chest will be done pretreatment, prior to cycles
      3 and 5 and at the end of treatment.

    <description>A complete response (CR),was disappearance of all target lesions on CT scan and absence of appearance of any new lesion was required. Partial response (PR) was assessed by at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions without appearance of any new lesions. Progressive disease (PD) was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions or the appearance of one or more new lesions. Patients were assessed to have stable disease if neither sufficient decrease to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, without appearance of new lesions. Patients who received one or more cycles were evaluable for response.</description>
