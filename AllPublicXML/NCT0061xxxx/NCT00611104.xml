      RATIONALE: Estrogen can cause the growth of breast cancer cells. Studying samples of blood
      and urine in the laboratory from participants receiving freeze-dried table grape powder may
      help doctors understand the effect of this drug on blood estrogen levels.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying the effect of freeze-dried table grape powder on
      blood estrogen levels in postmenopausal women.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To measure the change in levels of plasma estrone (E1), estradiol, E1-conjugates, and
           E1-sulfates in postmenopausal women after 6 weeks of daily ingestion of 94 grams of
           freeze-dried table grape powder.

        -  To conduct bioavailability research on the freeze-dried table grape powder in humans
           through the analysis of participants' blood and urine samples.

      OUTLINE: Participants receive oral freeze-dried table grape powder once daily on days 1-42 in
      addition to their usual diet. Treatment continues in the absence of toxicity.

      Participants undergo blood sample collection at baseline, periodically after the first dose,
      and on the last day of the study for pharmacokinetic and bioavailability analysis. Samples
      are examined by mass spectrometry to measure plasma levels of estrone (E1), estradiol,
      E1-conjugates, E1-sulfates, testosterone, and androstenedione. Participants also undergo spot
      urine collection and weight and height measurement periodically during study.

      Participants complete food diaries on days 1-3, 21-23, and 40-42 to assess their intake of
      grapes, grape juice, and red wine and to examine the constancy of their caloric intake over
      the course of the study.
