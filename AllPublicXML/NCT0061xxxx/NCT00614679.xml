  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to investigate the ability of systemic intravenous antibiotic plus
      antibiotic/anti-biofilm (i.e. N-acetylcysteine) lock catheter technique in eradicating
      uncomplicated catheter associated bacteremia and salvaging the infected vascular catheter.
      Secondary objectives include duration to clearance of bacteremia, future recurrence of
      bacteremia, need for catheter removal and death.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult patients who have an indwelling hemodialysis catheter for 10 or more days and
             evidence of a catheter associated bloodstream infection as evidenced by 1)quantitative
             blood cultures obtained through the lumen of the catheter yield concentrations of
             bacterial colonies that are 5 or more fold higher than peripheral blood cultures, or
             2)blood cultures obtained through the lumen of the catheter becomes positive 2 or more
             hours earlier than peripheral blood cultures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients will be excluded if 1) they are unable or unwilling to provide informed
             consent, 2) have evidence of a complicated bacteremia such as endocarditis, septic
             thrombophlebitis, septic emboli, osetoemylitis, deep seated abscesses etc 3)evidence
             of an exit site infection around the catheter such as a pus pocket, drainage or
             erythema. 4) patient is allergic to NAC or the proposed antibiotic (if patient is
             allergic to minocycline, tigecycline will not be used). 5) patient is pregnant or will
             become pregnant.
