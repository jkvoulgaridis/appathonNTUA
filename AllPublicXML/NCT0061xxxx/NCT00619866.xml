  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel-group
      study to assess the efficacy and safety of elagolix at two dose levels administered once
      daily for up to 6 months. Participants will be randomized (1:1:1) to one of the following
      treatment groups for the first 12 weeks of dosing: 150 mg elagolix once daily (QD); 250 mg
      elagolix QD or placebo QD. Following 12 weeks of dosing, participants will continue in the
      study for an additional 12 weeks; participants randomized to elagolix will continue to
      receive their assigned dose and participants randomized to placebo will be re-randomized to
      receive one of the two doses of elagolix for 12 weeks in a double-blind fashion. Six weeks
      after the last dose of study drug at the end of Week 24, a follow-up visit will be performed
      (end of Week 30).

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Monthly Mean Non-menstrual Pelvic Pain Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and weeks 4, 8, and 12</time_frame>
    <description>Participants assessed their pelvic pain not related to menses and its impact on their daily activities at approximately the same time every day in an e-Diary according to the following response options:
0 = No pelvic pain
1 = Mild pelvic pain; subject could not do some of the things she usually does
2 = Moderate pelvic pain; subject could not do many of the things she usually does
3 = Severe pelvic pain; subject could not do most or all of the things she usually does.

    <description>Participants assessed dysmenorrhea (pain during menstruation) and its impact on their daily activities at approximately the same time each day in an e-Diary according to the following response options:
Subject is not having her period
0 = No pain related to period
1 = Mild pain related to period; subject could not do some of the things she usually does
2 = Moderate pain related to period; subject could not do many of the things she usually does

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Monthly Mean Total of Dysmenorrhea and Non-menstrual Pelvic Pain Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Weeks 4, 8, and 12</time_frame>
    <description>Participants assessed dysmenorrhea and pelvic pain not related to menses and their impact on daily activities at approximately the same time every day on a 4-point scale (0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe) in an e-Diary.
The sum of the dysmenorrhea and non-menstrual pelvic pain scores on each day were calculated to create a daily total score. On days the participant was not having her period, the dysmenorrhea score was not defined; hence, the total score was equal to the non-menstrual pelvic pain score (range 0 to 3). On days where the participant recorded menstruation the total score ranged from 0 to 6, where higher scores indicate more severe pain. The monthly mean sum of dysmenorrhea and non-menstrual pelvic pain scores is the average of the daily values reported during the 4 weeks prior to each visit.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The EHP-5 is an instrument to measure health-related quality of life in women with endometriosis. The EHP-5 consists of two parts:
A core questionnaire consisting of five questions that measure the areas of pain, control and powerlessness, emotional well-being, social support, and self-image with five response categories for each item (Never, Rarely, Sometimes, Often, Always)
A supplemental questionnaire consisting of six additional questions which assess the areas of work, relationship with children, sexual intercourse, feelings about the medical profession, treatment, and infertility with the same five response categories plus an additional response category of Not Relevant which was not scored.
The scores associated with each possible outcome category are as follows: never (0), rarely (25), sometimes (50), often (75), and always (100). A negative change from baseline score indicates improvement in quality of life.</description>

        <description>The NRS is an 11-point scale used to measure endometriosis pain and was completed at approximately the same time each day using an electronic diary (e-Diary). Participants were instructed to select a single number between 0 (No pain) and 10 (Worst pain ever) that best described their endometriosis pain at its worst over the past day.
The monthly mean NRS is the average of the daily values reported during the 4 weeks prior to each visit.</description>

Participants were instructed to select a single number between 0 (No pain) and 10 (Worst pain ever) that best described their endometriosis pain at its worst over the past day.
The monthly peak NRS is the maximum of the daily values reported during the 4 weeks prior to each visit.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline and Weeks 4, 8, and 12</time_frame>
        <population>All randomized participants who received at least one dose of randomized, double-blind study drug and reported at least 10 e-Diary NRS values during the initial 12 week treatment period. The analysis includes participants with non-missing data at each time point.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Monthly Mean Dysmenorrhea Score</title>
        <description>Participants assessed dysmenorrhea (pain during menstruation) and its impact on their daily activities at approximately the same time each day in an e-Diary according to the following response options:
Subject is not having her period
0 = No pain related to period
1 = Mild pain related to period; subject could not do some of the things she usually does
2 = Moderate pain related to period; subject could not do many of the things she usually does
3 = Severe pain related to period; subject could not do most of or all of the things she usually does.
The monthly mean dysmenorrhea score is the average of the daily values reported during the 4 weeks prior to each visit.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Monthly Mean Total of Dysmenorrhea and Non-menstrual Pelvic Pain Scores</title>
        <description>Participants assessed dysmenorrhea and pelvic pain not related to menses and their impact on daily activities at approximately the same time every day on a 4-point scale (0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe) in an e-Diary.
The sum of the dysmenorrhea and non-menstrual pelvic pain scores on each day were calculated to create a daily total score. On days the participant was not having her period, the dysmenorrhea score was not defined; hence, the total score was equal to the non-menstrual pelvic pain score (range 0 to 3). On days where the participant recorded menstruation the total score ranged from 0 to 6, where higher scores indicate more severe pain. The monthly mean sum of dysmenorrhea and non-menstrual pelvic pain scores is the average of the daily values reported during the 4 weeks prior to each visit.</description>

        <description>The NRS is an 11-point scale used to measure endometriosis pain and was completed at approximately the same time each day using an electronic diary (e-Diary). Participants were instructed to select a single number between 0 (No pain) and 10 (Worst pain ever) that best described their endometriosis pain at its worst over the past day.
The percentage of days a participant reported a value of zero (or &quot;no pain&quot;) for the NRS was calculated for the 4 weeks prior to each visit.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Days With No Pain Based Based on Dysmenorrhea Daily Assessment</title>
        <description>Participants assessed dysmenorrhea (pain during menstruation) and its impact on their daily activities at approximately the same time each day in an e-Diary according to the following response options:
Subject is not having her period
0 = No pain related to period
1 = Mild pain related to period; subject could not do some of the things she usually does
2 = Moderate pain related to period; subject could not do many of the things she usually does
= Severe pain related to period; subject could not do most of or all of the things she usually does.
The percentage of days a participant reported a value of zero (&quot;no pain&quot;) for dysmenorrhea was calculated for the 4 weeks prior to each visit.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Days With No Pain Based Based on Total Score of Non-menstrual Pelvic Pain and Dysmenorrhea Daily Assessment</title>
        <description>Participants assessed dysmenorrhea and pelvic pain not related to menses and their impact on daily activities at approximately the same time every day in an e-Diary on a 4-point scale (0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe). The sum of the dysmenorrhea and non-menstrual pelvic pain scores on each day were calculated to create a daily total score. On days the participant was not having her period, the dysmenorrhea score was not defined; hence, the total score was equal to the non-menstrual pelvic pain score (range 0 to 3). On days where the participant recorded menstruation the total score ranged from 0 to 6, where higher scores indicate more severe pain.
The percentage of days a participant reported a value of zero (&quot;no pain&quot;) for the non-menstrual pelvic pain and dysmenorrhea total score was calculated for the 4 weeks prior to each visit.</description>

The percentage of days of narcotic analgesic use is defined as the number of days in the 4 weeks prior to each study visit that the participant reported the use of a narcotic analgesic, divided by the number of study days in the interval that the participant provided an e-Diary report regarding the use of endometriosis analgesics (including a response of &quot;none&quot;).</description>
          <population>All randomized participants who received at least one dose of randomized, double-blind study drug and reported at least 10 e-Diary NRS values during the initial 12 week treatment period. The analysis includes participants with non-missing data at each time point.</population>

        <description>The CPSSS consists of 5 components that address dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, non-menstrual pelvic pain, pelvic tenderness, and pelvic induration. To assess dyspareunia (painful intercourse) participants were asked to select the best description of pain during sexual intercourse over the past 28 days using the following response categories:
0 = Absent; No discomfort during sexual intercourse.
1 = Mild; I can tolerate the discomfort during sexual intercourse.
2 = Moderate; Intercourse is sometime interrupted due to pain.
3 = Severe; I prefer to avoid intercourse because of pain.
Not applicable. I am not sexually active for reasons other than my endometriosis symptoms.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Endometriosis Health Profile-5 (EHP-5) at Week 12</title>
        <description>The EHP-5 is an instrument to measure health-related quality of life in women with endometriosis. The EHP-5 consists of two parts:
A core questionnaire consisting of five questions that measure the areas of pain, control and powerlessness, emotional well-being, social support, and self-image with five response categories for each item (Never, Rarely, Sometimes, Often, Always)
A supplemental questionnaire consisting of six additional questions which assess the areas of work, relationship with children, sexual intercourse, feelings about the medical profession, treatment, and infertility with the same five response categories plus an additional response category of Not Relevant which was not scored.
The scores associated with each possible outcome category are as follows: never (0), rarely (25), sometimes (50), often (75), and always (100). A negative change from baseline score indicates improvement in quality of life.</description>
