  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with compensated chronic liver disease who have an episode of acute deterioration of
      liver function (acute-on-chronic liver failure) are known to have up to 90% mortality rate.
      Hepa Wash(R) is a newly developed liver and renal support system that is based on the use of
      recycled albumin dialysate. The new system has shown a high detoxification capacity in
      in-vitro and preclinical studies. The aim of the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy
      of the Hepa Wash system in patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure in the intensive care
      unit.

    <description>The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score analyses the severity of illness according to 6 organ systems (CNS, Liver, Kidney, Hemodynamic, Coagulation, Lung). Each system is given 0 to 4 points for a total of 24 points. A value &gt;2 in each of the systems indicates organ failure. An overall value &gt; 14 indicates 90% probability of in-hospital mortality.</description>
