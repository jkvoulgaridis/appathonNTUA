  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a common and potentially fatal chronic disease. An asthma action plan (AAP) is a
      written plan produced by a physician for a patient with asthma, to provide education and
      guidelines for self-management of worsening asthma symptoms. Studies have shown that AAPs
      effectively improve asthma control, but physicians fail to provide AAPs due to lack of time
      and adequate skills. Physicians also often fail to determine if their patients have good
      asthma control, and to adjust medications in response to patients' control level. The
      investigators propose to develop and test a computerized tool that will help physicians to
      determine if their patients' asthma is well controlled, advise them on medication changes
      required according to the current level of control, and automatically generate an electronic
      version of the AAP, all based on patient responses to a questionnaire. The investigators hope
      that this system will eliminate the barriers that physicians face in determining asthma
      control, adjusting medications, and delivering an AAP, and will increase the frequency with
      which physicians are able to achieve these goals in patients with asthma. The objectives of
      the study are to determine the impact of this system on asthma action plan delivery by
      primary care physicians, the frequency of checking control level, and the frequency and
      appropriateness of asthma medication changes (in accordance with control). We will also
      attempt to determine the impact of the system on hospitalisations, emergency room (ER)
      visits, unscheduled visits to the doctor, total visits to the doctor, days off work or
      school, nocturnal asthma symptoms, daytime asthma symptoms, daytime rescue puffer use, and
      quality of life, and to measure physicians' perceptions of and satisfaction with the system.

      This is a 2-year prospective interrupted time series (ITS) study of usual asthma care
      (baseline period) (year 1) compared to care with the eAAPS in place (intervention period)
      (year 2). The setting is two academic family health teams (primary health care teams
      including family physicians, nurses, and allied health members) in Hamilton, Ontario and one
      community-based family health team in Brampton, Ontario.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Recruitment was carried out across two academic family health teams (primary health care teams including family physicians, nurses, and allied health members) in Hamilton, Ontario and one community-based family health team in Brampton, Ontario. Clinics used the OSCAR electronic medical record (EMR) system and were under a capitated funding model.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Only clinicians/practitioners were enrolled in the trial, but data were collected from patients of the clinicians so they are represented as a separate group. All asthma patients of enrolled clinicians were included in the analysis, but patients seen in the baseline/intervention periods were not necessarily the same and their number thus differs.</pre_assignment_details>
