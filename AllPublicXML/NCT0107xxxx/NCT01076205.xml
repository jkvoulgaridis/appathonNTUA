    <description>The WAI is a tool designed to record the work ability of employees and consists of 7 questions. The modified WAI used in this study included Questions 1, 2, 4, 6, and 7 of the WAI. Question 3, which involves the number of current diseases diagnosed by a physician, was omitted because this parameter was unlikely to reflect change due to treatment. Question 5 (sick leave during the past year) was replaced with the previous question concerning sick leave days.WAI scores range from 7 (worst) to 49 (best).</description>

          <title>Work Productivity and Activity Impairment</title>
          <description>The Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI) questionnaire for general health is a validated tool in RA consisting of 6 questions, based on patient recall of the previous 7 days. WPAI assesses work time missed due to illness (absenteeism), impairment at work due to health (presenteeism), total work productivity impairment due to health (an aggregate measure of both absenteeism and presenteeism), and total non-occupational activity impairment due to health. WPAI scores are expressed as impairment percentages, with higher scores indicating worse outcomes.</description>

          <description>The WAI is a tool designed to record the work ability of employees and consists of 7 questions. The modified WAI used in this study included Questions 1, 2, 4, 6, and 7 of the WAI. Question 3, which involves the number of current diseases diagnosed by a physician, was omitted because this parameter was unlikely to reflect change due to treatment. Question 5 (sick leave during the past year) was replaced with the previous question concerning sick leave days. WAI scores range from 7 (worst) to 49 (best).</description>

          <title>Disease Activity Score – 28 Joints (DAS28)</title>
          <description>The DAS28 is a validated index of rheumatoid arthritis disease activity. Twenty-eight tender joint counts, 28 swollen joint counts, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and the patient's assessment of global disease activity are included in the DAS28 score. Scores on the DAS28 range from 0 to 10. A DAS28 score &gt; 5.1 indicates high disease activity, a DAS28 score &lt; 3.2 indicates low disease activity, and a DAS28 score &lt; 2.6 indicates clinical remission.</description>

          <title>Health-Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI)</title>
          <description>The HAQ-DI is a patient-reported assessment of physical function that includes 20 items in eight categories representing a comprehensive set of functional activities, including dressing, eating, walking, and hygiene. Patients are asked about their ability to complete these tasks in the past week on the following scale: without any difficulty (0); with some difficulty (1); with much difficulty (2); and unable to do (3). Scores on each task were summed and averaged to provide an overall score ranging from 0 (best) to 3 (worst), with a higher score representing a high-dependency disability.</description>

          <title>Euroqol Visual Analog Scale (VAS)</title>
          <description>EuroQol-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) is a generic instrument for measuring health-related quality of life. The VAS is a vertical scale ranging from 0 to 100 that provides a patient-reported assessment of overall health. Patients are asked to mark how good or bad their health is on that day, with 100 meaning &quot;the best health you can imagine&quot; and 0 meaning &quot;the worst health you can imagine.&quot;</description>

        <description>The Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI) questionnaire for general health is a validated tool in RA consisting of 6 questions, based on patient recall of the previous 7 days. WPAI assesses work time missed due to illness (absenteeism), impairment at work due to health (presenteeism), total work productivity impairment due to health (an aggregate measure of both absenteeism and presenteeism), and total non-occupational activity impairment due to health.
WPAI scores are expressed as impairment percentages, with higher scores indicating worse outcomes.</description>

        <description>The Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI) questionnaire for general health is a validated tool in RA consisting of 6 questions, based on patient recall of the previous 7 days. WPAI assesses work time missed due to illness (absenteeism), impairment at work due to health (presenteeism), total work productivity impairment due to health (an aggregate measure of both absenteeism and presenteeism), and total non-occupational activity impairment due to health.
WPAI scores are expressed as impairment percentages, with higher scores indicating worse outcomes.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Work Activity Index (WAI)</title>
        <description>The WAI is a tool designed to record the work ability of employees and consists of 7 questions. The modified WAI used in this study included Questions 1, 2, 4, 6, and 7 of the WAI. Question 3, which involves the number of current diseases diagnosed by a physician, was omitted because this parameter was unlikely to reflect change due to treatment. Question 5 (sick leave during the past year) was replaced with the previous question concerning sick leave days.WAI scores range from 7 (worst) to 49 (best).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Disease Activity Score - 28 Joints (DAS28)</title>
        <description>The DAS28 is a validated index of rheumatoid arthritis disease activity. Twenty-eight tender joint counts, 28 swollen joint counts, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and the patient's assessment of global disease activity are included in the DAS28 score. Scores on the DAS28 range from 0 to 10. A DAS28 score &gt; 5.1 indicates high disease activity, a DAS28 score &lt; 3.2 indicates low disease activity, and a DAS28 score &lt; 2.6 indicates clinical remission.</description>

        <description>The HAQ-DI is a patient-reported assessment of physical function that includes 20 items in eight categories representing a comprehensive set of functional activities, including dressing, eating, walking, and hygiene. Patients are asked about their ability to complete these tasks in the past week using the following categories: without any difficulty (0); with some difficulty (1); with much difficulty (2); and unable to do (3). Scores on each task were summed and averaged to provide an overall score ranging from 0 (best) to 3 (worst), with a higher score representing a high-dependency disability.</description>

Scores on each task were summed and averaged to provide an overall score ranging from 0 (best) to 3 (worst), with a higher score representing a high-dependency disability.</description>

        <description>The EuroQol-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) is a generic instrument for measuring health-related quality of life. The patient questionnaire consists of two parts. The first part includes statements for the following five areas (dimensions):
agility/mobility
self-care
usual activities
pain, bodily discomfort
anxiety, depression
For each dimension the patient is asked for a three-level assessment of their health on the current day: &quot;no problems&quot; (1), &quot;some problems&quot; (2), &quot;extreme problems&quot; (3).</description>

        <description>EuroQol-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D): The EQ-5D is a generic instrument for measuring health-related quality of life. The patient questionnaire consists of two parts. The second part is a vertical, thermometer-like, VAS ranging from 0 to 100 that provides a patient-reported assessment of overall health. Patients are asked to mark how good or bad their health is on that day, with 100 meaning &quot;the best health you can imagine&quot; and 0 meaning &quot;the worst health you can imagine.&quot;</description>
