    <textblock>
      Despite the fact that more than 10% of Americans suffer from migraine, this headache disorder
      is often not diagnosed and not appropriately treated. The goal of this proposal is to
      determine whether a migraine protocol designed for use in an emergency room can be used to
      deliver the headache care that many migraine patients never receive. This is a randomized
      trial. Consecutive inadequately treated migraine patients will be randomized to TYPICAL care
      or to COMPREHENSIVE care. Those patients in the comprehensive care arm will receive the
      following intervention: 1) reinforcement of diagnosis, 2) an adaptable online educational
      intervention, reading material, and headache diaries, 3) two migraine specific medications
      and 4) expedited referral to a headache specialist, if needed. Patients in the typical care
      arm will receive whatever intervention the emergency physician feels is most appropriate.
      Headache surveys will be used toll if the protocol improves migraine-related pain and
      functional disability one month after the ER visit.

    <description>This is a standardized instrument commonly used in migraine research. Participants answer 6 Likert questions about the impact of migraine on their daily life. A score of 36, the lowest possible score, indicates minimal functional impairment. A score of 78, the highest possible score, indicates substantial functional impairment</description>

          <title>Pre-existing migraine-related functional impairment as measured by the MIDAS scale</title>
          <description>The Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) Test is a brief, self-administered questionnaire designed to quantify headache-related disability over a 3 month period. It is a 5-question instrument used to determine the severity of the underlying migraine disorder. Each question is scored from 0 to 90; the total minimum and total maximum scores are 0 and 450 respectively. A total score of 0 indicates no impairment. A total score greater than 20 indicates severe migraine related functional impairment.</description>

        <title>Migraine Functional Impairment as Measured by Score on the Headache Impact Test 6 (HIT6) Scale</title>
        <description>This is a standardized instrument commonly used in migraine research. Participants answer 6 Likert questions about the impact of migraine on their daily life. A score of 36, the lowest possible score, indicates minimal functional impairment. A score of 78, the highest possible score, indicates substantial functional impairment</description>
