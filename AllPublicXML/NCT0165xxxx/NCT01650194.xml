  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to explore the safety and tolerability of enzalutamide in
      combination with abiraterone acetate plus prednisone. Subjects diagnosed with cancer of the
      prostate that was getting worse and spreading to the bone despite receiving hormone treatment
      were enrolled and received study treatment until disease progression.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For the study duration, all subjects maintained androgen deprivation with a gonadotropin
      releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist or orchiectomy. Study drug was administered
      until disease progression. Disease progression was defined as a composite endpoint consisting
      of either clinical deterioration, radiographic progression or prostate-specific antigen (PSA)
      progression according to the Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 2 (PCWG2)
      criteria.
