  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is apparent that local control for Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) remains a
      significant problem. Conventional radiation therapy techniques have limitations for the dose
      that can be delivered to a chest tumor mass due to the adjacent dose limiting organs.
      Mounting evidence supports the use of hypofractionated stereotactically delivered radiation
      therapy to control lung cancer with acceptable toxicity profiles.

      Thus the investigators propose to increase the doses of radiation to residual masses of NSCL
      to a BED &gt; 100 Gy by the addition of two fractions of stereotactically delivered boost
      radiation therapy to residual disease post-conventional chemoradiation to at least 59.4 Gy in
      180 cGy fractions. Using the linear quadratic equation to model doses of radiation therapy,
      59.4 Gy would have a BED of approximately 70 Gy. Single fraction stereotactic body radiation
      therapy (SBRT) of 10 Gy would have a BED of approximately 20 Gy. Thus the addition of two
      fractions of 10Gy of SBRT to limited volumes of PET residual disease would theoretically
      result in higher degrees of local control of lung cancer masses, achieving a minimum
      cumulative BED of approximately 110Gy-equivalent.

    <textblock>
      Lung cancer represents one of the most challenging malignancies to manage. Cure rates have
      only marginally improved in the last 20 years. It is the most commonly fatal cancer in both
      men and women with overall 5 year survivals of 15%. Lung cancer kills more Americans than the
      next three most common malignancies combined.

      Most non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) presents at advanced stages. Only approximately 25%
      present with stage I/II disease, 40% with stage III and 35% patients present with stage IV.
      (1) The optimal treatment of stage II/III NSCLC is complex. For those patients who are
      surgical candidates and a complete resection is technically feasible, radical surgery remains
      the standard of care. Traditionally, those patients with multiple N2 nodal levels or T4
      disease are considered inoperable. Given that the average age of patients diagnosed with
      NSCLC is in their mid-60's and usually have long smoking histories, many patients are
      medically inoperable.

Three fractions of 6.5 Gy with inhomogeneity correction will be delivered to the prescription line at the edge of the PTV for a total of 19.5 Gy. This will yield a total BED 102.2 Gy.</description>

          <description>Pneumonitis will be used as a marker of lung toxicity as a result of the Boost treatment. Participants will follow up with their treating physician annually for five years after treatment with SBRT . Any incidence of pneumonitis will be documented. Data will be presented as the percent of subjects receiving SBRT that required treatment for pneumonitis.</description>

        <description>The response rates of the residual primary tumor following SBRT boost will be determined using a modified version of the international criteria proposed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Committee. Data will be presented as the percent of participants with recurrence of the primary tumor after extended follow up, up to 5 years.</description>

Boost Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy: The dose and fractionation scheme utilized will be based on the location of the patientâ€™s residual disease. For patients with:
Peripheral Tumors: Treatment will consist of 2 fractions of radiation, with a minimum of 40 hours separating each fraction. Two fractions of 10 Gy with inhomogeneity correction will be delivered to the prescription line at the edge of the PTV for a total of 20 Gy. This will yield a total BED of 110 Gy.
