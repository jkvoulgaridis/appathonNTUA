      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of the drug isradipine for cognitive
      enhancement in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. Incomplete
      treatment response can be common in these disorders. While there are medications that are
      effective at treating positive symptoms, some other symptoms of the disorders are often left
      only partially treated (cognitive impairment and negative symptoms). This study will begin to
      address if the medication isradipine might help to treat some of the cognitive problems
      associated with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. Isradipine is a medication that
      acts by blocking a specific type of receptor in the brain called a calcium channel. It is
      currently approved by the FDA for hypertension.

    <measure>MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) Change in Neurocognitive/Functional Measures</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and week 4</time_frame>
    <description>MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) as measure of Neurocognitive/Functional Measures is a standardized battery designed to measure cognitive functioning in people with schizophrenia. The MCCB is represented as a composite T score. A t score is a type of standard score computed by multiplying a z-score (how many standard deviations an element is from the mean) by 10 and adding 50.</description>

        <description>MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) as measure of Neurocognitive/Functional Measures is a standardized battery designed to measure cognitive functioning in people with schizophrenia. The MCCB is represented as a composite T score. A t score is a type of standard score computed by multiplying a z-score (how many standard deviations an element is from the mean) by 10 and adding 50.</description>

Isradipine as utilized in this trial will be administered twice daily. Isradipine will be titrated as follows: baseline (week 0) 5 mg/day BID; Week 2 increase to 10 mg/day BID if 5 mg was well-tolerated. Dosing will be flexible based on side effects with a maximum=10 mg/day. If 5 mg cannot be tolerated, the subject will be discontinued.</description>

Isradipine as utilized in this trial will be administered twice daily. Isradipine will be titrated as follows: baseline (week 0) 5 mg/day BID; Week 2 increase to 10 mg/day BID if 5 mg was well-tolerated. Dosing will be flexible based on side effects with a maximum=10 mg/day. If 5 mg cannot be tolerated, the subject will be discontinued.</description>
