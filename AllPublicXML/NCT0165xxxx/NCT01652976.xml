  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine if the study drug, dasatinib, given in
      combination with 5-Fluorouracil, leucovorin and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) will work against
      metastatic pancreatic cancer.

      Dasatinib is a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drug for treating chronic
      myelogenous leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia, however it is not currently approved
      for use in the treatment of pancreatic cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Systemic control of pancreatic cancer remains a clinical unmet need. The recent superiority
      of 5-FU based combination therapies over the historical standard gemcitabine represents an
      opportunity to develop novel combinations of synergistic and effective cytotoxic and biologic
      targeted therapies. Src excess activity has been demonstrated in pancreatic cancer and is
      implicated in the invasive and metastatic phenotype clearly represented by this disease.
      Inhibition of Src activity is associated with numerous biologic modifications capable of
      positively modifying this phenotype and appears to have synergy with restoring inherent
      chemosensitivity. The addition of dasatinib to FOLFOX (FOLFOX-D) represents a novel
      therapeutic regimen in pancreatic cancer with safety and pharmacokinetic data already having
      been established in colorectal cancer. This protocol will test the safety and activity of
      this combination in pancreatic cancer where current clinical outcomes remain far from
      optimal.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Response Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>To determine the response rate (RR) by RECIST 1.1 criteria. The response rate is the number of subjects who had either a complete or partial response by RECIST 1.1 criteria. RECIST 1.1 criteria defines a partial response as a decrease of the sum of the largest diameter each target lesion by at least 30%. A complete response is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions (except lymph nodes, whose short axis must measure 10 mm or less). The imaging modality used for all RECIST assessments in this study was CT.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Freedom From Metastasis</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>To determine the rate of freedom from metastasis (FFM), which is defined as the percentage of subjects with documented progressive disease (by RECIST 1.1 criteria) who had no new lesions. RECIST 1.1 criteria defines progressive disease as the appearance of one or more new lesions and/or the increase of the sum of the largest diameter of the target lesions by at least 20% from the smallest sum collected (the sum must also have increased by at least 5 mm).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Median Time To Progression</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>To determine the median time to progression (TTP). TTP is defined as the time (in months) from when a subject achieves either a complete or partial response by RECIST 1.1 criteria until progressive disease (by RECIST 1.1 criteria) or death occurs.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Benefit Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>To determine the clinical benefit rate (CBR). The CBR is defined as the percentage of subjects who achieved either a complete or partial response or stable disease by RECIST 1.1 criteria. RECIST 1.1 criteria defines a partial response as a decrease of the sum of the largest diameter each target lesion by at least 30%. A complete response is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions (except lymph nodes, whose short axis must measure 10 mm or less). By RECIST 1.1 criteria, a subject is considered to have stable disease when the sum of the largest diameter of the target lesions has neither decreased enough to qualify as a partial response not increased enough to qualify as progressive disease.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Site of Failure</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>To determine the site of failure of this regimen in this population. The site of failure is the anatomical site(s) where disease progression by RECIST 1.1 criteria was noted on imaging.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Safety and Tolerability</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>To determine the safety profile and tolerability of this regimen in this population by evaluating acute treatment related toxicities using CTCAE v4.0 criteria. Using the CTCAE v4.0, the severity of each adverse event reported was graded on a scale of 1 (mild severity) to 5 (fatal). For this outcome measure the percentage of subjects experiencing any adverse event of each CTCAE grade was tabulated.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Drug Compliance</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>To determine patient compliance with oral therapy. For this outcome measure, compliance with oral therapy is defined as the percentage of subjects that took dasatinib for at least one cycle. Compliance with oral therapy was documented with a medication diary that subjects were asked to complete to document whether each dose of dasatinib was taken.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life, as Measured by the Cancer Therapy Satisfaction Questionnaire (CTSQ), 2007</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>To determine the quality of life (QOL) of patients receiving this therapy using the CTSQ questionnaire. The CTSQ consists of 16 questions where subjects respond with a score on a scale of 0 (worst)-4 (best). The responses to the questions are used to calculate 3 subscores: Expectations of Therapy (ET), Feelings about Side Effects (FSE), and Satisfaction with Therapy (SWT). Each subscore is calculated by multiplying the mean response value for the questions used to calculate that subscore by 25. The maximum value is 100 and the minimum value is 0 for all 3 subscores. A higher subscore indicates better QOL in that area. The mean difference in each of the 3 subscores from baseline and 95% confidence interval for the entire study population is reported here. A negative mean difference indicates a decrease from baseline in QOL for that area.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life, as Measured by the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy; Hepatobiliary Cancer (FACT-Hep) Questionnaire (Version 4.0)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The FACT-Hep consists of 45 questions where subjects respond with a score on a scale of 0 (worst)-4 (best). The responses to the questions are summed to calculate 5 subscores: Physical Well-Being (PWB), Social Well-Being (SWB), Emotional Well-Being (EWB), Functional Well-Being (FWB), and Hepatobiliary Cancer Subscale (HCS). The mean difference in each of the 5 subscores from baseline, as well as the total score of the 5 subscores (the FACT-Hep Total Score) for the entire study population is reported here. The mean difference in the FACT-G Total Score (calculated by summing the PWB, SWB, EWB, and FWB subscores) is also reported here. A negative mean difference indicates a decrease from baseline in QOL. Score ranges- PWB subscore: 0-28, SWB subscore: 0-28, EWB subscore: 0-24, FWB subscore: 0-28, HCS subscore: 0-72, FACT-G Total Score: 0-108, and FACT-Hep Total Score: 0-180. A higher value for each subscore or total score indicates better QOL.</description>

0 = Normal activity
= Fully active, able to carry on all pre-disease performance without restriction; Restricted in physically strenuous activity, but ambulatory and able to carry out work of a light or sedentary nature
= In bed &lt; 50% of the time; ambulatory and capable of all self-care, but unable to carry out any work activities</description>

The CBR is defined as the percentage of subjects who achieved either a complete or partial response or stable disease by RECIST 1.1 criteria. RECIST 1.1 criteria defines a partial response as a decrease of the sum of the largest diameter each target lesion by at least 30%. A complete response is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions (except lymph nodes, whose short axis must measure 10 mm or less). By RECIST 1.1 criteria, a subject is considered to have stable disease when the sum of the largest diameter of the target lesions has neither decreased enough to qualify as a partial response not increased enough to qualify as progressive disease.</description>

          <title>Clinical Benefit Rate</title>
          <description>To determine the clinical benefit rate (CBR). The CBR is defined as the percentage of subjects who achieved either a complete or partial response or stable disease by RECIST 1.1 criteria. RECIST 1.1 criteria defines a partial response as a decrease of the sum of the largest diameter each target lesion by at least 30%. A complete response is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions (except lymph nodes, whose short axis must measure 10 mm or less). By RECIST 1.1 criteria, a subject is considered to have stable disease when the sum of the largest diameter of the target lesions has neither decreased enough to qualify as a partial response not increased enough to qualify as progressive disease.</description>

        <title>Quality of Life, as Measured by the Cancer Therapy Satisfaction Questionnaire (CTSQ), 2007</title>
        <description>To determine the quality of life (QOL) of patients receiving this therapy using the CTSQ questionnaire. The CTSQ consists of 16 questions where subjects respond with a score on a scale of 0 (worst)-4 (best). The responses to the questions are used to calculate 3 subscores: Expectations of Therapy (ET), Feelings about Side Effects (FSE), and Satisfaction with Therapy (SWT). Each subscore is calculated by multiplying the mean response value for the questions used to calculate that subscore by 25. The maximum value is 100 and the minimum value is 0 for all 3 subscores. A higher subscore indicates better QOL in that area. The mean difference in each of the 3 subscores from baseline and 95% confidence interval for the entire study population is reported here. A negative mean difference indicates a decrease from baseline in QOL for that area.</description>

        <title>Quality of Life, as Measured by the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy; Hepatobiliary Cancer (FACT-Hep) Questionnaire (Version 4.0)</title>
        <description>The FACT-Hep consists of 45 questions where subjects respond with a score on a scale of 0 (worst)-4 (best). The responses to the questions are summed to calculate 5 subscores: Physical Well-Being (PWB), Social Well-Being (SWB), Emotional Well-Being (EWB), Functional Well-Being (FWB), and Hepatobiliary Cancer Subscale (HCS). The mean difference in each of the 5 subscores from baseline, as well as the total score of the 5 subscores (the FACT-Hep Total Score) for the entire study population is reported here. The mean difference in the FACT-G Total Score (calculated by summing the PWB, SWB, EWB, and FWB subscores) is also reported here. A negative mean difference indicates a decrease from baseline in QOL. Score ranges- PWB subscore: 0-28, SWB subscore: 0-28, EWB subscore: 0-24, FWB subscore: 0-28, HCS subscore: 0-72, FACT-G Total Score: 0-108, and FACT-Hep Total Score: 0-180. A higher value for each subscore or total score indicates better QOL.</description>

          <title>Quality of Life, as Measured by the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy; Hepatobiliary Cancer (FACT-Hep) Questionnaire (Version 4.0)</title>
          <description>The FACT-Hep consists of 45 questions where subjects respond with a score on a scale of 0 (worst)-4 (best). The responses to the questions are summed to calculate 5 subscores: Physical Well-Being (PWB), Social Well-Being (SWB), Emotional Well-Being (EWB), Functional Well-Being (FWB), and Hepatobiliary Cancer Subscale (HCS). The mean difference in each of the 5 subscores from baseline, as well as the total score of the 5 subscores (the FACT-Hep Total Score) for the entire study population is reported here. The mean difference in the FACT-G Total Score (calculated by summing the PWB, SWB, EWB, and FWB subscores) is also reported here. A negative mean difference indicates a decrease from baseline in QOL. Score ranges- PWB subscore: 0-28, SWB subscore: 0-28, EWB subscore: 0-24, FWB subscore: 0-28, HCS subscore: 0-72, FACT-G Total Score: 0-108, and FACT-Hep Total Score: 0-180. A higher value for each subscore or total score indicates better QOL.</description>
