  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the efficacy of the drug Amantadine for the treatment
      of freezing of gait in patients with Parkinson's Disease. The investigators hypothesize that
      amantadine is useful for management of freezing of gait in subjects with Parkinson's Disease.

    <measure>Timed Up and Go (TUG) - ON Usual Medication</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, change at 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This is a walking assessment. The subject will begin in the seated position, stand up, walk 7 meters, turn around, and sit back down. The entire process from leaving the chair to returning to the chair will be timed. Also, the Timed Up and Go (TUG) will be done both in the ON and OFF states.</description>

    <measure>Timed Up and Go (TUG) - OFF Usual Medication</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, change at 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This is a walking assessment. The subject will begin in the seated position, stand up, walk 7 meters, turn around, and sit back down. The entire process from leaving the chair to returning to the chair will be timed. Also, the Timed Up and Go (TUG) will be done both in the ON and OFF states.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Modified Timed Up and Go (mTUG)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, change in 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The subject sits in the chair approximately 3 1/2 meters away from doorway with the door closed. Subject then stands up and walks one meter to a 40cm X 40cm box taped on the floor. Within the box the patient turns clockwise (360 degrees), then turns counterclockwise (360 degrees). Walk to open the door and walk through the doorway, turn around and return to the chair. Modified Timed Up and Go (mTUG) completed in three components including walking the course without additional tasks, carrying a tray with a cup of water, and counting backwards from 100, in both ON and OFF state.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Analysis of Motor Functioning Using the Parkinson's Home Diaries</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, change in 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Subject will record motor activity as OFF, ON (mobility improved) or asleep on the diary every half hour for two days. Subjects further define ON time according to dyskinesia categories &quot;none&quot;, &quot;non-troublesome&quot; or &quot;troublesome.&quot; The home diaries are used as an evaluation measure of the intervention by assessing the change in off time and change in on time with troublesome dyskinesia. The difference in time experiencing dyskinesia while ON meds relative to the time OFF meds at baseline and at 4 weeks is compared.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Freezing of Gait Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, change in 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A questionnaire that is used to assess the likelihood of the subject freezing in a number of different scenarios.
0=No freezing of gait to 24=severe freezing of gait</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impression (CGI)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Global Improvement is the second scale in the clinical global impression (CGI). Total overall improvement is judged by whether or not, in the judgment of the assessor, the improvement is entirely due to the drug treatment. It is also a 1-7 point weighted scale, going from &quot;very much improved&quot; (1) to &quot;very much worse&quot; (7). A zero score is assigned if the score is not assessed.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39 (PDQ-39)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39 (PDQ39) is a copyrighted instrument to assess symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) with 39 questions relating to mobility, activities of daily living, emotional well-being, social support, cognition, communication and bodily discomfort. The test asks subjects to rate each question regarding their Parkinson's disease symptoms over the past month. (range 0 to 100, lower scores reflect better quality of life)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Gait Analysis Testing</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 4, week 7, week 11</time_frame>
    <description>Use of an accelerometer such as Motorola Droid and wireless acceleration sensors to record gait parameters step time, walking speed, and cadence during the timed up and go (TUG) and modified timed up and go (mTUG) components. The sensors will be attached to the subject's legs and trunk using Velcro straps. The accelerometer will be held or clipped onto the subject in order to measure his or her acceleration. This is done within clinic and during the visit time.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, change in 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A questionnaire used to discriminate between Parkinson Disease (PD) patients with fatigue and those without fatigue. Range 9 to 63, higher scores indicate greater fatigue severity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number Who Completed Medication as Randomized</measure>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Drug Safety Reports</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Analyzing the safety of the medication, Amantadine. Data regarding the medication will be collected from the patient on each visit including any adverse events since the last visit, frequency and severity of falls. This is done in order to determine the safety of Amantadine.</description>

        <title>Analysis of Motor Functioning Using the Parkinson's Home Diaries</title>
        <description>Subject will record motor activity as OFF, ON (mobility improved) or asleep on the diary every half hour for two days. Subjects further define ON time according to dyskinesia categories &quot;none&quot;, &quot;non-troublesome&quot; or &quot;troublesome.&quot; The home diaries are used as an evaluation measure of the intervention by assessing the change in off time and change in on time with troublesome dyskinesia. The difference in time experiencing dyskinesia while ON meds relative to the time OFF meds at baseline and at 4 weeks is compared.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, change in 4 weeks</time_frame>
        <population>patients who report being ON and OFF medication and experience dyskinesia under either condition at baseline and after 4 weeks of either Amantadine or Placebo.
NOTE: only one patient reported both dyskinesia at baseline and 4 weeks and only under the placebo condition. Others did not report any OFF time, so the difference could not be calculated.</population>

          <title>Analysis of Motor Functioning Using the Parkinson's Home Diaries</title>
          <description>Subject will record motor activity as OFF, ON (mobility improved) or asleep on the diary every half hour for two days. Subjects further define ON time according to dyskinesia categories &quot;none&quot;, &quot;non-troublesome&quot; or &quot;troublesome.&quot; The home diaries are used as an evaluation measure of the intervention by assessing the change in off time and change in on time with troublesome dyskinesia. The difference in time experiencing dyskinesia while ON meds relative to the time OFF meds at baseline and at 4 weeks is compared.</description>
          <population>patients who report being ON and OFF medication and experience dyskinesia under either condition at baseline and after 4 weeks of either Amantadine or Placebo.
NOTE: only one patient reported both dyskinesia at baseline and 4 weeks and only under the placebo condition. Others did not report any OFF time, so the difference could not be calculated.</population>
