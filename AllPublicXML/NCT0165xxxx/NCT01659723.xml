  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the relief of symptoms after Hyperbaric
      Oxygen Therapy (HBOT) in patients with late radiation cystitis by having Expanded Prostate
      cancer Index Composite (EPIC)symptom estimation scale as primary variable.

      Study hypothesis:

        -  HBOT can reduce or reverse the change or otherwise limit the damage of the bladder
           function and/or structure, which arose as a result of radiation therapy of cancer in the
           pelvic region organs.

        -  The effects of HBOT are associated with relief of symptoms that, at least in part, is
           related to the reduction of the extent of the radiation damage.

        -  Vascular density increases, fibrosis prevalence and inflammatory activity are reduced as
           a sign of an improved function of the mucosa.

        -  Treatment results of HBOT remains, in whole or in part, during the follow-up (residual
           effect)

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Radiotherapy is commonly used in the management of malignant diseases. Despite a continuous
      improvement of the technique, with improved efficacy and tolerance, adverse effects are still
      rather common. The urinary bladder and rectum are the major organs most commonly affected by
      radiotherapy to the pelvis area.

      One of the most significant causes of the symptoms of radio therapy is inflammation and
      degeneration of blood vessels in the radiated tissue. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy involves
      administration of oxygen at greater than normal atmospheric pressures. A well-documented
      effect of HBOT is the stimulation of angiogenesis. HBOT is an established treatment for
      degeneration of blood vessels in the jaw bone as a result of radiotherapy and several
      publications have shown good efficacy also when soft tissue is affected.

      If the method of treatment with HBOT means a reduction of the radiotherapy side effect it is
      thus an obvious importance for the individual patient. There is also significant potential
      savings for the healthcare and society.

    <description>EPIC was developed to measure health-related quality of life among men with prostate cancer (22) modified to enhance sensitivity to therapy effects. It comprises four summary domains; urinary, bowel, sexual and hormonal.
The primary objective of this study is to assess the relief of symptoms after HBOT in patients with late radiation cystitis by having EPIC symptom estimation scale as primary variable, comparing results between group A (post treatment) and group B (pre treatment).
All patients (Group A and B) will complete EPIC and SF-36 in a post-study long-term follow-up. This is done yearly for 5 years (18, 30, 42, 54 and 66 months post inclusion).</description>

    <measure>RTOG (Radiation Toxicity Grade by Radiation Therapy Oncology Group)</measure>
    <time_frame>At inclusion and 6 months after inclusion (i.e. post treatment for group A and pre treatment for group B)</time_frame>
    <description>RTOG is an internationally well established research group in the oncology field. They have developed organ specific scales for quantification of both acute and late symptoms after radiation. The scale range is from 0 to 5, where 0 is used for normal function and findings and 5 for death directly related to injuries post radiation. Both subjective and objective findings are used when setting the score.
Comparison will be made between Group A (post treatment) and Group B (pre treatment)</description>

    <description>SF-36 is a self-administered questionnaire and contains 36 items which measure eight dimensions and assess health-related quality of life. Comparing results between Group A (post treatment) and Group B (pre treatment).
All patients (Group A and B) will complete EPIC and SF-36 in a post-study long-term follow-up. This is done yearly for 5 years (18, 30, 42, 54 and 66 months post inclusion).</description>
