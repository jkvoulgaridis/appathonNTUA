  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if rice enriched in iron will help women with
      iron-deficient anemia restore their blood counts more efficiently than the standard rice not
      enriched with iron.

      The study will consist of 1 screening visit and 3 study visits. The two-week study will be
      scheduled to be between menses.

      You will then be assigned to eat regular rice dishes or rice dishes fortified with iron for
      the two-week period. The assignment to the rice group will be made randomly (like flipping a
      coin). Your chance of being in either rice group will be 50:50. You will be given 14 frozen
      rice meals in styrofoam containers to take home. You will be expected to eat two rice dishes
      per day for the next study week and to bring the empty containers to your next study visit.

    <measure>Change in reticulocyte count.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 1 and 2 weeks following consumption of 2 servings</time_frame>
    <description>Change in reticulocyte typically count in the iron-fortified rice group compared to the regular rice group. This is a test that measures how rapidly immature red blood cells called reticulocytes are made by the bone marrow and released into the blood.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in serum iron</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 1 and 2 weeks following consumption</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in serum iron is a medical laboratory test that measures the amount of circulating iron in the blood; in the fortified rice group compared to the regular rice group.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Transferrin</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 1 and 2 weeks following consumption</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in transferrin (a protein that transports iron in the body ) in the fortified rice group compared to the regular rice group.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hemoglobin</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 1 and 2 weeks following consumption</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in hemoglobin (The key protein in red blood cells to which oxygen attaches) in the fortified rice group compared to the regular rice group.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hematocrit</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 1 and 2 weeks following consumption</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in hematocrit (the proportion of your total blood volume that is composed of red blood cells) in the fortified rice group compared to the regular rice group.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Corpuscular Volume</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 1 and 2 weeks following consumption</time_frame>
