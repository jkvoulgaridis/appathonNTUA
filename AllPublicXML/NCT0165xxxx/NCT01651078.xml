    <textblock>
      The need for new technologies and devices in the field of neurosurgery is well established.
      In April 2013, FDA cleared NeuroBlate™ System, minimally invasive robotic laser thermotherapy
      tool. It employs a pulsed surgical laser to deliver targeted energy to abnormal brain tissue
      caused by tumors and lesions. This post-marketing, multi-center study will include patients
      with metastatic tumors who failed stereotactic radiosurgery and are already scheduled for
      NeuroBlate procedure. The study will collect clinical outcome, Quality of Life (QoL) and,
      where feasible, healthcare utilization data for publication.

    <measure>Percentage of Patients With Progression-Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Images were collected at 12 and 26 weeks post index procedure.</time_frame>
    <description>To describe local (CNS) progression-free survival rate in patients with failed radiosurgery for brain metastases treated with the NeuroBlate System. Sites were requested to submit imaging to a centralized core laboratory for analysis. A total of 27 patients had images submitted--27/42 (64%) of patients submitted follow-up images at 12-weeks and 16/42 (38%) patients submitted follow-up imaging at 26 weeks. Due to the low submission of follow-up images at 26-weeks, 12-weeks and last follow-up are reported.</description>

    <measure>Quality of Life (Change in The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Brain (FACT-Br) Score.</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 12 and 26 weeks post index procedure</time_frame>
    <description>FACT-Br questionnaire sub-scores (Physical well-being, social/family well-being, emotional well-being, functional well-being, brain cancer subscale) are summed together, leading to a FACT-Br total score on a scale from 0-200; larger scores indicate better overall quality of life. This outcome measured the FACT-Br score change from Baseline at both 12 and 26 weeks post NeuroBlate procedure (values at 12 and 26 weeks, respectively, minus value at baseline). Version 4 of the Fact-BR scoring guidelines were used.</description>

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient has signed and received a copy of the Informed Consent Form

          2. Patient may have up to 3 target supratentorial metastatic lesions previously treated
             with stereotactic radiosurgery, with radiological evidence of progression,
             pseudoprogression or radionecrosis. Subject may have additional non target lesions
             present as long as they are not expected (in Investigator's judgment) to contribute to
             symptomatology during the course of the study or confound interpretation of
             radiological and clinical measures.

          3. Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) ≥ 60.

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Females who are pregnant, breast feeding, or plan to become pregnant in the 6 months
             following index procedure.

          2. Leptomeningeal metastases.

          3. Uncontrolled infectious process.

          4. Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic &gt;180 mm Hg), angina pectoris, or cardiac
             dysrhythmia, or recent (within 6 weeks) history of intracranial hemorrhage.

          5. Serious infection, immunosuppression or concurrent medical condition (chronic or acute
             in nature) that may prevent safe participation or ability to meet follow-up
             requirements.

          6. Abnormal absolute neutrophil count (ANC&lt;1000/mm), platelets (&lt;100,000/mm) or the
             administration of antiplatelet agents (aspirin, plavix etc) or anticoagulation within
             7 days prior to treatment.

          7. Inadequate bone marrow, liver and renal function (e.g., total bilirubin &gt; 1.5 x ULN;
             AST, ALT &gt; 2.5 x ULN; alkaline phosphatase &gt; 2.5 x ULN; serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 x ULN).

      <recruitment_details>Forty-four (44) patients were enrolled between October 2012 and December 2015 across six centers in the United States (per the protocol, LAASR enrolled all patients who were scheduled to undergo a NeuroBlate procedure). Forty-two (42) patients underwent the procedure and were followed under the protocol as the &quot;NeuroBlate Procedure&quot; treatment arm.</recruitment_details>

This outcome measured the FACT-Br score change from Baseline at both 12 and 26 weeks post NeuroBlate procedure (values at 12 and 26 weeks, respectively, minus value at baseline). Version 4 of the Fact-BR scoring guidelines were used.</description>
