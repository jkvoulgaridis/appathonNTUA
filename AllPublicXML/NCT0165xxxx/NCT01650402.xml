  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial examines if lowering and maintaining 24-hour ambulatory
      systolic blood pressure to &lt;130 mmHg (intensive control) versus &lt;145 mmHg (standard control)
      slows/halts the progression of deterioration of mobility and cognitive function linked to
      white-matter disease (also known as white-matter hyperintensity or WMH) in patients with
      normal or mildly impaired mobility and cognition in subjects with detectable cerebrovascular
      disease (&gt;0.5% WMH fraction of intracranial contents). The study patients will be enrolled
      and randomized to one of two levels of ambulatory blood pressure control (intensive to
      achieve a goal 24-hour systolic blood pressure of &lt; 130 mmHg or standard to achieve a goal
      24-hour systolic blood pressure of &lt; 145 mmHg) for a total of 36 months.

      The study patients will be enrolled and randomized to one of two levels of ambulatory BP
      control (intensive to achieve a goal 24-hour systolic BP of &lt; 130 mmHg or standard to achieve
      a goal 24-hour systolic BP of &lt; 145 mmHg) for a total of 36 months. Similar antihypertensive
      regimens will be used in both of the treatment groups. Titration of antihypertensive
      therapies will be performed at monthly intervals for the first 3 to 6 months
      post-randomization to achieve goal systolic BP. The primary and secondary outcomes will be
      evaluated at baseline, and following 18 months and 36 months of therapy.
