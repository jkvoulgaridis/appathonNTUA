  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Of the 5.7 million stroke survivors in the United States, up to 80% exhibit significant
      weakness in one arm (called &quot;hemiparesis&quot;). This devastating impairment undermines
      performance of valued activities and quality of life. Although rehabilitation is commonly
      provided, conventional affected arm rehabilitative strategies have negative evidence, or no
      evidence, supporting their use. Thus, there remains a need for evidence-based rehabilitative
      strategies for arm hemiparesis.

      Newer rehabilitative approaches emphasize repetitive, task-specific practice (RTP)
      incorporating the affected arm. However, many of these promising regimens require
      participation in intensive therapies, and most are only efficacious on the least impaired
      patients. Thus, there remains a need for an efficacious, practical RTP technique to address
      moderate affected arm hemiparesis.

      To address the above shortfalls, one of the investigators team members piloted an innovative
      brace integrating electromyography (EMG) and robotics. In his case series, 8 stroke patients
      exhibiting moderate arm impairment successfully participated in RTP, with the brace (called
      the &quot;Myomo&quot;) detecting and augmenting their movement attempts. Aided by the Myomo,
      participation in the RTP regimen reduced subjects' affected arm impairment and spasticity.
      The next logical step is to test Myomo + RTP efficacy using randomized controlled methods and
      an appropriate sample size.

      The primary objective of this small efficacy study is to collect randomized, controlled pilot
      data estimating clinical effectiveness of this combined, EMG/robotics approach in conjunction
      with RTP. A unique adjunct will be acquisition of biomechanical data as an outcome measure.
      Based on pilot data, the central hypothesis is that Myomo therapy with RTP will exhibit
      significant impairment reductions. We will test the central hypothesis and accomplish the
      objective by pursuing the following specific aims:

      Specific Aim 1: Compare efficacy of Myomo + RTP with RTP only and Myomo only on affected arm
      impairment. Thirty stroke patients exhibiting moderate affected arm deficits will be randomly
      assigned to receive: (a) Myomo combined with RTP (Myomo + RTP); (b) RTP only (RTP), which
      constitutes the most frequently used regimen in clinical environments;2,3 or (c) Myomo
      therapy only (Myomo). The current study design will determine the additive effect of Myomo
      training to RTP, while also discerning the relative efficacy of RTP only or Myomo use only.
      The intended duration of contact will be equivalent across groups.

      Affected arm impairment, the primary study outcome, will be measured by the upper extremity
      section of the Fugl-Meyer Impairment Scale (FM), the primary outcome measure. The FM will be
      administered by a blinded rater twice before intervention, immediately post-intervention
      (POST), and two months post-intervention (POST-2) with POST serving as the primary study
      endpoint. The primary study hypothesis is that subjects in the Myomo + RTP group will exhibit
      significantly larger FM score changes than Myomo or RTP subjects at POST. It is also
      hypothesized that these changes will be sustained at POST-2.

      Specific Aim 2: Determine the impact of Myomo + RTP on affected arm outcomes. The
      investigators will administer the Arm Motor Ability Test (AMAT), to all subjects before
      intervention, at POST, and at POST-2. When compared to their scores before intervention, it
      is hypothesized that Myomo + RTP subjects will exhibit significantly larger AMAT score
      changes,than subjects in the other groups at POST. These differences will be sustained at
      POST-2.

    <description>The upper extremity section of the Fugl-Meyer Scale (FM) will assess whether changes occur in paretic upper extremity motor impairment. The FM has been used extensively in stroke recovery studies, and is highly recommended for &quot;use in clinical trials designed to evaluate changes in motor impairment following stroke.&quot; The items on the measure require the subject to perform various movements with the affected upper extremity, and each item is scored from 0 (cannot perform) to 2 (performs normally). Item are then summed for a total score. The total score ranges are 0 to 66, with a higher score representing less upper extremity impairment (and, thus, a relatively &quot;better&quot; score on the measure than a lower score).</description>

    <time_frame>Administered twice before the intervention period. These two scores are averaged to provide a composite score that is compared to average score for each group that is collected 1 week after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Arm Motor Activity Test (AMAT) was the secondary outcome for this study and was used to determine whether changes occur in activity limitation. The AMAT is a 13-item test in which valued activities are rated according to a functional ability scale that examines affected limb use 0 = no use, 1 = very slight use, 2 = slight use, 3 = moderate use, 4 = almost normal use, 5 = normal use;) and a Quality of Movement Scale (0 = no use, 1 = very poor, 2 = poor, 3 = fair, 4 = almost normal, 5 = normal. ). Therefore, the highest score that one can attain on either scale is 65.0 (which would mean that the person scored a perfect score of &quot;5&quot; on each of the thirteen items).</description>

        <title>Impairment in the Affected Upper Extremity as Measured by the Fugl Meyer Scale.</title>
        <description>The upper extremity section of the Fugl-Meyer Scale (FM) will assess whether changes occur in paretic upper extremity motor impairment. The FM has been used extensively in stroke recovery studies, and is highly recommended for &quot;use in clinical trials designed to evaluate changes in motor impairment following stroke.&quot; The items on the measure require the subject to perform various movements with the affected upper extremity, and each item is scored from 0 (cannot perform) to 2 (performs normally). Item are then summed for a total score. The total score ranges are 0 to 66, with a higher score representing less upper extremity impairment (and, thus, a relatively &quot;better&quot; score on the measure than a lower score).</description>
        <time_frame>Administered twice before the intervention period. These two scores are averaged to provide a composite score that is compared to average score for each group that is collected 1 week after intervention</time_frame>

        <title>Arm Motor Ability Test (AMAT)</title>
        <description>The Arm Motor Activity Test (AMAT) was the secondary outcome for this study and was used to determine whether changes occur in activity limitation. The AMAT is a 13-item test in which valued activities are rated according to a functional ability scale that examines affected limb use 0 = no use, 1 = very slight use, 2 = slight use, 3 = moderate use, 4 = almost normal use, 5 = normal use;) and a Quality of Movement Scale (0 = no use, 1 = very poor, 2 = poor, 3 = fair, 4 = almost normal, 5 = normal. ). Therefore, the highest score that one can attain on either scale is 65.0 (which would mean that the person scored a perfect score of &quot;5&quot; on each of the thirteen items).</description>
