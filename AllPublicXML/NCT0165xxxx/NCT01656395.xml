  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This adaptive design, dose-ranging study of MK-1029 will assess the dose-related efficacy and
      safety of MK-1029 compared with placebo using measures of lung function (forced expiratory
      volume in 1 second [FEV1]). The primary objectives are (1) To demonstrate that MK-1029,
      compared with placebo, results in dose-related improvements in FEV1 over the last 6 weeks of
      the 12-week active-treatment period; and (2) To determine the dose-related safety and
      tolerability of MK-1029 as monotherapy and as concomitant dosing with montelukast over 12
      weeks. The primary hypothesis is: MK-1029 is superior to placebo in a dose-related fashion in
      the average change from baseline in FEV1 over the last 6 weeks of the 12-week
      active-treatment period.

    <time_frame>Baseline and last six weeks of treatment (visits at Week 6, Week 8, Week 10 and Week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 is the amount of air (in liters) forcibly exhaled in one second. Repeated measurements of FEV1 were collected at visits during the 12 week active treatment period and the average change from baseline in FEV1 over the last 6 weeks of the 12-week-treatment period (visits at Week 6, Week 8, Week 10 and Week 12) was estimated using a constrained longitudinal data analysis (cLDA) model. In the cLDA analysis, baseline was the average FEV1 during the placebo run-in period and the post-baseline value was the average FEV1 over Week 6 to Week 12.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Asthma Exacerbation Days</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 6 to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>An asthma exacerbation day was defined as a day with ANY of the following: a decrease from Baseline in morning (AM) Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF) of more than 20%, an AM PEF of less than 180 liters (L)/min, an increase in Short Acting Beta2 Agonist (SABA) use of more than 70% (and a minimum increase of at least 2 puffs), an increase from Baseline in Daytime Asthma Symptom Score of more than 50%, an overnight asthma symptom of: Awake &quot;all night&quot;, or an asthma attack. Information on asthma exacerbation days was recorded throughout the study in the participant's electronic diary (e-Diary), and an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was used to calculate the average percentage of days with asthma exacerbations over Week 6 to Week 12.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Average Change From Baseline in Daytime Symptom Score (DSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and last six weeks of treatment (visits at Week 6, Week 8, Week 10 and Week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>The Daytime Symptom Score assessed daytime asthma symptoms. In the evening just before going to bed, participants scored their asthma symptoms for the period since arising by answering the following 4 questions in eDiaries: 1) How often did you experience asthma symptoms today?, 2) How much did your asthma symptoms bother you?, 3) How much activity could you do today? and 4) How often did your asthma affect your activities today? The 4 questions were scored on a 7-point scale (0=best to 6=worst) and averaged for a single score. The average change from baseline in DSS over the last 6 weeks of the 12-week-treatment period (visits at Week 6, Week 8, Week 10 and Week 12) was estimated using a cLDA model. In the cLDA analysis, baseline was the average DSS score during the placebo run-in period and the post-baseline value was the average DSS Score over Week 6 to Week 12.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Average Change From Baseline in Use of Short-Acting Beta-Agonists (SABAs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and last six weeks of treatment (visits at Week 6, Week 8, Week 10 and Week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>Twice daily (upon arising and before going to sleep), participants recorded the total number of puff (actuations) of SABA used for asthma symptoms in their eDiaries. The number of SABA puffs used in one day was calculated based on eDiary entries as the sum of daytime and nighttime number of puffs of SABA. The average change from baseline over the last 6 weeks of the 12-week-treatment period (visits at Week 6, Week 8, Week 10 and Week 12) in the daily number of SABA puffs was estimated using a cLDA model. In the cLDA analysis, Baseline was the average number of SABA puffs used in one day during the placebo run-in period and the post-baseline value was calculated as the average number of SABA puffs used in one day over Week 6 to Week 12.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Average Change From Baseline in Number of Nocturnal Awakenings</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and last six weeks of treatment (visits at Week 6, Week 8, Week 10 and Week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>The number of nights per week (between consecutive visits) that a participant awakened with asthma was based on eDiary entries and was calculated by dividing the number of nights a participant awakened with asthma (positive responses of once, more than once, awake &quot;all night&quot;) by the total number of nights (all responses) and then multiplying by 7 (standardized to a 7-day period). The average change from baseline in number of nocturnal awakenings over the last 6 weeks of the 12-week-treatment period (visits at Week 6, Week 8, Week 10 and Week 12) was estimated using a cLDA model. In the cLDA analysis, baseline was the average number of nocturnal awakenings during the placebo run-in period and the post-baseline value was calculated as the average number of nocturnal awakenings over Week 6 to Week 12.</description>

    <measure>Average Change From Baseline in Morning/Evening Peak Expiratory Flow (AM/PM PEF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and last six weeks of treatment (visits at Week 6, Week 8, Week 10 and Week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>PEF was defined as a person's maximum speed (rate) of expiration as measured with a peak flow meter in liters per minute. Participants performed triplicate PEF measurements twice daily using a PEF meter, in the AM upon rising and in the PM immediately before study drug administration at bedtime. All three values were recorded and the average of the best morning PEF and the best evening PEF for each day (AM/PM) was determined through the e-Diary. The average change from Baseline in AM/PM PEF over the last 6 weeks of a 12-week treatment period (visits at Week 6, Week 8, Week 10 and Week 12) was estimated using a cLDA model. In the cLDA analysis, baseline was the average AM/PM PEF value during the placebo run-in period and the post-baseline value was calculated as the average AM/PM PEF over Week 6 to Week 12.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire With Standardised Activities [AQLQ(S)] Overall and Domain Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The AQLQ(S) is a 32-item questionnaire with questions on 4 domains (asthma symptoms, activity limitation, emotional function and environmental stimuli) over the previous 2 weeks. Responses were scored on a 7-point scale (1=worst to 7=best). Each domain score is defined as the average score of all answered questions in that domain. The AQLQ(S) Overall Score is defined as the average of all available item scores (1=worst to 7=best). The changes from baseline are presented for the overall scores and the individual domain scores. Baseline was the last measurement taken prior to the first double-blind study drug. The ending values were calculated as the average AQLQ(S) Overall Score and domain scores at Week 12 of a 12-week treatment period. Statistical analyses are provided for the AQLQ(S) Overall Scores only.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The ACQ is a validated 6-item measure of asthma control to evaluate asthma control in response to therapy. Participants evaluate their asthma over the previous week by answering 6 questions: How often were you woken by your asthma during the night? How bad were your asthma symptoms when you woke up in the morning? How limited were you in your activities because of your asthma? How much shortness of breath did you experience because of your asthma? How much of the time did you wheeze? How many puffs/inhalations of short-acting bronchodilator have you used each day? Each response to a question was scored on a 7-point scale (0=best to 6=worst). The ACQ score is the average of the scores for the 6 items. Change from baseline to Week 12 in ACQ was estimated using a cLDA model. In the cLDA analysis, the Baseline value was the last measurement taken prior to the first double-blind study drug and the post-baseline value was calculated as the average ACQ Score at Week 12.</description>

          <title>Asthma Phenotype</title>
          <description>The Asthma Phenotype in this study was defined as either “Th2-High” or “Th2-Low,” based on measurements of asthmatic inflammation. Th2-High was defined according to the following 2 criteria at Visit 1: a peripheral-blood absolute eosinophil count ≥ 0.30 X 10^9/liters(L), and/or a peripheral-blood absolute eosinophil count ≥0.14 X 10^9/L with serum total IgE ≥100 IU/mL. Th2-Low was operationally defined as meeting neither of these criteria.</description>

        <description>FEV1 is the amount of air (in liters) forcibly exhaled in one second. Repeated measurements of FEV1 were collected at visits during the 12 week active treatment period and the average change from baseline in FEV1 over the last 6 weeks of the 12-week-treatment period (visits at Week 6, Week 8, Week 10 and Week 12) was estimated using a constrained longitudinal data analysis (cLDA) model. In the cLDA analysis, baseline was the average FEV1 during the placebo run-in period and the post-baseline value was the average FEV1 over Week 6 to Week 12.</description>

        <title>Average Change From Baseline in Daytime Symptom Score (DSS)</title>
        <description>The Daytime Symptom Score assessed daytime asthma symptoms. In the evening just before going to bed, participants scored their asthma symptoms for the period since arising by answering the following 4 questions in eDiaries: 1) How often did you experience asthma symptoms today?, 2) How much did your asthma symptoms bother you?, 3) How much activity could you do today? and 4) How often did your asthma affect your activities today? The 4 questions were scored on a 7-point scale (0=best to 6=worst) and averaged for a single score. The average change from baseline in DSS over the last 6 weeks of the 12-week-treatment period (visits at Week 6, Week 8, Week 10 and Week 12) was estimated using a cLDA model. In the cLDA analysis, baseline was the average DSS score during the placebo run-in period and the post-baseline value was the average DSS Score over Week 6 to Week 12.</description>

          <title>Average Change From Baseline in Daytime Symptom Score (DSS)</title>
          <description>The Daytime Symptom Score assessed daytime asthma symptoms. In the evening just before going to bed, participants scored their asthma symptoms for the period since arising by answering the following 4 questions in eDiaries: 1) How often did you experience asthma symptoms today?, 2) How much did your asthma symptoms bother you?, 3) How much activity could you do today? and 4) How often did your asthma affect your activities today? The 4 questions were scored on a 7-point scale (0=best to 6=worst) and averaged for a single score. The average change from baseline in DSS over the last 6 weeks of the 12-week-treatment period (visits at Week 6, Week 8, Week 10 and Week 12) was estimated using a cLDA model. In the cLDA analysis, baseline was the average DSS score during the placebo run-in period and the post-baseline value was the average DSS Score over Week 6 to Week 12.</description>

The number of SABA puffs used in one day was calculated based on eDiary entries as the sum of daytime and nighttime number of puffs of SABA. The average change from baseline over the last 6 weeks of the 12-week-treatment period (visits at Week 6, Week 8, Week 10 and Week 12) in the daily number of SABA puffs was estimated using a cLDA model.

        <title>Average Change From Baseline in Number of Nocturnal Awakenings</title>
        <description>The number of nights per week (between consecutive visits) that a participant awakened with asthma was based on eDiary entries and was calculated by dividing the number of nights a participant awakened with asthma (positive responses of once, more than once, awake &quot;all night&quot;) by the total number of nights (all responses) and then multiplying by 7 (standardized to a 7-day period). The average change from baseline in number of nocturnal awakenings over the last 6 weeks of the 12-week-treatment period (visits at Week 6, Week 8, Week 10 and Week 12) was estimated using a cLDA model. In the cLDA analysis, baseline was the average number of nocturnal awakenings during the placebo run-in period and the post-baseline value was calculated as the average number of nocturnal awakenings over Week 6 to Week 12.</description>

        <description>PEF was defined as a person's maximum speed (rate) of expiration as measured with a peak flow meter in liters per minute. Participants performed triplicate PEF measurements twice daily using a PEF meter, in the AM upon rising and in the PM immediately before study drug administration at bedtime. All three values were recorded and the average of the best morning PEF and the best evening PEF for each day (AM/PM) was determined through the e-Diary. The average change from Baseline in AM/PM PEF over the last 6 weeks of a 12-week treatment period (visits at Week 6, Week 8, Week 10 and Week 12) was estimated using a cLDA model. In the cLDA analysis, baseline was the average AM/PM PEF value during the placebo run-in period and the post-baseline value was calculated as the average AM/PM PEF over Week 6 to Week 12.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire With Standardised Activities [AQLQ(S)] Overall and Domain Scores</title>
        <description>The AQLQ(S) is a 32-item questionnaire with questions on 4 domains (asthma symptoms, activity limitation, emotional function and environmental stimuli) over the previous 2 weeks. Responses were scored on a 7-point scale (1=worst to 7=best). Each domain score is defined as the average score of all answered questions in that domain. The AQLQ(S) Overall Score is defined as the average of all available item scores (1=worst to 7=best). The changes from baseline are presented for the overall scores and the individual domain scores. Baseline was the last measurement taken prior to the first double-blind study drug. The ending values were calculated as the average AQLQ(S) Overall Score and domain scores at Week 12 of a 12-week treatment period. Statistical analyses are provided for the AQLQ(S) Overall Scores only.</description>

        <description>The AQLQ(S) is a 32-item questionnaire with questions on 4 domains (asthma symptoms, activity limitation, emotional function and environmental stimuli) over the previous 2 weeks. Responses were scored on a 7-point scale (1=worst to 7=best). Each domain score is defined as the average score of all answered questions in that domain. The AQLQ(S) Overall Score is defined as the average of all available item scores (1=worst to 7=best). The percentage of participants who experienced a ≥0.5 increase in AQLQ(S) Overall and Domain Scores at Week 12 compared to baseline was calculated using the Miettinen and Nurminen (MN) method. Statistical analyses are provide for the AQLQ(S) Overall Score response rate only.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) Score</title>
        <description>The ACQ is a validated 6-item measure of asthma control to evaluate asthma control in response to therapy. Participants evaluate their asthma over the previous week by answering 6 questions: How often were you woken by your asthma during the night? How bad were your asthma symptoms when you woke up in the morning? How limited were you in your activities because of your asthma? How much shortness of breath did you experience because of your asthma? How much of the time did you wheeze? How many puffs/inhalations of short-acting bronchodilator have you used each day? Each response to a question was scored on a 7-point scale (0=best to 6=worst). The ACQ score is the average of the scores for the 6 items. Change from baseline to Week 12 in ACQ was estimated using a cLDA model. In the cLDA analysis, the Baseline value was the last measurement taken prior to the first double-blind study drug and the post-baseline value was calculated as the average ACQ Score at Week 12.</description>

        <description>An asthma attack was defined as asthma symptoms during the previous 24 hours requiring one or more of the following: corticosteroid use (systemic), unscheduled visit to the doctor or urgent care clinic, unscheduled visit to the emergency department or hospitalization. Information on asthma attacks was recorded throughout the study in the participant's e-Diary, and an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was used to calculate the average percentage of asthma attack days over Week 6 to Week 12 of a 12-week treatment period.</description>
