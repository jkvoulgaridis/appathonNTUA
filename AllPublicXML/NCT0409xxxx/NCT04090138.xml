      The objective of this trial is to evaluate the effects of setria performance blend
      supplementation on endurance performance in healthy men.

    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial in healthy men.
      Subjects will take either a placebo or setria performance blend (L-citrulline + glutathione)
      for 8 days. At the day 8, subjects run on the treadmill to measure the time to exhaustion at
      90%, 100%, and 110% of peak velocity. Arterial blood flow and blood vessel diameter (via
      ultrasound), blood analytes (plasma nitrate/nitrite, L-arginine, L-citrulline), subjective
      feelings of fatigue from a visual analog scale (VAS) and ratings of perceived exertion will
      be assessed.
