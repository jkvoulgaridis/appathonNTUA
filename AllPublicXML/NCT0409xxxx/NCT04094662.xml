      Investigate the efficacy and safety of mirogabalin in Chinese participants with diabetic
      peripheral neuropathic pain in comparison to placebo.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to compare change from baseline in weekly Average Daily Pain Score
      (ADPS) at Week 14 in Chinese patients with Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathic Pain (DPNP)
      receiving mirogabalin versus placebo.

    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 14</time_frame>
    <description>The pain scores on a scale of 0-10, where 0 = no pain and 10 = the worst possible pain. The weekly ADPS is based on participants daily pain scores.</description>

    <description>Ratio of Participants Responding to Treatment, as Measured by Average Daily Pain Score (ADPS) Reduction from Baseline. The ADPS is used to determine categorical response rates.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Intensity Score Using the Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>at Week 14</time_frame>
    <description>Participants rate their pain in three parts of the questionnaire, which are combined into a single pain intensity score:
Part 1 - fifteen descriptors of pain intensity, on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (severe)
Part 2 - a visual analog scale (VAS), in which the participant rates pain on a 100 mm-long horizontal line, where 0 mm = no pain and 100 mm = worst possible pain
Part 3 - a Present Pain Intensity index in which the participant rates present pain intensity on a scale of 0 (no pain) to 5 (most intense pain)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Global Impression of Change</measure>
    <time_frame>at Week 14</time_frame>
    <description>Participants rate their overall impression of how the present pain compares to baseline using a 7-point scale, where 1 = very much improved and 7 = very much worse. Patient Global Impression of Change scores are used to determine categorical responder rates.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Average Daily Sleep Interference score (ADSIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>at Week 14</time_frame>
    <description>The sleep interference scores on a scale of 0-10, where 0 = pain did not interfere with sleep to 10 = pain completely interfered with sleep. The weekly ADSIS is based on participants daily sleep interference scores.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Medical Outcome Study (MOS) sleep scale</measure>
    <time_frame>at Week 14</time_frame>
    <description>Participants rate their sleep quality during the past 4 weeks in three parts of the questionnaire:
Part 1 - The participants rate the average time required to fall asleep, 0-15 minutes = 1, 16-30 minutes = 2, 31-45 minutes = 3, 46-60 minutes = 4, More than 60 minutes = 5.
Part 2 - The participants give the number of hours per night for the average hours of sleep per night.
Part 3 - The participants using a score of 1 (all of the time) to 5 (none of the time) to rate their sleep disturbance in the following areas: difficulty in falling asleep or remaining asleep, difficulty in staying awake during the day, difficulty in breathing, and snoring during sleep.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Five Level EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) version</measure>
    <time_frame>at Week 14</time_frame>
    <description>Participants rate their Quality of Life in the following dimensions: mobility (5-point scale), self-care (5-point scale), usual activities (5-point scale), pain/discomfort (5-point scale), and anxiety/depression(5-point scale) that are combined into an overall health utilities index. Participants also rate their perception of overall health using VAS, with zero indicating worst health and 100 representing best imaginable health.</description>

    <measure>Actigraphy signal collected from a wrist-worn medical-grade sensor</measure>
    <time_frame>at Week 14</time_frame>
    <description>Result of physical activity during waking hours and participants' sleep will be evaluated to explore a relationship between participants reported outcomes and actigraphy signal collected from a wrist-worn medical-grade sensor (ActiGraph GT9X Link). Only participants who signed a separate informed consent form for wearing medical-grade sensor will be included in this evaluation.</description>
