  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective study will determine the efficacy of intraoperative x-ray to identify
      retained surgical sponges. The recommended practice for finding a retained sponge is by
      radiography. The purpose is to find out how useful plain x-rays are in open posterior lumbar
      spine surgery, information which is presently unavailable. The specific aim is to compare the
      sensitivity (seeing a sponge when one is actually present) and specificity (not seeing a
      sponge when one is not present) of radiography of the surgical field for three conditions:
      viewing one lateral radiograph versus viewing one anteroposterior radiograph versus viewing
      two radiographs together, one lateral and one anteroposterior.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized study with two cohorts: one experimental and one control.
      Anteroposterior (AP) and lateral (LAT) radiographs are routinely obtained as standard of care
      during spine surgery to confirm proper implant placement. These images will be used in this
      study. In one-half of the study subjects, after all sponges are removed, a surgical sponge
      will be intentionally placed in the surgical field prior to imaging. Postoperatively, each
      subject's images will be assessed for the presence or absence of a retained surgical sponge.
      Images will be independently read by two investigators. When there is discordance, the images
      will be adjudicated by a third. Interobserver agreement will be quantified using the Kappa
      statistic. Those reading images will not have participated in the surgery.

    <description>Each subject's AP and LAT images will be viewed and the investigator will note whether or not a sponge is seen (graded present or graded absent). The investigator's answer will be compared to the true condition (actually present or actually absent). Results will be analyzed to quantify the relative specificity, sensitivity, positive and negative predictive values, and accuracy of 1) an AP image alone, 2) a LAT image alone, and 3) AP and LAT images together.</description>
