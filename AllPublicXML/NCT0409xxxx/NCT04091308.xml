  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will investigate if: 1) individualized physical exercise training in combination
      with extra protein intake can increase measures on all three ICF-levels? 2) extra protein
      intake alone increases outcomes of usual care treatment?

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Successful rehabilitation of the growing number of elderly citizens can lead to preservation
      of functional independence and improvement in the quality of life.

      The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of an individually tailored physical
      exercise training program combined with increased protein intake in order to improve measures
      on all three ICF levels (International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and
      Health). By conducting the study in a real-life clinical setting, research is translated into
      practice involving health professionals and the target group in the development of new
      knowledge on how to enhance the outcome of rehabilitation, thereby increasing the overall
      capacity of the elderly citizen, and decreasing the expenditure of health-services.
