    <textblock>
      This is a two-part study designed to evaluate the effect of Estetrol (E4) 15 or 20 mg, or
      placebo on the severity and frequency of vasomotor symptoms (VMS) (Efficacy Study Part) and
      the safety of E4 20 mg (Safety Study Part).

      &quot;This is a two-part study:

        -  The first part is the Efficacy Study mainly designed to evaluate the frequency and
           severity of vasomotor symptoms [VMS] in both hysterectomized and non hysterectomized
           postmenopausal participants after treatment with two doses of E4 (15 mg or 20 mg) or
           placebo for 12 consecutive weeks. Thereafter treatment will proceed for a total duration
           of 52 weeks, to continue the evaluation of secondary efficacy, safety and the effect on
           the endometrium. For endometrial protection, all non-hysterectomized subjects will
           receive treatment with 200 mg progesterone (P4) once daily for 14 consecutive days,
           after completion of the E4/placebo treatment.

        -  The second part is the Safety Study designed to evaluate the general safety, secondary
           efficacy (Lipid, glucose metabolism, health-related quality of life [HRQoL] and
           treatment satisfaction [TS]) after treatment with E4 20 mg for one year in
           hysterectomized postmenopausal participants.&quot;

If there is no agreement among the three pathologists, the most severe pathologic diagnosis will be used as the final diagnosis. Endometrial biopsy will be classified using criteria described in Blaustein's Pathology text into 1 of following 11 categories: Cat.0: No tissue; Cat.1: Tissue insufficient for diagnosis; Cat.2: Atrophic; Cat 3: Inactive; Cat 4: Proliferative; Cat 5: Secretory; Cat 6: Menstrual type; Cat 7: Simple hyperplasia without atypia; Cat 8: Simple hyperplasia with atypia; Cat 9: Complex hyperplasia without atypia; Cat 10: Complex hyperplasia with atypia; and Cat 11: Carcinoma.</description>

    <measure>Health-related quality of life assessment using the Menopause-specific Quality of Life (MENQOL) questionnaire (Safety part)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 12 and 52</time_frame>
    <description>The MENQOL is self-administered questionnaire which assessed changes in quality of life over a one-month period. It is composed of 29 questions indicating if subject experienced the problem (Yes/No) and if Yes, rating scale ranged from 0=Not bothered at all to 6=Extremely bothered. For analysis, the original scores were converted to the analysis score ranging from 1-8 where No=1, 0=2, 1=3...and 6=8. The scale contains four domains: vasomotor, psychosocial, physical and sexual. Each domain is scored separately. Vasomotor domain score is mean of = Q1,Q2, Q3, with 1 being &quot;not at all bothered&quot; and 8 being &quot;extremely bothered&quot;.</description>

    <measure>Total score in treatment satisfaction using the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) questionnaire (Safety part)</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 4, 12 and 52</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI score is a seven point scale in which subjects were asked to rate the total improvement, whether or not in her judgment it was due entirely to drug treatment, compared to her condition at admission to the study. Scale: Very much improved, Much improved, Minimally improved, No change, Minimally worse, Much worse, Very much worse. Results for the top two responses - Very Much Improved and Much Improved, and No Change or Worsening (Minimally worse, Much worse, Very much worse) - were combined for each estetrol treatment groups compare to placebo.</description>
