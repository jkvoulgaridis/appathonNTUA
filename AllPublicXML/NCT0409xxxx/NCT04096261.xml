      The aim of our study is the analysis of sleep phases and quality as well as the detection of
      respiratory pauses in subjects with cognitive disorder. To assess whether sleep quality is
      associated with the blood-brain barrier and Alzheimer's disease, which may be indicative of
      an early, non-invasively measurable change in brain activity in the early stages of
      Alzheimer's disease.

      The aim of our study is the analysis of sleep phases and quality as well as the detection of
      respiratory pauses in subjects with cognitive disorder. To assess whether sleep quality is
      associated with the blood-brain barrier and Alzheimer's disease, which may be indicative of
      an early, non-invasively measurable change in brain activity in the early stages of
      Alzheimer's disease.

      Sleep quality impairment is a known risk factor for memory impairment. There is increasing
      evidence of a link between measurable sleep parameters, in particular a reduction of slow
      waves of deep sleep in cognitive deficits. Also, breathing pauses during sleep are associated
      with increased daytime sleepiness and cognitive impairment. This observational study is
      intended to establish a possible link between subjective memory disturbances and altered
      sleep quality or respiratory breaks during sleep. In the run-up to this study, they performed
      a special MRI scan of the head and a lumbar puncture (removal of nerve water) in a different
      context. The aim of this imaging study and the new biomarker in brain water was to
      investigate the function of the blood-brain barrier that occurs in Alzheimer's disease. The
      results of the studies on the quality of sleep should be evaluated in the context of this
      study in connection with the findings of the MRI examination and lumbar puncture.
