    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of M3814 when given together with
      pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride in treating patients with high or low grade
      ovarian cancer that has come back (recurrent). M3814 may stop the growth of tumor cells by
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of
      tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them
      from spreading. Giving M3814 and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride may work
      better in treating patients with ovarian cancer compared to pegylated liposomal doxorubicin
      hydrochloride alone.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of nedisertib (M3814) in combination with
      pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride (PLD) and determine the recommended phase 2
      dose (RP2D) of the combination in women with recurrent ovarian cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. II. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of M3814
      when given in combination with PLD.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To correlate response to treatment (as defined by response rate and progression free
      survival) with PLD exposure (in area under the curve [AUC]) and PLD associated toxicities in
      women with recurrent high grade serous and low grade serous ovarian cancer treated in the
      expansion cohorts.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of nedisertib.

      Patients receive nedisertib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28 and pegylated
      liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride intravenously (IV) on day 1. Cycles repeat every 28 days
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.

          -  Patients with platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer are eligible for both the dose
             escalation and dose expansion phases if their provider feels that PLD would be an
             appropriate treatment option for them. Patients with platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer
             should also be offered any higher priority studies for which they are potentially
             eligible

          -  Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum
             pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication.
             If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy
             test will be required

               -  The effects of M3814 and liposomal doxorubicin on the developing human fetus are
                  unknown and there is the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. For
                  this reason, women and men of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate
                  contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to
                  study entry, for the duration of study treatment, and for 6 months after

                  is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should
                  inform her treating physician immediately. Because there is an unknown but
                  potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of
                  the mother with M3814, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is
                  treated with M3814

          -  Patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does
             not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the
             investigational regimen are eligible for this trial

          -  Patients with known history or current symptoms of cardiac disease, or history of
             treatment with cardiotoxic agents, should have a clinical risk assessment of cardiac
             function using the New York Heart Association Functional Classification. To be
             eligible for this trial, patients should be class 2B or better

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.
             Participants with impaired decision-making capacity (IDMC) who have a
             legally-authorized representative (LAR) and/or family member available will also be
             eligible

          -  Archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue collected within the past 36
             months prior to registration must be available for submission for deoxyribonucleic
             acid (DNA)/ribonucleic acid (RNA) analysis

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Inability to swallow and/or absorb oral medication (patients with a drainage peg are
             ineligible)

          -  Patients may not have received prior anthracyclines (doxorubicin or pegylated
             liposomal doxorubicin) for treatment of their ovarian cancer

          -  Patients who have not recovered from adverse events due to prior anti-cancer therapy
             (i.e., have residual toxicities &gt; grade 1) with the exception of alopecia or
             neuropathy

          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to M3814 or pegylated liposomal doxorubicin

          -  Patients who cannot discontinue concomitant medications or herbal supplements that are
             strong inhibitors or strong inducers of cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes CYP3A4/5 and
             CYP2C19. Concomitant use of CYP3A4/5 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index are
             also excluded. Patients may confer with the study doctor to determine if alternative
             medications can be used. The following categories of medications and herbal
             supplements must be discontinued for at least the specified period of time before the
             patient can be treated:

               -  Strong inducers of CYP3A4/5 and CYP2C19: &gt;= 3 weeks prior to study treatment

               -  Strong inhibitors of CYP3A4/5 and CYP2C19: &gt;= 1 week prior to study treatment

               -  Substrates of CYP3A4/5 with a narrow therapeutic index: &gt;= 1 day prior to study
                  treatment

               -  Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to
                  regularly consult a frequently-updated medical reference. As part of the
                  enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk
                  of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be
                  prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or
                  herbal product. Patient Drug Interactions Handout and Wallet Card should be
                  provided to patients

          -  Patients who cannot discontinue concomitant H2 blockers or proton-pump inhibitors
             (PPIs). Patients may confer with the study doctor to determine if such medications can
             be discontinued. These must be discontinued &gt;= 5 days prior to study treatment.
             Patients do not need to discontinue calcium carbonate

          -  Patients receiving sorivudine or any chemically related analogues (such as brivudine)
             are excluded

          -  Patients who have received a live attenuated vaccine within 30 days of dosing with
             M3814

          -  Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness

          -  Patients with psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because M3814 is DNA-PK inhibitor agent
             with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother with M3814, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother
             is treated with M3814. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in
             this study
