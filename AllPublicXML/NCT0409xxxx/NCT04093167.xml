      The purpose of stage 1 of the study is to find out if blood tests can be used to see how the
      cancer is responding to treatment with pembrolizumab.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The standard or usual treatment for this disease is pembrolizumab given by needle every three
      weeks. This study will be done in two stages.

      The purpose of stage 1 of the study is to find out if we can use blood tests to see how the
      cancer is responding to treatment with pembrolizumab. A second stage of the study will take
      place once stage 1 is completed. In stage 2 blood tests will be used to help determine if
      patients whose cancer does not seem to be getting better on treatment with pembrolizumab,
      would do better on a different treatment.

             arrhythmias requiring medication, history of 2nd or 3rd degree atrioventricular
             conduction defects). Patients with known history or current symptoms of cardiac
             disease, or history of treatment with cardiotoxic agents, should have a clinical risk
             assessment of cardiac function using the New York Heart Association Functional
             Classification. To be eligible for this trial, patients should be class 2B or better.
