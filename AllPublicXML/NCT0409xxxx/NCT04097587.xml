  <brief_summary>

      screen use, and improving sleep quality and psychosocial adaptations in children aged 4-6
      years.

    <textblock>
      A total of 129 parent-child dyads were randomly allocated to two groups: experimental group
      (receiving parental education, n=63), and control group (daily activities, n=66). Data were
      collected before and after intervention. Instruments included screen time, Children's Sleep
      Habits Questionnaire, and Pediatric Symptom Checklist-17. A linear mixed model analysis was
      used to examine the efficacy of education intervention.

    <description>This program was carried out for 50 min/week over 8 weeks to empower parents with knowledge and self-efficacy about children's screen use, and motivate them to monitor and change their children's screen behaviors. Teaching strategies included lectures, group discussions, reflection, role playing, and peer sharing (Table 1). Topics included 1) parents' and children's screen use, 2) the relationship between network equipment and children's internet use, 3) the positive and negative effects of excessive screen use on children's physical and psychological development, 4) limiting screen use at mealtimes and bedtime, 5) strategies for screen-related devices, 6) alternative activities to screen use, such as board games and outdoor activities, 7) setting a target of appropriate screen times, and 8) encouraging the signing of a contract between parents and children to limit screen time. We also provided parents with a handbook of the course content.</description>
