  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Osteoporotic fractures are a major public health issue. They cause substantial
      disability, loss of autonomy, morbidity and excess mortality. Diabetes is also associated
      with increased risk for falls and fractures through a direct impact of elevated blood glucose
      on the skeleton and on muscles.

      Research project overview: The investigators propose a cross-sectional study that will
      involve 2 research centers in the province of Quebec. The investigators will recruit 20 obese
      participants, without diabetes, who have not undergone bariatric surgery, for one-time
      measurements to be compared with baseline measurements (pre-surgery) from participants in the
      bariatric obese diabetic groups with type II diabetes mellitus from the ongoing study BODI
      study (NCT03455868). Bone Mineral Density as well as muscle quality, strength and function
      will be evaluated at a single study visit.

      Relevance: This data will permit the evaluation of the bone-muscle unit in patients with
      obesity with and without diabetes, and assess whether the presence and duration of diabetes
      impacts further on clinical and functional musculoskeletal outcomes (falls, fractures and
      mobility and strength) in this population. AGEs, if associated with muscle and bone
      deterioration, might become an easily accessible biomarker of musculoskeletal health in the
      clinical setting.
