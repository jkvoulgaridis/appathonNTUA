  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although the Affordable Care Act (ACA) expanded Medicaid eligibility, Medicaid expansions do
      not appear to have decreased the gap in mental health treatment between Whites and
      racial/ethnic or linguistic minorities. There is a critical shortage of trained providers who
      can offer culturally congruent mental health service in non-English languages in
      Medicaid-based Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs). Building capacity and training
      opportunities to implement evidence-based mental health interventions by community health
      workers (CHWs) could expand ACOs infrastructure and increase access to and quality of mental
      healthcare. To this end, the investigators will test the effectiveness and implementation of
      the STRONG MINDS model to improve engagement and quality of treatment for depression and
      anxiety among low-income racial/ethnic and linguistic minority populations, served by
      Medicaid ACOs. Our proposed study is a Hybrid Type I Effectiveness Implementation study of
      the effectiveness of the mental health intervention and its impact on study outcomes within
      varying contexts associated with Medicaid ACOs in North Carolina (NC) and Massachusetts (MA).

      The investigators will test the STRONG MINDS intervention with adults who have moderate to
      severe symptoms of depression or anxiety, defined as 66+ on the CAT-MH for depression and/or
      51+ on the CAT-MH for anxiety. CAT-MH benchmarks for depression are: &lt;50=no depression;
      50-65=mild; 66-75=moderate; and&gt;75 =severe depression, and for anxiety are 35-50 = mild
      anxiety; 51-65 = moderate anxiety; and &gt;65 severe anxiety. Eligible participants cannot be
      receiving mental health care (therapy sessions with psychiatrist, psychologist or social
      worker) in the past 3 months or in the upcoming month. Participants must speak English,
      Spanish, Mandarin, or Cantonese. Eligible participants will be consented and assigned to a
      CHW within the site. After a baseline interview, participants will be randomized to either
      the intervention or an enhanced usual care condition. Randomization will be stratified by
      site using a computer-generated block randomization scheme of variable block size. The
      investigators will monitor engagement in treatment (% of participants with 2 or more mental
      health sessions/visits in a 6-month period after baseline), mental health symptoms (HSCL-25),
      overall functioning (WHODAS 2.0), and participant perceived quality of care (PoC) for the
      intervention group and compare to the enhanced control group. Outcome measures (identified
      above) will be assessed four times during the study period: at baseline, 3 months, 6 months
      and 12 months.

      Recruitment Strategy: CHWs will screen 6,000 participants with the CAT-MH and substance use
      measures (for exclusion) in addition to obtaining demographic and social determinants
      information during the 3.5 years of study screening to identify approximately 1,200 eligible
      participants across both MA and NC (600 per site). Eligible participants will be randomized
      to the intervention or enhanced control condition and be invited to complete a baseline
      assessment as described above. Based on data from our clinical trials, the investigators
      anticipate that 30-33.5% of those screened will show moderate to severe symptoms of
      depression and/or anxiety and will not be receiving mental health care. The investigators
      conservatively anticipate that 60-70% will agree to participate, for approximately 600 cases
      per site with 20% attrition over a 6 month period.

      Sampling, Recruitment and Consent: Community Health Workers (CHWs) and Research Assistants
      (RAs) will be responsible for approaching potential participants in designated clinics or
      Community-based Organizations (CBOs). In clinics, CHWs will recruit in waiting rooms or by
      provider referrals. In community agencies, they will recruit during special community events
      and meetings. Eligible patients will be scheduled for a baseline interview with a Research
      Assistant that includes instruments designed to identify elevated mental health symptoms, as
      well as socio-demographics, cultural, contextual and social factors, medication use, health
      literacy, language proficiency, past access to health services, migration, patient activation
      and self-management, and motivation to enter care. Following the baseline interview,
      participants will be randomized to either the intervention or enhanced usual care (control)
      condition. Additional interviews will be administered by research assistants blind to study
      condition at 3-, 6- and 12-months following baseline.

    <description>The proposed intervention integrates cognitive behavioral therapy techniques combined with mindfulness exercises and promotion of behavioral activation through pleasant activities and developing supportive relationships. The intervention is led by CHWs and organized into 10 sessions, tailored to the participant using a collaborative approach, to improve mood symptoms, augment self-reported functioning, and increase self-reported quality of care among participants with moderate to severe symptoms of depression and/or anxiety. It is complemented by a care manager that links participant to services for needs related to social determinants of health (i.e. education, housing). The intervention has been tailored for delivery by CHWs in Spanish, Mandarin, Cantonese, and English.</description>

    <description>Participants in this arm will receive a booklet about anxiety and depression in Spanish, English, or Mandarin/Cantonese. The Care Manager will call the participant 4 times over the course of 6 months to administer the PROMIS depression (8 item) and anxiety (7 item) short forms, a suicide questionnaire, and a question about medication side effects to mimic the administration schedule in the intervention group. With patient's permission, the care manager will inform the PCP about screening and other assessments and determine if participants should be referred to mental health or substance services and removed from control group given symptom severity.</description>
