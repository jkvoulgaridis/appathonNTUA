  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sarcopenia leads to loss of muscle mass and muscle strength during the aging process. It has
      been reported that eccentric training has some positive effects on the preservation of
      eccentric strength, with less delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) in older groups, and lower
      metabolic costs.

      This is prospective study. The goals of this study are to:

        1. Examine the effects of eccentric training on physical function (gait speed, stair climb,
           chair stand) in older adults.

        2. Examine the effects of eccentric training on muscle strength (Isometric strength,
           Isokinetic strength, power) in older adults.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Gait speed</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline gaitspeed at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An examiner used a stopwatch to time how long it took subjects to walk along a marked tape. The Kinect device was used to measure gait speed.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Stair climb</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline stair climb at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects were measured on eight 17-cm stairs twice, requiring a step by step pattern, where the timer activated when the first contact was made at the first step and ended when the contact occurred at the last step before and after the 8 weeks of exercise training.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Chair stand</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline chair stand at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects had to get up from a chair measuring 41 cm in height with a flat seat. Subjects were asked to stand up and sit down 5 times as quickly as possible with their arms folded across the chest. They stood up until full extension was observed at the trunk and lower limb joints, and returned to a seated position with their back fully supported at the back of the chair.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Isokinetic knee strength</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline isokinetic knee strength at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The isokinetic was measured using a baltimore therapeutic equipment (BTE) Primus RS (BTE Tech., Hanover, MD, USA). The subject performed a 60 degree per second knee flexion and extension five times. Each isokinetic contraction was performed through a full range of motion.Before each subject began the isokinetic test, the subject warmed up using a 50-60% knee extension/flexion once.
Isokinetic knee strength is measured in as peak torque achieved on an isokinetic dynamometer (BTE PrimusRS, BTE tech, MD, USA) at 60 degree per second.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Isometric knee strength</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline isometric knee strength at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Isometric knee strength was measured using a baltimore therapeutic equipment (BTE) Primus RS (BTE Tech., Hanover, MD, USA). The subject was asked to sit on the treatment chair and a standard stabilization strap was placed on the upper ankle. The knee was kept at 90 degree flexion, and the foot was positioned in dorsi flexion. The subject's hands were placed on the edge of the side of the chair and the trunk, hips, and mid-thigh were stabilized in the chair by the straps.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Power</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline power at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The test used same machine as the isometric and isokinetic tests. The ankle was placed in a neutral position, and the subjects performed a range of motion for 10 seconds, once. After the warm up, knee extension and flexion were performed as quickly as possible during a period of 10 seconds.
Isokinetic knee strength is measured in as peak torque achieved on an isokinetic dynamometer (BTE PrimusRS, BTE tech, MD, USA) at 60 degree per second.</description>
