  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to examine the associations between maternal BMI and levels of
      oxytocin in maternal plasma during augmentation with oxytocin during first stage of labor in
      term pregnancy.

      A translational prospective experimental study in the delivery ward in Linköping. The study
      population will include women in two BMI groups (underweight/normal weight and
      overweight/obese) during first stage of labor with singleton full term pregnancy and cephalic
      presentation.The BMI is calculated from weight and height registered at the first antenatal
      visit around week 8-12. At the delivery ward, if the women are in need of labor augmentation
      with oxytocin infusion, a peripheral venous catheter will be placed in the contralateral arm
      from the arm where oxytocin will be administrated. The oxytocin infusion will be prepared to
      a concentration of 10 mU/ml and will be given according to a standardized protocol or to an
      infusion level giving maximum of 5 uterine contractions per 10 minutes. Blood samples for
      measuring plasma levels of oxytocin will be taken prior to start and before every increase in
      the rate of oxytocin infusion. The blood samples will be collected through the first stage of
      labor.
