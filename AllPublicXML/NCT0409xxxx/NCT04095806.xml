      Background:

      A previous study in Zanzibar (which Jutta Adelin Jorgensen, PI of ZanStroke, led) showed a
      high prevalence of hypertension among adults at 33%, in fact higher than average in
      Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), and poor performance of the health systems with nearly 90% of
      people with hypertension not achieving adequate blood pressure control. Uncontrolled
      hypertension (HTN) and stroke have already become among the commonest causes of admission to
      and death at hospital in Zanzibar. At the same time, there is little or no data available to
      quantify the stroke burden on types, treatment and outcomes, cost of stroke care, nor a
      comprehensive understanding of the causes of poor hypertension control in the population.The
      Tanzanian Stroke Incidence study (which Richard Walker from Newcastle University led) showed
      some of the highest stroke incidence rates in the world. However, there are many unanswered
      questions, and the Zanzibar Stroke Study will be a unique opportunity to look at all stroke
      admissions from a large island population.

      Zanzibar Stroke Study:

      The hypotheses investigated are

      1a. Current challenges in stroke care cannot exclusively be explained by limited structural
      resources, and care delivering processes play an essential role.

        1. b. Current organization and quality of care for stroke including rehabilitation could
           benefit from being aligned with best practices for low resource settings.

        2. a. Stroke types, causes, and prognosis are dominated by a higher proportion of
           hemorrhagic strokes, associated to poorly controlled hypertension, higher 30-day
           mortality, and worse prognosis in terms of disability and mortality at 12 months than
           seen in high income settings.

      2b Long term stroke outcome is not only depending on stroke severity but also on
      sociodemographic/economic factors with worse prognosis for the poorest part of the
      population.

      3a. There is a significant first stage delay due to local perceptions and beliefs around
      stroke which prohibits biomedical treatment in the prognostically important acute phase of
      stroke 3b. There are untapped resources in the community that could be leveraged to increase
      adherence to medical treatment to control BP to prevent stroke and re-stroke, as well as
      making rehabilitation accessible 4a. Introducing a hypertension care package at lowest
      primary care level for people at high cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk to prevent stroke and
      re-stroke is cost-effective, affordable, and possible.

      4b. With no intervention, the cost of stroke care at hospital level will in 10 years exceed
      the cost of all reproductive and child health (RCH) services.

      ZanStroke is an observational, prospective study of stroke admissions to hospitals in
      Zanzibar (Unguja) enrolling all patients with a recent stroke (&lt; 30 days) over a period of
      one year to investigate the burden of stroke disease, risk factors and outcome up till 12
      months post-stroke. This will be done through establishing a stroke patient register.

      Participant data will include sociodemographic and -economic information, vascular risk
      factors and previous medical history, routine head-CT, routine biochemical results and other
      investigations, as well as early and long-term outcomes (deaths, disability,
      independence/functionality, quality of life, cognition, medicine adherence, rehabilitation
      therapy, re-stroke).

      Approximately 80% of stroke patients in Unguja, Zanzibar who seek hospital care are admitted
      to the main hospital and the nearby private hospital, and these will undergo CT head scan,
      but this will not be possible in all of the other six hospitals. We will take blood samples
      and store serum and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) for potential future analysis from the main
      hospital and the nearby private hospital only.

      In addition to the clinical epidemiological research, qualitative and health economic
      evaluation research will be undertaken to understand stroke patients and caretakers life
      worlds and perspectives, health care providers skills and practices, organization and
      processes of stroke care at hospital level, and to define a set of most cost-effective
      interventions to prevent and treat stroke in the particular Zanzibar context.

      Current and future benefits and impacts:

      With the demographic transition and population ageing in SSA rates of stroke are set to
      continue to increase rapidly as part of the double burden of disease (still a major burden of
      infectious diseases, as well as an unfinished agenda of maternal and newborn health).

      Previous studies have already established a global high level of hypertension in the adult
      population in Zanzibar, and low performance of the health system for managing this.

      It is important to identify the peculiar genomic, gene-environmental and environmental risk
      and protective factors for stroke occurrence, pattern, type, outcome, and current incidence
      velocity in SSA in order to inform preventive measures especially effective and
      cost-effective control of raised blood pressure/hypertension; the best model for the
      provision of inpatient care and rehabilitation in a resource poor environment with lack of
      access to dedicated stroke units and limited multidisciplinary team input; and to include the
      particular East Africa population in existing or future international stroke collaborations
      to ensure that genetic variations relevant to the population there are represented.

    <description>disability of stroke patients as measured using the modified Ranking Scale (mRS) at 30 days post stroke.
The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) assesses disability in patients who have suffered a stroke and is compared over time to check for recovery and degree of continued disability. A score of 0 is no disability, 5 is disability requiring constant care for all needs; 6 is death.
The mRS has been used in clinical research for over 30 years and is a common standard for assessing functional outcomes in patients with stroke.
Multiple studies have shown that the mRS correlates with physiological indicators such as stroke type, lesion size and neurological impairment as assessed by other stroke evaluation scale</description>

    <description>Cognitive impairment of stroke patients 3 and 12 months post stroke using the Identification and Intervention for Dementia in Elderly Africans (IDEA) cognitive screening tool .
The first 4 items involve being able to name a bridge from a description of its use, knowing the day of the week, knowing the name of the village chief/ town mayor/ city governor and naming as many animals as possible in one minute (score 2 for ≥ 8 animals, score 1 for 4-7 animals, score 0 for 0-3 animals). Item 5 is a 10-word recall test (score 1 point for each word up to a maximum of 5 points). The sixth item is designed to measure praxis and involves a matchstick design test with scores ranging from 0 (no matchsticks placed correctly), to 3 (all four matchsticks placed correctly).
The maximum possible score is 15 and the minimum 0, with a higher score indicating better cognitive function. 7/8 is used as a cut-off for dementia, and 10/11 a cut-off for cognitive impairment</description>

    <description>Quality of life among stroke patients 3 and 12 months post stroke using the 5-level EQ-5D instrument.
The EQ-5D is a standardized non-disease specific instrument to describe and value health-related quality of life and consist of a descriptive system and a visual analogue scale (VAS).
The descriptive system comprises of mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels. The patient indicates his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. This decision results in a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state.
The EQ VAS records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale ( 0-10), where the endpoints are labelled 'The best health you can imagine' (0) and 'The worst health you can imagine' (10).</description>

    <time_frame>3 and 12 months post stroke; data collected over 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Medicine adherence among stroke patients 3 and 12 months post stroke using the Medicine Adherence Questionnaire (MAQ).
MAQ is a standardized instrument to assess intentional and un-intentional non-adherence and consist of four questions with response options yes or no. No to all responses = good adherence, while one or more Yes to responses = non-adherent. Non-adherence can be identified as mainly unintentional (factor 1) or purposeful (factor 2), or mixed.</description>
