  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There have been multiple trials to investigate the morphological changes in the macula and
      retinal nerve fiber layer of amblyopic eyes, due to the different published results and the
      lack of evident association between these changes and the patients' parameters. So, we
      perform this study to compare the variations in macular parameters (central thickness,
      average thickness, macular volume) and peripapillary thickness in different cases of
      amblyopic eyes versus the normal fellow eyes using spectral-domain optical coherence
      tomography. In addition, to estimate the relationship of optical coherence tomography
      variations with different defined patients' parameters (age, sex, best corrected visual
      acuity, spherical equivalent refractive error, and axial length).

    <textblock>
      Amblyopia remains an important cause of low visual acuity,affecting 2% to 6% of the general
      population. Unilateral amblyopia is defined as reduced best-corrected visual acuity secondary
      to an abnormal visual experience during the critical period of visual development. Classic
      causes include strabismus, anisometropia, form deprivation or a combination of these factors
      .

      The normal postnatal reduction (apoptosis) of retinal ganglion cells is arrested in amblyopia
      which would cause increase in retinal nerve fiber layer thickness as hypothesized by Yen et
      al .This also would affect the normal maturation of the macula, including movement of Henle's
      fibers away from the foveola. This would result in increased foveal thickness. Furthermore,
      because of the reduced apoptosis of retinal ganglion cells, the thickness of the ganglion
      cell layer in the macula would also be increased.

      Optical coherence tomography : is a non-contact and non-invasive technique that help in
      assessment of retina abnormalities. The high resolving power (10um - Time Domain, 5um -
      Spectral Domain) provides excellent detail for evaluating the vitreo-retinal interface,
      neurosensory retinal morphology, and the retinal pigmented epithelial-choroid complex. It
      generates cross sectional images by analyzing the time delay and magnitude change of low
      coherence light as it is backscattered by ocular tissues. An infrared scanning beam is split
      into a sample arm (directed toward the subject) and a reference arm (directed toward a
      mirror). As the sample beam returns to the instrument it is correlated with the reference arm
      in order to determine distance and signal change via photodetector measurement. The resulting
      change in signal amplitude allows tissue differentiation by analysis of the reflective
      properties, which are matched to a false color scale. As the scanning beam moves across
      tissue, the sequential longitudinal signals, or A-scans, can be reassembled into a transverse
      scan yielding cross-sectional images, or B-scans, of the subject. The scans can then be
      analyzed in a variety of ways providing both empirical measurements (e.g. retinal
      thickness/volume) and qualitative morphological information.

    <description>Foveal thickness (mean thickness in the central 1000-μm diameter area) and central foveal thickness (mean thickness at the point of intersection of 6 radial scans) are 212 ± 20 and 182 ± 23 μm, respectively. Macular thickness measurements were thinnest at the center of the fovea, thickest within 3-mm diameter of the center, and diminished toward the periphery of the macula. The temporal quadrant was thinner than the nasal quadrant.</description>
