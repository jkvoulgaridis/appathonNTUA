  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is a Phase 1-2, open-label, sequential-group, dose-escalation and
      cohort-expansion study evaluating the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics, and
      antitumor activity of Zotatifin (eFT226) in subjects with selected advanced solid tumor
      malignancies. The study will evaluate weekly 1-hour intravenous (IV) administration of
      Zotatifin (eFT226). Treatment and study subject evaluations will be performed in 21 day
      cycles.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Part 1 (dose escalation) will enroll subjects with an advanced solid tumor that is refractory
      or intolerant to standard of care therapy, where the tumor is pancreatic adenocarcinoma (no
      molecular typing) or any other solid tumor that has a documented activating mutation,
      amplification, or fusion of HER2, ERBB3, FGFR1, FGFR2, or an activating mutation in KRAS.

      Subjects will be assigned sequentially to increasing eFT226 doses. The starting dose of
      eFT226 is 0.005 mg/kg administered IV weekly in 21 day cycles. eFT226 doses will be escalated
      in subsequent cohorts after subjects enrolled in a given cohort have completed the 21-day
      dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) evaluation period. Dose escalation in Part 1 will enroll
      subjects based on 3+3 design, whereby 3 subjects will be initially enrolled and treated at
      each dose level.

      To obtain as robust a data set as possible regarding PK, safety and tolerability in a diverse
      population prior to selecting the RP2D, the MTD and MTD-1 cohorts may be backfilled up to 15
      subjects total in each cohort.

      Part 2 (Expansion Cohort) of the study will provide cohort expansion to further explore the
      safety, pharmacology, and clinical activity of eFT226 monotherapy in subjects with previously
      treated advanced solid tumor malignancies. Part 2 will be based on results observed in Part 1
      and will be defined by amendment to the protocol.

    <description>eFT226 is a novel small-molecule, investigational drug being developed by eFFECTOR Therapeutics as an anticancer therapy. eFT226 is a potent and selective inhibitor of eIF4A1-mediated translation and selectively regulates the translation of a subset of mRNAs based on sequence specific recognition motifs in their 5'-UTR. eIF4A1 inhibition by eFT226 downregulates expression of receptor tyrosine kinases and KRAS, leading to decreased signaling through the PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways. Preclinical efficacy testing of eFT226 demonstrates activity across models of solid tumor cancers with amplifications in HER2, FGFR1/2 and mutations in KRAS (including breast, NSCLC and CRC).</description>
