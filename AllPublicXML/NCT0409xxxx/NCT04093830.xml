  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The majority of studies about bimodal hearing advantages have been conducted on adults but
      scant relevant studies into pediatric users, therefore more comparative studies are required
      to compare the effect of bimodal stimulation to unilateral cochlear implant use in children
      with severe to profound sensori-neural hearing loss .

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are now many recipients of unilateral cochlear implants who have usable residual
      hearing in the non-implanted ear. To avoid auditory deprivation and to provide binaural
      hearing, a hearing aid or a second cochlear implant can be fitted to that ear. When bilateral
      cochlear implant cannot be used for patients with bilateral hearing impairment, a hearing aid
      can be used in their non- implanted ear with residual hearing. This is because patients with
      bilateral hearing loss need bilateral stimulation to develop the neural pathway required for
      central processing of binaural hearing.

    <measure>Comparison the audiometric thresholds in bimodal fitting users condition and cochlear implant alone condition</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>By using pure tone and speech audiometer the pure tone audiometry will be done in the free ﬁeld with a speaker at 0° azimuth and the mean threshold in speech frequencies of 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 kilohertz will be determined.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Comparison between speech discrimination score in bimodal fitting condition and cochlear implant alone condition.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The speech discrimination score is a measure as a percentage of words from a standardized list presented at suprathreshold levels that are recognized and repeated by the patient.
a higher score on the speech discrimination test is better
Interpreting speech discrimination score :
100-90% Means Excellent or Normal speech discrimination score, 89-75% Means Good speech discrimination score, 74-60% Means Fair speech discrimination score, 59-50 % Means Poor speech discrimination score&amp; &lt;50% Means Very Poor speech discrimination score.</description>

    <measure>Comparison of early speech perception in bimodal fitting condition and cochlear implant alone condition</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The test will be done starting from a low level using the manual and standard scoring forms of Early speech perception test ( ESP) by using : Compact disc , full-color picture cards, Toys ,digitally remastered sounds, and an All Words menu</description>
