    <textblock>
      This study seeks to estimate the occurrence of adverse events related to the study treatment
      (Cryosurgical freezing and Intratumoral Combination Immunotherapy), as well as determine the
      potential efficacy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cryosurgical freezing will release intact antigens to prime the immune system. The study
      treatment immunotherapeutic drugs (PD-1 inhibitor monoclonal antibody nivolumab and
      anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody ipilimumab, and cyclophosphamide) will then be sequentially
      injected directly into the cancer immediately following cryosurgical freezing. Oral low-dose
      cyclophosphamide will also be administered subsequently. It is speculated that neoantigens
      released from the cryoablated necrotic cancer will be available in the vicinity of the
      cryosurgical freezing field immediately following the procedure. Immature dendritic cells
      attracted to the injection site will internalize neoantigens to become activated to recognize
      cancer-specific antigenic proteins. The activated dendritic cells will recruit killer T-cells
      to the injection site to attack cancer cells, and then migrate through the lymphatic system
      to sites of metastases, targeting cancer-specific neoantigens and recruiting more killer
      T-lymphocytes to destroy other cancer cells harboring the precise antigenic epitopes
      (abscopal (bystander) effect). In this way, dendritic cells are capable of initiating
      cell-mediated systemic immune response in combination with cytotoxic killer T-cells.
      Regulatory T lymphocytes, which have been implicated in dampening or halting cell-mediated,
      antigen-specific immune responses, will be selectively depleted by anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal
      antibodies and low-dose cyclophosphamide. Intratumoral injection of the immunotherapeutic
      medications assists in stimulating and harnessing the local and systemic immune response.
      Oral cyclophosphamide prolongs the immune response. Using this combination of therapies,
      referred to as AbscopalRx1001, it is thought that a clinically significant systemic
      anti-cancer immune response might be elicited. Intratumoral injection of drugs will likely
      offer fewer side effects than systemic therapy.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        5.3.1 Be willing and able to provide written informed consent/assent for the trial.

        5.3.2 Be ≥18 years of age on day of signing informed consent.

        5.3.3 Have a performance status of 0-3 on the ECOG Performance Scale.

        5.3.4 Have a life expectancy of 6 months or more as determined by treating physician.

        5.3.5 Not a candidate for or refuses chemotherapy; or failure of prior chemotherapy.

        5.3.6 PSA &gt;2 ng/mL at baseline.

        5.3.7 Available archival tumor tissue for correlative studies. Submission of archival TRUS
        prostate biopsy tissue is required if available, in the form of representative
        formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor specimens in paraffin blocks (preferred) or
        at least 15 slides, with an associated pathology report. If archival prostate tissues are
        unavailable or cannot be obtained, a repeat TRUS prostate biopsy is not required for
        eligibility.

        5.3.8 Histologically-documented adenocarcinoma or mixed adenocarcinoma-neuroendocrine
        carcinoma of the prostate. All subjects must submit their primary tumor or metastatic
        biopsy pathology specimens and laboratory and imaging reports to Rampart Health where they
        will be centrally reviewed. Central Rampart Health pathologic review is not required for
        screening but rather for confirmation of diagnosis and histologic subtype of cancer. Local
        pathologic review is sufficient for eligibility determination.

        5.3.9 Measurable disease as defined by PCWG3 using iRECIST criteria and identified by
        radiographic imaging. In order to be eligible, the patient must have at least one
        metastatic bone and/or metastatic lymph node site(s) with cancer mass measuring 1 cm or
        more in diameter based on bone and/or soft tissue lesions as defined by any of the
        following:

          -  Bone metastases defined by bone imaging. If the patient has technetium bone scan,
             and/or NaF PET performed, either study may be used for documenting metastases; both
             scans do not need to show the number of metastases required for study entry. For
             patients undergoing PSMA PET, only PSMA avid lesions that are consistent with
             metastasis will be counted as a site of metastasis.

          -  Distant metastatic lymph node disease defined by imaging. A lymph node ≥1 cm in
             shortest dimension will be noted as involved with disease. Distant metastatic lymph
             nodes will be determined as any lymph nodes outside the confines of the true pelvis.
             For patients undergoing PSMA PET, only PSMA avid lesions that are consistent with
             metastasis will be counted as a site of metastasis.

          -  Any other soft tissue lesion defined by imaging deemed by the physician to be
             consistent with distant metastatic disease. For patients undergoing PSMA PET, only
             PSMA avid lesions that have a CT or MRI correlate consistent with metastasis will be
             counted as a site of metastasis.

        5.3.10 The effects of the medications in this protocol on the developing human fetus are
        unknown. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must agree to use adequate contraception
        prior to the first dose of study therapy, for the duration of the study participation, and
        for 120 days after the last dose of study therapy.

        5.3.11 Their partners should be encouraged to use proper method of contraception.

        5.3.12 Acceptable initial laboratory values within 14 days of treatment initiation
        according to the following: ANC ≥ 1500/µl; Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL(prior transfusion
        permitted); Platelet count ≥ 100,000/µl; Creatinine ≤ 2.0 x the institutional upper limit
        of normal (ULN) OR creatinine clearance &gt;30 ml/min; Potassium ≥ 3.5 mmol/L (within
        institutional normal range); Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN (unless documented Gilbert's disease);
        SGOT (AST) ≤ 2.5x ULN, or &lt;5x ULN in patients with documented liver metastases; SGPT (ALT)
        ≤ 2.5x ULN or &lt;5x ULN in patients with documented liver metastases; Albumin &gt;2.5 mg/dL;
        Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) ≤1.5 X ULN unless subject is receiving
        anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or PTT is within therapeutic range of intended use of
        anticoagulants ≤1.5 X ULN unless subject is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT
        or PTT is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants. Deviation from these
        values is allowed at the discretion of the treating investigator.

        5.3.13 No active major medical or psychological problems that could be complicated by study
        participation.

        Exclusion Criteria:
