      Study Type and Design Prospective, Observational Study Rivaroxaban in Elderly AF patients
      with or without renal impairment in Korea

      This study will investigate effectiveness and safety in elderly patients, the result from
      well-designed and high-quality prospective clinical registry collected through real-world
      clinical practice is expected to resolve current medical unmet needs of rivaroxaban in Korean
      elderly patients.

      Primary Study Objective(s) To investigate the effectiveness of rivaroxaban in elderly
      patients with NVAF, with or without renal impairment in Korea real-world clinical practice
      settings Secondary Study Objective(s) To see safety outcome including major bleeding,
      clinically non-major bleeding, all-cause mortality rivaroxaban in subgroup based on risk
      factor(eg. Renal impairment) physicians' treatment pattern in rivaroxaban
