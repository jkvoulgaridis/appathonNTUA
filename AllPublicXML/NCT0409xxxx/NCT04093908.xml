  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite careful patient selection for subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN DBS),
      some Parkinson's disease (PD) patients show limited improvement of motor disability.
      Non-conclusive results and the lack of a practical implantable prediction algorithm from
      previous prediction studies maintain the need for a simple tool for neurologists that
      provides a reliable prediction on postoperative motor improvement for individual patients.

      In this study, a prior developed prediction model for motor response after STN DBS in PD
      patients is validated. The model generates individual probabilities for becoming a weak
      responder one year after surgery. The model will be validated in a validation cohort
      collected from several international centers.

      The predictive model is made public accessible before data collection on:

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Predicting motor outcome after STN DBS in Parkinson Disease can be challenging for the
      clinician. Current prediction studies report non-conclusive results on the most important
      predictors and are limited by used computational methods. Traditional statistical analyses
      which focus on correlations are biased by predictor- and confounder-selection by the
      investigators. Modern computational methods like machine learning prediction models are less
      limited by sample size and can consider a wider range of predictors which leads to less
      selection-bias.

      Retrospective patient data is collected from multiple international centers. This
      retrospective, multicenter cohort is used to validate the model which is developed based on a
      single-center retrospective cohort.

      The goal is to develop a prediction tool that provides the clinician with a probability for
      weak response during the preoperative phase. This could support the clinician in including or
      informing the patient during preoperative counseling.

    <description>Motor outcome is categorised in a binary outcome variable. The model will predict to which outcome group the patient will belong one-year postoperatively. The primary outcome measure is the performance of the predicted outcome categories with the actual outcome categories.
Performance of prediction models is expressed as area under the curve of the receiver operator curve, predictive accuracy, true positive prediction rate, and false positive prediction rate.</description>
