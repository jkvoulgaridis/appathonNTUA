  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label, crossover study designed to evaluate elements of abuse
      liability (AL) including subjective effects, plasma nicotine uptake, and physiological
      measures during and following ad libitum use of the investigational products (IPs) by healthy
      subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will recruit smokers of combustible cigarettes.

      Potential subjects will complete a pre-screening interview and a Screening Visit to assess
      their eligibility within 45 days prior to enrollment.

      Starting on Day 1, eligible smokers will be confined at the clinical site for 9 days.
      Subjects will participate in four separate Test Sessions for AL assessment, one for each IP.
      Each Test Session will last for approximately 4 hours during and following IP use. Subjects
      will be randomized to use one IP in each Test Session: Usual Brand (UB) combustible
      cigarettes, nicotine gum, and 2 Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS).

      For approximately a day and a half prior to each respective Test Session, IP will be
      dispensed for ad libitum use for product familiarization.
