  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will explore the preliminary efficacy of multiple intra-articular injections of
      LRX712 by evaluating the ability of the drug to restore structural integrity of articular
      cartilage. Efficacy will be evaluated in the context of the systemic safety and local
      tolerability of the investigational drug.

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of
      multiple intra-articular injections of LRX712 in the knee when treating patients with knee
      osteoarthritis of mild/moderate severity, in order to support the further clinical
      development. This study will also allow refinement of the systemic and local pharmacokinetics
      of LRX712 and the exploration of drug effects on biomarkers of cartilage breakdown and
      regeneration in OA patients.

             longer; or longer if required by local regulations

          -  Patient has malalignment (valgus- or varus-deformity) ≥ 5° in the index knee as per
             anatomic PA axis measured by weight-bearing short knee radiography

          -  History of significant cardiac conduction/electrophysiological disorder, e.g. familial
             long QT syndrome or known family history of Torsades de Pointes or prolonged QT
             syndrome or QTcF ≥ 450 msec (Fridericia Correction) for males and ≥ 460 msec for
             females at screening or baseline (by local 12-lead digitized ECG reading)
