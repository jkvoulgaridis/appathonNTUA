  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to measure the effects of using a mobile phone app
      (Roadmap 2.0) on the health-related quality of life of caregivers and patients undergoing
      allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT).

      Health information technology tools may enable caregivers and patients to become more active
      participants in their healthcare.This study is not to provide any treatment, but rather to
      investigate the use of this mobile health technology-mediated intervention (Roadmap 2.0).
      Roadmap 2.0 is a web-based application that integrates patient-specific information and
      includes several domains: laboratory results, medications, clinical trial details, photos of
      the healthcare team, trajectory of transplant process, and discharge checklist.

      This trial is anticipated to enroll 664 participants, but only caregivers (332 total) will be
      evaluated for the primary and secondary outcome measures. Thus, the sample size is 332. The
      total enrollment includes 166 caregiver-patient dyads of adult patients (age &gt;/=18 years)
      undergoing HCT (&quot;adult dyads&quot; = 332 total) and 166 caregiver-patient dyads of pediatric
      patients (age 5-17 years) undergoing HCT (&quot;pediatric dyads&quot; = 332 total).

Caregivers download the Positive Activities app onto their mobile phone to use freely throughout inpatient and outpatient (through day 120 post-transplant). Caregiver may also use an electronic tablet provided by the study team during the patient's hospital stay.</description>
