  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with type 1 diabetes need long-term insulin injections. However, needles may cause
      discomfort or provoke anxiety if the patient has needle phobia, factors that contribute to
      poor compliance with insulin, especially in younger patients. Use of needle-free technology
      has been proposed as a strategy to mitigate these problems. There have been few studies on
      the efficacy of needle-free syringes for patients with type 1 diabetes. To determine the
      efficacy of needle-free injection of insulin in its patient population, people with type 1
      diabetes, we conduct a pilot study to assess glycemic control and injection experience of
      patients. For the comparator device, we used an insulin pen. The primary objective is to
      explore whether needle-free syringes are more beneficial to control blood glucose than
      insulin pens of type 1 diabetes, which the blood sugar fluctuates significantly. The
      secondary objective is to evaluate the experience and safety of insulin administration by the
      needle-free injection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, prospective, 1:1 parallel-group, randomized controlled trial. The
      intervention will last for 12 weeks. The laboratory staff who tests the HbA1c level, the
      outcome assessor who collects the blood glucose data and injection experience include the
      measurement of perceived pain, skin condition at the injection site, and device preference in
      participants, and the statisticians will be blinded to the treatment allocation.

      After informed consent is obtained, the participants can attend an initial study visit to
      determine eligibility for the trial. We propose to enroll 60 patients with type 1 diabetes
      (T1DM), participants are randomized into two groups, 30 in the needle-free jet injection
      group and 30 in the pen injection group. Sample size estimation is based on hypothesized
      changes in the primary outcome pre-prandial glucose in the morning. Participants are
      randomized using a computer-generated list.

      In order to ensure high quality data, two staff are responsible for the input of original
      data into the database to check and confirm the accuracy. When the data entered by two people
      are inconsistent, the auxiliary staff decides which data to use.

      Data analysis will be conducted under the intention-to-treat principle by including all the
      randomized patients in the data analysis. Missing data will be filled in with multiple
      imputation method. Any substantial difference in baseline characteristics will be adjusted
      with mixed-model regression analysis. Sensitivity analysis will be conducted by using
      per-protocol data by excluding those patients who drop out of the RCT.
