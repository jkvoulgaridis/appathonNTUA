  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial will determine the added benefit of combining exercise and behavioral
      health education (versus exercise and aging and health education) to improve physical
      activity in community-dwelling older adults who have painful knee osteoarthritis (OA).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a highly prevalent, leading cause of pain that limits physical
      functioning in older adults. Although clinical practice guidelines recommend physical
      exercise for managing symptoms of knee OA, several systematic reviews indicate that exercise
      intervention studies provide only short-term benefits (lasting 6 months) for knee OA. Many
      older adults with painful knee OA return to sedentary lifestyles when structured exercise
      programs end6. Efforts to increase and sustain physical activity in this population will
      require promoting self-regulatory skills to develop confidence to maintain an active
      lifestyle and manage symptoms that often limit activity. Therefore, we developed a
      group-based behavioral health (BH) program for older adults with painful knee OA that
      complements Enhance Fitness (EF) — a multicomponent, community-based exercise program for
      older adults, involving balance, strength, and endurance training. The Behavioral Health (BH)
      program will have 10, 1-hour weekly classes spread over 4 months, while the Health Education
      (HE) program will be equally matched for attention with classes on aging and health. In
      parallel with BH/HE programs, all study subjects will participate in Enhance Fitness (EF)
      exercise classes that will be held for 1-hour, 3 times a week for 4 months. EF+BH
      intervention (versus EF+HE) improves physical activity, pain, physical function, and other
      outcomes in older adults with knee OA.

    <measure>Knee Pain and Function</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months, 10 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) questionnaire will be used. This is a reliable, validated, and widely used patient-reported outcome measure for assessing knee pain and knee pain-related functional limitations in clinical trials of exercise in adults with knee OA. The knee pain and knee pain-related functional limitation subscales range 0-100 with higher scores indicating better outcome.</description>

    <measure>6 Minute Walk Test</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months, 10 months</time_frame>
    <description>Mobility will be measured by the 6-Minute Walk Test. This is a recommended performance-based measures to assess interventions in adults with knee OA and in older adults in general, facilitating comparisons with previous exercise trials.</description>

    <measure>Timed Up and Go Test</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months, 10 months</time_frame>
    <description>Mobility will be measured by the Timed up Go. This is a recommended performance-based measures to assess interventions in adults with knee OA and in older adults in general, facilitating comparisons with previous exercise trials.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fatigue</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months, 10 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PROMIS-57 Profile v2.1 will be collected, which includes 8 question items on fatigue. The PROMIS fatigue score ranges 0-100 with higher scores indicating worse outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Study Specific Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months, 10 months</time_frame>
    <description>This multi-item measure assesses overall participant satisfaction with the study as well as individual treatment components. These questions were developed specifically for the PACIFIC Study. Overall and treatment-specific satisfaction scores range 20-100 with higher scores indicating better outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Global Impression of Change</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months, 10 months</time_frame>
    <description>This is a widely used single item assessment of overall change in health status following treatment on a 7-point scale. Participants are asked, &quot;Since the start of the study my overall status is: (1) Very much improved; (2) Much improved; (3) Minimally improved; (4) No change; (5) Minimally worse; (6) Much worse; and (7) Very much worse&quot;.</description>
