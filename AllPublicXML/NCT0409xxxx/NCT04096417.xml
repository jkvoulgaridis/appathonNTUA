  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well pemigatinib works in treating patients with colorectal
      cancer with mutations (alterations) in a FGFR gene and that has spread to other places in the
      body (metastatic) or cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable). Pemigatinib may stop the
      growth of tumor cells by blocking FGFR, which is needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess overall response rate (ORR) of pemigatinib in patients with metastatic or
      unresectable colorectal cancer harboring activating FGFR alterations.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the clinical benefit rate (complete response + partial response + stable
      disease) with pemigatinib.

      II. To assess progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) with pemigatinib.

      III. Assess changes in patient quality of life (QOL) as measured by the linear analogue
      self-assessment (LASA) questionnaire.

      IV. Assess the frequency and severity of adverse events.

      CORRELATIVE RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess plasma pharmacodynamic biomarkers of response and resistance to therapy.

      II. To explore any correlation between tissue and blood based biomarkers and clinical
      outcomes.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pemigatinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Treatment repeats
      every 21 days for up to 35 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 3 years
      after registration.

    <time_frame>At 36 weeks after registration</time_frame>
    <description>Defined as the percentage of patients, among evaluable patients, who experience an objective response per RECIST 1.1. The proportion of successes will be estimated by the number of successes divided by the total number of evaluable patients. Confidence intervals for the true success proportion will be calculated according to the approach of Clopper and Pearson.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical benefit rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 36 weeks after registration</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical Benefit Rate is defined as the number of patients that experience a complete or partial response within 36 weeks post registration, or have stable disease for at least 36 weeks post registration, divided by the number of evaluable patients. Analysis of this endpoint will mirror that of the primary objective.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-free survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From study entry to the first of either disease progression or death from any cause, assessed up to 3 years after registration</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from study entry to the first of either disease progression or death from any cause, where disease progression is determined based on RECIST 1.1 criteria. PFS will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The median PFS and corresponding 95% confidence interval will be reported. Patients who do not experience disease progression or death while on protocol will be censored at the last disease assessment date.</description>

    <measure>Quality of Life (QOL) as measured by the LASA [item 1: Overall QOL]</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline up to 36 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of Life (QOL) was measured using item 1: Overall QOL of the Linear Analogue Self-Assessment (LASA) Questionnaire on a 0-10 scale, with 0=as bad as it can be and 10=as good as it can be. The QOL scores was converted to a 100-point scale, with 0=Low QOL and 100=Best QOL. Change from baseline to Week 36 will be calculated by subtracting the baseline scores from the scores at Week 36. Negative change indicates the QOL decrease and positive change indicates the QOL improvement.</description>
