    <measure>Closed Kinetic Chain Upper Extremity Stability Test (CKCUEST) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Closed Kinetic Chain Upper Extremity Stability Test/ The CKCUEST is a functional test which assess shoulder's stability. Patient is in push-up position, with 91 cm between his hands. His body is straight and his foots are squeeze. patient has to touch his hand with his other one and returns in the initial position. Then, patient repeats this movement with his other hand, etc, during 15 secondes. The CKCUEST score is the movement's number performed. The outcome measure will be the mean of the three test realisation.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Global Physical Activity Questionnaire. It is a standardized questionnaire which evaluate the global physical activity. GPAQ takes into account both number and intensity of activity. There are 4 parts (profession activities,day to day ways of moving, hobbies, sedentarity) in total being 16 questions.</description>
