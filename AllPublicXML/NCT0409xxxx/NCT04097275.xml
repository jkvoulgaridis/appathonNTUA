  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), are reprogrammed from somatic cells that can
      self-renew indefinitely and produce different types of cells. They provide human model cell
      lines for orphan drug development. It is the goal of this study to define new cellular
      disease models for Inborn Erors of Metabolism, as enabling tools for both drug discovery and
      development.

    <measure>Generation of patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells and then differentiate them into neural cells.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>To generate patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells and then differentiate them into neural cells, or other specific cell according to the Inborn Error of Metabolism, to study the misfolded proteins in endoplasmic reticulum, their role in untranslated protein response, and possible mechanisms to shuttle the misfolded proteins into lysosomes.</description>

    <description>The biopsy will be performed by means of punch biopsy (diameter 2.5 mm) under local anesthesia on a forearm. The skin biopsy will be transferred to sterile cell culture Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) 1% Penicillin 1% Streptomycin 1% Gentamycin medium 10% FBS.</description>

1 x Citrate Phosphate Dextrose Adenine (CPDA) tube (8.5 ml) - for EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines generation
1 x Dried Blood Spot DBS-filtercard, called CentoCardÂ® - for quality control confirmatory genetic testing</description>
