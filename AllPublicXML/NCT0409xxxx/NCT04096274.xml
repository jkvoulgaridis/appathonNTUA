  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the effects of an intervention called Leadership and
      Organizational Change for Implementation (LOCI), relative to implementation as usual (IAU),
      on clinician fidelity to, and youth service outcomes of, a well-established digital
      measurement-based care intervention called the Outcomes Questionnaire-Analyst in outpatient
      community mental health clinics.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the effects of LOCI on the implementation, fidelity, and
      sustainment of a digital measurement-based care (MBC) system called the Outcomes
      Questionnaire Analyst (OQ-A). Over two phases, the investigators will recruit a total of 20
      agencies with up to 2 first level leaders per site (max N of 40 total), a minimum of 3
      clinicians per site (60 total), and 72 caregivers per site (720 total). Agencies will be
      randomly assigned to the control condition (implementation as usual of the OQ-A system) or
      the intervention condition (the LOCI intervention).

    <measure>Fidelity to MBC</measure>
    <time_frame>0-24 months after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Clinician fidelity to the OQ-A, a digital measurement-based care system, will be measured by parent/caregiver reports. Specifically, parents/caregivers will complete the Caregiver Report of Measurement-Based Care measure which assesses the frequency of clinician's use of the measurement-based care system.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Youth Outcomes</measure>
    <time_frame>0-6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Caregivers will be asked about their child's progress throughout treatment in order to assess this relative to their clinician's implementation and fidelity to the MBC system. Caregivers will complete the Shortform Assessment for Children (SAC) to measure youth outcomes--specifically, the youth's rate of symptom reduction throughout treatment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mechanisms of Fidelity</measure>
    <time_frame>0-24 months</time_frame>
    <description>This study will evaluate mechanisms of fidelity in clinician use of the MBC system. Clinicians will take assessments that measure the leadership style of their supervisors, the organizational climate, and clinicians' intentions to use MBC as these are hypothesized to mediate fidelity. Clinicians will complete the Implementation Leadership Scale (ILS) and the Implementation Climate Scale (ICS) to measure rate of improvement.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Agencies must serve youth in an outpatient setting

          -  Agencies must have at least 4 clinicians who see youth

          -  Agencies must be willing to allow first-level leaders (supervisors) to participate in
             the study, including the trainings and data collection

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Agencies will be excluded if they are already using measurement based care (MBC)
             agency wide

          -  Caregivers will be excluded if their child has a diagnosis of active psychosis, autism
             or related developmental disorder, or intellectual disability because the digital
             measurement-based care system we are using is not designed for this population
