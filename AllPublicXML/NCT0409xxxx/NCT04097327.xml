  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this prospective, uncontrolled clinical study is to evaluate the clinical effect
      of Ectoin® Dermatitis Cream-EHK02 on skin hydration and transepidermal water loss (TEWL) in
      subjects with atopic dermatitis after single and multiple applications. Furthermore, data
      concerning the subjective impression of the study preparation should be collected.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The principle mode of Ectoin is based on the physical interaction of this compatible solute
      with water. Ectoin® Dermatitis Cream 7% (EHK02) is able to build an Ectoin® Hydro Complex on
      the skin providing an effective protection against external stress factors, stabilizing the
      skin barrier and moisturizing the dry skin. In former studies, it has been shown that it can
      be used for the symptomatic treatment of atopic dermatitis. This study should confirm the
      efficacy and safety of EHK02.

    <description>Corneometer is a non-invasive instrument that measures barrier function of the skin surface. Change of skin hydration will be assessed comparing values before (initial condition-pretreatment) and after single application. The electrical capacitance of the skin surface will be expressed digitally in arbitrary units. Three measurements will be performed on each test area and the mean will be used to define the skin barrier function of the stratum corneum.</description>

    <time_frame>baseline (pretreatment), 8 hours after first application (post treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>Transepidermal water loss (TEWL) is affected by environmental factors as humidity, temperature, the time of year (seasonal variation) and the moisture content of the skin (hydration level). Tewameter is a non-invasive instrument that measures skin hydration. Change of skin hydration will be assessed comparing values before (initial condition-pretreatment) and after single application. The TEWL measurement will be measured three times and the mean than will be used to define skin hydration of the stratum corneum. The hydration of the skin surface will be expressed in g/hm².</description>
