  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this single-centre, prospective randomised controlled trial is to compare
      clinical, functional, and radiological outcomes in CO THA versus Mako THA. Patients
      undergoing Mako THA will form the investigation group and those undergoing CO THA will form
      the control group.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Reproducibility of the planned pre-operative centre of rotation [COR] of the hip</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks post-op</time_frame>
    <description>Radiographic assessment of the COR will be performed using coronal plane images from the preoperative pelvic CT scan and postoperative CT scanogram at six weeks after surgery.
The COR will be determined using the centre of a circle encompassing the native femoral head on the contralateral side in the preoperative films and the prosthetic femoral head on the ipsilateral side on postoperative films. The horizontal COR will be calculated by measuring the distance between the COR and a line running directly perpendicular from the midline of the pelvis, which is defined as a line connecting the middle of the pubic symphysis and the middle of the inter-sacroiliac line. The vertical COR will be calculated by measuring the distance of a line that runs directly perpendicular from the inter-tear drop line to the COR.</description>
