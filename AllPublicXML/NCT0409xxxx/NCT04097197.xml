  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to study the barriers to flu vaccination among at-risk people at the Primary
      Health Care level in order to increase the vaccination rates as recommended by the World
      Health Organization.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People from vulnerable groups (e.g., those diagnosed with Diabetes, Chronic Obstructive
      Pulmonary Disease, Asthma) are at increased risk of developing complications from infection
      with influenza virus, that could ultimately result in death.

      Flu vaccination is recommended by many authorities, including the World Health Organization,
      as a means to decrease the risk of developing such life-threatening conditions. However,
      vaccination rates are well below the recommended threshold.

    <description>Patients in the experimental arm will receive a brief educational intervention if they initially refuse flu vaccination. The intervention was designed towards the most common barriers to flu vaccination that were found after a brief review of the literature. After the intervention, patients will be asked again whether or not they wish to receive the flu vaccine.</description>
