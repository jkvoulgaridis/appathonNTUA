    <textblock>
      Restoring the sensation of the breast becomes increasingly recognized as a critical part of
      autologous breast reconstruction. A prospective study was conducted of all patients who
      underwent either innervated or non-innervated deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) flap
      breast reconstruction in Maastricht University Medical Center between August 2016 and August
      2018 and who returned between for a follow-up visit between the start of the study and August
      2019. Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments were used for sensory testing of the breast.

    <description>The sensory recovery of the breast to touch was tested at different follow-up moments after the initial surgery. Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments were used for sensory testing. Nine areas of the breast, indicating native skin and flap skin, were tested. Mean monofilament values were calculated for each area and compared between groups.</description>

    <description>The sensory recovery of the donor site to touch was tested at different follow-up moments after the initial surgery. Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments were used for sensory testing. Four areas of the donor site were tested, two areas above and two areas below the scar. Mean monofilament values were calculated for the total donor site and compared between groups.</description>

        In this prospective study, patients who underwent an innervated or noninnervated DIEP flap
        breast reconstruction between August 2016 and August 2018 at Maastricht University Medical
        Center in the Netherlands were included if they returned for follow-up between August 2016
        and August 2019.
