        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Signed the informed consent form (ICF) approved by an institutional review board
             (IRB).

          2. Determined to have genotype TT, AA, or AT.

          3. Weighs at least 50 kg and not more than 100 kg.

          4. If female, must be surgically sterile for at least 6 months prior to screening,
             post-menopausal for at least 1 year, using adequate contraception, have a vasectomized
             partner or abstinent.

          5. Subject is in good physical health as determined by the investigator, based on
             physical examination, medical history, 12-lead ECG, vital signs, and clinical
             laboratory tests.

          6. Subject is willing and able to comply with all aspects of the protocol, including the
             diet and medication restrictions.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. If female, breastfeeding or pregnant.

          2. Use of any prescription or over-the-counter drugs.

          3. Clinical laboratory test results outside laboratory normal range that are determined
             by the investigator to be clinically significant.

          4. Creatinine clearance &lt;90 mL/min (estimated by Cockcroft-Gault formula).

          5. Pulse rate ≤50 or ≥100 bpm, systolic blood pressure ≤90 or ≥140 mmHg, diastolic blood
             pressure ≤60 or ≥90 mmHg or a history of hypertension, recurrent hypotensive events,
             or known orthostatic hypotension.

          6. ECG abnormalities (PR &gt;200 msec; QRS complex &gt;120 msec; QT interval corrected for
             heart rate using Fridericia's formula [QTcF] interval &gt;450 msec if male and &gt;470 msec
             if female, or history of clinically significant ECG abnormalities (such as cardiac
             arrhythmia, familial long QT syndrome, or previous torsade de pointes).

          7. History of diabetes insipidus, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone
             secretion, or any other disorder associated with fluid or sodium imbalance.

          8. History or evidence of any clinically significant surgical or medical condition (eg,
             cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, endocrine, hematologic, hepatic, immunologic,
             metabolic, urologic, pulmonary, neurologic, psychiatric, dermatologic, renal, and/or
             another major disease or malignancy) that would be anticipated, in the opinion of the
             investigator, to compromise subject safety or PK evaluation.

          9. Known allergy or hypersensitivity to 8-L-arginine vasopressin or chlorobutanol.

         10. Clinically significant history of allergic conditions (including drug allergies,
             asthma, eczema, or anaphylactic reactions, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic
             seasonal allergies), as judged by the investigator.

         11. History of or current infection with hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, or human
             immunodeficiency virus.

         12. Use of tobacco- or nicotine-containing products in the 6 months prior or intent to
             smoke during the study. Smoking status will be confirmed by negative urine cotinine
             test.

         13. Consumption of more than 21 units (males) or more than 14 units (females) of alcohol
             per week (1 unit = 10 g pure alcohol or 250 mL of beer [5%], 35 mL of spirits [35%],
             or 100 mL of wine [12%]). Alcohol use is prohibited from 72 hours prior to admission
             on Day -2 until discharge from clinical unit.

         14. History of chronic drug or alcohol abuse in the last 4 years. Lack of abuse will be
             confirmed by urine screens for alcohol and drugs of abuse (amphetamines, barbiturates,
             benzodiazepines, cannabinoids, cocaine metabolites, methamphetamines,
             methylenedioxymethamphetamine, and opiates [including heroin, codeine, and
             oxycodone]).

         15. Participation in a clinical trial of an investigational drug within the 30 days prior
             to admission on Day -2.

         16. Significant blood loss or donation (≥500 mL within the 30 days prior to admission on
             Day -2).

         17. Is an employee or the close relative of an employee of the sponsor or clinical unit.
