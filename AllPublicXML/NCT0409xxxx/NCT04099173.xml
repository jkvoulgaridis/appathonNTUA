    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine whether a Brief Mindfulness-Based Intervention for
      Suicidal Ideation (MB-SI), consisting of four, 45 minute sessions (one session per day,
      provided over a range of 12 subsequent days) will result in short or longer-term reduction in
      suicidal ideation (SI) and/or suicide-related behaviors (SRBs) as well as improvements in
      secondary outcome measures compared to Treatment as Usual (TAU).

    <measure>Measure P1: Number of participants with a significant change in the frequency and/or severity of suicidal-related behaviors</measure>
    <time_frame>Once within 24 business hours of enrollment, once at the day prior to discharge or on admission day 7 (or day 8 or 9 if day 7 is on a weekend), and once at one month post-intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants with a significant change in the frequency and/or severity of suicidal-related behaviors, as measured by the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale, among the MB-SI + TAU cohort compared to the TAU only cohort. The total Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale score can range from 0 to 25, with higher values indicating greater intensity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Measure S1: Number of participants with a significant change in psychiatric hospitalizations and emergency room visits for psychiatric illness</measure>
    <time_frame>One month post-intervention Psychiatric Hospitalizations and Emergency room visits for psychiatric illness</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants with a significant change in Psychiatric Hospitalizations and Emergency room visits, as measured by retrospective review of the electronic medical record, among the MB-SI + TAU cohort compared to the TAU only cohort for one month post-intervention</description>

    <measure>Measure S2: Number of participants with a significant change in state or trait mindfulness, as measured by the Toronto Mindfulness Scale (TMS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Once within 24 business hours of enrollment to study and once at one month post-intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants with a significant change in state or trait mindfulness, as measured by the TMS, among the MB-SI + TAU cohort compared to the TAU only cohort. The TMS consists of 2 subscales: curiosity and decentering. Altogether, the TMS includes 13 statements rated on a scale from 0 = not at all, to 4 = very much. Higher values represent higher state of mindfulness.</description>

    <measure>Measure S3: Number of participants with a significant change in affective state as measured by the Emotional Regulation Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Once within 24 business hours of enrollment to study and once on the day prior to discharge or on admission day 7 (or day 8 or 9 if day 7 is on a weekend).</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants with a significant change in affective state, as measured by the Emotional Regulation Questionnaire, among the MB-SI + TAU cohort compared to the TAU only cohort. 10-likert-type items designed to measure respondents' tendency to regulate emotions in two ways: cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression. Scoring is kept continuous and each facet's scoring is kept separate. Higher scores indicate greater capacity for emotional regulation.</description>

    <measure>Measure S4: Number of participants with a significant change in state or trait mindfulness, as measured by the Five Facet Mindfulness Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Once within 24 hours of enrollment to study, once on the day prior to discharge or on admission day 7 (or day 8 or 9 if day 7 is on a weekend), and once at one month post-intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants with a significant change in state or trait mindfulness, as measured by the Five Facet Mindfulness Scale, among the MB-SI + TAU cohort compared to the TAU only cohort. Five Facet Mindfulness is a scale of 15 items, scores can range from 15 - 75, and higher scores indicate a greater capacity for mindfulness.</description>
