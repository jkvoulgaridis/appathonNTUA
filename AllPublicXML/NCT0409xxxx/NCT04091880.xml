  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be recruited and divided into 3 groups:

        1. Experimental Group (378 subjects): combined immunization of EV71 vaccine and influenza
           vaccine;

        2. Control Group A (378 subjects): EV71 vaccine only;

        3. Control Group B (378 subjects): influenza vaccine only;

      All blood samples will be collected before and one month after vaccinatioin. The
      immunogenicity and safety of both experimental and control groups will be compared and the
      data be analyzed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To further evaluate the feasibility of simultaneously administration of EV71 vaccine and flu
      vaccine, we design this clinical trial to test its immunogenicity and safety. 1134 subjects
      aged from 6 to 11 months old are divided into one experimental group and two control groups
      (control group A and B).

      Each group includes 378 subjects and is divided again into 3 age-based subgroups: ① 6-7
      months old; ② 8-9 months old; ③10-11 months old ; each subgroup has 126 subjects
      respectively.

      378 subjects from the experimental group will be simultaneously administrated with one dose
      of EV71 vaccine (0.5 ml) and one dose of influenza vaccine (0.25 ml). One month later, they
      are going to receive a second dose of EV71 vaccine and influenza vaccine, simultaneously.
      Blood samples are collected before the first vaccination, and one month following the second
      vaccination.

      378 subjects from the control group A will be only administrated with two doses of EV71
      vaccine (0.5 ml) (1 month apart). Blood samples are collected before the first vaccination,
      and one month following the second vaccination.

      378 subjects from the control group B will be only administrated with two doses of influenza
      vaccine (0.25 ml) (1 month apart). Blood samples are collected before the first vaccination,
      and one month following the second vaccination.

      To evaluate the immunogenicity, we will detect and compare the neutralization antibody
      levels, the seroprotection rates, and antibody geometric mean concentrations. The safety of
      all groups will be monitored as well.
