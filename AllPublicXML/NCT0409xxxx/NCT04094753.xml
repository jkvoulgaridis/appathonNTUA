  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Urinary incontinence is an increasing medical and socio-economical problem. 44% of the
      elderly (&gt;65 years) women and 28% of the elderly men suffer from unwilling urine loss.
      Moreover, this percentages increase with age. Incontinence is a problem with multiple
      physical, psychological, and financial effects. In addition incontinence has a important
      impact on the family and healthcare professionals surrounding the elderly.

      The problem of urinary incontinence is complex and multifactorial. Moreover, diagnostic
      guidelines are inconsistent leading to a high amount of technical interventions to diagnose
      and to specify the type of incontinence.

      Aim of this study is to create a short form of necessary technical investigations to diagnose
      and evaluate urinary incontinence.

    <measure>Decreasing the amount of necessary technical investigations to diagnose incontinence</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Based on international guidelines different technical investigations are used and approved to observe the type of urinary incontinence individually. Nevertheless, based on expert opinion all technical investigations schould be done together. However this combination of different technical investigations (urodynamics, questionaires, voiding dairy and clinical examination) is not evidence based and time consuming. We want to develop a statistical model to decrease the need of technical investigations to obtain a correct diagnose of stress urinary incontinence, urge urinary incontinence or mixed incontinence.</description>

    <intervention_name>Renal Function Profile</intervention_name>
    <description>A Renal Function Profile is a 24 hour-urine collection in which urine samples are collected at fixed time points every 3 hours, starting 3 hours after the first morning void. Daytime samples were taken at 10:00-11:30 (U1), 13:00-15:30 (U2), 16:00-17:30 (U3), 19:00-20:30 (U4), and 22:00-23:30 (U5). The nighttime samples were taken at 1:00-2:30 (U6), 4:00-5:30 (U7) and 7:00-8:30 (U8). The volume of each sample, and of each micturition in between, was noted to calculate the 24h, daytime and nighttime urine volume and diuresis rate.</description>
