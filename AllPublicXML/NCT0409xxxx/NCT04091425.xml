  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of administering a
      single intravenous (IV) infusion dose of TAK-925 to adults with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)
      who are experiencing excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) despite adequate use of CPAP as the
      primary OSA therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-925. TAK-925 is being tested to treat
      participants who have EDS due to OSA despite using CPAP. The study will evaluate the
      pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), safety, and tolerability of a single IV dose of
      TAK-925 in participants with OSA.

      The study will enroll approximately 42 patients. The study will utilize a three-way cross
      over design with a 24 hour wash-out between each treatment.

      On Day 1 of each treatment period, TAK-925 or placebo will be administered as a single 9-hour
      IV infusion.

      The multi-center study will be conducted in United States. The patient's participation in the
      study will last for up to 43 days and include an 8-day stay in the study clinic and a safety
      follow-up phone call 7 days after the end of treatment.

    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (example, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. A TEAE is defined as an AE with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug.</description>

          -  Short sleepers with chronic sleep deprivation who get on average less than 7.5
             hours/night time in bed and/or less than 6.5 hours of sleep per night as defined by
             approximately 1 week of nocturnal actigraphy testing and supported by a sleep diary,

             periodic limb movement during sleep (PLMS) &gt;15.

          -  Has used any over-the-counter (OTC) or prescription medications with stimulating
             properties within 7 days before dosing or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) that
             could affect the evaluation of EDS or any use of sodium oxybate within 3 months of
             screening.

          -  Has nicotine dependence that is likely to have an effect on sleep (e.g., a participant

             assessments, or the ability of the subject to complete the study per the judgment of
             the investigator.
