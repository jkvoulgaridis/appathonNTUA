  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this first-in-man Phase I-IIa study is to evaluate the safety and antitumor
      activity of autologous CD44v6 CAR T-cells in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and
      multiple myeloma (MM).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a seamless Phase I/IIa, open-label, multicenter clinical trial that combines
      Phase I dose escalation based on toxicity with Phase IIa dose expansion based on antitumor
      activity. Considering the &quot;first in human&quot; nature of this clinical study, the Bayesian
      Optimal Interval Design (BOIN) has been chosen to minimize any risks of exposure to the novel
      CD44v6 CAR T-cells during dose escalation. The study population is made up of patients with
      relapsed/refractory AML or MM expressing CD44v6.

      The medicinal product under investigation (MLM-CAR44.1 T-cells) is patient specific as it is
      prepared starting from lymphocytes of the patient collected through lymphocyte apheresis.
      These autologous T-cells are expanded in vitro in large numbers and genetically modified to
      express the CAR CD44v6Î”NL gene and thus acquire antitumor functions. As a safety feature, the
      MLM-CAR44.1 T-cells are genetically modified to also express the HSV-TK Mut2 gene (suicide
      gene), which can be selectively activated in case of severe toxicity through the
      administration of ganciclovir (GCV), leading to the death of proliferating CAR T-cells.

      The aim of this study is to assess the safety, antitumor activity and feasibility of CD44v6
      CAR T cell immunotherapy in AML and MM.
