  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to providing parents of children diagnosed with autism spectrum
      disorders (ASD) and disruptive behaviors essential skills to manage their children's
      behaviors using an evidence based parent training protocol. Beyond the feasibility of
      delivering an evidence based intervention in groups and with community partners, primary and
      secondary outcomes in both the children and the parents who participated in the study are
      assessed during and after the intervention process
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      the investigators will deliver parent-mediated, community-implemented, group intervention for
      parents of young children with autism and disruptive behavior. The intervention is 11-12
      weeks and will take place in community settings such as special education schools and
      community centers.

      Within these meetings parents will be given the skills to understand their child's behavior
      and work to modify those that are clinically disruptive to the child and their environment.

      Groups will be facilitated by student therapists under direct weekly supervision of a Board
      Certified Behavior Analyst (BCBA). Data will be collected before, after, and throughout the
      intervention, primarily by parent-report with one teacher-report measure and two (pre/post)
      filmed parent-child interactions.

      The primary desired outcome is a measurable decrease in the child's disruptive behaviors and
      an increase in their adaptive behaviors. Although the intervention specifically targets
      disruptive behavior, we expect to see consequent improvement in a number of linked domains.
      These represent desired secondary outcomes.

      First, as a result of receiving concrete skills and seeing improvement in their child's
      behavior, as well as due to participation in the group with other families, a reduction in
      parental stress and an increase in their perceived self-efficacy should occur, as well as a
      reduction in the stress of the non-participating parent.

      Second, after the reduction in disruptive behaviors there should be an improvement in autism
      symptomatology. Improvements in behavior will allow the child to benefit more from their
      environments, leading to social and developmental gains.

      In the context of the current study, the impact of the intervention on family accommodation
      is also assessed, hypothesizing that by learning how to analyse and modify behaviors, parents
      are gaining a broader insight into the impact their own behaviors have on that of their
      children.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The aberrant behavior checklist: a behavior rating scale for the assessment of treatment effects (Aman, M. G., Singh, N. N., Stewart, A. W., &amp; Field, C. J.,1985)</measure>
    <time_frame>Administered to parents and teachers at baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks (end-point), 16 weeks and 20 weeks (follow-up). The measure will be administered at different time points to follow changes in severe disruptive behaviors of the participants</time_frame>
    <description>A caregiver and teacher report measure of disruptive behaviors including 58 items, each rated on a four-point Likert scale (0-3), with higher scores indicative of more severe problem behavior. Includes five subscales: Irritability (tantrums, aggression and self-injury, 15 items); Social Withdrawal (16 items); Stereotypic Behavior (7 items); Hyperactivity (16 items); and Inappropriate Speech (4 items). In children with ASD, the ABC subscales demonstrate adequate internal consistencies (α=.77-.94) and convergent validity (Kaat, Lecavalier, &amp; Aman, 2014).
The measure will be administered at different time points on order to follow changes in the disruptive behaviors of the participants.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Home Situations Questionnaire (HSQ) (Barkley &amp; Murphy, 1998)</measure>
    <time_frame>Administered to parents at baseline, 12 weeks and at 20 weeks.The measure will be administered at different time points in order to follow changes in compliance levels of the participants.</time_frame>
    <description>A caregiver-rated scale for child noncompliance across 24 everyday situations. Each item is rated as a problem: ''yes'' or ''no''; ''yes'' items are then scored from 1 (mild) to 9 (severe), on two subscales: 'Demand‐Specific' and 'Socially Inflexible' (Chowdhury et al. 2010). The total severity score is divided by 24 to obtain a per item mean.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) (Constantino &amp; Gruber, 2005)</measure>
    <time_frame>Administered to parents at baseline, 12 weeks and at 20 weeks. The measure will be administered at different time points in order to follow changes in social-related behaviors of the participants.</time_frame>
    <description>A caregiver - and teacher-report measure of child social competence with 65 items, each rated on a four-point Likert scale (1-4), with higher scores indicative of more problematic social-related behaviors, in the domains of social awareness, social cognition, social communication, social motivation, and autistic mannerisms (e.g., restricted or repetitive behaviors). All subscales have acceptable internal consistency (α = .77-.92) and test-retest reliability (Constantino et al., 2003)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Adaptive Behavior Assessment System (ABAS-II)</measure>
    <time_frame>administered to participating parents at baseline, 12 weeks and at 20 weeks. The measure will be administered at different time points in order to follow changes related to adaptive behaviors of the participants.</time_frame>
    <description>A comprehensive evaluation tool, covering the ten adaptive behavior deficit areas defined by the DSM-5 (APA, 2013), and it is recommended for use as part of the standard ASD diagnostic evaluation process, by the Ministry of Health in Israel. The ABAS-II provides standard scores on the following core domains: Communication; Use of Community Resources; Academic Functional Skills; Daily Living Skills; Health and Security; Leisure; Self-Help; Self-Direction; Socialization and Occupation, as well as a General Adaptive Behavior Composite Score (GAC). Items are rated on a four-point Likert scale (0-3), with higher scores indicative of higher adaptive functioning.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Parenting Stress Index Short Version (PSI-SR) (Abidin, 1990)</measure>
    <time_frame>administered to all participating and non-participating parents at baseline, 12 weeks and at 20 weeks.The measure will be administered at different time points in order to follow changes in stress levels of parent participants.</time_frame>
    <description>A self-report inventory designed to measure the overall level of parenting stress an individual is experiencing and it examine stressors associated specifically with the parental role and do not include stresses associated with other life roles and events. The PSI-SR has strong psychometric properties and has been used in a number of studies of autism and parent training, and was also found valid and reliable when tested on Israeli parents (sharf 1989; Turkel 2002). It contains 36 items, each rated on a five-point Likert scale (1-5), with higher scores indicative of more parenting stress and includes Parental Distress (PD), Parent-Child Dysfunctional Interaction (P-CDI) and Difficult Child (DC) sub-scales.</description>
