  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective multicenter observational cost-utility study following older or high-risk
      patients with colorectal cancer with and without prehabilitation before surgery.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will answer the question whether prehabilitation is cost-effective in colorectal
      cancer surgery among individual patients aged 70 years and above or patients with an American
      Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score of III. We also aim to identify factors facilitating
      or impairing implementation of prehabilitation such that it is cost-effective.

    <description>Quality of life according to the EuroQol-5 dimensions-5 levels questionnaire. The 5 dimensions cover mobility, selfcare, daily activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety. All dimensions are rated on a 5 level scale ranging from 'I have no problems with ....(dimension)' to 'I am not able to/I am extremely...(dimension)'. The first option is considered 'better' and the latter as 'worse'.</description>

    <description>Dependence regarding (instrumental) acitivities of daily living ((I)ADL)according to the Gait Assessment Rating Scale (GARS). Several items with regard to self-reliance are scored according to the phrase 'I can do ....(item) completely independently.......'. Possible answers are 'Without any effort', 'with some effort', 'With a lot of effort', and 'Only with help from others'. The first is considered better and the latter as worse.</description>

    <measure>Return to normal activity</measure>
    <time_frame>0-6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The return to normal activity (RNA) of patients is investigated by the different questionnaires listed above on several time-points. After surgery, we can examine the time within a time frame of 6 months that patients return to their normal activities.</description>
