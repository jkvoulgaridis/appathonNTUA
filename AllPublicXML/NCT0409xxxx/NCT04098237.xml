  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess weight stability, functional changes, and quality of
      life when Pancreaze (pancrelipase) delayed-release 63,000-lipase unit capsules, for main
      meals, and 21,000-lipase unit capsules, for snacks, are added to standard of care in patients
      with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency due to pancreatic adenocarcinoma. This will be the
      first prospective study of this particular formulation in addition to standard of care in
      advanced pancreatic cancer patients. We will treat 45 consecutive patients with borderline
      resectable, locally advanced and advanced pancreatic cancer patients who present with weight
      loss and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency with this advanced formulation of Pancreaze.

    <description>As measured by patient reported stool consistency using the Bristol Stool Chart.The Bristol Stool Chart is a diagnostic scale to classify stool into 7 different groups, ranging from Type 1-7 (indicating solid to liquid consistency or time spent longest in the bowel to least time in the bowel). A normal stool should be either Type 3 or Type 4 (middle of the scale). Worsening of stool consistency is denoted by classifications located closer to the extreme ends of the scale (Type 1 or Type 7).</description>
