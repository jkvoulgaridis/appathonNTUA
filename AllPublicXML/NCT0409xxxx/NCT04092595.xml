    <description>Period 1 is 4 days in length. On Day 1 of Period 1 participants will receive a single dose of Rosuvastatin 10 mg given as a tablet orally. Period 2 is 11 days in length and will immediately follow Period 1 with no washout. In Period 2, participants will be dosed with oral 200 mg PF-06651600 once-daily (QD) for 7 days. On Day 8 of Period 2, a single dose of 10 mg Rosuvastatin oral tablet will be administered following administration of the 200-mg dose of PF-06651600. Dosing with oral 200 mg PF-06651600 QD will continue until Day 10 of Period 2.</description>
