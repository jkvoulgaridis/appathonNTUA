  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the PIINC study is to identify differences in placental inflammatory lesions
      between women participating in group prenatal care versus standard prenatal care, and
      additionally, examine whether the frequency of placental inflammatory lesions differ by race
      and income. The investigators hypothesize that women participating in group prenatal care
      will have lower pro-inflammatory profiles compared to women in routine prenatal care.

      This is a supplementary investigation of placental inflammatory lesions among participants
      enrolled in a randomized controlled trial comparing biomedical, behavioral and psychosocial
      outcomes among pregnant women who participate in CenteringPregnancy group prenatal care, to
      women in the traditional individual prenatal care and to investigate whether improving
      women's stress, activation and engagement will explain the potential benefits of
      CenteringPregnancy on outcomes and health disparities. The study will be conducted in a large
      prenatal care center in South Carolina. Eligible White and Black women will be recruited
      before 20 weeks of gestational age with low risk pregnancy.
