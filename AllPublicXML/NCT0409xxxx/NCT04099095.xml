  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Social prescribing is a way of understanding the things that are important to a person and
      then using these to find groups and resources in their local community that can help them
      meet their goals and understand their problems. Social prescribing can be used with people
      who have physical health problems, mental health problems, social problems such as loneliness
      or financial/housing problems.

      The Welsh Government has supported the creation of these social prescribing services across
      Wales. However, the evidence showing that social prescribing is a good way of improving a
      person's well-being and quality of life is not very strong.

      This project is an evaluation of a new social prescribing service delivered by British Red
      Cross in two areas in Wales. British Red Cross have made a new social prescribing service,
      where a link worker works with a patient who has mild/moderate mental or emotional health
      problems, to understand their needs and set them goals for the future over 12 weeks of core
      support. The link worker will also help them find services in their local community that
      might help them achieve their goals.

      The study uses a waitlist trial, thus some participants will get to meet the link worker and
      have the intervention straight away, while others will have to wait for 20 working days. From
      this, the researchers can compare the people who had the intervention straight away with the
      people who had to wait. Scores on well-being and quality of life questionnaires will be used
      to see the effects of the intervention on participants.

      Social prescribing is an umbrella term to describe ways of linking people to sources of
      community-based, non-medical support. There is no fixed definition of social prescribing.

      In Wales, social prescribing has many models which require the NHS and third sector
      organisations to work closely together. These involve referral to a link worker/community
      connector/social prescriber from primary care or another referral route, such as social work
      or housing. These roles all practice social prescribing, which includes a 'what matters'
      conversation, co-productive goal setting, motivational interviewing and coaching, followed by
      referral to third sector and community groups/professionals for support and activity to meet
      the person's individual goals.

      Social prescribing is being widely implemented and has support from Welsh Government.
      However, there is limited research evidence to judge its effectiveness, who benefits (if at
      all) and its value for money. Public Health Wales identified gaps in the published evidence
      for social prescribing, particularly in the evaluation of social prescribing projects in
      primary care in Wales. It is therefore important to employ more rigorous and high-quality
      methods to evaluating social prescribing interventions in the community.

      As part of a Welsh Government Third Sector grant for delivering a social prescribing pilot
      with a focus on mental health, British Red Cross are undertaking a research project in two
      localities in Wales, Caerphilly and Pembrokeshire, to create and test a model of social
      prescribing. As part of this initiative, a link worker will work with the individual over a
      12-week period to discuss their needs, goals and future steps. A link worker helps the
      individual to explore extra services that may support them in improving their health, sense
      of wellness and independence by providing practical and emotional support.

      This study will conduct an evaluation alongside the implementation and delivery of the
      British Red Cross social prescribing intervention, using a randomised waitlist evaluation
      method. Participants will either receive the social prescribing intervention within 5 days of
      giving consent, or 20 working days after consent and baseline data collection. This will
      allow the researchers to draw comparisons between the immediate intervention group and the
      waitlist controls, who continue to receive usual care. This will also provide a more robust
      evidence base for social prescribing interventions. The study will use measures of quality of
      life and wellbeing.

    <measure>Change from base-line. The Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (SWEMWBS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>At Base-line, 4 weeks and 3 months after randomisation</time_frame>
    <description>SWEMWBS is completed by the participants and allows self-reflection on mental well-being before and during involvement in health enhancing activities. Each of the 7 statement can be scored from 1 to 5, from 'none of the time' to 'all of the time'. A total score is calculated by summing the 7 individual statement scores. The minimum score is 7 and the maximum is 35. The higher score signifies better mental well-being.</description>

    <measure>Change from base-line. EQ-5D-5L Health Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>At Base-line, 4 weeks and 3 months after randomisation</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L Health questionnaire records the self-reported health using five sections: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each section receives a score ranging from 1 to 5, with a score of 5 providing the most ill-health. The minimum total score is 5 and the maximum 25. The lower the score the better the health of the participant. Part 2 of the questionnaire provides a self-reporting vertical visual analogue scale with the end points labelled, &quot;The best health you can imagine&quot; scoring 100 and &quot;The worst health you can imagine&quot;, scoring 0.</description>
