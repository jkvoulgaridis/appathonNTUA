  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pentoxifylline, the novel
      phosphodiesterase inhibitor, as an adjunctive to risperidone in alleviating the negative
      symptoms of schizophrenia.

      This study aims to examine the efficacy of pentoxifylline, the novel phosphodiesterase
      inhibitor, in a sample of moderately ill outpatients with early-course schizophrenia. The
      investigators hypothesize that as compared to placebo a 2-month treatment with pentoxifylline
      in 120 volunteers with early-course schizophrenia will result in a more significant
      improvement in psychopathology (primary outcome) and cognitive symptoms (secondary outcome).
      In addition, cytokine plasma levels will be used as another secondary outcome measure to see
      if treatment-induced changes in total PANSS score are associated with changes in cytokine
      levels.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      there is some evidence for the role of phosphodiesterase (PDE) signaling system in
      pathophysiology of schizophrenia making this system a potential target for therapeutic
      agents. PDEs are a family of enzymes that hydrolyse cyclic nucleotides and thus play a key
      role in regulating intracellular levels of the second messenger cyclic adenosine
      monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate. Pentoxifylline (PTX) is a methylated
      xanthine derivative and a PDE inhibitor that is FDA-approved for the treatment of patients
      with intermittent claudication on the basis of chronic occlusive arterial disease of the
      limbs. It is known to inhibit platelet aggregation, increase erythrocyte flexibility or
      deformability, and reduce blood viscosity. The rationale for its use in schizophrenia is that
      it competitively inhibits PDEs, resulting in increased cAMP levels, the activation of protein
      kinase A (PKA), the inhibition of IL and TNF-α synthesis, and reduced inflammation.
      Furthermore, there is growing evidence to support the inflammatory hypothesis of
      schizophrenia, the investigators will also explore whether cytokine levels mediate the
      response from pentoxifylline treatment.

    <description>PANSS total score will be used to examine treatment-induced change in psychaopthology. The PANSS is a 30-item rating scale used to assess symptoms of psychopathology. We will use the total PANSS score as the primary outcome measure which reflects total level of psychopathology including the positive and negative symptoms as well as general psychopathology.This measure will be administered at baseline, week 8 and week 16 of the study to assess if pentoxifylline treatment results in a significant reduction in PANSS total score as opposed to placebo.</description>

    <description>Average total score on MCCB will be used to examine treatment-induced change in cognitive function. MCCB (Nuechterlein et al., 2008) will be admisnitered at the baseline an week 16 of the study. The MCCB assesses 7 domains of cognitive functioning known to be impaired for individuals with schizophrenia. A summary score averaging across domains is generated as a global measure of cognitive functioning.</description>
