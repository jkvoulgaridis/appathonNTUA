  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project was undertaking by Qilu Hospital of Shandong University in China. In order to
      report the efficacy and safety of vitamin D combining with high-dose dexamethasone for the
      treatment of adults with newly-diagnosed primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP).

      The investigators anticipate to undertaking a prospective, multicenter, randomised controlled
      trial of 60 ITP adult patients. One part of the participants are randomly selected to receive
      vitamin D (given Rocaltrol orally at a dose of 0.25 μg per day for 1 month), combining with
      dexamethasone (given orally at a dose of 40 mg per day for 4 days, two-cycles with an
      interval of 10 days); the others are selected to receive high-dose of dexamethasone treatment
      plus placebo. Platelet count, bleeding and other symptoms were evaluated before and after
      treatment. Serum calcium and creatinine are monitored. Adverse events are also recorded
      throughout the study. In order to report the efficacy and safety of vitamin D combining with
      high-dose dexamethasone therapy for the treatment of adults with ITP.

Response (R)： A platelet count ≥ 30 * 10^9/L and a greater than two fold increase in platelet count from baseline measured on two occasions &gt; 7 days apart and the absence of bleeding.
No response (NR)： A platelet count &lt; 30 * 10^9/L or a less than two fold increase in platelet count from baseline or the presence of bleeding. Platelet count must be measured on two occasions more than a day apart.</description>
