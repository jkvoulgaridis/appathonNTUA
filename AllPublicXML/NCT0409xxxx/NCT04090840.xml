      BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE

      Two out of three Americans are overweight and obesity is associated with hypertension, sleep
      apnea, atrial fibrillation. Metabolic syndrome with centripetal obesity is also a precursor
      to insulin resistance and the development of Type II diabetes mellitus. While multiple
      strategies for weight reduction are often recommended in physician visits, calculating
      calories and energy expenditure is often inconvenient and does not promote compliance.
      Intermittent fasting, or time-restricted eating, is a methods to limit caloric intake by
      fasting for 16 hours to promote ketosis and suppress insulin secretion. Weight loss and
      reduction in body fat has been observed with brief periods of intervention as time-restricted
      eating results in reduction in overall caloric intake. Prospective feasibility studies and
      randomized comparative trials with intermittent fasting are lacking.

      The investigators recommend caloric restriction in all of our patients that suffer from
      arrhythmias and BMI &gt;30. However, they have not systematically measured compliance and the
      efficacy of lifestyle interventions. Lifestyle counseling and weight loss has been shown to
      decrease the progression and burden of symptomatic atrial fibrillation. Intermittent fasting
      can result in consistent reductions in body fat and weight without specific lifestyle
      counseling. The aim of the present observation cohort study is to assess the feasibility of
      recommending intermittent fasting in an arrhythmia clinic with regard to compliance and
      efficacy.

      The investigators hypothesize that compliance and adherence to a 16/8 intermittent fasting
      regimen will be &gt;25% and result in weight loss, compared to the 6 month trend prior to the
      intervention. This pilot study will serve as the basis to power the first randomized trial
      comparing intermittent fasting with other types of dietary counseling for arrhythmia
      outcomes.

      OBJECTIVES

      To prospectively assess compliance to prescribed intermittent fasting, measured by adherence
      and change in weight at 6 months.
