  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide, especially in developed
      countries. In developing countries, including South Korea, the incidence and mortality rate
      of breast cancer is rapidly increasing. One of the most important characteristics of breast
      cancer in South Korea, as well as in other Asian countries, is the younger onset of disease
      compared to Western.

      Medical treatment of breast cancer is evolving rapidly, incorporating immune checkpoint
      blockades and molecularly targeted agents. However, data and knowledge are still limited in
      terms of molecular characteristics of Asian breast cancer, compared to that of Western
      countries, and this remains a major hurdle for drug development in Asian breast cancer
      patients.

      The primary objective of this study is to elucidate the genetic characteristic of young (&lt;50
      years of age) Korean patients with metastatic breast cancer using FoundationOne CDx.

      Secondary Objective(s):

        1. To evaluate the prognostic and predictive role of tumor mutation burden.

        2. To reveal the correlation between genetic characteristics and immunohistochemical
           expression of selected proteins (including DNA damage repair (DDR) molecules and various
           immune modulating molecules including PD-L1, PD-1, IDO, and OX40).

        3. Compare molecular characteristics of breast cancer according to age groups (&lt;35 years
           vs. 35-50 years).

        4. To offer genomic profiling guided therapy to patients as early as possible (preferably,
           1st- or 2nd-line of treatment). In addition, to explore how genomic profiling guided
           therapy could improve patient outcome as an ad-hoc if sufficient number of patients can
           be followed up (compared to historic data).
