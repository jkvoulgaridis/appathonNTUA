  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to 15 subjects will be enrolled to evaluate initial safety and performance of the AtaCor
      Temporary Pacing System. Safety will be evaluated through analysis of all Adverse Events.
      Performance will be evaluated through (1) the incidence of successful StealthTrac Lead
      placement using the MACH I Delivery Tool, (2) electrical performance measurements, such as
      pacing capture thresholds, sensed R-wave amplitudes, pacing impedance and skeletal muscle
      stimulation at rest. Appropriate sensing and pacing capture will be ascertained from ECG
      Holter Monitor recordings during periods of in-hospital ambulation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Enrolled Subjects will have both a market-released transvenous pacing lead and
      investigational StealthTrac Temporary Pacing Lead placed and evaluated. During the placement
      procedure, diagnostic echocardiograms will be performed to detect any new pericardial
      effusions. Once inserted, the StealthTrac Lead will be used to deliver high rate pacing (160
      to 220 BPM) in clinically appropriate Subjects, to demonstrate suitability for use in
      transcatheter procedures that require brief periods of temporary pacing. Lead positions will
      be documented using fluoroscopic images before the Subject leaves the procedure room. On the
      following two days after the procedure, electrical performance will be evaluated in multiple
      postures and appropriate pacing and sensing will be confirmed during activity using ECG
      Holter monitor recordings. Subjects will also be asked patient-centric questions about their
      experience with the StealthTrac Lead throughout the study period. Evaluations will continue
      for a minimum of two (2) and a maximum of seven (7) days after the index procedure. Prior to
      StealthTrac Lead removal, an X-Ray will be taken to document the final lead position and
      diagnostic echocardiography will be performed to (1) detect any latent pericardial effusions
      and (2) assess differences in cardiac function with intrinsic conduction and while pacing. A
      final follow-up will be performed 25-30 days after removal to identify any latent adverse
      events before the Subject exits the study.

    <description>The StealthTrac Lead is designed to facilitate extracardiac temporary ventricular pacing and sensing. The distal end of the StealthTrac Lead is designed to reside within the connective tissue of the anterior mediastinum outside the pericardium. The StealthTrac Lead is delivered using the MACH I Delivery Tool, which is designed to facilitate insertion of the StealthTrac Lead through a small skin incision parallel to the sternum, without the need for fluoroscopic guidance.</description>
