  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes becomes the most prevalence chronic disease worldwide. Most type 2 diabetes
      patient are under the care in public general out-patient clinic in Hong Kong. The chronic
      nature of diabetic and the complexity of its management, on top of medication, diabetic
      patients often require behaviour modification and self-care management support. Effective
      diabetes self-care management education with patient-centered care approach with patients'
      participation and engagement has been shown to improve the clinical outcome. But such
      application during doctors' consultation are minimal in view of time limitation. Primary Care
      Nurse (PCN) is the first contact and is easily accessible in GOPCs. With support and
      training, PCN could act as a case manager to deliver the coordinated care. Interact and
      engage type 2 diabetes patients in self-care management, and work with multidisciplinary team
      in providing patient-centered care in GOPC setting. As there is lack of evidence about
      adopting such approach in the investigator's local population. This study is to test the
      effectiveness of the PCN led self-care management program to improve patients' clinical
      outcomes.

      1. Safety Assessment

           There is no harmful effect from the intervention.

        2. Statistics

           (A) Sample Size Estimation With reference from previous study (Aanand et al. 2011), the
           sample size is calculated by assuming change the reduction of HbA1c is 0.59%
           (intervention group 8.05% (SD 1.40) versus control group 8.64% (SD 1.39). In order to
           have 80% power and 5% false positive error, a sample size of 88 is needed for each arm
           using the public domain sample size calculator (https://www2.ccrb.cuhk.edu.hk/stat/).
           After consideration of 10% attrition rate, 97 participants will be recruited in each
           arm.

           (B) Data Analysis All statistical analyses will be performed using SPSS Windows 22.0
           program. P-value less than 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. All
           treatment evaluations will be performed on the principle of intention-to-treat analysis
           of the difference in outcomes between groups at 6 months after baseline. Missing values
           will be imputed using last value carrying forward method. Repeated analysis will be done
           for per-protocol analysis. Demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized
           using descriptive statistics. Continuous variable will be summarized as numbers of
           observed values, mean and standard deviation. Categorical variables will be described as
           frequency and percentage. Information collected on all outcomes will be first summarized
           using descriptive statistics at baseline and at 6 months as appropriate. Linear
           regression model will be used to test the effect of intervention on the outcomes between
           2 groups.

        3. Direct Access to Source Data and Documents

           Apart from the outpatient number and Initials, no subject sensitive identifier will be
           contained in the completed questionnaires. All completed questionnaires will be kept in
           knocked administrative room in research site with limited access by investigators. All
           patient records in CMS will be accessed by investigators only by their own CMS login.

        4. Quality Control and Quality Assurance

           Expert panel including family medicine specialist, diabetes nurse consultant, diabetes
           nurse working in primary health care setting, dietitian, physiotherapist and podiatry
           will review the education contents. Nurses who have received structural education on
           chronic disease management as organized by Institute of Advanced Nursing Studies,
           Hospital Authority will be assigned to provide intervention to participants. All the
           interventionist and co-investigator will be trained for 4 hours by principal
           investigator for the objectives, contents and process of program before implementation.
           Meeting will be held during the process of data collection to exchange ideas and
           knowledge between the interventionist.

           Principal investigator will monitor in all study phase. The interaction between
           interventionists and participants will be guided by protocol and guideline.
           Co-investigator in individual clinic will monitor participants' recruitment and data
           collection. Principal investigator will randomly check and sit in to monitor the
           consistency.

        5. Ethics and Data Handling

      Ethics of this study will be complied with the Declaration of Helsinki. Investigators will
      explain the study in detail and subjects will sign an informed consent form with written
      information sheet. Investigators will clarify all the queries with subjects. The enrolment
      will be entirely voluntary and it will not affect their care received in the study site. All
      the personal identifiers will be removed during data processing. The relevant documents will
      be kept in a locked cabinet in the study site and will be retained for 3 years after the
      study end.

    <time_frame>Assess change from Baseline HbA1c at 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Diabetes Knowledge Scale (DKN) (Dunn et al, 1984) will be adopted to measure participants' knowledge level. The DKN questionnaire consists 15 multiple-choice items each related to test the participants' knowledge level on the major areas of basic physiology of diabetes and general principles of diabetes care. A score of 1 is assigned for a correct response and 0 for an incorrect response. The total score is calculated by summing the scores from 15 items. The total scores are then converted to percentages. High scores on this measure indicated a higher level of diabetes knowledge. The original English version of the DKN questionnaire was translated into Chinese version by Chan &amp; Molassiots (1999) and has been validated for Hong Kong Chinese T2DM patient in an out-patient diabetes clinic. The content validity index is 0.96.</description>

    <measure>Self-Efficacy: Diabetes Empowerment Scale - Short Form (C-DES-SF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Assess change from Baseline HbA1c at 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Diabetes Empowerment Scale - Short Form (C-DES-SF) will be adopted to measure participants' self-efficacy level. It has been validated for Hong Kong Chinese patient by Shiu, Choi &amp; Wong (2012). The Internal consistency (α = 0.77) and the test-retest validity (ICC 0.89, 95% CI 0.86-0.92). The scale consists of 10 items and reports in a 5-points Likert scale. An item checked &quot;strongly agree&quot; receives 5 points; &quot;agree&quot; - 4 points; &quot;neutral&quot; - 3 points; &quot;disagree&quot; - 2 points; and &quot;strongly disagree&quot; receives 1 points. An overall score for the C-DES-SF would be calculated by adding all of the item points. Higher points represent higher level of self-efficacy to manage diabetes in his/her daily live.The items to be reported are (a) overcoming barriers, (b) determining suitable methods, (c) achieving goals, (e) obtaining support, and (f) coping.</description>

    <measure>QOL: Audit of Diabetes Dependent Quality of Life (ADDQoL-19)</measure>
    <time_frame>Assess change from Baseline HbA1c at 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Audit of Diabetes Dependent Quality of Life (ADDQoL-19) will be used to measure participants' QOL. The Internal consistency (α = 0.81) and the construct validity was proven (Fung &amp; Wong, 2016). The scale consists of 19 diabetes-specific domain items and reports in a 7-points scale. Respondents rate the impact of diabetes on applicable domains on a scale from -3 (maxmium negative impact) to +1 (maximum postive impact). Respondents then rate the importance of those domains for their QOL on a scale from 3 (very important) to 0 (not at all important). Impact ratings are multiplied by the corresponding importance rating to provide a weighted-impact score for each domain from -9 (maximum ngeative impact) to +3 (maximum postive impact). Weighted impact score are summed and divided by the number of applicable domains, to give a overall Average Weighted Impact (AWI) score. Higher AWI scores represent a worse of quality of life as impacted by diabetes.</description>
