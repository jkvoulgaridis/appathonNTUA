  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess safety of velaglucerase alfa (VPRIV) in participants
      affected with Gaucher disease type 1 (GD1) transitioning from other enzyme replacement
      therapies (ERTs)/ substrate reduction therapies (SRTs) to VPRIV in a Canadian real-world
      setting across all age groups.

    <measure>Number of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs) Following the Transition From Other ERTs/SRTs to VPRIV</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. Number of participants transitioning from other ERTs/SRTs to VPRIV with AEs will be reported.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Use of Glucosylspingosine (Lyso-Gb1) Biomarker</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>Change in use of Lyso-Gb1 by participants following the transition from other ERTs/SRTs to velaglucerase alfa (VPRIV) will be assessed.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Gaucher Disease Questionnaire Score at Month 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>Gaucher disease questionnaire (PRO) scores will be calculated for each adult participant (greater than or equal to [&gt;=] 18 years).
The questionnaire asks how much the participant is affected by the Gaucher disease. A total summated score is calculated and ranges from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating more severe impairment and worse quality of life.</description>
