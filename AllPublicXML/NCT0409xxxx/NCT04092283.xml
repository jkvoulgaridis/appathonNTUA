    <textblock>
      This phase III trial studies how well an antibody (durvalumab) with chemotherapy and
      radiation therapy (chemoradiation) works in treating patients with stage III non-small cell
      lung cancer that cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable). Immunotherapy with monoclonal
      antibodies, such as durvalumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may
      interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. This study is being done to see
      if adding durvalumab to standard chemoradiation followed by additional durvalumab can extend
      patients life and/or prevent the tumor from coming back compared to the usual approach of
      chemoradiation alone followed by durvalumab.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate whether there is an improvement in overall survival with concomitant
      chemotherapy/radiation therapy/MEDI4736 (durvalumab) followed by one year (12 cycles) of
      MEDI4736 (durvalumab) as compared to concomitant chemotherapy/radiation followed by one year
      (12 cycles) of MEDI4736 (durvalumab).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the difference in response using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
      (RECIST) 1.1 criteria to assess whether or not MEDI4736 (durvalumab) added to concomitant
      chemo/radiation results in an improvement in response rates.

      II. To evaluate any difference in progression free survival (PFS) with concomitant
      chemotherapy/radiation therapy/MEDI4736 (durvalumab) followed by one year (12 cycles) of
      MEDI4736 (durvalumab) as compared to concomitant chemotherapy/radiotherapy followed by one
      year of MEDI4736 (durvalumab).

      III. To evaluate whether the incidence of recurrence and recurrence pattern is affected by
      giving MEDI4736 (durvalumab) during chemo/radiation.

      IV. To evaluate any difference in toxicity when MEDI4736 (durvalumab) is added to concomitant
      chemo/radiation using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE).

      OUTLINE:

      STEP 1 (CONCURRENT THERAPY): Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive durvalumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1 and 15 of
      cycle 1 and day 1 of cycle 2. Patients also receive 1 of 3 treatment regimens per
      investigator choice: 1) etoposide IV over 60 minutes on days 1-5 and cisplatin IV over 60
      minutes on days 1 and 8 every 28 days for 2 cycles; 2) pemetrexed disodium IV over 60 minutes
      and cisplatin IV over 60-120 minutes on day 1 every 21 days for 2 cycles; or 3) paclitaxel IV
      over 60 minutes and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1 every 7 days for 6 cycles.
      Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning
      on day 1 of chemotherapy, patients receive radiation therapy 5 days a week for 6 weeks.

      ARM B: Patients receive 1 of 3 investigator's choice treatment regimens and radiation therapy
      as in Arm A.

      STEP 2 (CONSOLIDATION THERAPY): Within 14 days after the last dose of radiation (from Step
      1), all patients then receive durvalumab IV over 60 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every
      28 days for 12 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months if less than 2
      years from study entry, every 6 months if 2-5 years from study entry, and then yearly for
      years 5-10 from study entry.

                  based pill

               -  Methods that are considered inadequate include male or female condom with or
                  without spermicide; female cap, diaphragm, or sponge with or without spermicide;
                  non-copper containing intrauterine device; progestogen-only oral hormonal
                  contraceptive pills where inhibition of ovulation is not the primary mode of
                  action [excluding Cerazette/desogestrel which is considered highly effective];
                  and triphasic combined oral contraceptive pills)

             recover to grade 2 (or less) within 45 days after the end of concurrent
             chemo/radiation, with the exception of alopecia, vitiligo, and the laboratory values
             defined in the inclusion criteria

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  STEP 1 EXCLUSION ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA - CONCURRENT THERAPY

          -  Patient must not have a known active tuberculosis infection

          -  Patient must not have any severe infections within 4 weeks prior to registration
             including, but not limited to, hospitalization for complications of infection,
             bacteremia, or severe pneumonia

          -  Patient must not have signs or symptoms of severe infection (sepsis) within 2 weeks
             prior registration

          -  Patient must not have been treated with systemic immunostimulatory agents (including
             but not limited to interferon-a [IFN-a], interleukin [IL]-2) within 6 weeks or five
             half-lives of the drug (whichever is shorter) prior to registration; or treated with
             an investigational agent within 4 weeks prior to registration (or within five
             half-lives of the investigational agent, whichever is longer)

          -  Patient must not have a history of severe allergic, anaphylactic, or other
             hypersensitivity reactions to chimeric or humanized antibodies or fusion proteins

          -  Patient must not have been treated with systemic immunosuppressive medications
             (equivalent to &gt; 10 mg prednisone per day) or other immunosuppressive medications
             within 7 days of registration. Inhaled or topical steroids and adrenal replacement
             steroid doses equivalent to &gt; 10 mg prednisone per day are permitted in the absence of
             active autoimmune disease

          -  Patient must not have had a prior allogeneic bone marrow transplantation or prior
             solid organ transplantation

          -  Patient must not have a history of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, pneumonitis
             (including drug induced), organizing pneumonia (i.e., bronchiolitis obliterans,
             cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, etc.), or evidence of active pneumonitis on
             screening chest computed tomography (CT) scan within 4 weeks of registration

          -  Patient must not have had any prior systemic treatment with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1,
             anti-PD-L2, anti-CTLA-4 antibody, or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting
             T-cell costimulation or immune checkpoint pathways

          -  Patient with known history or current symptoms of cardiac disease, or history of
             treatment with cardiotoxic agents, should have a clinical risk assessment of cardiac
             function using the New York Heart Association Functional Classification. To be
             eligible for this trial, patients should be class 2B or better. For example, patients
             must not have the following:

               -  Unstable angina and/or congestive heart failure requiring hospitalization within
                  180 days prior to registration

               -  Uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia within 180 days prior to registration

          -  Patient must not have an uncontrolled intercurrent illness, including but not limited
             to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, uncontrolled
             hypertension, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, interstitial lung disease,
             serious chronic gastrointestinal conditions associated with diarrhea, or psychiatric
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirement,
             substantially increase risk of incurring adverse events (AEs) or compromise the
             ability of the patient to give written informed consent

          -  Patient must not have received a live, attenuated vaccine within 4 weeks prior to
             registration

          -  Patient must not have unintentional weight loss &gt; 10% within 30 days prior to
             registration

          -  Patient must not have had past radiation to the current intended treatment site

          -  Patient must not donate blood while on study treatment

          -  STEP 2 EXCLUSION ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA - CONSOLIDATION

          -  Patients must not receive any non-protocol anti-cancer therapy after the end of
             chemo/radiation or during consolidation

          -  Patients with suspected cases of &gt;= grade 2 pneumonitis (non-infectious) are not
             eligible for consolidative MEDI4736 (durvalumab) and will proceed onto follow-up
             instead

          -  Patients must not have disease progression on the first post-treatment (for concurrent
             chemo/radiation) chest CT scan, which must be obtained within 14 days after the last
             dose of radiation therapy. If so, the patient is not eligible for consolidative
             MEDI4736 (durvalumab) and will proceed onto follow-up instead
