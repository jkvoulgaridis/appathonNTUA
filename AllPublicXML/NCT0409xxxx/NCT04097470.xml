  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate how safe and effective the addition of the new
      medicine midostaurin to decitabine is for the treatment of unfit acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
      and high-risk myelodysplasia (MDS) patients. Patients who are ineligible for intensive
      chemotherapy because of accompanying diseases may opt for gentler treatment. This does not
      produce a cure but serves to allow the quality of life to be acceptable for as long as
      possible. Decitabine is an example of a gentler treatment. It is effective against leukemia
      and has fewer side effects than intensive chemotherapy. Given in courses of 5 successive
      days, decitabine is registered for the treatment of AML. There is scientific research to
      suggest that decitabine is more effective and generally well tolerated when given in courses
      of 10 successive days. Therefore, treatment with 10-day courses of decitabine is the standard
      treatment in this scientific research. The aim is to investigate whether this standard
      treatment can be improved by adding a new product, midostaurin. Midostaurin is a medicine
      that is directed against a specific protein on leukaemia cells (FLT3).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial aims to develop effective treatments for unfit (i.e. Hematopoietic cell
      transplantation co-morbidity index (HCT-CI) ≥ 3) in adult (≥ 18 yrs) AML patients, for whom
      current treatment strategies are highly unsatisfactory. Therefore new treatment modalities
      are introduced and evaluated in multiple parallel randomized phase II studies that will be
      conducted within the frame of a master protocol. The scheme of this new design consists of
      one arm with one of the currently considered best available treatments for unfit AML patients
      (i.e. 10-day decitabine). After a maximum of 3 10-day courses, or less in case of good
      response, treatment will be continued with 5-day decitabine courses. This treatment will be
      compared to investigational treatments in combination with decitabine.

      The competitor of the 10-day decitabine schedule will be 10-day decitabine combined
      (sequential) with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor midostaurin (independent of the presence of
      FLT3 mutations). The rationale for midostaurin is: 1) single agent midostaurin has shown
      efficacy in both FLT3 wild type and mutant AML; 2) it has shown efficacy in a phase III
      randomized controlled trial when combined with intensive chemotherapy in FLT3-mutated AML
      (RATIFY study); 3) midostaurin has been successfully combined with hypomethylating agents
      (azacitidine and decitabine) and improved the response compared with historical response
      rates of these drugs, suggesting at least additive affects of midostaurin with
      hypomethylating agents.
