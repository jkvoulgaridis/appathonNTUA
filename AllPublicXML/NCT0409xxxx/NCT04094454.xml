    <textblock>
      A commercially available vaginal dilator set will be used as measuring device. The grading of
      vaginal stenosis will be determined as difference of the diameter of vaginal dilator to the
      baseline. A reduction of the diameter of &lt;20% is defined as vaginal stenosis Grade 1, a
      reduction of 20-35% as Grade 2, a reduction of &gt;35-49% as Grade 3 and a reduction &gt;/=50% as
      Grade 4. The investigators hypothesize that the rate of vaginal stenosis Grade 1 or higher 12
      months after radiotherapy is lower in the group using extended vaginal dilation during
      radiotherapy (Arm A). Rates of vaginal stenosis of 50% have been observed in previous patient
      collectives and the investigators hypothesize that a reduction to 25% is possible in the
      experimental group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed as a prospective, randomized, two-armed, single-center phase-II-trial.
      60 patients will be included in the study. Patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria will be
      randomized into one of the two arms, which differ only in the diameter of a tampon used for
      vaginal dilatation during treatment. All patients will receive standard (chemo)radiotherapy
      with a total dose of 45-50,4 Gy (single dose 1,8-2 Gy) to the pelvic and inguinal (if
      required) lymphatic drainage with a boost to the anal canal up to 54-60 Gy (single doses
      1.8-2.2 Gy). The primary objective is the assessment of the incidence and grade of vaginal
      fibrosis 12 months after (chemo)radiotherapy for anal cancer depending on the extent of
      intrafractional vaginal dilatation. Secondary endpoints are clinical symptoms and toxicity
      according to the Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) version 5.0, assessment of clinical
      feasibility of daily use of a tampon for vaginal dilatation, assessment of the compliance for
      the use of a vaginal dilatator and quality of life assessed with the EORTC-QLQ30/-ANL27
      questionnaires.
