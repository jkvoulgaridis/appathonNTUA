  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The smART+ is a comprehensive modular patient care system intended for ICU patients.

      The main purpose of the study is the optimization of the delivery of nutrition.

      The use of the smART+ Feeding tube includes a feature of facilitating correct tube placement
      and alerting when the tube is displaced during ongoing use. The system will automatically
      stop feeding if displacement is detected. If a massive reflux episode is detected by the
      system, a balloon located on the tube will automatically inflate and automatic GRV feature
      will open to prevent gastric content from regurgitating to the esophagus.

      In addition to tube placement, the system allows to obtain REE (Resting Energy Expenditure)
      measurements and calculates the optimized nutritional values required by the patient.
      Furthermore, the system optimizes feeding by compensating for any lost feeding time or
      discarded nutritional content that was discarded via the GRV (Gastric Residual Volume).

      Study participants will be randomly assigned to a study group:

      Group A- ICU patients receiving the investigational device (&quot;Treated&quot;). Group B- Control
      group.
