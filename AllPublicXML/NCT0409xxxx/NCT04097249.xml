  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study sought to evaluate the vasomotor response in the pain referral area of healthy
      individuals, performing the same procedure with and without the experience of delayed onset
      muscle soreness.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Validity of infrared thermography for properly diagnosing musculoskeletal pain and their
      clinical applicability is lacking. This study investigates temperature changes on the upper
      extremity before and after a suprathreshold stimulation (painful stimulus) with a digital
      algometer over the infraspinatus muscle. The same procedure is performed in two consecutive
      days, 24 hours apart (Day-1 and Day-2). At the end of Day-1, an eccentric exercise is
      performed in order to to induce delayed onset muscle soreness on the external rotators of the
      shoulder.

    <description>A thermography image of the upper extremity of the body will be taken on both days of assessment before and after applying a painful stimulus. Changes in colour pixels will be analysed to determine temperature changes.</description>

    <measure>Changes in Pressure Pain Thresholds: pressure algometry</measure>
    <time_frame>Day-1 (baseline assessment, pre exercise before painful stimulus), Day-2 (24 hours post-exercise before painful stimulus)</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in pressure pain thresholds will be determined with pressure algometry over the infraspinatus muscle. Pressure Pain Threshold is defined as the exact time point where the pressure is first being perceived as painful.</description>
