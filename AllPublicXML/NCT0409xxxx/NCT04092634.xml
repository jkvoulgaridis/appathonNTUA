      The aim of this study is to compare clinical outcomes of patients considered to be high risk
      for prosthetic dislocation undergoing primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) with the use of a
      dual mobility bearing versus a conventional, single bearing design.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Primary THA for a diagnosis of osteoarthritis or inflammatory arthritis in the setting
             of a history of prior lumbar or lumbosacral fusion performed at least 6 months prior
             to their THA. In addition, patients considered high-risk for potential prosthetic
             dislocation will be included based on the presence of one or more of the following:
             neuromuscular disorder (e.g. cerebral palsy, Parkinson's disease, history of a
             stroke), dementia or cognitive impairment, substance or alcohol abuse (&gt;10 drinks per
             week), acute displaced femoral neck fracture, age &gt; 75 years, inflammatory arthritis,
             and increased preoperative range of motion (calculated as described by Krenzel et al.:
             combined flexion, adduction, internal rotation &gt; 115 degrees).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Less than 18 years of age

          -  Revision THA

          -  spinopelvic fusion that is more recent than 6 months prior to THA

          -  isolated cervical or thoracic fusion

          -  intent to undergo a revision spinopelvic fusion within one year of their index THA

          -  a history of prior infection in the affected hip

          -  a history of prior open surgery on the affected hip (i.e. prior proximal femur
             fracture or osteotomy)

          -  or a preoperative diagnosis of post-traumatic arthritis, avascular necrosis, or
             fracture
