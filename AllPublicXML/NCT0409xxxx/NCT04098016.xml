  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will develop a digital intervention (&quot;Healthy Roots&quot;) adapted from a previously
      tested adult digital obesity treatment intervention (&quot;Track&quot;).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Healthy Roots will focus on improving the clinical encounter between WIC clinicians and
      socioeconomically disadvantaged mothers, who are disproportionately impacted by obesity,
      during the first 6 months postpartum. The proposed trial will test the feasibility of mothers
      receiving WIC benefits to participate in a pilot digital behavioral intervention to increase
      diet quality, which will deliver nutrition guidance for meeting recommendations outlined in
      the Dietary Guidelines for Americans using interactive self-monitoring and feedback, and
      tailored skills training. I will also explore acceptability of participating in Healthy Roots
      among both mothers receiving WIC benefits and WIC clinicians who are delivering counseling.
      This will help determine the potential for this intervention to be implemented into the
      existing clinical WIC encounter.
