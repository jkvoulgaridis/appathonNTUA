    <textblock>
      Cerebral palsy is a disorder of movement and posture resulted from a non-progressive lesion
      or injury of the immature brain. It is a leading cause of childhood-onset disability.

      Many experimental animal studies have revealed that umbilical cord blood is useful to repair
      neurological injury in the brain.

      Based on many experimental studies, umbilical cord blood is suggested as a potential therapy
      for cerebral palsy.

      This protocol was developed based on the results of the previously approved protocol of the
      center NCT03826498 (Allogeneic cord blood transfusion in patients with infantile cerebral
      palsy), which showed high efficiency in the rehabilitation of patients. The present protocol
      is intended for revealing the dependence of the clinical effect on the degree of tissue
      compatibility of umbilical cord blood samples and the recipient

      Cerebral palsy (CP) is a group of neurodevelopmental conditions with abnormal movement and
      posture resulted from a non-progressive cerebral disturbance. It is the most common cause of
      motor disability in childhood. Most therapies are palliative rather than restorative.
      Umbilical cord blood (UCB) may be used as restorative approach for children with CP.

      Many experimental animal studies have revealed that UCB is beneficial to improve and repair
      neurological injuries, this effect achieved due to immune regulation and angiogenesis as well
      as the neuroprotective effect.

      Based on animal studies and some clinical trials, UCB is suggested as a potential therapy for
      children with CP.

      This study is prospective, non randomized (open label) with control group

      Ð¡LINICAL PURPOSES Estimation of the efficiency of the method of transfusion of umbilical
      blood hematopoietic cells to patients with diagnosed infantile cerebral palsy depending on
      the degrees of compatibility of donor and recipient.

      RESEARCH PURPOSES

        1. To develop an algorithm of using the method of transfusion of hematopoietic cells of
           umbilical cord blood at complex therapy of patients with children's cerebral palsy.

        2. Formulate criteria for selecting patients for this method.

        3. To analyze the safety and efficacy of umbilical cord blood hematopoietic cells
           transfusion in patients with cerebral palsy using evaluation scales.

        4. To compare the efficacy of treatment of patients depending on the degree of tissue
           compatibility of the donor and recipient and other laboratory indications.

        5. To implement the method of transfusion of umbilical cord blood hematopoietic cells in
           the complex therapy of patients with cerebral palsy.

    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 month after first infusion, 6 month after second infusion (3 times)</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation of the overall dynamics of treatment. GMFCS is a 5 level clinical classification system that describes the gross motor function of people with cerebral palsy on the basis of self-initiated movement abilities. Distinctions between levels are based on functional abilities; the need for walkers, crutches, wheelchairs, or canes/walking sticks; and to a much lesser extent, the actual quality of movement:
Level I: Walks without Limitations Level II: Walks with Limitations Level III: Walks Using a Hand-Held Mobility Device Level IV: Self-Mobility with Limitations; May Use Powered Mobility Level V: Transported in a Manual Wheelchair The Evaluation of the results is carried out by comparing the primary and subsequent indications. Information will be collected from parents.</description>

We reported changes in GMFM between each assessment time point. Categories of outcome table are baseline and values of just subtracting the latter raw scores from the former ones.
