  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the treatment of hamstrings in the management of patients with
      mechanical low back pain of non-specific origin. Half of the participants will received the
      application of a dry needle technique in the most hyperalgesic areas of the muscle, while the
      other half will received the same technique in areas not hyperalgesic.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Shortening of the hamstrings could be related to low back pain.Therefore, the treatment of
      these muscles may improve pain.

      The dry needling technique seems to improve the extensibility of the muscles. This technique
      seems to be more effective when is applied in the most hyperalgesic areas related to the
      participant's pain.

      In order to demonstrate this hypothesis, the investigators will check if the dry needling
      technique produces the same effects when is applied in other areas of those same muscles

    <measure>Low back pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline Pressure Pain Threshold at 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators use a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) to determine the intensity of the patient with blowback pain.The VAS is a 100-mm line, oriented horizontally, with one end representing &quot;no pain&quot; and the other end representing &quot;worst pain.&quot; Subjects will be asked to rate their current pain with a mark on the scale.</description>

    <measure>Disability with Oswestry Disability Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline disability at 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) is a questionnaire used by clinicians and researchers to quantify disability for low back pain.The self-completed questionnaire contains ten topics concerning intensity of pain, lifting, ability to care for oneself, ability to walk, ability to sit, sexual function, ability to stand, social life, sleep quality, and ability to travel.Each topic category is followed by 6 statements describing different potential scenarios in the patient's life relating to the topic. The patient then checks the statement which most closely resembles their situation. Each question is scored on a scale of 0-5 with the first statement being zero and indicating the least amount of disability and the last statement is scored 5 indicating most severe disability. The scores for all questions answered are summed, then multiplied by two to obtain the index (range 0 to 100). Zero is equated with no disability and 100 is the maximum disability possible</description>

    <measure>The extensibility of the hamstring muscle</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline disability at 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The extensibility of the hamstring muscle will be measured by the popliteal or active knee extension (AKE) test, with the patient supine on the stretcher, with the contralateral limb in extension, will placed with the hip at 90 degrees of flexion.
While maintaining this position, the clinician tries to extend the knee. Limitation of knee extension is measured with a goniometer in degrees.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pressure Pain Threshold</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline Pressure Pain Threshold at 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PPT serves to determine the sensitivity of hiperalgesic focus. The investigators will done it with one algometer. A lower threshold is a worse result. A higher threshold is a better result.</description>
