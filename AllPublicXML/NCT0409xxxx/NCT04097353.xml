  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to examine the efficacy of Harvesting Hope for Kids (HH4K), a
      biobehavioral intervention delivered in the context of a university-based, cancer survivor
      garden, to increase produce intake and physical activity in survivors and caregivers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Advances in treatment have led to a rapidly growing population of over 388,500 survivors,
      with 13,500 new survivors expected annually. However, chronic or long-term side effects
      (e.g., secondary malignancies, metabolic syndrome, cardio-pulmonary toxicities) can reduce
      quality of life and lead to premature death. The investigators propose that diet and fitness
      are two critical factors for healthy survivorship given their broad impact on late effects
      like obesity, fatigue, and metabolic syndrome. Despite the promise of comprehensive lifestyle
      interventions for children who are overweight or obese, research with survivors is limited by
      small samples and inconsistent effects. Novel research supports a key role for the
      gastrointestinal (GI) microbiome in regulating weight and health outcomes, yet no studies
      have examined the &quot;obesogenic&quot; microbiome in the context of lifestyle interventions for
      survivors of childhood cancer. The objective of this RCT is to examine the efficacy of
      Harvesting Hope for Kids (HH4K), a biobehavioral intervention delivered in the context of a
      university-based, cancer survivor garden, to increase produce intake and physical activity in
      survivors and caregivers. Families will be randomized to participate in HH4K or enhanced
      usual care. Dietary patterns, physical activity, cardiometabolic indices, family outcomes,
      and GI microbiome will be assessed and the HH4K group will demonstrate greater improved than
      enhanced usual care.

    <description>Eight weekly, 60-minute sessions at a university-based farm with booster sessions. Learning is structured around fun activities to provide information about the impact of cancer treatment on children's health, as well as the importance of nutrition and physical activity in survivorship. Each session is manualized and devoted to education, a behavioral strategy applied toward a weekly goal, a cooking demonstration/taste testing, and harvesting produce from the survivor garden. Modules are offered in a group format with families together.</description>

    <description>Families assigned to enhanced usual care (SS4K) group will receive education in the form of standardized guidelines for nutrition and physical activity for survivors of childhood cancer. In a one-hour session, they will learn about the impact of cancer treatment on health and the importance of nutrition and physical activity for survivors. Families will receive websites for other educational resources. They will not have access to harvesting, remote coaching, the web portal, or behavioral training to address their child's nutrition or activity.</description>
