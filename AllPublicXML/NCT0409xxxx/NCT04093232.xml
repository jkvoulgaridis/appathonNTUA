    <textblock>
      This NJH Investigator Initiated Study funded by Fidia will prospectively perform 2 ultrasound
      (US) guided knee aspirations in patients with knee osteoarthritis using a pneumatic
      compressive device (KneeTap ™) at baseline and at 3 months following 2 Hymovis® injections.
      Synovial fluid catabolic and anabolic proteins will be compared to those values in the
      peripheral blood and correlated with clinical outcome measurements at 3 ,6 and 12 months
      compared to baseline values; WOMAC, SF 36, visual analog pain scale, 6 minute walking
      distance and SF volumes quantitated by US.

      50 Subjects between 21-80 years with a BMI &lt; 40 with mild to moderate knee osteoarthritis on
      x ray (KL grade II or III) will have a ultrasound guided arthrocentesis with an external
      pneumatic compression device (KneeTap) and if &gt; 0.5 ml of synovial fluid is obtained they
      will received the first of 2 FDA approved Hymovis knee injections. A second ultrasound guided
      Hymovis intra-synovial space injection will be administered in one week with a repeat
      arthrocentesis in 3 months. Subjects will be compensated $ 50 for each of 4 of 5 study
      visits. Clinical outcome measures at study visits 1, 3 (3 months) 4 at (6 months) and 5 (12
      months will include: VAS (Visual analog Global pain (1-10), SF -36 ,WOMAC questionnaires
      (Western Ontario and McMaster University Arthritis Index pain Scale), measured distance on 6
      minute walking distance test and synovial fluid depth measured by ultrasound. The Synovial
      fluid biomarker panel will include values of over 45 separate cytokines,.chemokines and
      proteins from subjects pre vs post Hymovis injections and compared to values in the
      peripheral blood obtained simultaneously. SF biomarker analysis will be performed on
      cryopreserved samples using fluorescence multiplex bead based assays (Luminex) or by ELISA.
      All values as well as clinical outcome parameters will be entered into the REDCap system for
      statistical analysis
