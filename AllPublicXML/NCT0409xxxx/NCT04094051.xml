      This is a non-interventional, Phase 4 study designed to improve understanding of current
      clinical practice in the treatment of CLL/SLL and to describe treatment pattern and evaluate
      outcomes of ibrutinib-treated CLL patients in China. This study will include both

    <description>In the retrospective period, clinical information of approximate 500 patients with CLL/SLL prior to the study initiation will be collected retrospectively through chart review. There will be one time follow-up to collect data on disease progression, survival status and patient-reported outcomes.</description>

        Retrospective group: CLL/SLL patients who received CLL/SLL treatment before study
        initiation as judged by participating site physician. A telephone follow-up will be
        arranged at the time of study initiation to determine the disease progression, survival
        status, PRO assessments and ADR. If the patient is accessible, oral consent will be
        obtained and documented in the medical record before the retrospective data collection
        through chart review. If the patient is not accessible at the time of study initiation, ICF
        waiver approved by the IRB will be in place for the etrospective data collection according
        to the latest local regulation. Prospective group: CLL/SLL patients who are on ibrutinib
        treatment at the time of study initiation as judged by participating site physician or
        start ibrutinib treatment after study initiation. This group of patients can be divided
        into two subgroups.
