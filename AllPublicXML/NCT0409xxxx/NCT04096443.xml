  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this pilot study is to determine whether fecal microbial transplant (FMT) has the
      potential to be an effective, safe and tolerable therapy for the treatment of multiple
      sclerosis (MS). The investigators plan to gather preliminary data in a small cohort of 10 to
      15 adults with MS.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The specific aims are to:

        1. Determine the tolerability of a single dose of 30 capsules in a group of adults with MS

        2. Determine whether any unexpected outcomes arise in participants who successfully
           complete an FMT procedure consisting of a single dose of 30 capsules

        3. Determine whether successfully completed FMT leads to engraftment of donor microbiome in
           participants

        4. If the FMT leads to engraftment of donor microbiome in participants, determine whether
           participants revert back to previous microbiome profiles, and if so, at what time point

        5. Determine whether engrafted species following the FMT, if detected, result in any
           changes in immune or metabolomic parameters relative to baseline

        6. Determine whether the FMT has any adverse impact, relative to baseline, on study
           participants' self-reported levels of fatigue, mental well-being, and health-related
           qualify of life

        7. Determine whether the FMT has any adverse impact, relative to baseline, on study
           participants' neurological status, relative to baseline

      The study population will consist of adults with clinically definite MS who are currently
      untreated with any disease-modifying therapy or are being treated with glatiramer acetate or
      interferon beta. The research team will offer study participants a single FMT procedure in
      the form of 30 oral capsules which contain fecal material. Study participants will visit
      Griffin Hospital facilities 8 times. The first visit will involve a clinical screening. Of
      the 7 remaining visits, 6 will involve data collection and one will involve the FMT
      procedure.

    <description>Phenotyping will be performed: for T cells - TCRβ, TCRγ, CD4, CD8, CD25, CD44, CD62L, CD69, PD1, CTLA4; for B cells - B220, CD19, CD21, CD23, CD1d, CD5, IgA, IgG1, IgG2a(c), IgG2b; for DCs - CD11c, CD11b, BDCA1, CD8, CD103, CD205 and CD86.

    <measure>Change in neurological status using Kurtzke Functional Systems Scale (FSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-FMT and 4 time points post-FMT (3-7 days, 10-15 days, 40-45 days, 100-110 days)</time_frame>
    <description>The FSS uses a set of single-item ordinal clinical rating scales to rate levels of function in seven domains (pyramidal, cerebellar, brainstem, sensory, bowel and bladder, visual, and cerebral/mental). Each single item scale ranges from 0 to 5 or 6 (0 = &quot;normal;&quot; 5 or 6 represents the worst level of function; and 9 = &quot;unknown&quot;). For each single item scale, scores representing the highest level of function are as follows: pyramidal: 6 = &quot;quadriplegia&quot;; cerebellar: 5 = &quot;unable to perform coordinated movements due to ataxia&quot;; brainstem: 5 = &quot;inability to swallow or speak&quot;; sensory: 6 = &quot;sensation essentially lost below the head&quot;; bowel and bladder: 6 = loss of bowel and bladder function&quot;; visual: 6 = &quot;grade 5 plus maximal visual acuity of better eye of 20/60 or less&quot;; cerebral/mental: 5 = &quot;dementia or chronic brain syndrome - severe or incompetent.&quot; The ratings are used in conjunction with observations and information concerning gait and use of assistive devices to rate the EDSS.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in neurological status using Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-FMT and 4 time points post-FMT (3-7 days, 10-15 days, 40-45 days, 100-110 days)</time_frame>
    <description>The EDSS is an ordinal clinical rating scale ranging from 0 (normal neurological examination) to 10 (death due to MS) in half-point increments.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in self-reported health-related quality of life assessed using the Health Status Questionnaire Short-Form 36 (SF-36)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-FMT and 3 time points post-FMT (10-15 days, 40-45 days, 100-110 days)</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-35 has 36 questions. It has a single item covering change in health status over the last year and 8 multi-item scales. The scoring system is relatively complex and generates 8 subscales and 2 summary scores. The 8 subscales are: physical functioning, role limitations due to physical problems, bodily pain, general health perceptions, vitality, social functioning, role-limitations due to emotional problems, and mental health. Two summary scales (Physical and Mental) have been derived using factor analytic methods. Scales are set up so that a higher score indicates better health. To achieve this, responses on 10 items are recoded before being added to other items on the same scale. Raw scale scores are then transformed to a 0-100 scale.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in self-reported mental health status assessed using Mental Health Inventory (MHI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-FMT and 3 time points post-FMT (10-15 days, 40-45 days, 100-110 days)</time_frame>
    <description>The MHI consists of 18 items and assesses several domains of mental health. The scoring system generates 4 subscale scores (Anxiety, Depression, Behavioral Control, and Positive Affect) and 1 total score. The subscale and total scores range from 0-100, with higher scores indicating better mental health.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in self-reported levels of fatigue assessed using Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-FMT and 3 time points post-FMT (10-15 days, 40-45 days, 100-110 days)</time_frame>
    <description>The MFIS provides an assessment of the effects of fatigue on physical, cognitive, and psychosocial function. It consists of 21 items. The items be aggregated into 3 subscales (Physical, Cognitive, and Psychosocial), as well as into a total MFIS score. All items are scaled so that higher scores indicate a greater impact of fatigue on a patient's activities. The physical subscale can range from 0-36. The cognitive subscale can range from 0-40. The psychosocialsub scale can range from 0-8. The Total MFIS score can range from 0-84.</description>

    <time_frame>Day of FMT procedure and 5 time points post-FMT (1 day, 3-7 days, 10-15 days, 40-45 days, 100-110 days), or any time the study team is contacted by subjects who report adverse side effects</time_frame>
