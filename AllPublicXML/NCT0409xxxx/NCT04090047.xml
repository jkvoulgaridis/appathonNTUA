             evaluation including a detailed medical history, full physical examination, which
             includes blood pressure (BP) and pulse rate measurement, clinical laboratory tests,
             and 12-lead ECG.

          -  Body mass index (BMI) of 17.5 to 30.5 kg/m2; and a total body weight &gt;50 kg (110 lb).

             seasonal allergies at the time of dosing).

          -  Evidence or history of clinically significant dermatological condition (eg, contact
             dermatitis or psoriasis) or visible rash present during physical examination.

          -  Participant with a history of known hypersensitivity to itraconazole or its excipients
             or to other azole antifungals.

          -  Screening supine BP ≥140 mm Hg (systolic) or ≥90 mm Hg (diastolic), following at least
             5 minutes of supine rest. If BP is ≥140 mm Hg (systolic) or ≥90 mm Hg (diastolic), the
             BP should be repeated 2 more times and the average of the 3 BP values should be used
             to determine the participant's eligibility.

          -  Baseline 12-lead ECG that demonstrates clinically relevant abnormalities that may
             affect participant safety or interpretation of study results (eg, baseline QTc
             interval &gt;450 msec, complete left bundle branch block [LBBB], signs of an acute or
             indeterminate-age myocardial infarction, ST-T interval changes suggestive of
             myocardial ischemia, second- or third-degree atrioventricular [AV] block, or serious
             bradyarrhythmias or tachyarrhythmias).

          -  Participants with abnormalities in clinical laboratory tests at screening, as assessed
             by the study-specific laboratory

          -  History of alcohol abuse or binge drinking and/or any other illicit drug use or
             dependence within 6 months of Screening.

          -  Blood donation (excluding plasma donations) of approximately 1 pint (500 mL) or more

          -  Female participants of childbearing potential who are unwilling or unable to use a
             highly effective method of contraception for the duration of the study and for at
             least 60 days after the last dose of itraconazole.

          -  Female nursing participants will be excluded.
