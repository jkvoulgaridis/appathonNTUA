      This study is a 6-week micro-randomized trial investigating the feasibility of a mobile
      health platform. Its long-term objective is to develop a mobile health platform for the
      translation of a psychosocial intervention for bipolar disorder (BP) into an effective and
      evidence-based adaptive intervention. In this aim of the study, investigators will evaluate
      how individuals with BP respond to a microintervention based in acceptance and commitment
      therapy (ACT) that is delivered with a mobile app.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bipolar (BP) disorder is a chronic illness of profound shifts in mood ranging from mania to
      depression. BP is successfully treated by combining medication with psychosocial therapy, but
      care can prove inadequate in practice. With gaps in coverage and medication, along with
      imprecise guidelines on when, where, and how to intervene, promising psychosocial therapies
      require adaptive strategies to better address the specific needs of individuals in a timely
      manner. However, To accomplish this, evidence based practices are needed. This project aims
      to address this knowledge gap by establishing a mobile health platform for translating a
      psychosocial therapy in BP into an effective adaptive intervention.

      The research to be conducted under this protocol falls under the general heading of a
      micro-randomized trial. It investigates feasibility of a study on how to tailor an
      intervention based on acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) when delivered via a smartphone
      app. Long-term objective of this study is to develop a mobile health platform for the
      translation of a psychosocial intervention for bipolar disorder (BP) into an effective
      adaptive intervention. In this particular part of the study, the investigator will assess the
      feasibility of a mobile health and wearable device platform for the translation of a BP
      psychosocial therapy into an evidenced-based adaptive intervention. To answer this question,
      investigator will study how individuals with BP respond to a microintervention delivered via
      a mobile app. Primary outcome of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of a
      micro-randomized trial in ACT in terms of completion of assessments (interview and
      self-report), wearing of Fitbit, and completion of microintervention questions. Secondary
      outcome of the study is to detect a linear effect in time of the microintervention on symptom
      levels of mania and depression in individuals with bipolar disorder. The estimated linear
      effect would be used to power a larger study.Enrollment is by invitation only; participants
      in the study will be recruited from the Prechter Longitudinal Study of Bipolar Disorder
      (HUM606).

    <intervention_model_description>This study uses a design known as a microrandomized trial. Whereas a multi-arm trial randomizes a subject to an intervention group only once at the start of the study, a microrandomized trial repeatedly randomizes a subject to an intervention group throughout the study. In addition to an overall effect of an intervention on proximal outcomes, a microrandomized trial allows one to determine if the effect is modified by momentary factors (e.g., current mood, day of the week, day in the study).
For the present study, every subject has a equal chance of being assigned to one of two intervention groups at each of 84 time points (2 daily x 42 days). At each time point, the two intervention groups are to either receive a prompt based on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) or not receive such a prompt. Regardless of the assigned group, subjects are asked to assess their mood, stress, and activity at every time point prior to assignment to intervention group.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Feasibility of microintervention: average completion of shortened YMRS</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 1-43</time_frame>
    <description>Feasibility of the microintervention will be evaluated by measuring the average completion of the shortened Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) that will be delivered to participants through the mobile app.
The Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) is a 11-item interview-based measure of manic symptoms. Scores on 3 items range from 0 to 8, whereas scores on the remaining 8 items range from 0 to 4. The total score of the YMRS can range from 0 to 56, with higher scores indicating more severe manic symptoms.
The shortened scale used for the app includes three items (tracking the symptoms increased energy, rapid speech, and irritability) from the YMRS. The symptoms are scored on the following 0-3 scale:
0 = absent/normal
= mild
= moderate
= severe</description>

    <description>Feasibility of the microintervention will be evaluated using the average completion of the shortened Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (SIGH-D) that will be delivered to participants through the mobile app.
The SIGH-D is a 17-item clinician-rated scale that assesses the severity of depressive symptoms. The total score is obtained by summing the score of each item, 0-4 (symptom is absent, mild, moderate, or severe) or 0-2 (absent, slight or trivial, clearly present). Scores can range from 0 to 54, with higher scores indicating more severe depression.
The shortened SIGH-D assessment contains three items that track symptoms of depressed mood, fidgeting, and fatigue. The symptoms are scored on the following 0-3 scale:
0 = absent/normal
= mild
= moderate
= severe</description>

    <measure>Proximal changes in mood outcomes as a result of intervention: activity questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 1-43</time_frame>
    <description>The effectiveness of the ACT micro-intervention will be assessed by looking at responses to the activity questionnaire in relation to whether or not a participant received a micro-intervention at the prior time-point. The activity questions of interest are as follows:
Since you [woke this morning or last logged your symptoms], how much energy was consumed by trying to get rid of unwanted feelings, thoughts, or other internal experiences (example: suppressing, distracting, avoiding)?
Since you [woke this morning or last logged your symptoms], how much energy was consumed by pursuing your values (example: making choices that align with who you want to be or who/what matters)?
Both questions are answered using a scale of 0-6, where 0 = &quot;none&quot; and 6 = &quot;all of my energy.&quot;</description>

    <description>At every time-point of the study, participants will complete self-reports of mania (as measured by the shortened YMRS), depression (as measured by the shortened SIGH-D ), medication adherence, and activity through the mobile app Lorevimo. After completing these assessments, participants will be randomly assigned to either receive one additional ACT-based microintervention question or receive no additional question.
The microintervention will consist of one of 84 prompts that aim to target one of 6 processes targeted in ACT (contacting the present moment, defusion, acceptance, self-as-context, values, and committed action).
The ACT-based questions were developed by the research team as a unique intervention for the current study. They are based upon core themes of acceptance and commitment therapy: engagement, awareness, and openness.</description>

    <description>The mobile intervention in this study consists of two components: 1) self-monitoring and 2) an ACT-based microintervention.
Self-monitoring: twice daily, participants will complete self-reports of mania, depression, medication adherence, and activity through the mobile app Lorevimo.
Microintervention: The microintervention will consist of one of 84 prompts that aim to target one of 6 processes targeted in ACT (contacting the present moment, defusion, acceptance, self-as-context, values, and committed action). At each time-point, participants have a 50% chance of receiving a microintervention question along with the daily self-monitoring assessments.</description>
