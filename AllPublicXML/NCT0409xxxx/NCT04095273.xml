  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to test how well patients with advanced solid tumors respond to
      treatment with BAY1895344 in combination with pembrolizumab. In addition researchers want to
      find for patients the optimal dose of BAY1895344 in combination with pembrolizumab, how the
      drug is tolerated and the way the body absorbs, distributes and discharges the drug. The
      study medication, BAY1895344, works by blocking a substance (ATR Kinase) which is produced by
      the body and is important for the growth of tumor cells. Pembrolizumab is an immunologic
      checkpoint blocker that promotes an immune response against the tumor.
