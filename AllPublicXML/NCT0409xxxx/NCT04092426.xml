  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Keratoconus is a degenerative disease entity characterized by conical shape ectasia of the
      cornea. progressive conical deformation of the cornea leads to substantial astigmatism.
      Patients who are at an advanced stage of ectasia are often led to corneal transplant or other
      treatments, which essentially aim at correcting the refractive error and not in treating the
      ectasia. The top of the protruding cone that corneal configuration may be close to the visual
      axis or below and nasal of that. The disease manifests during adolescence, followed by slow
      progressive course, although it is possible to stabilize anytime. In 85% of cases both eyes
      are affected, but the severity of the attack can present significant asymmetry.

      Often in keratoconus a positive family history is present. Prevelance of keratoconus varies
      greatly worldwide.The reported prevalence of keratoconus varies widely depending upon the
      geographic location, diagnostic criteria used, and the cohort of patients selected.
      Environmental factors may contribute to the wide variation in prevalence.

      the Middle East have higher prevalence than locations with cooler climates and less sunshine
