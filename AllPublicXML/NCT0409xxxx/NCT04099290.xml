  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is a blood-based test that measures dying or dead cancer cells
      that are already circulating in the blood. In this study, the investigators will enroll
      patients who are planning to receive surgery to remove their head and neck cancer. The
      investigators are interested to learn how ctDNA levels change with surgery and over the
      course of time. The investigators also want to determine if there are certain features of the
      tumor or the patient themselves that might cause ctDNA to be higher than other patients.
      Also, the investigators want to explore if the detection of ctDNA following surgery is
      related to cancer recurrence.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will take a piece of the tumor from the surgery and determine if they can
      identify mutations, or changes in the genetic makeup of the cells due to cancer, that are
      specific to the tumor. Based on this information, the investigators will design a test using
      PCR, which is a technology that allows for the amplification of the DNA, that is specific to
      the mutation identified in the tumor. Once verified, the presence (or absence) of ctDNA in
      the blood can be measured. The investigators will measure this blood test prior to surgery
      and at multiple time points following surgery. Specimens will be collected at the time of
      planned clinical assessments.
