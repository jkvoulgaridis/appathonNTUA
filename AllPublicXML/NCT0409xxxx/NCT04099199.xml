    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter study with a minimum of three CLIA-Waived intended operator sites in
      which prospectively collected vaginal swab specimens will be evaluated with the Click Sexual
      Health Test as compared to standard of care. The specimen collection will occur over one
      study visit for each enrolled subject, but study staff will continue to follow the subject
      through standard of care until the subject receives treatment or she is lost to follow up.
