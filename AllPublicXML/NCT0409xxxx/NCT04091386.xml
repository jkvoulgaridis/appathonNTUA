  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study researcher want to learn more about the change of physical activity of
      hemophilia A patients treated with damoctocog alfa pegol. Patients enrolled in this study
      will be wearing a small device measuring daily activity including sleep time. Researcher will
      compare these physical activity data with patient's clinical data including bleeding events
      to gain information on how bleeding levels are related to the activity level of the patients.

      The study aims to enroll about 80 patients who are at the same time also participating in the
      HEM-POWR study (NCT03932201) evaluating the effectiveness and safety of damoctocog alfa
      pegol.

      The primary objective is to evaluate the change in physical activity as measured by the
      ActiGraph CentrePoint Insight Watch (ActiGraph LLC, Pensacola, Florida) after 1, 2 and 3
      years of treatment with damoctocog alfa pegol.

      Secondary objectives are to determine the

        -  Change in combined moderate to vigorous physical activity,

        -  Association between physical acitivities and clinical outcomes / patient-reported
           outcome scores/ number of bleeds,

        -  Percentage of patients achieving WHO-recommended levels of activity

        -  Category of physical activity

        -  Sleeping/ awake time

        -  Actual wear time.

    <ipd_description>Availability of this study's data will be determined according to Bayer's commitment to the EFPIA/PhRMA &quot;Principles for responsible clinical trial data sharing&quot;. This pertains to scope, timepoint and process of data access. As such, Bayer commits to sharing upon request from qualified researchers patient-level clinical trial data, study-level clinical trial data, and protocols from clinical trials in patients for medicines and indications approved in the US and EU as necessary for conducting legitimate research. This applies to data on new medicines and indications that have been approved by the EU and US regulatory agencies on or after January 01, 2014. Interested researchers can use www.clinicalstudydatarequest.com to request access to anonymized patient-level data and supporting documents from clinical studies to conduct research.
