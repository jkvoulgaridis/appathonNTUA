  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS) experience in impairments in mobility and cognition
      that increase the risk for accidental falls. More than 50% of individuals with MS experience
      injurious falls within a 6-month period. Current interventions to improve fall risk have
      focused on forward walking (FW) and balance training, resulting in small declines in the
      relative risk for falls with a large degree of variability. Interestingly, motor differences
      between MS and healthy controls are more pronounced in backward walking (BW), yet no studies
      have investigated BW training as an intervention to reduce fall risk in persons with MS.
      Further, the underlying pathological and cognitive factors that impact BW performance and its
      potential to impact fall risk in persons with MS remain unknown. This study will investigate
      the feasibility, acceptability and impact of BW training compared to forward walking training
      on motor function, brain structure, and fall risk in persons with MS.

    <description>Training will consist of BW training on both a treadmill and overground. All participants will receive 1x/week training with a trained member of the research team, who will progress the participant week-to-week and ensure safety. Treadmill speed will be determined by baseline BW walking speed and incrementally increased with each training week to subject tolerance. Participants will follow a home exercise program for the remainder of the week that includes BW, backward stepping, and functional exercises that incorporate BW movements.</description>
