  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1 pilot study of CSL200 in adult subjects with severe sickle cell disease.
      The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety of the following: collection
      of CD34+ hematopoietic stem / progenitor cells by apheresis after mobilization with
      plerixafor, reduced intensity conditioning with melphalan, and administration of CSL200.

    <description>Adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.
Serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, or is medically significant.
Adverse event of special interest (AESI) is defined in this study as any of the following: acute immune reactions, autoimmunity to CSL200; malignancy; predominant integration site in presence of malignancy or other abnormality.</description>

    <ipd_description>CSL will consider requests to share Individual Patient Data (IPD) from systematic review groups or bona-fide researchers. For information on the process and requirements for submitting a voluntary data sharing request for IPD, please contact CSL at clinicaltrials@cslbehring.com.
Applicable country specific privacy and other laws and regulations will be considered and may prevent sharing of IPD.
If the request is approved and the researcher has executed an appropriate data sharing agreement, IPD that has been appropriately anonymized will be available.</ipd_description>
