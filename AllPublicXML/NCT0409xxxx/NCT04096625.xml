  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS), is a neuromodulatory technique, that is safe,
      well-tolerated, easy to administer and fairly inexpensive. Results from tDCS trials involving
      participants with several neuropsychiatric disorders, including major depression, bipolar
      disorder, schizophrenia and substance use disorder are encouraging. The clinical effects of
      tDCS are broad; the underlying condition, the areas stimulated together with the type and
      duration of stimulation are important factors. In patients with neuropsychiatric conditions,
      a reduction of symptoms, an enhancement of neurocognitive functions together with an overall
      improvement in functionality and wellbeing have been consistently reported. These effects
      emerge during the stimulation period, in the weeks after stimulation, the effects seem to
      peak and consolidate further. tDCS appears to enhance the effects of other interventions as
      well; however, to date, there have been no studies into the effects of using tDCS as an
      add-on intervention to psychotherapy on symptoms and wellbeing
