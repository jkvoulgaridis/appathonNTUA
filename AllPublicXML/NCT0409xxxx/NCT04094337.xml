  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to test Implementation of Internet-Assisted Treatment for Non-Cardiac Chest
      Pain at the Cardiac Department at Sørlandet Hospital. The internet-assisted treatment will be
      delivered by personnel working at the department. Effectiveness will be tested in an
      randomized controlled trial (RCT). The intervention has been tested in an RCT where the
      intervention was delivered by a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) specialist who also
      participated in developing the intervention. Presently the investigators will test if
      personnel working at the department, with minimal training in CBT, can deliver the
      intervention effectively.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most patients with chest pain referred to hospital do not have a cardiac illness. Non-cardiac
      chest pain (NCCP) is often followed by persistent distress and reduced quality of life, and
      societal costs are nearly equal to those of cardiac patients. Research suggests that
      face-to-face CBT is effective, but this has not been implemented as standard treatment. The
      investigators plan to test an easily implementable internet-assisted treatment for NCCP
      patients delivered by personnel already working at the department.

      Patients will be recruited at the chest pain unit at Sørlandet Hospital, Kristiansand, and
      will be recruited after they have finished their cardiac examination.

      The intervention group will receive six web-based sessions, comprising information, exposure
      to physical activity, how worry can excess pain, physical reactions to pain and worry,
      consequences of avoidance, and specific panic treatment.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Body Sensations Questionnaire (BSQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>58 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>BSQ is an 17-item self-report-questionnaire which measures fear of different bodily sensations. Each item is rated on a five-point Likert scale ranging from 1 to 5. Total range 17-85 where higher score represents more symptoms. Primary outcome is difference in mean score between intervention arm and control arm for BSQ at end of treatment (6 weeks after randomization for both arms). Difference in mean scores between arms will also be assessed at pretreatment/baseline, and at 3 months and 12 months after end of treatment (18 weeks and 58 weeks after randomization). There is no predefined clinical relevant effect for this measure. The investigators will use a distribution based method. Clinical relevant effect is defined as improvement of more than 0.5 standard deviation compared to baseline.</description>

    <measure>Change in Cardiac Anxiety Questionnaire (CAQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>58 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>CAQ is an 18-item self-report-questionnaire which measures hearth related anxiety/fear, attention, avoidance and safety seeking behavior. Each item is rated on a five-point Likert scale ranging from 0 to 4. Total range 0-72 where higher score represents more symptoms. Primary outcome is difference in mean score between intervention arm and control arm for CAQ at end of treatment (6 weeks after randomization for both arms). Difference in mean scores between arms will also be assessed at pretreatment/baseline, and at 3 months and 12 months after end of treatment (18 weeks and 58 weeks after randomization). There is no predefined clinical relevant effect for this measure. The investigators will use a distribution based method. Clinical relevant effect is defined as improvement of more than 0.5 standard deviation compared to baseline.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire (BIPQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>58 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>BIPQ is an 8-item self-report-questionnaire which assess the patient's perception/beliefs about their symptoms. Each item is rated on a 0-10 scale. The items represent different components/dimensions. Secondary outcome is difference in mean score between intervention arm and control arm for item 1, 5, 6 and 8 at end of treatment (6 weeks after randomization for both arms). Difference in mean scores between arms will also be assessed for item 1, 5, 6 and 8 at pretreatment/baseline, and at 3 months and 12 months after end of treatment (18 weeks and 58 weeks after randomization). There is no predefined clinical relevant effect for this measure. The investigators will use a distribution based method. Clinical relevant effect is defined as improvement of more than 0.5 standard deviation compared to baseline.</description>

    <measure>Change in Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)</measure>
    <time_frame>58 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>PHQ-9 is an 9 item self-report-questionnaire which assess depression symptoms. Each item is rated on a 0-3 scale. Total range 0-27 where higher score represents more symptoms. Secondary outcome is difference in mean score between intervention arm and control arm for PHQ-9 at end of treatment (6 weeks after randomization for both arms). Difference in mean scores between arms will also be assessed at pretreatment/baseline, and at 3 months and 12 months after end of treatment (18 weeks and 58 weeks after randomization).</description>

    <measure>Change in EQ-5D-5L</measure>
    <time_frame>58 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>EQ-5D-5L is an 5 item (plus a visual analog scale) self-report-questionnaire assessing health related quality of life. Secondary outcome is difference in mean score between intervention arm and control arm for EQ-5D-5L at end of treatment (6 weeks after randomization for both arms). Difference in mean scores between arms will also be assessed at pretreatment/baseline, and at 3 months and 12 months after end of treatment (18 weeks and 58 weeks after randomization). Distribution based methods are commonly used, defining improvement of 0.2 or 0.5 standard deviation as clinical relevant. The investigators define a minimal clinical relevant improvement to be 0.2 standard deviation in EQ-5D-5L.</description>
