    <textblock>
      Prospective Phase 1 clinical trial providing proof of concept data on boiled peanut oral
      immunotherapy (OIT) for the treatment of peanut allergy in children. The investigators
      hypothesize that the proportion of subjects successfully desensitized with boiled peanut OIT
      is greater than the theoretical placebo rate of 20%.

    <textblock>
      Oral Immunotherapy will be administered utilizing a powder derived from boiled peanuts.
      Treatment will begin with an initial escalation day in which dosing is begun at 0.1 mg peanut
      protein and escalated to a final dose of 6 mg peanut protein. Doses are ingested orally.
      Participants will continue daily oral ingestion of doses at home and return for updosing
      every 2 weeks to a final maintenance dose of 300 mg peanut protein. Participants will
      continue daily oral ingestion of the peanut product for a minimum duration of 28 days before
      undergoing exit double blind placebo controlled food challenge. At the conclusion of the
      study, participants will be offered continued maintenance therapy off study in line with
      current specialty standards.

    <description>The investigator will compare the proportion of patients successfully desensitized as defined by meeting the primary endpoint with the expected placebo rate. The null hypothesis is that the proportion of patients successfully desensitized by boiled peanut oral immunotherapy will not be greater than the expected 20% that has been previously published as the proportion of patients successfully meeting the primary endpoint in OIT studies (which aligns with the expected 20% that would naturally &quot;outgrow&quot; a peanut allergy). If the null hypothesis is rejected, it can be concluded that the proportion of patients successfully desensitized by boiled peanut therapy is greater than placebo.</description>
