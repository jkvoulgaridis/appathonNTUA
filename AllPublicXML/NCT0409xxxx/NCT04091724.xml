  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Emergence delirium is a significant problem, particularly in children. However the incidence,
      preventative strategies, and management of emergence delirium remain unclear. Multichannel
      electroencephalogram is a recognized tool for identifying neurophysiologic states during
      anesthesia, sleep, and arousal. The aim of the current study is to evaluate the mechanisms
      and predictors of emergence delirium in children under 16 years scheduled for elective
      surgery using electroencephalogram. The &quot;Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium Scores (PAED
      Score)&quot; (Sikich et al. 2004) is used to screen for the occurrence of emergence delirium in
      the post anesthesia care unit.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of emergence delirium</measure>
    <time_frame>Recovery from anesthetic until discharge of the child from the Post-Anesthesia Care Unit, an average of 1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>The Delirium is measured by the Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium Scores (PAED Score) (Sikich et al. 2004).The PAED scale is a validated observational measure of 5 aspects of child behavior (caregiver eye contact, purposeful movement, evidence of awareness of surroundings, restlessness, and inconsolability). Ratings are summed to produce a total score ranging from 0 to 20; greater scores indicate greater severity. A peak PAED value ≥ 10 is considered emergence delirium.</description>

    <measure>Relative power of each brain waves</measure>
    <time_frame>from stay at the preoperative holding room to discharge of the child from the Post-Anesthesia Care Unit, , an average of 3 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Electroencephalogram data were acquired using a 32-channel electroencephalogram recording system (Brain Products, Germany). A 5 min, baseline, eyes-closed recording was conducted at the preoperative holding room when the child was at rest. Recording of electroencephalogram was commenced before the start of anesthetic induction and was stopped before discharge of the child from the Post-Anesthesia Care Unit. We defied delta (1 to 3 Hz), theta (4 to 7 Hz), alpha (8 to 12 Hz), and beta (13 to 40 Hz) frequency bands. And then, the relative power of each frequency bands to the total power of the sum is calculated.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Preoperative anxiety of children</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline (At the preoperative holding room)</time_frame>
    <description>Preoperative anxiety is evaluated using the preoperative modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale (m-YPAS) score (Kain et al. 1997). The modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale (m-YPAS) consists of 5 items (activity, vocalizations, emotional expressivity, state of apparent arousal, and use of parent). Children's behavior is rated from 1 to 4 or 1 to 6 (depending on the item), with higher numbers indicating the highest severity within that item. Each score is calculated by dividing each item rating by the highest possible rating (i.e., 6 for the &quot;vocalizations&quot; item and 4 for all other items), adding all the produced values, dividing by 5, and multiplying by 100. This calculation produces a score ranging from 23.33 to 100, with higher values indicating higher anxiety.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The level of consciousness</measure>
    <time_frame>Recovery from anesthetic until discharge of the child from the Post-Anesthesia Care Unit, an average of 1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>The level of consciousness is measured by Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale score (Kerson et al. 2016). The Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale (RASS) is a 10-point scale, with four levels of anxiety or agitation, one level denoting a calm and alert state, and 5 levels of sedation.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Postoperative pain: FLACC- Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Recovery from anesthetic until discharge of the child from the Post-Anesthesia Care Unit, an average of 1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>Postoperative pain is measured by the FLACC- Scale (Merkel et al. 1997). The Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability (FLACC ) scale is a measurement used to assess pain for children or individuals that are unable to communicate their pain. The scale is scored in a range of 0-10 with 0 representing no pain. The scale has five criteria, which are each assigned a score of 0, 1 or 2.</description>
