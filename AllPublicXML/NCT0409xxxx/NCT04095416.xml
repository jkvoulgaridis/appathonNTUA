  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There will be two populations in this study: control group, and intervention group. These
      groups will undergo propensity matching to account for confounders and minimize selection
      bias. 120 patients will be enrolled, 60 to each population. The objective of this study is:
      assess the utility of lower extremity compression wraps as adjuvant therapy in inpatient
      management of acute systolic heart failure

      The control group will consist of patients admitted to I5 Cardiology for management of acute
      systolic heart failure with intravenous diuresis and standard medical therapy, meeting
      inclusion criteria. Information will be gathered through observational prospective data
      analysis from Epic EMR, and will include daily diuretic type and dose required, daily urine
      output, daily creatinine, total days of admission, daily and pre-discharge weight, admission
      BNP, and pre-discharge BNP.

      The intervention group will consist of patients admitted to I5 Cardiology meeting inclusion
      criteria and being managed with standard medical therapy. This group will receive additional
      therapy using bilateral lower extremity compression wraps applied by nursing staff per
      pre-set protocol, and will receive education on the use of compression wraps. Patients will
      be instructed to wear the compression wraps for the entirety of the time they are undergoing
      intravenous diuresis, with pauses in care as needed for hygiene and symptom relief purposes.
      During the time of compression wrap application, the following data will be collected: urine
      output, daily weights, daily creatinine, daily and total dose and type of intravenous
      diuretic used. Prior to discharge, a BNP will be obtained.

      Endpoints (including percentage of weight reduction, total urine output achieved with
      diuresis, total dose requirement and type of intravenous diuresis, total days of intravenous
      diuresis, days to discharge, discharge BNP, and percent reduction from admission BNP) will
      then be compared to assess the utility of adding lower extremity compression wraps to
      inpatient management of acute systolic heart failure.

      There will be two populations in this study: control group, and intervention group. 120
      patients will be enrolled, 60 to group, randomized in 1:1 fashion. The control group will
      consist of patients admitted to I5 Cardiology for management of acute systolic heart failure
      with intravenous diuresis and standard medical therapy, meeting inclusion criteria.
      Information will be gathered through observational prospective data analysis from Epic EMR,
      and will include daily diuretic type and dose required, daily urine output, daily creatinine,
      total days of admission, daily and pre-discharge weight, admission BNP, and pre-discharge
      BNP. The intervention group will consist of patients admitted to I5 Cardiology meeting
      inclusion criteria and being managed with standard medical therapy. This group will receive
      additional therapy using bilateral lower extremity compression wraps applied by nursing staff

      intravenous diuretic used. Prior to discharge, a BNP will be obtained. Endpoints (including
      percentage of weight reduction, total urine output achieved with diuresis, total dose
      requirement and type of intravenous diuresis, total days of intravenous diuresis, days to
      discharge, discharge BNP, and percent reduction from admission BNP) will then be compared to
      assess the utility of adding lower extremity compression wraps to inpatient management of
      acute systolic heart failure.
