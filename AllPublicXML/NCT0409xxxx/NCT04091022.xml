  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single institution, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind phase IIB trial of
      1) topical diclofenac and topical DFMO, or 2) placebo in participants with a history of non
      melanoma skin cancer/ keratinocytic cancers.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There will be two groups to the study. Individuals, aged 18 years or older, who have
      extensive actinic damage, at least 8 AKs and a history of at least one non-melanoma skin
      cancer, but are in otherwise general good health, will be given topical diclofenac and
      topical DFMO. They will be compared to individuals, aged 18 years or older, who have
      extensive actinic damage, but are in otherwise general good health, will be given placebo.
      All participants must be at increased risk of non-melanoma skin cancer as evidenced by a
      history of prior squamous or basal cell skin cancer, ongoing or history of actinic keratoses,
      and the presence, at baseline, of at least eight actinic keratoses on the face, neck, scalp
      and arms. Subjects will be randomized to:

        1. topical diclofenac twice daily and topical DFMO daily

        2. placebo for the topical diclofenac BID and placebo for the topical DFMO daily

All study drug will be blinded except to the pharmacists. Records will be kept to document receipt, distribution and disposition of the drugs.
