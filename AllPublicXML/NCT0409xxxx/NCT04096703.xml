  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study compares two treatments for Idiopathic Esophagogastric Junction Outflow
      Obstruction: pneumatic dilation compared with expectant management, on symptoms and liquid
      barium emptying exams.

    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to address these gaps in knowledge by:

      Performing a randomized controlled trial in patients with idiopathic EGJOO that compares
      treatment outcomes after pneumatic dilation versus expectant management (disease controls)
      (expectant management). And, determining rational physiological and objective measures of
      treatment response.

    <description>The Eckardt score is the grading system most frequently used for the evaluation of symptoms and efficacy of achalasia treatment. 33 It attributes points (0-3 points) to 4 symptoms of the disease (dysphagia, regurgitation, chest pain, and weight loss), and its total ranges from 0-12. The higher the score the worse the symptoms.</description>
