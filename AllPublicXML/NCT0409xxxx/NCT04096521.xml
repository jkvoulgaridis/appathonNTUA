    <textblock>
      This study is part of the East Jakarta Cohort Study to assess the current micronutrient
      status of the mothers and their children. The study also includes the assessment of
      genotyping of MTHFR 677C--&gt;T of the mother and DNA methylation of IGF2 gene of the children.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The initial study recruited 315 mothers in the public health centre and one district hospital
      in East Jakarta. The follow-up study is able to re-visit the 127 of them. This also includes
      127 peers of the subject that lives in the same neighbourhood. The design of the study is
      case-cohort design, part study of the existing cohort. The assessment of the follow-up study
      includes the mother and the children born in the initial study. Anthropometric measurement,
      socioeconomic data from a structured questionnaire, biomarker assessment, blood pressure were
      obtained from the subjects.

        In 2014, the pregnant mothers in 10 public health centre and one sub-district hospital in
        East Jakarta were recruited in the study. They were in the third trimester gestation
        period, receive iron-folic acid supplementation and ANC. In 2018, the repeated collection
        was conducted to collect follow-up data. We also include peer of the subjects that lived in
        the same neighbourhood since the first cohort study and have children in the same age with
        cohort participant
