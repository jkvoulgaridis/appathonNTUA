  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This cluster-randomized trial will compare changes in attitudes and knowledge on
      administering naloxone based on exposure to either a virtual reality educational training or
      the current standard educational trainings (e.g. on-line videos, printed information
      handouts) offered at local libraries. Individuals attending local library's naloxone training
      days will voluntarily complete an anonymous validated survey pre and post attending either
      the virtual reality or standard educational training.

      This study will utilize a cluster-randomized trial design. Entire libraries will be
      randomized to either offer community members the virtual reality training or the standard
      educational offerings (e.g. handouts, online videos). Volunteers will be asked to complete
      the brief, anonymous, and validated Opioid Overdose Knowledge Scale prior to receiving an
      education intervention (pretest) and then again immediately after (posttest). Neither
      participants nor investigators will be blinded. Library patrons who do not participate in the
      study will be offered current standard training materials. Regardless of the library's
      randomization, to either virtual reality or standard training, all patrons completing pre and
      post test surveys will have the opportunity to view the virtual reality training or other
      public health department materials.

    <measure>Change in Opioid Overdose Knowledge Scale (OOKS) From Pre- to Post-training</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately Pre-Training and Within 1 Hour Post-training</time_frame>
    <description>Higher scores on the OOKS indicate greater knowledge on how to identify and appropriately intervene during an opioid related overdose, including proper use of naloxone. The tool has been validated with healthcare professionals and lay persons and used to assess changes in knowledge and attitudes after in-person naloxone trainings. This main outcome of this study is examining changes in the OOKS subscale for signs of an opioid overdose with scores ranging from 0 to 10.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Opioid Overdose Attitudes Scale (OOAS) From Pre- to Post-training</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately Pre-Training and Within 1 Hour Post-training</time_frame>
    <description>The OOAS subscales assessing competencies to manage an opioid overdose (5 items). Study participants were given intranasal naloxone, so all items were adapted to refer to intranasal naloxone rather than injectable naloxone. OOAS items were scored on a Likert-type scale and higher scores suggested more favorable attitudes towards opioid overdose response, where 1=completely disagree, and 5=completely agree</description>

        <description>Higher scores on the OOKS indicate greater knowledge on how to identify and appropriately intervene during an opioid related overdose, including proper use of naloxone. The tool has been validated with healthcare professionals and lay persons and used to assess changes in knowledge and attitudes after in-person naloxone trainings. This main outcome of this study is examining changes in the OOKS subscale for signs of an opioid overdose with scores ranging from 0 to 10.</description>
