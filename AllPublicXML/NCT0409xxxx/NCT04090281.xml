  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to determine the feasibility and clinical utility of incorporating precision
      medicine approaches, incorporating both cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) genotyping and
      platelet reactivity phenotyping, with standard of care for patients with acute coronary
      syndromes (ACS), post PCI.

      Study Population:

      Adult patients will be eligible for inclusion if they provide informed consent and have no
      contraindications for 12-months of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT).

      Baseline Evaluation:

      Overview of clinical protocol: Patients with successful PCI will receive a genotype guided
      recommendation, upon discharge, based on CYP2C19 genotype. Patients who are determined to
      have CYP2C19 poor metabolizer (PM) or intermediate metabolizer (IM) status will be
      recommended to receive 12-months of prasugrel. Patients who are determined to have CYP2C19
      normal metabolizer (NM), rapid metabolizer (RM), or ultra-rapid metabolizer (UM) phenotype
      will be recommended to receive a de-escalation treatment, guided by on-treatment platelet
      reactivity phenotype at 14 days, post discharge.

      30-day, 6-month, and 12-month Follow-up: Patients will be contacted by phone or visited
      during one of their regularly scheduled appointments, at 14 days, 30 days, 6 months , and 12
      months, to complete &quot;Follow-up Case Report Forms&quot; to collect outcomes data. The 12-month
      follow up communication with enrolled patients will end their participation in the study.
