    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of single and multiple dose (once daily
      for 7 days) oral JNJ-64417184 and JNJ-53718678 on the pharmacokinetic (PK) of single and
      multiple-dose (once daily for 7 days) oral JNJ 53718678 and JNJ-64417184, respectively when
      coadministered to healthy adult participants under fed conditions.

             minutes], respiratory rate, and tympanic body temperature) performed at screening. If
             there are abnormalities, the participant may be included only if the investigator
             judges the abnormalities to be not clinically significant. This determination must be

          -  Blood pressure (after the participant is supine for 5 minutes) between 90 and 140
             millimeters of Mercury (mmHg) systolic, extremes included, and no higher than 90 mmHg
             diastolic at screening

             interval &lt;=200 ms

             period

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of, or current clinically significant medical illness including (but not
             limited to) cardiac arrhythmias or other cardiac disease, hematologic disease,
             coagulation disorders (including any abnormal bleeding or blood dyscrasias), lipid
             abnormalities, significant pulmonary disease, including bronchospastic respiratory
             disease, diabetes mellitus, hepatic or renal insufficiency (calculated creatinine
             clearance/estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] &lt;60 milliliter per minute
             (mL/min) at screening, calculated by the modification of diet in renal disease [MDRD]
             formula), thyroid disease, neurologic or psychiatric disease, infection, or any other
             illness that the investigator considers should exclude the participant or that could
             interfere with the interpretation of the study results

          -  Past history of cardiac arrhythmias (example: extrasystoli, tachycardia at rest),
             history of risk factors for Torsade de Pointes syndrome (example: hypokalemia, family
             history of long QT Syndrome)

          -  Any evidence of heart block or bundle branch block at screening

          -  History of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) or HIV-2 infection, or tests
             positive for HIV-1 or HIV-2 at screening

          -  Participant with any history of clinically significant skin disease such as, but not
             limited to, dermatitis, eczema, drug rash, psoriasis, food allergy, or urticaria
