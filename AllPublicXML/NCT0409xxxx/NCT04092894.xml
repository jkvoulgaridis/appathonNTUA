  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will evaluate the efficacy of postoperative oral suvorexant treatment on
      nighttime wakefulness after persistent sleep onset (WASO) among adult cardiac surgical
      patients recovering in the cardiac intensive care unit (ICU). The study include patients ≥ 60
      years old undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG), with or without valve
      surgery (aortic or mitral). Patients will receive either oral suvorexant or placebo for 7
      nights starting the night after extubation. The primary hypothesis is that suvorexant
      compared with placebo decreases WASO, as measured by a specialized electroencephalogram
      (EEG), the SedLine monitor, during the first night in the cardiac ICU. Investigators will
      also assess total sleep time (TST), time to sleep onset (TSO), and postoperative delirium and
      delirium-free days.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, blinded study. Participants will be
      enrolled preoperatively. After postoperative extubation, eligible patients will be randomly
      allocated in a 1:1 ratio to receive either suvorexant 20 mg or placebo.

      Study procedures will start on preoperative night 3 when the patient is first asked to report
      information about their sleep using the Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire (RCSQ).
      Patients will complete the RCSQ every morning during the 3 days prior to surgery. The
      intervention (study drug) will be applied for 7 nights starting the night after postoperative
      extubation in the ICU. Primary and secondary outcomes will be assessed once during the night
      of the sleep trial in the ICU. The sleep trial will take place during the first night after
      extubation if the patient has been extubated before 7pm. Exploratory outcomes will be
      assessed from day of extubation until hospital discharge.

      Suvorexant 20 mg or placebo will be administered p.o. once a day between 9:00pm and 10:00pm
      for a maximum of 7 days starting the night after extubation in the ICU. The study drug will
      be discontinued after 7 consecutive doses following extubation; or at hospital discharge (if
      less than 7 days after extubation); or at ICU discharge, if patient showed signs of airway
      obstruction during sleep or when strong inhibitors of CYP3A are co-administered; or in the
      event of early termination, subject withdrawal of consent, investigator withdrawal for
      toxicity or other reasons.

      If deemed necessary by the treating clinicians, melatonin or benzodiazepine may be added for
      treatment of insomnia. All patients will receive usual supportive care as per the treating
      physicians and standard practice.

      Duration of nighttime wakefulness after persistent sleep onset (WASO), total sleep time
      (TST), time to sleep onset (TSO) will be measured by electroencephalogram (EEG) using a Next
      Generation SedLine® Brain Function Monitor during the night of the sleep trial. Incidence of
      postoperative in-hospital delirium and increases delirium free days will be assessed using
      Confusion Assessment Method (CAM).

    <description>Nighttime wakefulness after persistent sleep onset (WASO) will be measured using a SedLine® Brain Function Monitor. WASO will be defined as the duration of wakefulness after the onset of persistent sleep in the observation period between 11:00pm (Lights-Off) to 6:00am (Lights-On) in minutes. Onset of persistent sleep will be defined as the first epoch of 10 consecutive minutes of sleep (REM or non-REM Stages 1, 2, 3 or 4) after Lights-Off. Wakefulness will be defined as any epoch of Stage 0. Sleep staging will be performed according to Rechtschaffen &amp; Kales criteria and in accordance with AASM guidelines. The SedLine® monitor uses a symmetrical bilateral array of sensors that provides four-channel data.</description>

    <description>Subjective sleep quality will be assessed by applying the Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire (RCSQ). The RCSQ is a validated survey instrument for assessing sleep quality in critically ill patients based on a five-item, visual analogue scale (each from 0 [worst value] to 100 [best value]). The scale evaluates perceptions of depth of sleep, sleep onset latency, number of awakenings, time spent awake, and overall sleep quality.</description>

    <time_frame>Every day from postoperative day 1 up to day of hospital discharge, an expected average of 21 days</time_frame>
    <description>Incidence of postoperative delirium will be measured daily by the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) and CAM-ICU. The CAM is a standardized screening tool used for identification of delirium symptoms through a diagnostic algorithm based on 4 cardinal features of delirium, namely acute onset and fluctuating course, inattention, disorganized thinking, and altered level of consciousness. The CAM-ICU, which is routinely performed in the ICU, includes both brief cognitive testing and the CAM algorithm to screen for delirium. For CAM-positive patients, the Delirium Symptom Interview, a standard cognitive assessment consisting of tests of attention, orientation, and memory will be performed by a research team members trained in the survey administration methodology and blinded to treatment assignment to verify the CAM screening results.</description>
