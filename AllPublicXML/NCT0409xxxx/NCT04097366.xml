  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BRAID is a randomised, multi-centre study assessing the impact of supplementary imaging in
      the detection of breast cancer in women participating in the UK national breast screening
      programme who have dense breast tissue.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast density is a measure of the amount of fibroglandular tissue and is a risk factor for
      breast cancer. Women with extremely dense breasts are at 4-fold increased breast cancer risk
      compared to women with 'fatty' breasts. High breast density reduces the sensitivity of
      mammography increasing the probability of the test missing a cancer. Women with dense breasts
      have their cancers found when the cancer is larger as they present with interval cancers or
      their cancers are not detected until the next screening round at a later stage.

      The UK national breast screening programme (NHS BSP) offers all women aged 50-70 screening
      with 3-yearly mammograms. It aims to reduce breast cancer mortality by 20% by detecting small
      cancers thereby reducing the number of late stage diagnoses. However only 53% of the cancers
      being detected are small (&lt;15mm). This is partly due to masking of cancers by dense breast
      tissue.

      This trial addresses how best to screen women with dense breasts for breast cancer. BRAID
      will randomise women whose recent screening mammogram shows that they have dense breasts to
      either standard of care (no supplementary imaging) or supplementary imaging with abbreviated
      MRI (ABB-MRI), automated whole breast ultrasound (ABUS) or contrast enhanced spectral
      mammography (CESM). These imaging techniques have been shown to be more sensitive than
      mammography at detecting cancers in dense breast tissue. Our hypothesis is that more cancers
      will be detected at an earlier stage with supplemental imaging.
