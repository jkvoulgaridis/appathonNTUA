  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CX1003 is a novel multi-target tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is designed to primarily
      inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) and hepatocyte growth factor
      receptor (HGFR/MET). This study aimed to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and antitumor
      activity of CX1003 in patients with refractory advanced or metastatic solid tumors.
