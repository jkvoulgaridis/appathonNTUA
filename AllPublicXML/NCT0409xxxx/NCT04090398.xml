    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well radium-223 dichloride and paclitaxel work in treating
      patients with advanced breast cancer that has spread to the bones. Radium-223 dichloride is a
      radioactive drug that behaves in a similar way to calcium and collects in cancer that has
      spread to the bones (bone metastases). The radioactive particles in radium-223 dichloride act
      on bone metastases, killing the tumor cells and reducing the pain that they can cause. Drugs
      used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor
      cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from
      spreading. Giving radium-223 dichloride and paclitaxel may work better in treating patients
      with metastatic breast cancer compared to paclitaxel alone.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine if the combination of radium Ra 223 dichloride (radium-223 dichloride) and
      paclitaxel improves progression-free survival (PFS) compared to paclitaxel alone.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the time to the first symptomatic skeletal event [SSE] (defined as 1st use of
      radiation therapy to relieve skeletal symptoms, new symptomatic pathologic vertebral or
      non-vertebral bone fractures, spinal cord compression, or tumor-related orthopedic surgical
      intervention).

      II. To measure the objective response rate (ORR). III. To determine the safety of radium-223
      dichloride with paclitaxel. IV. To measure overall survival (OS).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To perform molecular profiling assays on malignant and normal tissues, including, but not
      limited to, whole exome sequencing (WES) and messenger ribonucleic (RNA) sequencing (RNAseq),
      in order to:

      Ia. Investigate if molecular alterations in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair genes are
      associated with response to radium-223 dichloride, and.

      Ib. Investigate if loss of heterozygosity in triple negative tumors is associated with
      response to radium-223 dichloride.

      II. To contribute genetic analysis data from de-identified biospecimens to Genomic Data
      Commons (GDC), a well annotated cancer molecular and clinical data repository, for current
      and future research; specimens will be annotated with key clinical data, including
      presentation, diagnosis, staging, summary treatment, and if possible, outcome.

      III. To correlate change in level of total alkaline phosphatase, bone-specific alkaline
      phosphatase, and serum osteocalcin to response to radium-223 dichloride therapy.

      IV. To examine the radium-223 dichloride bio-distribution and absorbed dose in each bone
      metastatic lesions as well as elsewhere in the body including critical organs using
      dosimetry.

      V. To bank formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue, blood, and nucleic acids obtained
      from patients at the Experimental Therapeutics Clinical Trials Network (ETCTN) Biorepository
      at Nationwide Children's Hospital.

      VI. To explore the symptomatic adverse events (AE) for tolerability of each treatment arm.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15 and
      radium Ra 223 dichloride IV over 1 minute on day 1. Treatment with radium Ra 223 dichloride
      repeats every 28 days for 6 cycles and treatment with paclitaxel repeats every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Cycles repeat every
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, then every 3 months
      for 2 years.

    <description>Quantitative imaging biomarkers will be used for 18F-FDG-PET scan analysis as recommended. Two levels of SUV analysis will be performed: lesion level, in which SUV metrics will be extracted from each lesion ROI, and patient level, in which all lesions for a single patient will be grouped into a patient ROI before SUV analysis. Uptake will be quantified with maximal uptake (SUVmax), mean uptake (SUVmean), and total uptake (SUVtotal). For both ROI levels, SUVmax will be defined as the maximum SUV of the ROI and SUVtotal will be defined as the total summed SUV of the ROI normalized to voxel volume. SUVmean will be defined as the mean SUV within the lesion ROI or the mean of the SUVmean of all lesions within the patient ROI. For each SUV metric, response will be calculated as percent change from baseline to mid-treatment scans.</description>

             pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this
             study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Pre-menopausal subjects
             as well as subjects with ovarian radiation or concomitant treatment with an LH-RH
             agonist/antagonist must have a negative pregnancy test and agree to use an adequate
             method of contraception as recommended by their treating physicians. Subjects of
             child-bearing potential who are sexually active and their male partners must agree to
             utilize, during the treatment period and for 6 months after last dose of radium-223
             dichloride, 2 reliable and acceptable methods of contraception used simultaneously: a)
             barrier method such as a) condoms (male or female) with spermicidal agent or b)
             diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide, combined with a highly effective
             non-hormonal birth control method such as an intra-uterine device. Men treated or
             enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception and not donate
             sperm prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 6 months after
             completion of Radium-223 dichloride

             eligible

          -  No prior paclitaxel in metastatic setting within 2 years prior to Radium-223
             dichloride start

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have not recovered from adverse events (AEs) due to prior anti-cancer
             therapy (i.e., have residual toxicities &gt; grade 1) with the exception of alopecia

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitor within 4
             weeks prior to treatment. No radiation therapy for 2 weeks prior to treatment. For
             patients on trial therapy prior to study enrollment, washout period of 6 times the
             half-life of previously administered investigational agents prior to starting
             radium-223 dichloride is required

          -  Prior therapy with radionuclides (e.g., strontium, samarium, rhenium, radium)

          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents

          -  Patients with psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because radium-223 dichloride is an alpha
             particle-emitting radiopharmaceutical agent with the potential for teratogenic or
             abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for AEs in
             nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with radium-223 dichloride,
             breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with radium-223
             dichloride. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study

          -  Patients with a marked baseline prolongation of QT/corrected QT interval (QTc)
             interval (e.g., repeated demonstration of a QTc interval &gt; 480 milliseconds (ms)
             (CTCAE grade 1) using Fredericia's QT correction formula

          -  Patients with a history of additional risk factors for Torsades de Pointes (TdP) (e.g.
             heart failure, hypokalemia, family history of long QT syndrome)
