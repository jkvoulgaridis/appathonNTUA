      Purpose The primary purpose of the current project is to characterize unselected patients
      undergoing surgery developing post-operative atrial fibrillation (POAF), ultimately leading
      to a new risk-stratification model.

      Background and rationale According to rather scarce existing reports, it is estimated that
      10% will develop POAF following abdominal surgery. It remains a challenge for the clinicians
      to predict which patients are at risk. POAF can be difficult to diagnose, as symptoms are
      often vague. Hence, the diagnosis may remain underreported leaving many patients without
      adequate treatment. Untreated atrial fibrillation is associated with increased morbidity and
      mortality, especially due to an increased risk of ischemic stroke.

      Methods Three-hundred adult patients admitted for surgery at the Digestive Disease Center at
      Bispebjerg Hospital will be examined by heart rhythm monitoring during hospitalization, i.e.
      pre-, peri- and postoperatively in the main SECAFIB-SURG study. Twenty study participants who
      develop POAF and 20 without POAF matched with these on sex, age and co-morbidity, will
      undergo additional cardiovascular examinations three months after surgery in the current
      sub-study. All patients will be followed for at least one year after surgery. The study is
      scheduled for completion within two years, commencing in January 2020.

      Perspective Creating a POAF risk-stratification model for patients undergoing abdominal
      surgery, could ensure timely diagnosis and treatment, hence, preventing complications
      associated with POAF.

      Background and rationale Post-operative AF (POAF) appears to be common in relation to
      abdominal surgery affecting between 8% and 18%, however the incidence is not well reported,1
      and the SECAFIB-SURG study aims at reporting this.

      A number of risk-stratification models exist in the general population and in cardiac surgery
      patients, but it remains challenging to predict which patients will develop POAF in
      non-cardiac surgery patients.2-5 Diagnosing POAF is important, as recent data from the
      Framingham population suggest that secondary AF (AF occurring during a concomitant medical
      condition, e.g. surgery) is not a benign condition.6,7 Studies have found an association
      between POAF in relation to non-cardiac surgery and increased risk of post-operative
      mortality and stroke.8-10 Despite this, the current perception is that POAF is self-limiting
      and merely a result of the physiological stresses of surgery, why continuous anti-coagulation
      and referral for a cardiologist is not necessarily recommended.11-13 Well-known factors
      associated with AF in the general population is age, hypertension, heart failure, myocardial
      infarction, heart valve disease and diabetes.14 In general surgery important risk factors of
      AF is age (age 65-74, OR 2.08; age &gt;85, OR 3.56), hypertension (OR 3.66), heart failure (OR
      1.64), thyroid disease (OR 6.29), laparotomy (vs laparoscopy, OR 3.30) and duration of
      surgery (&gt; 600 min, OR 1.38).1 The pathophysiology of AF is however incompletely
      comprehended.14-16 Structural remodelling of the atria and electrical pathways, oxidative
      stress, inflammation, calcium overload, myofibroblast activation and microRNAs are suspected
      implicated in AF initiation and progression.14-17 Improved understanding of the
      pathophysiology of AF and improved diagnostic tools for predicting POAF is needed. In the
      current study, blood samples will focus on markers of cardiac surcharge (troponins and
      natriuretic peptide)18,19, inflammation20-22 and microRNAs associated with AF.23-25 Urine
      samples will focus on oxidative stress markers.22,26,27 Electrocardiogram (ECG) will focus on
      short and prolonged p-wave, and p-wave terminal force in lead V1 (PTFV1) which are correlated
      with AF.28 Myovista (HeartSciences, Southlake, Texas, USA) a novel type of ECG (wavECG)
      utilizing continues wavelet transform signal processing, appears to identify left ventricular
      diastolic dysfunction (LVDD),29 which is associated with AF in other studies.16,30-32
      Finapres Nova (Enschede, The Netherlands) is a continuous blood pressure monitor which will
      be used for non-invasive hemodynamic monitoring, e.g. beat-to-beat cardiac output, stroke
      volume, cardiac contractility, left ventricular ejection time and total peripheral
      resistance.33 Oral glucose tolerance test performed during monitoring with Finapres might
      demask peripheral vascular dysfunction.34 Speckle-tracking and strain analysis of the left
      atrium (LA) by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is in some studies able improve AF
      risk-prediction.35-39 Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) with late gadolinium
      enhancement (LGE) has been used to quantify atrial structural remodelling, fibrosis and
      function, and has been used to improve prediction of favourable outcome of patients
      undergoing ablation for AF.40-43

      Purpose The study aims at characterizing patients developing POAF by novel methods to improve
      risk stratification of patients undergoing abdominal surgery.

      Methods Prospective, single-centre, case-control study of patients undergoing abdominal
      surgery.

      The current study is a sub-study of SECAFIB-SURG. Study participants will be identified among
      those enrolled in the SECAFIB-SURG study (study ID: 68605) who have agreed to be contacted if
      they developed POAF or matched on age and gender with someone who did. POAF is defined as
      new-onset AF developing from surgery until discharge and diagnosed by specialists in
      Cardiology or Anaesthesiology on ECG or heart rhythm monitoring for at least 30 seconds
      duration or three recurrent episodes of AF. The Investigator (Department of Cardiology at
      Bispebjerg-Frederiksberg Hospital) will ensure signed informed consent.

      Statistical considerations LA strain analysis has not been performed in this patient group.
      LA strain has predicted recurrence of AF in patients who have undergone radiofrequency
      ablation.23,24 In one study, patients with recurrent AF had LA strain mean of 18.4% while
      those without recurrence had a LA strain mean of 25.5%23. In another study, patients with
      recurrent AF had LA strain mean of 9.7% while those without recurrence had a LA strain mean
      of 16.2%.24 With 95% power and alpha 0.05, and enrolment ratio 1:1, 5 patients with - and 5
      patients without - are required to identify significant difference in LA strain mean between
      the two groups. The current population is however expected more heterogenous that those
      undergoing radiofrequency ablation and as the study is explorative it will include 20
      patients with POAF and 20 matched controls without POAF. Follow-up will remain unchanged from
      the main study, i.e. one year from surgery.

      A venous blood sample (approximately 30 mL) and a urine sample (approximately 30 mL) will be
      collected for a Research biobank. Blood samples will be collected in EDTA- and serum tubes,
      respectively, extracting plasma (from the EDTA tube) and serum (from the serum tube). Samples
      are subsequently immediately frozen and transported on dry ice to a -80 degree freezer at
      Copenhagen University's Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences. Samples will be analysed when
      the last sample has been collected. Analyses will focus on markers of oxidative stress,
      coagulation abnormalities (factors II, VII, X and von Willebrand Factor) as well as fibrosis.
