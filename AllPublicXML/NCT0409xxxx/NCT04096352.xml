  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Scientific literature supports that teachers are at greater risk for voice disorders than the
      general population. In the classroom, the teacher's voice represents the main communication
      tool. Optimal voice use is indispensable to ensure effective teaching and preserve the
      teacher's vocal health.

      This project investigates how virtual reality (VR) facilitates the learning of effective
      vocal skills and their application in real-world contexts. Based on acoustic analyses and
      self-assessment scales, the investigators compare 100 future teachers randomly assigned in
      two groups. The experimental group (n=50) receives a voice training by VR simulations and
      voice information. The control group (n=50) only receives voice information.

      Experimental group participants receive direct method (three 1-hour sessions of voice
      training by virtual reality simulations over a course of 3 weeks) and indirect method (one
      1-hour session of information on voice function and voice hygiene). Control group
      participants receive indirect method (one 1-hour session of information on voice function and
      voice hygiene).
