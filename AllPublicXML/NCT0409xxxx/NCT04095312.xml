    <textblock>
      This study is based on the ergonomic features of the most common surgical procedures, which
      require advanced techniques and relatively difficult operations, such as pancreatobiliary
      surgery, prostatectomy, nephrectomy, colon and rectal resection. This study id designed to
      verify the clinical safety and effectiveness of 'Revo-i Surgical Robot System (Model
      MSR-5100), developed by Mirae Company to overcome the limitations of general laparoscopic
      surgery.
