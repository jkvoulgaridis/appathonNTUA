    <textblock>
      Very little is known about the role of X-inactive specific transcript RNA in human breast
      cancer and in regulating different response to therapy .

      the relation between the breast cancer predisposing gene BRCA1 &amp; X-inactive specific
      transcript RNA has been investigated but still controversial.

      Loss of X chromosome inactivation (XCI) is observed in breast cancer . Other studies sheds
      light on a possible mechanism of breast carcinogenesis mediated by XIST misbehaviour.

    <textblock>
      breast cancer is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in women .Genetics of female
      contributes to her risk of having breast cancer . this disease is still discovered in their
      late stages due to the negligence of females inspite of self inspection and clinical
      examination of the breast .the identification of markers that could predict the tumor
      behavior is important in breast cancer management , staging, evaluation of therapeutic
      response and development of new therapeutic modalities .XIST (X-inactive specific transcript)
      RNA is a long non -coding RNA which plays an important role in inactivation of x_ chromosome
      which act as an example for long non _ coding RNA mediated gene regulation .Very little is
      known about the role of XIST in human breast cancer and in regulating different response on
      therapy . the relation between the breast cancer predisposing gene BRCA1 &amp; XIST has been
      investigated but still controversial .Loss of X chromosome inactivation (XCI) is observed in
      breast . some studies provide evedience that BRCA1 Is involved in XIST regulation on the
      active X chromosome but not its localization .other studies sheds light on a possible
      mechanism of breast carcinogenesis mediated by XIST misbehaviour .
