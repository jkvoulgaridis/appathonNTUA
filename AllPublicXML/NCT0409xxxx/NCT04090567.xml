    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well olaparib with cediranib or AZD6738 works in treating
      patients with germline BRCA mutated breast cancer that has spread to other places in the body
      (advanced or metastatic). Olaparib, cediranib, and AZD6738 may stop the growth of tumor cells
      by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess the objective response rate (ORR) of olaparib plus cediranib and olaparib plus
      ceralasertib (AZD6738) combinations in patients with advanced or metastatic breast cancer
      with germline BRCA (breast cancer susceptibility gene) mutations who have been previously
      treated with PARP inhibitors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety and tolerability of olaparib in combination with cediranib and in
      combination with AZD6738 in patients with advanced or metastatic breast cancer with germline
      BRCA mutations.

      II. To assess duration of response (DOR) to treatment. III. To assess best response. IV. To
      estimate progression free survival (PFS).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate BRCA1 expression at baseline and on progression. II. To evaluate hypoxia
      markers at baseline and on progression. III. To evaluate levels of angiogenesis/ inflammatory
      markers including VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) at baseline and on progression.

      IV. To evaluate novel markers of resistance and response to PARP inhibitor in baseline and
      upon progression of disease in tumor tissue that are identified by the investigator's basic
      science collaborator's ongoing studies in vitro and in vivo.

      V. To evaluate circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) at baseline and on progression.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive olaparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) and cediranib PO once daily
      (QD) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive olaparib PO BID on days 1-28 and ceralasertib PO QD on days 1-7.
      Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.

          -  Patients at risk of brain perfusion problems, e.g., carotid stenosis

          -  Patients with relative hypotension (&lt; 100/60 mm Hg) or clinically relevant orthostatic
             hypotension (&gt;= 20 beats per minute change in pulse including a fall in blood pressure
             of &gt;= 20 mm Hg associated with dizziness, syncope, and blurred vision, from lying down
             or sitting to standing). Uncontrolled hypertension requiring clinical intervention

          -  Breast feeding/lactating/pregnant women

          -  Prior allogeneic bone marrow transplant or double umbilical cord blood transplantation

          -  Progressed on or recurred within 1 months of completing platinum-based chemotherapy in
             metastatic setting

          -  Additional exclusion criteria for olaparib + cediranib: Patients may not have evidence
             of coagulopathy or bleeding diathesis. Therapeutic anticoagulation for prior
             thromboembolic events is permitted. The clinical indication for therapeutic
             anticoagulation must be clearly documented prior to enrollment and must be discussed
             with the principal investigator (PI). Given the increased risk of serious bleeding
             from cediranib, patients who are on more than or equal to 2 anti-thrombotic agents,
             including but not limited to anti-platelet agents (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug
             [NSAID]s/aspirin, clopidogrel), heparin, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH),
             warfarin, and a direct thrombin inhibitor, will be excluded

          -  Additional exclusion criteria for olaparib + AZD6738: A diagnosis of ataxia
             telangiectasia

          -  Major surgery within 3 weeks of starting study treatment and patients must have
             recovered from any effects of any major surgery
