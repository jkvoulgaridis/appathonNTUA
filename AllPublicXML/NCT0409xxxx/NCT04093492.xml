  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Preemie Prep for Parents (P3) mobile intervention will be tested in an outpatient
      population of pregnant women at risk of preterm birth and their partners. The study is an RCT
      comparing knowledge and preparedness for decision making between a group receiving the P3
      texts and videos and a group receiving links to ACOG prematurity patient education handouts.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled study focused on an outpatient population of pregnant women
      at risk of preterm birth and their partners. The objective is to test the efficacy of the
      Preemie Prep for Parents (P3) intervention on prematurity knowledge and preparedness for
      decision making.

      Participants are recruited from their obstetric clinic appointment between weeks 16 and 21,
      and randomized 1:1 to either the P3 intervention, or access to electronic ACOG handouts
      (active control). Any participating partners are assigned to the same arm as their pregnant
      partner. The participants in the P3 group will then receive a schedule of automated text
      messages, with video links, up to twice a day. These videos and messages are based on
      information relevant to their gestational age.

      At study entry, participants will complete measures of their health literacy, anxiety,
      decision self-efficacy, and subjective global health. As pregnancy continues, questionnaires
      will be sent to participants at the start of their 25th, 30th, and 34th weeks. These
      questionnaires will include Prematurity Knowledge Questionnaires (specific to their
      gestational age), a Preparation for Decision Making scale, and an anxiety measure. At study
      completion, within two weeks of either preterm childbirth or completion of the 34 week
      questionnaire, participants will be asked to also complete the Educational-Aid Questionnaire.
