    <time_frame>5 days</time_frame>
    <description>The study will determine if the RAM Nasal Cannula is providing adequate CPAP to neonates. This will be measured with the Braden Q score. The Braden Q Scale is composed of seven subscales. All seven subscales are rated from 1 (least favorable)to4(most favorable); patients receive only one score per subscale.</description>

    <description>The study will determine if the RAM Nasal Cannula is providing adequate Bi-PAP to neonates. This will be measured with the Braden Q score every 3 hours. The Braden Q Scale is composed of seven subscales. All seven subscales are rated from 1 (least favorable)to4(most favorable); patients receive only one score per subscale.</description>
