    <textblock>
      Tuberculosis (TB) is a highly stigmatized disease, and approximately one-third of the
      Cambodian population living with TB are undetected. Therefore, it is vital to find these
      missing cases and promptly link them to care to reduce disease progression and interrupt
      further transmission. The integration of community-based, peer-driven intervention in TB
      active case finding (ACF) is relatively novel. In partnership with KHANA, the National Center
      for Tuberculosis and Leprosy Control (CENAT), and the Cambodia Anti-Tuberculosis Association
      (CATA), we will conduct a pragmatic cluster randomized controlled trial comparing 1) the ACF
      with the seed-and-recruit model; 2) ACF targeting household and neighborhood contacts; 3) ACF
      targeting the older population using mobile screening units; and 4) passive case finding
      (PCF) approach. The primary outcome will be the case notification rate in the intervention
      and control districts during the study period. We will also determine additionality,
      comparing the yield in each arm with its respective historical baseline and the cumulative
      yield over the implementation period. The secondary outcomes include the number needed to
      screen to detect one TB case, cost-effectiveness (direct and indirect costs per TB case
      notified), and the treatment outcome of all people with TB in this study. The project will be
      carried out over two years in eight operational districts (province name in parenthesis) -
      Koh Soutin (Kampong Cham), Stong (Kampong Thom), Kanchreach (Prey Veng), Choeung Prey
      (Kampong Cham), Dambae (Thbong Khmum), Boribo (Kampong Chhnang), Ponhea Leu (Kandal), and
      Phnom Srouch (Kampong Speu) - in Cambodia. The selection was also based on the number of
      health centers to increase comparability and generalizability of study findings. This study
      will randomize currently underserved operational districts (without active intervention at
      least in the past six months from the implementation date) to receive the interventions (ACF)
      and PCF as the control. The results from this proposal will enable a nationwide scale-up of
      an effective intervention that is contextualized and complies with the principles set by the
      national TB program to find undiagnosed cases and control TB in Cambodia. Also, this project
      will complement existing ACF programs in Cambodia by expanding ACF to other operational
      districts that are currently not served by the Global Fund, its implementing partners, and
      other organizations. Findings from this trial could also potentially inform active case
      finding strategies in other countries with a high TB burden.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading infectious cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide,
      accounting for 10 million new cases and 1.6 million deaths in 2017. The disease burden is
      disproportionately concentrated in low- and middle-income countries with over 95% of TB
      deaths contributed by these regions. In 2016, the number of new TB cases was estimated at 10
      million, and nearly 40% remained undiagnosed. Limited access to health care, high treatment
      cost, and social stigma of TB contributed to delayed detection and poor treatment uptake.
      Other risk factors such as poor living conditions and overcrowding further perpetuated the
      transmission of TB, which, in turn, leads to social and economic insecurity. Cambodia is one
      of the countries with the world's highest burden of TB, with an estimated incidence of active
      TB of 326 (95% CI: 224-447) per 100,000 population in 2017. Through the years, TB control
      programs in Cambodia has achieved significant milestones made possible by committed partners
      and focused efforts at the grassroots, national, and international level. In 2016, the TB
      incidence was approximately half of that in the year 2000, and a similar decline was observed
      in the TB mortality rate. Furthermore, the country has made notable progress in the fight
      against TB by achieving a treatment success rate of 94%, one of the highest among the 30 high
      TB burden countries.

      However, the successes are impeded by a significant proportion of undiagnosed cases.
      Globally, it is estimated that 36% of the TB cases were undiagnosed in 2017, and a similar
      proportion is observed in Cambodia. Traditionally, TB cases are captured and passively
      notified when people with TB present themselves to a health facility. In recent years, a more
      proactive strategy to increase TB case notification, namely active case finding (ACF) has
      gained traction and is reported to be effective. Alongside passive case finding (PCF), the
      ACF strategy has been adopted by countries affected by the epidemic, including Cambodia, to
      reach people with TB effectively. Nevertheless, despite increased efforts to improve case
      detection, TB case finding remains a great challenge due to limited resources, geographical
      barriers, and social stigma. The current approaches rely solely on skilled healthcare workers
      and community health volunteers to find TB cases. Its utility and sustainability, in the long
      run, have yet to be substantially demonstrated.

      Empirically, a snowball approach (seed-and-recruit mechanism) has been widely accepted to
      reach concealed populations such as populations who are at-risk for HIV in many countries,
      including Cambodia, due to its practical feasibility. A community-based peer-led strategy as
      such has been an inherent component in HIV responses worldwide, and successes have been
      reported. However, little is known about the feasibility and effectiveness of ACF with the
      snowball model in improving TB case notification. However, given the comparable hard-to-reach
      nature of HIV and TB populations, it is a concept worth exploring. In partnership with KHANA,
      the National Center for Tuberculosis and Leprosy Control (CENAT), and the Cambodia
      Anti-Tuberculosis Association (CATA), this project seeks to examine the effectiveness of
      different ACF strategies in increasing TB case notification in the community and its impact
      on treatment outcome. This project is congruent with the global plan to end TB. and the
      Global Fund's strategy 2017-2022 by informing sustainable and evidence-based solutions for TB
      control in Cambodia.

      We will conduct a cluster randomized controlled trial with four arms comparing ACF with the
      seed-and-recruit model, other ACF approaches, and PCF approach in eight operational districts
      in Cambodia. The project will be carried out over two years. ACF with the seed-and-recruit
      model by KHANA, ACF targeting household and neighborhood contacts by CENAT, ACF targeting the
      older population using mobile screening units by CATA will be implemented in the intervention
      arms and PCF will be implemented in the control arm. These case finding strategies have been
      piloted in Cambodia, and they are endorsed by the national TB program in Cambodia. This study
      will randomize currently underserved operational districts (without active intervention, at
      least in the past six months from the implementation date). The interventions will be carried
      out as per the protocol devised by the partner organizations, respectively.

      This study aims to 1) evaluate the effectiveness of an ACF strategy using a seed-and-recruit
      model for increasing TB case notification (case notification rate, additionality, comparing
      the yield in each arm with its respective historical baseline and the cumulative yield over
      the implementation period) in Cambodia, 2) establish the effect of ACF strategies on TB
      treatment outcomes, 3) evaluate number needed to screen to detect one TB case and the
      cost-effectiveness (costs per TB case notified) of different ACF strategies.

In the intervention clusters, potential seeds - TB survivors, people living with HIV, and household contacts of people with TB - will be approached by the research team. Seeds will be trained and act as recruiters in the community to refer presumptive TB cases to the attached health centers. The research team will work with staff at the health centers to facilitate screening and enrollment of recruits who are diagnosed with TB to care. New people with TB who have the potential to be a recruiter will be invited and trained to recruit their peers in the community who may have TB for TB screening. Seeds will be trained to identify people who may have TB and equipped with health promotion skills to impart knowledge and practices about TB. We will follow-up all people with TB referred by seeds for six months from the treatment initiation.</description>

Immediate neighbors (10 nearest households) of the index cases (people with TB) who are symptomatic will also be invited by the community health volunteers to the screening session. Next nearest households within the same village will be approached if the number of presumptive TB cases in the 10 nearest households is low. The one-off screening session will be held at the nearest health center on specific days. Presumptive TB cases will be screened for symptoms on-site, and chest x-ray (CXR) will be taken. Sputum samples from presumptive TB cases with abnormal (CXR) will be collected for GeneXpert testing. Test results will be communicated to the newly diagnosed people with TB, and they will be referred to the health centers for treatment and follow-up.</description>

    <description>The outreach team will conduct training and sensitization of the target population of the activities. The schedule of a one-off screening session will be made known to the communities in the districts before the screening day. Each person who visits the screening session will be screened. Demographic information and presence of TB symptoms will be collected at registration by a trained staff. A chest x-ray will then be performed on-site for all persons exhibiting TB symptoms and all elderly aged 55 and above regardless of symptoms. When CXR findings are abnormal, sputum samples will be collected for GeneXpert testing on-site as well. Test results will be communicated to the participants on the spot or via phone calls, and people with TB will be referred for treatment and follow-up at the health center where screening is conducted or a center of their choice. Should the health center of their choice do not fall within the selected sites, follow-up will be conducted via phone calls.</description>
