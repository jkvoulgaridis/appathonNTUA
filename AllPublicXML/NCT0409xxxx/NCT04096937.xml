  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rural youth have heightened exposure to adverse childhood experiences (ACES) such as poverty,
      social isolation, chronic hunger, and drug use in the home. These threats can lead to
      downstream problems with emotion regulation, substance abuse, and heightened vulnerability to
      chronic disease. Resilience is the capacity to adapt positively in the face of such
      disadvantage. Youth resilience interventions can buffer the negative effects of ACES.
      Unfortunately, rural schools and other youth-serving agencies often have inadequate capacity
      to provide such interventions. Thus, there is a critical need to develop cost-effective,
      sustainable, and culturally-relevant youth resilience interventions that can be delivered by
      trained personnel with dedicated time and resources. WVU, UK, and Save The Children have a
      long-term goal to establish a sustained community-engaged research partnership to promote
      resilience in Appalachian youth. This is a community-based participatory research
      (CBPR)-guided study being conducted for the purpose of developing a culturally relevant,
      intervention to promote Appalachian youth resilience. The intervention, called Journey of
      Hope in Appalachia (JOHA), has as it's starting point Save The Children's evidence-based
      Journey of Hope (JOH) program that targets youth experiencing acute stress from natural
      disasters and similar events. This program will be culturally adapted to promote resilience
      among Appalachian youth experiencing ACES. JOHA will incorporate positive aspects of
      Appalachian culture (e.g., storytelling, theater, music) and will be designed for
      sustainability and eventual dissemination by Save through the Appalachian Translational
      Research Network (ATRN) and other regional Networks.
