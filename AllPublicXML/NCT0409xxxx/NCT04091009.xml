  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to compare two ways of managing pain in people who are
      taking buprenorphine and are scheduled to undergo surgery. Buprenorphine (subutex) and
      buprenorphine/naloxone (suboxone) are effective long-term treatments for substance use
      disorders. The management of pain after surgery in adults taking buprenorphine can be
      challenging, as buprenorphine may interfere with the effectiveness of other medications used
      to treat pain.

      We want to compare how well pain is managed after surgery (&quot;post-op&quot;) in two groups:

      The &quot;Continue Group&quot;: those who continue taking their standard dose of buprenorphine before,
      during and after surgery.

      The &quot;Reduce Group&quot;: those who are placed on a lower dose of buprenorphine starting one day
      before surgery and during the time period after surgery until the pain from the surgery has
      decreased. Once the pain from the surgery has decreased, you will be put back on your full
      dose of buprenorphine.

      We also want to find out if there is a difference in pain, opioid cravings, and relapse rates
      in the month following surgery.
