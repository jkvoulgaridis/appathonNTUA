      This is a multi-center, pivotal study to assess the safety and effectiveness of a new method
      of treating severe burns using NovoSorb Biodegradable Temporizing Matrix (BTM). A comparison
      will be made between burn wounds treated with BTM and the institution's standard of care
      (SOC).

    <description>NovoSorb BTM comprises a completely synthetic, sterile, integrating dermal component (porous biodegradable polyurethane foam) and a temporary epidermal barrier component (a nonbiodegradable polyurethane sealing membrane). These layers are adhered with a biodegradable polyurethane bonding layer. BTM will be implanted and fixed into position to close a debrided burn wound. After a period of integration, the sealing membrane is removed and a split skin graft is applied.</description>
