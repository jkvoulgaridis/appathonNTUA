    <description>Patient-selected weighted composite outcome scale is a composite scale to consider both decisional conflict and decisional regret scales simultaneously according to the priority based on the survey of 100 potential participants. The rationale for this endpoint is to consider not only the preference of majority patients (73%) but also the minority (27%) participants who prefer the decisional regret scale</description>

    <description>The intervention involves a clear pathway centered on the use of a web-based decision tool. This tool aims to support the shared decision-making process for anticoagulation for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation. This web-based tool will be used both by the participants as well the physician responsible for atrial fibrillation decision making.</description>
