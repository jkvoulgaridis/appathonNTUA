    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the hypothesis that the gas mixture with xenon will have a positive
      effect on the symptoms in patients with Parkinson's Disease. The study will test the
      hypothesis that the gas mixture with xenon has a symptomatic treatment potential for patients
      with Parkinson's Disease, as measured by change from baseline in the Unified Parkinson
      Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS).

    <description>Analysis of Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) from baseline.The UPDRS scale refers to Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale, and it is a rating tool used to gauge the course of Parkinson's disease in patients. The UPDRS scale includes series of ratings for typical Parkinson's symptoms that cover all of the movement hindrances of Parkinson's disease. The UPDRS scale consists of the following five segments: 1) Mentation, Behavior, and Mood, 2) ADL, 3) Motor sections, 4) Modified Hoehn and Yahr Scale, and 5) Schwab and England ADL scale. Each answer to the scale is evaluated by a medical professional that specializes in Parkinson's disease during patient interviews. Some sections of the UPDRS scale require multiple grades assigned to each extremity with a possible maximum of 199 points. A score of 199 on the UPDRS scale represents the worst (total disability) with a score of zero representing (no disability).</description>
