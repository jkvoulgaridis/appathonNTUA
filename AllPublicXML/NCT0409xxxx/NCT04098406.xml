  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this trial is to assess the efficacy, safety, and PK/PD effects of CNM-Au8
      as a disease-modifying agent for the treatment of ALS by utilizing electrophysiological
      measures to detect preservation of motor neuron function. The primary endpoint is the mean
      change in the average difference between active treatment and placebo from Baseline through
      Week 36 for the MUNIX score(4).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centre randomised, double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled study of
      the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of CNM-Au8 in patients who are
      newly symptomatic within 24-months of Screening and with a clinically probable or possible or
      definite ALS diagnosis per the Awaji-Shima criteria (de Carvalho et al. 2008).

      Patients may be screened over up to a 4-week period. Patients who meet the inclusion criteria
      and none of the exclusionary criteria will be enrolled into the clinical study.

      Patients will be randomised 1:1 into one of two groups: either active treatment with CNM-Au8
      30 mg or Placebo.

      All patients will receive their randomised oral treatment daily over thirty-six (36)
      consecutive weeks during the Treatment Period.

      There will be three study periods:

        1. Up to a four (4) week screening period (Screening Period);

        2. A thirty-six (36) week blinded randomised treatment period (Treatment Period);

        3. A four (4) week safety follow-up period (End-of-Study Assessment).

      Per protocol all patients will receive their blinded and randomised oral treatment daily over
      at least 36 consecutive weeks during the Treatment Period. Following the end of the Treatment
      Period patients may be transitioned into an open-label extension period in a separate study
      protocol (e.g., RESCUE-ALS OLE).

      For those patients not transitioning into the separate open-label extension study, patients
      will complete an EOS safety assessment 4-weeks following study drug discontinuation.

      An independent DSMB will be responsible for monitoring the safety of the study on a quarterly
      basis and ad hoc at the request of the DSMB or the Sponsor (e.g., in the event of unexpected
      SAEs) to review data throughout the Treatment Period. The DSMB may make recommendations on
      the conduct of the study, including study termination.

      Appropriate procedures will be detailed in a DSMB Charter.
