  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Open-label, baseline-controlled, multi-center study evaluating a 1064 nm diode laser, pulsed
      electromagnetic fields and vacuum assisted radio frequency for non-invasive fat reduction of
      the abdomen and flanks.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will enroll up to 200 subjects requesting non-invasive lipolysis of the abdomen and
      flanks. Each subject will receive up to 3 study treatments of the diode laser and up to 3
      treatments of the pulsed electromagnetic fields and vacuum assisted radio frequency study
      treatments. Subjects will be followed at 24 weeks post diode treatments to observe their
      satisfaction with treatment outcomes.

    <description>The investigational device (Venus Bliss™) is a non-invasive medical aesthetic device designed for body contouring. The device is comprised of a console, four 1064 nm diode laser applicators (60 mm x 60 mm). A belt is included to allow the operator to secure the laser applicators on the lipolysis treatment area, allowing hands free operation. The device uses vacuum assisted radiofrequency (RF) and PEMF (pulsed electromagnetic field) technology which has been shown in clinical studies to be safe and effective in body circumferential reduction and skin tightening.</description>
