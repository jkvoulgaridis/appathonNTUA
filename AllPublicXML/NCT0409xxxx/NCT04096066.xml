  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The combination of lenalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone (Rd) is considered the new
      standard for elderly newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) patients. The combination
      carfilzomib plus lenalidomide-dexamethasone (KRd) in relapsed-refractory MM patients improved
      the progression-free survival (PFS) of approximately 1 year compared to standard Rd
      treatment. In a small phase 2 trial (23 pts) the KRd combination in elderly NDMM pts showed a
      complete response (CR) rate of 79% and a PFS at 3 years of 80%. Cardiovascular adverse events
      are the most limiting toxicities, especially in elderly patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This protocol is a randomized, multicenter study designed to determine the MRD negativity and
      the PFS of KRd treatment regimen.

      Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive carfilzomib-lenalidomide-dexamethasone
      (KRd - Arm A) or lenalidomide-dexamethasone (Rd - Arm B).

      Patients will be stratified basing on international staging system (ISS) and fitness status
      using a web-based procedure completely concealed to study participants.

      All consecutive patients â‰¥ 65 years with newly diagnosed MM will be enrolled in a large
      randomized study during a period of 24 months.

      Patients will be treated until disease progression or intolerance to the therapy. The only
      exception is for patients enrolled in KRd arm who achieve at least a VGPR during the first
      year of treatment and in sustained MRD negativity (MRD negative at least at 10-5 after one
      and two years of therapy): these patients will stop carfilzomib administration after 2 years,
      whereas treatment with lenalidomide and dexamethasone will be continued.
