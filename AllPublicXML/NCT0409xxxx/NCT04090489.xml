  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chagas disease (CD) could be acquired by contact with the vector, transplacentally and by
      blood transfusion. The duration and clinical presentation of the initial acute phase of the
      infection may be variable, but the majority of patients are asymptomatic. The acute phase
      usually lasts a few months and, if untreated, the acute phase goes on to develop a chronic
      infection. The chronic phase usually continues for the subject's lifetime, and 30% to 40% of
      patients will progress to the chronic phase with a cardiac, digestive, neurological, or mixed
      form at 15 to 30 years after the initial infection. Progressive heart failure and sudden
      death due to ventricular arrhythmias are the main causes of death in patients with chronic
      Chagas heart disease.

      Objective: To evaluate cardiac involvement in children after pharmacological treatment for
      Chagas disease.

      Methods: Open exploratory study, blind for cardiological evaluation. Population: children
      treated for Chagas disease with at least 6 years after-treatment parasitological (T.cruzi
      qPCR), serological (IHA, EIA) and cardiological follow-up. Non-infected subjects were
      included as a control group for final cardiological evaluation.

      Treatment: benznidazole or nifurtimox, standard dose, for 60 days. Blood samples were
      collected at diagnosis, end-of-treatment and every 6-12 months thereafter.

      Electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed at diagnosis and every year after treatment.

      In this cohort, 24 hours ECG (Holter) and Speckle-tracking strain echocardiography study were
      performed at the end of follow-up for this study.
