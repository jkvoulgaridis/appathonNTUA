  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The field of clinical diagnosis of recessive cerebellar ataxias (ARCA) is particularly
      complex and Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) techniques have revolutionized this
      neuro-genetic field. The current challenge is to optimize the analysis of genetic data
      generated by NGS because: the processing of data remains very laborious; diagnostic yeld less
      than 50%; the interpretation of the variants sometimes very difficult. For this purpose of
      optimization, the team of the University Hospital of Strasbourg has developed a computer
      algorithm based on 124 clinical and para-clinical parameters (derived from the data of the
      literature), useful to guide the genes to be targeted in priority by genetic analysis, in the
      context of a suspicion of ARCA (&gt; 60 known genes); this algorithm was validated
      retrospectively in 834 patients with genetically confirmed ARCA (92% Sense, 95% Spec).
      However, these 834 patients are often the same as those described in the literature and used
      for the elaboration of the algorithm. This introduces a bias in the initial evaluation of the
      algorithm, which therefore requires validation in clinical practice, from a cohort of
      patients referred for suspected ARCA (with or without a found genetic mutation). At the same
      time, Montpellier's genetics laboratory has developed a bioinformatic method for the search
      for copy number variations (CNV) that can be applied in a targeted manner to the genes
      predicted by the algorithm.

      The principal aim of this study is the validation of a semi-automated clinical algorithm for
      NGS molecular diagnosis of ARCA; the secondary objective is to evaluate if the application of
      this algorithm coupled with a targeted bioinformatic analysis can increase the diagnostic
      yield of the NGS analysis.

      Design: Retrospective study based on clinico-genetic data. Total research duration: 22 months
      Plan of the study : More than 150 patients referred for ARCA suspicion have been analyzed by
      NGS (Montpellier platform) since September 2013. The clinical data of these patients will be
      entered at the computer level into the algorithm to obtain the prediction of the gene
      involved (under the form of a probability for each of the genes known to ARCA). The
      investigators will compare this result with that obtained by standard NGS analysis. For
      patients without molecular diagnosis defined after standard NGS analysis, the investigators
      will take the 5 most probable genes selected on the basis of the algorithm in order to carry
      out an in-depth analysis of the variants found and a bioinformatic analysis by semi-automatic
      detection of CNVs. Main Evaluation Criterion: Concordance of the algorithm with standard NGS
      analysis for the genetic diagnosis of ARCA. Secondary evaluation criterion:% of patients for
      whom the prediction based on the algorithm suggested the correct diagnosis (subsequently
      confirmed after revision in the detail of the genetic data) while the standard genetic
      analysis was not not informative. Statistical Analysis: The investigators will perform a
      concordance analysis (Cohen's k) to validate the algorithm in clinical practice. For a given
      patient, there will be concordance if: i) one of the first 5 genes predicted with the highest
      probability by the algorithm is compatible with the mutation found after standard NGS or ii)
      if no gene is predicted by the algorithm (score &lt;20) and no mutation found by NGS analysis.

    <description>In order to validate in clinical practice a semi-automated clinical algorithm designed to guide the molecular diagnosis obtained by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) in patients with suspected Autosomal Recessive Cerebellar Ataxia (ARCA), we will measure the agreement between the prediction of the algorithm and the result of the standard NGS analysis. For each patient the agreement is defined as: 1) one of the first 5 gene predicted with the highest probability by the algorithm is also the mutated gene found after the NGS analysis; 2) if no gene is predicted by the algorithm (= none of the gene has a prediction score &gt; 20) and no mutation is found after NGS analyses.</description>

    <description>The secondary objective is to evaluate whether the application of this algorithm, coupled with a targeted bioinformatic analysis, changes the diagnostic yield compared to a NGS analysis performed in a conventional manner. Therefore, the secondary outcome will be the percentage of patients for whom the prediction based on the algorithm suggested the corrected diagnosis (confirmed in a second time after the review of the genetic data derived from NGS after the application of a targeted bioinformatic analysis), while the standard NGS analysis (blinded to algorithm prediction) was not informative</description>

      Genetic database of approximately 150 patients with cerebellar ataxia, referred since
      September 2013 for exome analysis to the Montpellier University Hospital Center. The genetic
      data are from clinical exome capture sequencing with the Trusight One sequencing panel kit
      (www.illumina.com/trusightone), allowing exploration of approximately 5,000 human disease
      genes. Each sample is accompanied by a consent that allows genetic analysis and data
      processing. Each sample is also accompanied by clinical information, usually consisting of a
      clinical information sheet adapted to patients with genetic ataxias or clinical reports.
      These data are already accessible.
