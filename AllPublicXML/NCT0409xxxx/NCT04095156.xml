  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Membranous nephropathy (MN) is the most frequent cause of nephrotic syndrome (NS) in adults.
      The majority of MN patients show detectable circulating antibodies against the M-type
      phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R). Infusion of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies results in a
      profound depletion of B-cells, which are thought to be responsible for anti-PLA2R production.
      B-cell depletion is followed by NS remission in 70% of cases. Limited evidence highlighted
      that differences in the B- and T-cell compartments may exist between responders and
      non-responders. Owing to the non-homogenous efficacy of anti-CD20 treatment, investigators
      hypothesize that in MN patients who experience NS remission after B-cell depleting therapy,
      autoreactive B-cells may be mostly circulating, whereas in patients who do not respond to the
      same treatment, autoreactive B-cells may chiefly reside into secondary lymphoid organs - and
      thus be more resistant to the drug action. Researchers will therefore extensively analyze the
      circulating immune repertoire of MN patients before and after the infusion of B-cell lineage
      depleting agents, assessing the presence of circulating PLA2R autoreactive B cells from
      appropriately stratified responder and non-responder patients. Patients and healthy controls
      will be enrolled in this study. Patients will be stratified according to gender, anti-PLA2R
      status, type of B-cell lineage depleting agent received and response to treatment.
