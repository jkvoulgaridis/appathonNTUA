  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized controlled trial of a behavioral intervention (Pre-Game Safety Huddles) designed
      to study the impact of huddles on concussion safety in youth sport, primarily regarding
      intention to report concussive symptoms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      More than 1 million youth sustain a sport-related concussion (SRC) each year. The middle
      school age range is particularly concerning because it is a time when children have both a
      unique susceptibility to brain injury and high participation rates in organized sports with
      concussion risk, such as soccer and football. There are two avenues to decrease concussion
      risk: (1) minimizing the number and force of collisions to decrease concussion incidence
      (primary prevention) and (2) improving concussion identification to decrease morbidity
      (secondary prevention). The goal of this study is to utilize Pre-Game Safety Huddles to
      discuss sportsmanship (primary prevention) and concussion reporting (secondary prevention)
      with a goal of improving concussion safety.

      To assess the efficacy of Pre-Game Safety Huddles as a tool for injury prevention, we will
      conduct a Randomized controlled trial with youth sport teams. We will recruit leagues in the
      Seattle area (girls' soccer, boys' soccer and football) and randomize them to either
      intervention or control. Coaches in the intervention group will then be trained to lead
      Pre-Game Safety Huddles before each game over the course of the season (9-12 weeks). Youth
      and coaches will be surveyed at three time points and data will be analyzed to determine
      impact of the intervention on two outcomes: 1) intention to report concussive symptoms and 2)
      intention to make a play to stop an opponent that may cause a head injury.
