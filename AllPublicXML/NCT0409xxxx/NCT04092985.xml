    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess the feasibility and reliability of smartwatch iECG provided by the
      Apple Watch/Apple iPhone for the detection of different cardiac arrhythmias. In this study,
      results from a 12-lead ECG will be set as the gold standard for the arrhythmia diagnosis, and
      results from the smartwatch iECG (Apple watch/Apple iPhone application and Cardiologist's
      interpretations) as the index tests. The iECG tracings will be recorded simultaneously,
      starting and ending at the same time as the standard 12-lead ECG, using the built-in sensors
      of a smartwatch (Apple Watch Series 4) with the ECG application.

      This diagnostic accuracy study is an investigator-initiated trial to evaluate the value of a
      smartwatch-based iECG for detection of cardiac arrhythmias.

      iECG tracings will be recorded simultaneously, starting and ending at the same time as the
      standard 12-lead ECG, using the built-in sensors of a smartwatch (Apple Watch Series 4) with
      the market version of the ECG application (Apple Inc., Cupertino, California). Participants
      will be advised to lie down in a supine position and breathe spontaneously. All recording
      will be done by trained study personnel.

      All iECG and 12-lead ECG recordings will be presented in PDF format as our references. Saved
      formats will be transferred to our Telemonitoring Center for further analysis and processing.

      Results from a 12-lead ECG will be considered as the gold standard for the measurement of
      heart rhythms and the arrhythmia diagnosis. All 12-lead ECGs recordings will be analyzed by 2
      blinded cardiologists and will be categorized as &quot;Sinus rhythm&quot;, &quot;High or low heart rate&quot;,
      &quot;Atrial fibrillation&quot;, or &quot;Inconclusive&quot;. Besides, cardiologists will report ECG wave's
      characteristics as well as any other possible diagnosis including &quot;Superior ventricular
      tachycardia&quot;, &quot;Ventricular tachycardia&quot;, &quot;Atrial flutter&quot;, and &quot;other types: other possible
      arrhythmias&quot;. In the case of uncertainties, a third cardiologist will be consulted, blinded
      for initial diagnoses.

      The iECG recordings (test index) will be interpreted and reported in two different ways:

        1. By using HealthKit Framework (Apple Watch and Apple iPhone applications): After a
           successful iECG recording with the Apple watch, iECGs will be transmitted by the ECG
           application to the iPhone. The Health App (Apple Inc., Cupertino, California) will
           receive, process and store the iECGs on the iPhone and will present one of the following
           results on the iPhone screen automatically: &quot;Sinus rhythm&quot;, &quot;High or low heart rate&quot;,
           &quot;Atrial fibrillation&quot;, or &quot;Inconclusive&quot;. Besides, the mean heart rate will be recorded,
           which will be automatically calculated by the Health App.

        2. By cardiologist: All iECGs will be analyzed by 2 blinded cardiologists. They will report
           their findings in the following categorize: &quot;Sinus rhythm&quot;, &quot;High or low heart rate&quot;,
           &quot;Atrial fibrillation&quot;, or &quot;Inconclusive&quot;. Besides, they will report ECG wave's
           characteristics as well as any other possible diagnosis including &quot;Superior ventricular
           tachycardia&quot;, &quot;Ventricular tachycardia&quot;, &quot;Atrial flutter&quot;, and &quot;other types: other
           possible arrhythmias&quot;. In the case of uncertainties, a third cardiologist will be
           consulted, blinded for initial diagnoses.

      ECG wave's characteristics: The following variables will be measured as the iECG and 12-lead
      ECG waves' characteristics. Three randomly chosen heartbeats will be considered to measure
      each wave or interval, and the mean of these 3 measurements will be used for statistical
      analysis.
