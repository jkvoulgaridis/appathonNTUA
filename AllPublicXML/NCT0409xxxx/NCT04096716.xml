  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine whether the lymph nodes that drain a brain
      tumor can be detected by imaging after injection of a substance called Tc-99m tilmanocept
      directly into the brain tissue around the tumor. Tc-99m tilmanocept is a radioactive
      substance that is used to find lymph nodes by injecting it and then scanning the body with a
      device that can trace its radioactivity. In this study, the investigators are looking to see
      how long it takes the Tc-99m tilmanocept to travel from the tumor to the lymph nodes. The
      investigators will be using it to map lymph nodes as they relate to specific brain areas.

    <description>The surgeon will inject 0.5 mL of reconstituted Tc-99m tilmanocept using a blunt tipped needle 1 cm into the wall of the resection cavity after completing surgical resection of the tumor
Portable gamma camera imaging will be obtained at 3 ± 2 hour, 6 ± 1 hours (optional), and the following day after injection of Tc-99m tilmanocept.</description>
