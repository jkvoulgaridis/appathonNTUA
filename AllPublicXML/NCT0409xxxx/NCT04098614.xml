  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study purpose is to investigate how an inpatient recovery coaching intervention can
      overcome or mitigate specific risk factors and barriers to initiating and maintaining
      Substance Use Disorder recovery. This study will offer insight into how and why an inpatient
      link to recovery coaching is effective for promoting long-term Substance Use Disorder
      recovery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Substance Use Disorder (SUD) is a prevalent disease that impacts an estimated 24 million
      Americans each year. The life-altering consequences of SUD are both diverse and severe,
      influencing mortality, the workplace, and economics. The goal of this study is to determine
      how specific risk factors of relapse and barriers to recovery, including neurocognitive,
      health, personal, social, financial, and situational barriers, can be overcome or changed
      through a recovery coaching intervention. This work seeks to provide a mechanism to
      demonstrate exactly how and why this potential new model of care (recovery coaching) is
      effective, rather than simply assessing if it can work. To accomplish this aim, the change
      between baseline and 6-month assessments will be assessed. Then, the difference in the change
      between individuals assigned to the current standard of care and patients assigned to
      inpatient recovery will be compared.

    <measure>Change in Social Support</measure>
    <time_frame>intervals of 1, 2, 3, and 6 months post-baseline assessment</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will complete the 5-item Social Support subscale of the Assessment of Recovery Capital (ARC) to assess social support. The difference between the post-baseline and baseline measures will be assessed.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Financial Barriers to SUD Recovery</measure>
    <time_frame>intervals of 1, 2, 3, and 6 months post-baseline assessment</time_frame>
    <description>These barriers include lack of stable housing, transportation, and cost of recovery services. Participants will complete the Housing and Safety Subscale of the Assessment of Recovery Capital (ARC) to assess social support and housing stability. The difference between the post-baseline and baseline measures will be assessed.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Situational Barriers to SUD Recovery</measure>
    <time_frame>intervals of 1, 2, 3, and 6 months post-baseline assessment</time_frame>
    <description>The barriers measured will be (1) long delays for treatment, (2) complexity of navigating the healthcare system, (3) lack of programs in one's community, (4)lack of professional help, (4) and not knowing where to go for help. The response options are binary (yes, they think this is a barrier to their recovery', or 'no, not a barrier to recovery'). Responses to these questions (0=no, 1=yes) will be summed to determine situational barriers. The difference between the post-baseline and baseline measures will be assessed.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Inhibitory Control</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 6 months post-baseline assessment</time_frame>
    <description>Inhibitory control will be assessed behaviorally using a 150 - 200 trial computerized 'Stop Signal' Task, the most common measure of this construct. Stop Signal Reaction Time (SSRT) and Stop trial accuracy will be measured and compared across time points.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Resting State EEG beta poewer</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 6 months post-baseline assessment</time_frame>
    <description>We will measure both absolute and relative powers for beta (14-25 Hz) bands using a 24-channel Soterix Medical EEG.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Striatal Dopaminergic Functioning</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 6 months post-baseline assessment</time_frame>
    <description>Consistent with previous research, we will assess average spontaneous eyeblink rate, a well-validated indirect proxy for available levels of striatal tonic dopamine.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Risk-Taking</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 6 months post-baseline assessment</time_frame>
    <description>Risk-taking will be measured using the 7-item Risk Propensity Scale (Meertens &amp; Lion, 2008). Higher scores on this scale indicate greater risk-taking propensity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Emotion Regulation</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 6 months post-baseline assessment</time_frame>

    <description>Experimental: Recovery Coach Intervention Participants randomized to the intervention arm are linked to a recovery peer coach while they are in the hospital. Recovery peer coaches are provided to the participant by Faces and Voices of Recovery (FAVOR)
- Greenville. Recovery coaches are Certified Peer Support Specialists (CPSS), individuals who have firsthand experience in successful recovery and are trained in using recovery-oriented tools to help peers overcome addiction. FAVOR offers immediate access to a personal coach, a local center, and assistance to off-site intervention and recovery resources in the community. They provide twice weekly contact with participants.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Standard of Care Control</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>No Intervention</arm_group_type>
    <description>Patients in the control condition receive the current standard of care, which entails a treatment referral with a list of addiction recovery facilities, groups, and resources. It is the patient's responsibility to call a treatment facility or group on the list and thus relies on self-referral. The medical team is not permitted to call a facility or group on behalf of the patient. The physician may counsel the patient on the dangers of substance abuse and addiction, but the extent of counseling is variable and dependent on the individual physician.</description>
