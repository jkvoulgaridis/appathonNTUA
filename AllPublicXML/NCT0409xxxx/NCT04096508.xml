  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastrointestinal endoscopy is widely acknowledged as the most useful tool for diagnosing and
      treating gastrointestinal mucosal lesions. It can not only observe the mucosa directly, but
      also obtain tissue biopsy for pathological diagnosis. Although the importance of
      gastrointestinal endoscopy has been well understood, there are still a certain proportion of
      people who are unwilling to undergo it due to the discomfort and anxiety during the
      procedures. Music is multifunctional, which can alleviate people's depression, anxiety and
      other negative emotions as well as help to maintain good mental health. Thus, in this study
      we aim to investigate the role of music listening in gastrointestinal endoscopy in a
      randomized controlled clinical trial, especially for those patients who plan to undergo
      therapeutic endoscopic procedures and try to improve the patients' experience.

      This is a randomized controlled trial to examine the function of music listening in the
      procedures of gastrointestinal endoscopy. It was previously reported that music listening may
      exert beneficial effects for patients who undergo gastrointestinal endoscopy. However, most
      of the studies did not analyze the effects of the specific music type and listening time in
      diagnostic and therapeutic gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures, respectively. This study
      will test whether the specific music type and listening time before gastrointestinal
      endoscopy could improve patients' experience of the procedure in a randomized controlled
      trial. The results may help to optimize the routine clinical practice at present.
