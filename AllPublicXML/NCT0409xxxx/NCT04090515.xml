  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will examine acceptability/feasibility of an existing intervention
      (Project Health) on a sample of Latinx individuals in a primary health care setting. Project
      Health intervention involves making small, participant-identified, gradually increasing
      improvements to their dietary intake and exercise.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of the research study is to investigate the acceptability/feasibility of
      Project Health that addresses dietary intake and exercise to reduce eating disorder symptoms,
      BMI, body dissatisfaction, negative affect, dietary intake, emotional eating, substance use,
      sociocultural pressures to be thin, food cravings, and impulsivity at post-intervention and
      increase levels of cognitive dissonance about engaging in behaviors that produce obesity and
      a sedentary lifestyle. To address this aim, the research will involve a randomized control
      trial that will employ a longitudinal experimental design that will involve: (a)
      phone-screener (pre-screener); (b) baseline appointment consisting of a pre-intervention
      assessment (eligibility); (c) 6-week intervention (randomized to Project Health or Video
      Control); (d) 3-month follow-up.

    <measure>Body Mass Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Assess change from baseline to 3-month follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>Body mass index will be used to assess obesity. For the current study objective height and weight measurements will be obtained from each participant. BMI will be calculated per World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations based on measured weight and height ([weight (pounds)]/[height (inches)2 x 703]) with lower values indicating better outcomes.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Eating Disorder Diagnostic Interview</measure>
    <time_frame>Assess change from baseline to 3-month follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>The Eating Disorder Diagnostic Interview is a 31-item questionnaire used to assess DSM-IV eating disorder symptoms. Items assessing symptoms in the past month at each assessment will be summed to form a composite score with lower scores indicating better outcomes.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Body Esteem Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Assess change from baseline to 3-month follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>The 35-item Body Esteem Scale assesses opinions about body parts and functions. Items are rated on a five-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (Have strong negative feelings) to 5 (Have strong positive feelings). The measure yields three subscales for female respondents [Sexual Attractiveness (possible range = 13 - 65), Weight Concern (possible range = 10 - 50), Physical Condition (possible range = 9 - 45)] and male respondents [Physical Attractiveness (possible range = 11-55), Upper Body Strength (possible range = 9 - 45), Physical Condition (possible range = 13 - 65)]. Scores for each subscale are obtained by summing responses to all items comprising each subscale with higher scores indicating better outcomes.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Positive and Negative Affect Schedule</measure>
    <time_frame>Assess change from baseline to 3-month follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule will assess the extent that participants experience 20 different feelings and emotions (e.g., distressed, excited) on a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (very slightly or not at all) to 5 (extremely). The PANAS subscale negative affectivity will be summed (possible range = 41 - 205) and lower scores indicating better outcomes.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Food Habits Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Assess change from baseline to 3-month follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>The Food Habits Questionnaire is a 49-item, self-report measure of overall dietary quality. Items are rated on a Likert-type scale from 0 (I don't use this food) to 4 (Usually or Always: 3 to 7 times/week). The measure consists of 6 subscales: Grains, Vegetables and Fruits, Dairy Products, Meat and Poultry, Other Foods, and Fats and Oils. For the current study, the Food Habits Questionnaire total score (all items summed) will be used as a measure of overall dietary quality (possible range = 23 - 219) with higher scores indicating better outcomes.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Assess change from baseline to 3-month follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>The Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire will be used to assess emotional eating. Items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (never) to 5 (very often). For the current study, the emotional eating subscale (13 items) will be used as a measure of emotional eating. The 13 items of the subscale are summed and divided by 13 to create a mean score with a range from 1-5. Lower scores on this measure indicate better outcomes.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Substance Use Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Assess change from baseline to 3-month follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>The Substance Use Scale is a 10-item measures that assesses the frequency of use of various substances during the past year. Items used six-point response scales ranging from never to 5-7 times a week for frequency of use, zero to six or more drinks for quantity of alcohol use, and zero to 21 or more cigarettes a day for frequency of cigarette use. Items are averaged to form an overall substance use measure with lower scores indicating better outcomes (possible range 0 - 6).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived Sociocultural Pressure Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Assess change from baseline to 3-month follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>The Perceived Sociocultural Pressure Scale assesses how much pressure participants feel from their family and friends to be thin. For the current study, an expanded, 20-item version of the scale will be used. Because this sample may include males, we will add 8 items assessing perceived pressure for muscularity, as well as 4 items that assess appearance criticism. Items are rated on a Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (None) to 5 (A lot). Responses are averaged to form a scale score (possible range =1= 5) with lower scores indicating better outcomes.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Food Craving Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>Assess change from baseline to 3-month follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>The Food Craving Inventory is a 28-item self-report instrument that is widely used to measure overall food cravings as well as craving for sweet food, high-fat food, starchy food, and fast-food (FCI-FF). Items are rated on a scale from 1 (Never) to 5 (Always/Almost every day) and averaged with lower scores indicating better outcomes (possible range = 1-5).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Impulsivity</measure>
    <time_frame>Assess change from baseline to 3-month follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>The 30-item Barratt Impulsivity Scale assesses impulsivity. Items are measured on a 4-point Likert scale (1 = rarely/never to 4 = almost always/always). The total score be calculated by summing item responses, with scores ranging from 30-120 with lower scores indicating better outcomes.</description>

    <description>Project Health has three aims: 1) encourage participants to explore the costs of obesity, an unhealthy diet, and sedentary behavior and the benefits of physical fitness, a healthy diet, and regular exercise; 2) help participants gradually reduce caloric intake and increase physical activity, such that the participant reaches energy balance (i.e., is not eating more calories than they need); and 3) reduce attitudinal and behavioral risk factors for eating disorders and obesity. The intervention will be administered in Spanish.</description>
