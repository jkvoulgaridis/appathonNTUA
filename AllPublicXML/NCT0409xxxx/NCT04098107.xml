  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to collect motion-capture data on movements common to
      baseball play in order to develop an algorithm for a wearable device for the prevention and
      rehabilitation of sports-related overuse injuries. Secondary objectives include evaluating
      the feasibility of wearing the throwing device during simulated baseball play.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With the rise in competitive sports participation in pediatric and adolescent populations,
      there has also been an increase in overuse injuries. Current methods of overuse injury
      prevention, such as pitch-counting, fail to account for differing techniques or effort and
      often ignore the elevated risk for children participating in two or more sports emphasizing
      the same body part. This wearable device seeks to more accurately monitor overuse to prevent
      and aid rehabilitation of overuse injuries.

      Subjects will be asked to fill out a short survey about their athletic activities. They will
      wear a prototype of a minimal risk throwing device during simulated baseball play in a sports
      medicine session or at the Human Motion Laboratory. Various motion data from the device and
      from the Motion Lab analysis will be collected to create and refine an algorithm to quantify
      workload and throwing movements.

      The primary endpoint of this study is to quantify motion capture data on movements common to
      baseball play. The secondary endpoints include quantifying injury associated with different
      baseball movement using the proposed system, development of algorithms to quantify workloads
      associated with injury during common baseball movements and validation of basic device
      measurements (Pilot Phase).

    <description>During Phase 1, subjects that have been recruited, consented, and enrolled will come to the biomechanics laboratory for throwing performance housed at the University of Pennsylvania (Human Motion Laboratory) on the day of their appointment. Subjects will be asked to wear the prototype device during a simulated baseball game (approximately 30-45 pitches), and then will perform a set of other baseball-specific movements while fitted with infrared markers for throwing analysis. This data will be used to develop and refine the algorithm for the prototype.</description>

    <description>The Innovative Design Labs ( IDL) PhySens will be used to monitor the physical motions of subjects during standard sports-related actions (e.g. throwing a baseball). For this test, the PhySens Carrier will be attached via clothing rivets to a fabric sleeve or strap made of compliant materials commonly used in clothing and wearable products (e.g. nylon, spandex, neoprene).</description>
