  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ProActive registry is a longitudinal, multi-center study with a prospective arm observing
      clinical care for patients receiving physician ordered Prospera, an allograft rejection test,
      and a historical control arm collecting data on cases at the same sites whose kidney
      allograft rejection status was managed with Serum Creatinine SCr/estimated Glomerular
      Filtration Rate eGFR. This registry will compare patient management and outcomes in patients
      who receive Prospera (Prospera arm) to the outcomes of the historical control group (control
      arm) to determine Prospera's clinical utility. High-risk subjects defined as having a
      biopsy-demonstrated rejection event or at least one pre-existing Donor Specific Antibody DSA
      with total Mean Fluorescent Intensity MFI&gt;3000 or a calculated Panel Reactive Antibodies
      cPRA&gt;70% will be followed for an additional period up to 24 months in both the Prospera arm
      and historical control arm.

      The primary objective is to differentiate the clinical utility of Prospera testing from the
      use of creatinine testing as measured by the proportion of positive biopsies in post renal
      allograft patients.

      Secondary objectives include:

        -  To observe the performance of the Prospera assay in detecting AR (repeated validation)

        -  To evaluate whether Prospera can detect AR earlier and more often than SCr

        -  To determine whether use of Prospera will significant decrease the overall number of
           surveillance biopsies when compared to routine SCr surveillance

    <description>The proportion of clinically indicated biopsies that show Active Rejection (AR) will be measured in the Prospera arm and the control arm. Specifically, the proportion of clinically indicated biopsies showing AR in individuals with a positive donor derived-cell free DNA dd-cfDNA test at the time of Bx in the test arm, where Prospera has been integrated into the care paradigm, will be compared against the proportion of clinically indicated biopsies showing AR in the control arm.</description>

    <description>Graft function in the Prospera arm and control arm will be measured. This will be assessed by examining the average eGFR score (as calculated using serum creatinine Chronic Kidney Disease-EPIdemiology collaboration CKD_EPI equation) at year three in the Prospera arm compared to the average eGFR score determined at year three in the historical control arm.</description>

    <description>The performance of Prospera to detect AR will be evaluated.

Adult patients who have received a kidney allograft from a genetically different donor within 60 days and who have been selected by their healthcare provider to receive Prospera dd-cfDNA testing according to their regular interval testing schedule as part of their clinical care will have medical records pertaining to their kidney rejection status collected at each study visit.</description>

      There are two arms to this study: A prospective arm and a historical control (retrospective
      arm).

      Each participant in the Prospective arm will have received the commercially available
      Prospera test.

      Subjects prospectively enrolled and whom consent to &quot;Optional future Research&quot; may have
      bio-specimens stored for future research.

      The historical arm (retrospective cohort) will not have any bio-specimens collected or
      stored.

        Approximately 3,000 adult renal allograft participants will be enrolled in this study, and
        data will be collected from a de-identified cohort of approximately 1,000 historical
        control patients who had a renal allograft.
