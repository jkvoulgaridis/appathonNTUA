  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to determine the effect of multiple once daily
      administrations of enzalutamide on the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of digoxin
      (P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate) and rosuvastatin (breast cancer resistant protein (BCRP)
      substrate) in participants with prostate cancer.

      This study will also evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple once daily
      administrations of enzalutamide alone and in combination with a single dose of digoxin (P-gp
      substrate) and rosuvastatin (BCRP substrate) in participants with prostate cancer, as well,
      assess the pharmacokinetics of enzalutamide and its active metabolite.

      Screening and enrollment are temporaily on hold due to COVID-19. Eligible participants will
      be admitted to the clinical unit on day -1. Participants may be discharged from the clinical
      unit on day 2 on the condition that all required assessments have been performed and that
      there are no medical reasons for a longer stay in the clinical unit and participants are able
      and willing to return to the clinical unit on days 3 to 8 for daily pharmacokinetic sampling.
      Or, participants may choose to remain in the clinical unit up to the 168 hour postdose (day
      8) pharmacokinetic sample collection.

      Participants will return to the clinical unit on day 35 for an ambulant visit and will be
      admitted to the clinical unit on day 63. Participants may be discharged from the clinical
      unit on day 65 on the condition that all required assessments have been performed and that
      there are no medical reasons for a longer stay in the clinical unit and participants are able
      and willing to return to the clinical unit on days 66 to 71 for daily pharmacokinetic
      sampling. Or, participants may choose to remain in the clinical unit up to the 168 hour
      postdose (day 71) pharmacokinetic sample collection.

      From day 72 onwards, participants experiencing clinical benefit (determined by the
      investigator in consultation with the physician responsible for treating the participants'
      prostate cancer) may roll over into an open label, single arm extension study. Only
      participants who will be enrolled into the extension study will continue to receive
      enzalutamide until any discontinuation criterion occurs per the extension study protocol.

    <description>Adverse events (AEs) will be coded using medical dictionary for regulatory activities (MedDRA).
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered an Investigational Product (IP), and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of IP whether or not considered related to the IP.
An AE is considered &quot;serious&quot; if the event: results in death; is life-threatening; results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions; results in congenital anomaly or birth defect; requires inpatient hospitalization (except for planned procedures)or leads to prolongation of hospitalization (except if prolongation of planned hospitalization is not caused by an AE); or other medically important events.</description>
