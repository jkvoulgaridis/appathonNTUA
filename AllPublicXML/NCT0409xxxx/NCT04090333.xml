  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project will be conducted to investigate the hormonal homeostasis in men and women, with
      a special emphasis on sex hormones in men and AMH level in women, before and after withdrawal
      of the overused analgesics among MOH patients. Additionally, a more broad endocrine profile
      will be explored before and after withdrawal.

      It is hypothesized that patients with MOH have disturbed hormone levels, which is normalized
      after withdrawal of the medication-overuse.
