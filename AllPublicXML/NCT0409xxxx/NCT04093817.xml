    <textblock>
      The aim of this research is to know the incidence of arrhythmias in on vs. off pump CABG and
      to know their relations to the patient's morbidity and mortality, hospital stay and hospital
      costs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      On pump vs. off pump CABG has been a topic of debate for many years regarding the benefits
      and the risks of each technique .Off pump CABG began 30 years ago. Its promotion was based on
      its potential benefits over some of the limitation of traditional on pump CABG. It avoids the
      trauma of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and minimizing aortic manipulation and reducing length
      of hospital stay and morbidity.

      There is a criticism regarding completence of revascularization in off pump vs. on pump CABG,
      this is no longer valid in the current era as technology to safely perform multi vessel off
      pump has improved tremendously over the past decade.

      One of the debates between these two techniques was the incidence of arrhythmias in and after
      the operation and its relation to morbidity and mortality at the operation and hospital stay
      after the operation.

      As known atrial fibrillation (AF) is still the most common arrhythmia that occur after CABG
      and although in some studies it has been considered a benign and self-limiting complication,
      some suggest serious morbidity and mortality from this complication, it is said that it
      affects more than 40% of patients underwent CABG. Atrial fibrillation (AF) may lead to
      thromboembolic complications, additional pharmacotherapy, longer hospital stay, increase
      cost, anxiety and stroke.

      Most AF post CABG are found in the second to third post-operative day. SO, on this study the
      investigators focus one the incidence of arrhythmias, especially AF in those two techniques
      and their relations to patients' morbidity and mortality.
