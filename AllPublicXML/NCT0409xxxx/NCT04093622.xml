    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess long-term side effects from subjects who receive a Fate
      Therapeutics genetically modified NK cell product. Subjects who previously took part in a
      Fate Therapeutics study and received genetically changed NK cells will take part in this
      long-term follow-up study. Subjects will join this study once they complete the parent
      interventional study. No additional study drug will be given, but subjects can receive other
      therapies for their cancer while they are being followed for long term safety in this study.

      For a period of 15 years starting from the last administration of Fate Therapeutics
      genetically modified NK cell product, subjects will be assessed for long-term safety and
      survival through questionnaires and blood tests.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-therapeutic, multi-center, long-term follow-up (LTFU) study of subjects who
      received a Fate Therapeutics NK cell product that has been modified by lentivirus-mediated
      genetically engineering. The period of follow-up is 15 years after the administration of the
      NK cell product.

      The study involves up to 15 years post-infusion monitoring of subjects who have been exposed
      to lentivirus-mediated gene transfer in Fate Therapeutics clinical studies. Upon withdrawal
      or completion of the parent interventional study, the study site will contact the
      subject/healthcare provider/legal guardian annually.
