  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Personalizing surgical care is of enormous clinical relevance, when considering the number of
      patients undergoing surgery in Switzerland every year. Currently, personalization is based on
      underlying or coexisting disease or alterations of laboratory values, but there is no
      accepted biological test available that may predict success or failure of surgery. Surgical
      site infections are the most common form of hospital-acquired infections. While the relevance
      of bacteria, antibiotics and intensive care support is well accepted, the impact of the
      individual host response remains poorly understood. The Investigators hypothesize that
      postoperative alterations of the metabolome allow identification of predictors of surgical
      complications in general, and surgical site infections in particular.

      The investigators will conduct a prospective cohort study aiming to identify the metabolic
      and genetic signature that is associated with surgical site infections. Secondary aims and
      outcomes include the influence of metabolome on response to anesthetic drugs and acute and
      chronic pain, surgery- and anesthesia-factors related to short- and long-term oncological
      outcome, metabolic response effect on infectious complications and rejection after
      transplantation, bacteria-specific immune responses to major surgery after 2-4 weeks after
      surgery, metabolomics and macrobiotic markers for postoperative ileus or anastomotic leakage,
      and the effect of the presence of multidrug resistant bacteria on surgical outcome. All
      patients undergoing surgery in the investigators' clinic and who gave informed consent will
      be included. A blood sample will be taken before surgery, on the first postoperative day and
      after 3-8 weeks. A Urine sample will be taken after surgery and after 3-8 weeks. Sink and
      rectal swabs will be acquired before surgery. The samples will be stored in a Biobank.
      Additionally, all data routinely captured during the treatment of the patient from the
      different data collection systems in use in the investigators' hospital will be coded and
      centralized in a single, cohort database
