    <textblock>
      Prospective randomized multicenter trial of about 100 subjects enrolled in 3-5 centers.
      Patients will be randomized to two groups in equal proportion (50 in each). To precise the
      function of this device on reducing technical difficulties and conquering learning curves, it
      is required that the doctor should be able to independently do echo-guided percutaneous
      interventions and his cases should be more than 20 but less than 100. Experimental group is
      allocated to use novel interventional guidewire for echocardiography guided percutaneous
      interventions for ASD, control group will be treated by cook lunderquist guidewire. If
      echo-guided procedure does not work well, the procedure will be immediately replaced by
      conventional procedure guided by radiology. To evaluate the effectiveness and safety
      comprehensively, variables are defined as success rate, duration of procedure, times of
      arrhythmia, times of misguided to tricuspid valve, cardiac perforation, cardiac tamponed,
      complications in peripheral vessels etc.

      1. This is a prospective blinded randomized multicenter comparison clinical trial followed
           the design of superiority trial to compare the effectiveness and safety of the guidewire
           for echo-guided interventions designed by Hangzhou Dexin Medical Technological Company
           with other similar products.

        2. This trial will enroll about 100 subjects from 3-5 centers. Patients will be randomized
           to two groups in equal proportion (50 in each). Proposal recruiting period is 18 months
           and follow-up will be performed for 30 days.

    <description>The primary outcome will be the success rate, which is defined by the principles below:
guidewire can successfully access to left atrium through ASD.
sheath can successfully access to left atrium guided by guidewire and not fall into right atrium after guidewire pullout.
guidewire can be successfully pulled out. The secondary outcome will be duration of procedure, times of arrhythmia, times of misguided to tricuspid valve, cardiac perforation, cardiac tamponed, complications in peripheral vessels.</description>
