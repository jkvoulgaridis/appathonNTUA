  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients in Wong Siu Ching Clinic and Tai Po Clinic who are found to have ear wax after
      physical examination will have ear syringing done, without pre-ear oil application. On the
      other hand, patients in Fanling Family Medicine Centre with ear wax will be given ear oil one
      week before performing ear syringing. We will compare the respective success rates of ear
      syringing from these 2 groups, the mean numbers of syringing attempts , as well as any
      complications such as ear canal abrasion, ear drum perforation, any pain or vertigo reported
      by patients. For those cases who fail ear syringing , olive oil will be prescribe and arrange
      1 week follow up for ear syringing .

    <description>For both groups the mean number of syringing attempts (and 95% confidence interval) is calculated and compared by testing the difference between the means, using a t test for independent samples. For patients with persistent earwax in both ears , the mean number of syringing attempts needed for both ears in one patient is used for the calculations . All ears in which the wax is still persistent after another 10 syringing attempts are given a value of 11 in the calculations . Data for this study is analyzed using SPSS version 26 .</description>
