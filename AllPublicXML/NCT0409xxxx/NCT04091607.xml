  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if music therapy during interventional lumbar
      medial branch blocks for chronic lower back pain will lower pain scores and anxiety levels,
      while increasing patient desire for repeat procedure as well as patient satisfaction.

      Subjects will be put into 1 of 2 groups, Music or the Control Group (no music). The music
      group will listen to patient's preferred music on Pandora station broadcast using Headphones
      or Wireless Earbuds with Tablet or Computer. Hearing impaired patients will have an option of
      non-earbud headphones. . Earbuds or headphones will be used regardless of music therapy
      playing. . The control group will be provided earbuds or alternative headphone as well,
      however, with no music. The sound environment will be standardized for procedure by closing
      procedure room door and minimizing extraneous sounds (i.e. from equipment, alarms, etc.,).
