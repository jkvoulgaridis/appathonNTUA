  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine how folate supplementation affects both serum and red blood cell
      folate status in females ages 18 years and older. Additionally, this study will determine the
      effect of folate supplementation on mood, cognition, sleep patterns, and alcohol, nicotine,
      and other drug use. This study will fill a crucial gap in understanding how folate status
      affects a variety of health behaviors in order to better inform public health practice and
      prevention.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preliminary studies conducted by the investigator's team indicate that 95.7% of previous
      participants (all alcohol consuming, ages 14-24), were below the threshold for red blood cell
      (RBC) folate status for women of childbearing potential. Understanding how the interaction of
      behaviors (alcohol use, nutrient supplementation, diet) contribute to sub-optimal folate
      status is critical to developing and expanding upon evidence-based FASD prevention programs.
      Notably, how nutrient supplementation might improve overall folate status in a group with
      poor folate status and other behaviors that confound the absorption of folate. Because the
      participants do not view themselves as being at risk for unwanted pregnancy, their motivation
      to take a supplement for a future pregnancy is very low. This team seeks to collect data on
      how folate supplementation might improve individually measured outcomes, like cognition and
      mood, so that interventions might be developed focusing on these individual outcomes.

      After becoming aware of the study, prospective participants will undergo a screening
      questionnaire for inclusion/exclusion criteria. Once the participant meets the inclusion
      criteria, the study will be fully explained and written informed consent will be handed out.
      Participants will be randomized in a single-blind manner (participant) in a 1:1 ratio to the
      Methyl Folate supplement (1,000 mcg, once daily) or placebo (once daily).

    <intervention_model_description>Participants will be randomly assigned to a condition that receives a vitamin supplement (methyl folate), or a placebo group. Both the condition and placebo group will receive the same size pill once daily for 15 days and the pills will look the same. The condition group will receive a gel capsule containing the methyl folate supplement and a microcrystalline cellulose fiber. The placebo group will receive the same size gel capsule containing only the microcrystalline cellulose filler. The methyl folate supplement is the upper tolerable limit set by the Institute of Medicine. Taking more that the upper limit of 1000 mcg of methyl folate may be harmful; for this reason, it is important to discontinue vitamin use while enrolled in the study. Participants assigned to both the condition and placebo groups will be directly observed taking the pill during each daily appointment.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Red blood cell folate status</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Red blood cell folate status will be analyzed through dried blood spot samples collected on Arrayit blood cards, which use linear flow chromatography to separate whole blood into erythrocyte and serum. Red blood cell folate values represent a longer-term reduction in folate consumption or increases in folate excretion. Overturn of red blood cells occurs every 4 months, therefore, red blood cell folate status will only be assessed at baseline. The WHO-recommended cutoff of &lt;340 nmol/L will be used to assess low red blood cell folate status.</description>
