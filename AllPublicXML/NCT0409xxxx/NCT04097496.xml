  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ACT OUT! Trial is designed as a proof-of-concept, cluster, randomized, superiority trial
      with two parallel groups. Although the unit of measurement is student, the unit of
      randomization is classroom, stratified by school. For each grade, an even number of
      classrooms will be selected from each school; half of the selected classrooms will be
      randomly assigned to intervention arm, whereas the other half will be assigned to control
      arm. This way, sociodemographic and school-level factors will be made approximately
      comparable between intervention and control arms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be an assessment of the ACT OUT! Social Issue Theater program as a universal
      social and emotional learning (SEL) intervention targeting social-emotional competence (SEC)
      and bullying in elementary, middle, and high school students. ACT OUT! is an existing program
      that has been performed in various forms by professionally-trained members of an acting
      ensemble since 1995. The present iteration consists of three distinct scenarios per grade
      range (elementary, middle, and high) that present age-appropriate improvisational drama
      illustrating issues related to SEL and bullying, including facilitated discussion with the
      actors, who remain in character. The program lasts approximately one hour (scenario
      descriptions and a fidelity checklist for SEL/bullying elements will be made available as
      supplemental files).

      SEL curricula typically consist of manualized and/or structured classroom or multicomponent
      programs taking place over time; the median number of sessions within an SEL program in a
      meta-analysis of 213 SEL studies was 24. At one hour in duration, ACT OUT! is substantially
      shorter and is performed by professional actors - meeting the goal of reduced school resource
      costs for SEL programming, but potentially raising concerns about whether such a dose could
      reasonably be expected to produce an effect. Underlying this study is a supposition that
      unique properties of a dramatic performance specifically may trigger SEL responses. In
      Aristotle's Poetics, which is the first known work on dramatic theory, it is written that a
      dramatic tragedy (in the Aristotelian sense) is designed to arouse certain feelings,
      &quot;wherewith to accomplish catharsis ofâ€¦ emotions.&quot; This precise mechanism underlies the
      development of psychodrama as a psychotherapeutic intervention, as combined action and
      verbalization can present a situation &quot;freed from the restricting stereotyped residues of
      past experience.&quot; Recent studies and meta-analyses have examined psychodrama as a means of
      prevention and/or behavior change with generally positive findings. Researchers have also
      found that youth report that they enjoy psychodramatic elements as part of a larger
      prevention curriculum. However, no studies have measured any outcomes of a psychodramatic SEL
      experience.

      This will be the first study to examine whether a short dose of interactive psychodrama can
      affect SEC metrics and bullying experiences in schoolchildren. In responding to recent
      criticism of SEL studies, the investigators have chosen to utilize the SPIRIT 2013 clinical
      trial guidelines in developing this protocol to promote rigor, reproducibility, and
      transparency.

    <masking_description>Because of the nature of the ACT OUT! trial, blinding of the trial participants, school officials, and members of Claude McNeal Productions is not possible. Further, since data management will occur via the primary research team, group identity cannot realistically be masked. However, we have included two statistical consultants - one internal to the university and one external to the university - who will be asked to verify all analyses using masked group assignment.</masking_description>

    <description>Computed from the Delaware Social Emotional Competency Scale (DSECS-S). The score is averaged from Likert-type data (e.g., one overall score will be computed from 12 questions). The score ranges from '1' to '4' - some items will be reverse coded, so that a '4' is consistently the optimal score across questions and for the total scale value.</description>

    <description>Social awareness, emotion regulation, relationship skills, and responsible decision-making as measured via 4 sub-scales of the Washoe County School District Social-Emotional Competency Assessment. For each sub-scale, the score is averaged from Likert-type data (e.g., one overall score will be computed from 3-5 questions). The score ranges from '1' to '4' - a '4' is consistently the optimal score across questions and for the total scale value.</description>

    <description>Subjective receptivity to the intervention (e.g., enjoyment) as measured by response items from Dent et al. (1998). This scale *does not* have a specific name. It measures the following characteristics of receptivity to the intervention: whether it was enjoyable, interesting, a waste of time, boring, understandable, difficult to understand, believable, important, and helpful. Each item is measured using a Likert-type scale. The score ranges from '1' to '4' - some items will be reverse coded, so that a '4' is consistently the optimal score across questions and for the total scale value.</description>

    <description>Eligible classrooms will be randomized to attend a 1-hour ACT OUT! interactive, semi-improvisational psychodrama performance. The ACT OUT! intervention is an established theater program (https://www.claudemcnealproductions.com/act-out-ensemble/). The ACT OUT! production will include three to five vignettes paired with moderated discussions between the audience and the actors, the latter who will remain partly in character for the duration of the intervention. Vignettes will be different for each grade level included in the study (4th, 7th, and 10th). Public documentation of the guidelines for the ACT OUT! intervention will be made available as a supplemental file attached to the primary outcomes paper for the study.</description>
