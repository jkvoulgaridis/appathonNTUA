  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to learn whether services to the caregiver to provide emotional,
      instrumental and social support can improve quality of life and other outcomes. The
      Caregiver-Support program provides services that are not usually available to caregivers of
      persons with heart failure and other chronic conditions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Family caregivers who care for older adults living with multiple chronic conditions,
      including heart failure (HF), provide substantial cost savings to the US healthcare system.
      While caregiving can be meaningful and rewarding, extensive research also demonstrates high
      rates of chronic disease, fatigue and physiologic measures such as stress hormones among
      caregivers. Family caregivers are often left juggling caregivers' loved one's healthcare as
      well as caregivers' own. Unmet needs have been identified including increased stress,
      financial strain and social isolation, but interventions to address these needs in HF
      caregivers have had mixed results. Due to the limited impact of many caregiver interventions,
      experts have called for a greater understanding of the dynamic and contextual factors of
      family caregiving including resources, needs and social support with an increased focus on
      individualization of interventions for high-risk caregivers to improve outcomes.Following a
      mixed methods study to better understand these contextual factors and to address this gap
      between the evidence and uptake of proven strategies by caregivers, the study team has
      developed a resilience-promoting intervention to improve quality of life for family
      caregivers of individuals with multiple chronic conditions, including HF, Caregiver-Support.
      Caregiver-Support will help caregivers articulate statements of purpose in life, set goals to
      address fatigue and caregiver burden, provide instrumental support through a benefits check
      up and promote identification and increased connection with the caregiver's social network.

      The first phase of the study will be an open label pilot (N=5) followed by a single-masked,
      two-group, randomized trial (N=40) to test the feasibility and gauge an initial effect size
      of the intervention. Participants will be visited by study staff in participants' homes for
      all data collection and intervention visits. Participants will be randomized to receive
      either the immediate intervention group or the waitlist control group. In the waitlist
      control group, participants will receive usual care for the first 16 weeks (which is limited
      to printed materials provided in the clinic) and then begin the intervention.

      The intervention will consist of 5 in-home sessions with a nurse interventionist. Each
      participant will receive each intervention component but interventionists will systematically
      tailor content to the participants' goals based on protocols. All participants will be
      reassessed at 16 weeks (in person) and 32 weeks (by phone) by a research assistant (RA)
      masked to treatment condition. The primary outcome will be improvement in quality of life
      between baseline and 16 weeks. Other endpoints include group differences in fatigue,
      caregiver burden, self-reported and physiological measures of resilience up through 32 weeks
      after the intervention. The investigators will also examine the acceptability of the
      intervention using intervention compliance and participant satisfaction data.

    <measure>Change in Quality of Life as assessed by the Short Form Health Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 16 weeks and 32 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Short Form Health Survey (36 items) measures self-rated quality of life using 8 sub-scales. Items are scored on a 0-100 range, with total scores averaged for each subscale. The eight domains are also averaged to create an overall score from 0-100. Higher scores indicate a more favorable health state.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Fatigue as assessed by the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 16 weeks and 32 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PROMIS 7-item fatigue measure has a score range from 0-35 with higher scores indicating higher levels of fatigue.</description>

    <measure>Change in Caregiver Burden as assessed by the Oberst Caregiving Burden Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 16 weeks and 32 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will use the task difficulty and time caring subscales of the Oberst Caregiving Burden Scale, which include 15 likert scale items. Scores range from 15-75. Higher scores indicate greater task difficulty and more time spent on each task, higher burden.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Caregiver Burden as assessed by the Zarit Caregiver Burden Interview (ZBI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 16 weeks and 32 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The ZBI is a 12 item measure with higher scores representing higher feelings of burden; the range of summed scores is 0-48.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Interleukin 6 (ng/mL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 16 weeks and 32 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will wear a non-occlusive sweatpatch to collect interleukin 6. Higher levels of interleukin 6 suggest increased activation of inflammatory response and decreased resilience to stress.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Interleukin 10 (pg/ml)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 16 weeks and 32 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will wear a non-occlusive sweatpatch to collect interleukin 10. Higher levels of interleukin 10 suggest increased activation of the anti-inflammatory response and increased resilience to stress.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in resilience to stress as assessed by Heart Rate Variability</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 16 weeks and 32 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will touch a finger pad for 2-5 minutes to obtain heart rate variability. Heart rate variability is assessed through multiple calculations including: percentage of pairs of adjacent N-N intervals differing by more than 50 milliseconds (pNN50), high-frequency power (HF power), and low frequency to high frequency (LF/HF) ratio. Higher pNN50, HF power and LF/HF ratio levels suggest increased resilience to stress.</description>
