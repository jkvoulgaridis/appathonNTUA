      Coronary stents are the default devices for the treatment of coronary artery disease in
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) according to existing guidelines. However,
      thrombosis and restenosis are still the main limitations of current permanent metallic
      stents. In contrast to Bare Metal Stents (BMSs), Drug Eluting Stents (DESs) have a reduced
      restenosis rate due to the presence of antiproliferative agents in the coating layer of the
      stent surface and reduced rate of repeat revascularisation. However, late and very late stent
      thrombosis remains the limitation of DES in spite of prolonged dual antiplatelet therapy.
      Bioabsorbable scaffolds have been introduced to overcome limitations of permanent metallic
      stents.

      The aim of this observational retrospective study is to investigate the clinical performance
      and long-term safety of scaffold in a real world setting.

      Institution involved in the present registry are high volume PCI centers. Operators have
      experience in PCI with bioresorbable scaffolds technology

      The study organization is based on:

      DATA SAFETY MONITORING BOARD (DSMB) All adverse events will be reported to the DSMB and
      reviewed on an on-going basis throughout the subject enrolment and follow-up period to ensure
      the safety of subjects enrolled in this study. In case of clinical events, coronary artery
      angiographies and percutaneous coronary interventions was reviewed by an independent
      core-lab.
