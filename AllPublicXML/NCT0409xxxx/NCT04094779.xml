  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-drug therapies (NDT) constitute a strong axis of the person with dementia behaviour
      management. Among these NDT, the flash activities constitute a mode of intervention to
      prevent and control the expression of the most disruptive behavior. These are short-term
      activities with the objective of decreasing the behavioural disorders intensity in less than
      15 minutes.

      The aim of this pilot study is to test the effect of a flash activity &quot;breath of fresh air&quot;
      compared to the usual relational care on the short-term decrease (15 min.) of the agitation
      in hospitalized dementia patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The &quot;breath of fresh air&quot; flash strategy is to offer the patient the possibility to go out of
      the medical unity and walking outdoor.

      When the caregiver identify a level of agitation greater or equal to two on the gravity score
      and greater or equal to two on the impact score with the NPI test (The Neuropsychiatric
      Inventory Test), the caregiver let the patient wandering in the outside lanes of the hospital
      and encourage him to us his senses. For example, the sight could be stimulated by looking at
      a bird.

      This variation of sensory stimulations enable a temporo-sensory break on the crisis, allowing
      the patient to turn his attention from the crisis context to another stimulation.
