    <textblock>
      To evaluate the hematological responses based on the response assessment criteria defined in
      this study (the 531-004 response assessment criteria) when AMG531 is subcutaneously
      (SC)-administered with ciclosporin A (CsA) therapy for 6 months in patients with aplastic
      anemia (AA) who were previously untreated with immunosuppressive therapy.
