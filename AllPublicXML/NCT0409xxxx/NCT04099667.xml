    <textblock>
      Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the safety and efficacy of
      a single-dose of MYOBLOC over a 1-year duration in adult subjects with lower limb monoplegia
      or hemiplegia spasticity due to stroke or TBI, followed by an open-label extension safety
      study of multiple doses. The primary goal is to assess efficacy of MYOBLOC versus placebo in
      the treatment of adult lower limb spasticity. The secondary goals are: to establish a safe
      and efficacious dose of MYOBLOC (administered intramuscularly as a single total dose, to
      assess the duration of therapeutic response of MYOBLOC after a single administration, and to
      evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of MYOBLOC after multiple administrations at
      13-week intervals over a minimum duration of 1 year.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female, 18 to 80 years of age (inclusive).

          2. Lower limb spasticity due to stroke or traumatic brain injury (TBI) that occurred at
             least 6 months prior to study. May have lower limb monoplegia or hemiplegia.

          3. Able to walk (with or without the use of a walking assistive device).

          4. Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) score greater than or equal to 2 in the ankle plantar
             flexors of the affected lower limb at screening and at baseline.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Quadriplegia/tetraplegia, lower limb diplegia or triplegia.

          2. Uncontrolled epilepsy with a seizure(s) within the last year.

          3. Neuromuscular disorders including, but not limited to, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
             (ALS), primary lateral sclerosis (PLS), multiple sclerosis (MS), myasthenia gravis, or
             muscular dystrophy.

          4. History of major joint contracture(s), in which, based on Investigator assessment, the
             contracture(s) significantly contributes to joint immobility in the target limb.

          5. Known hypersensitivity to botulinum toxins type A or B or to any MYOBLOC solution
             components.

          6. Application of an ankle-foot orthosis (AFO) within 30 days before screening. Subjects
             regularly using an AFO 30 days or more before screening must be willing to maintain
             use of the AFO through Week 4 of the DBP of the study.

          7. Prior botulinum toxin type A (BoNT/A) or B (BoNT/B) treatment in the lower limb
             identified for treatment within 24 weeks before screening. Prior BoNT/A or BoNT/B
             treatment in areas other than the target limb is not exclusionary but must have
             occurred at least 12 weeks before screening. Prior toxin exposure must have been
             well-tolerated and without any significant long-term side effects in the case of
             repeated prior exposure.

          8. Severe dysphagia (i.e., inability to swallow liquids, solids, or both without choking
             or without medical intervention), or dysphagia with a history of aspiration pneumonia,
             within 6 months before screening.

          9. Obstructive pulmonary disease with forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1)/forced
             vital capacity (FVC) &lt;70%.

         10. Slow vital capacity &lt;60% of predicted.
