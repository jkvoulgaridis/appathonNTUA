  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tricuspid regurgitation is common in patients with heart valve disease, both flexible band
      and rigid ring annuloplasty can correct this anomaly. However, there is no data to address
      which one can bring more benefits to these patients with combined heart valve disease. This
      study aims to prospectively compare the efficacy and long term outcomes of flexible band
      versus rigid ring annuloplasty for the correction of tricuspid regurgitation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Subject must be 18 years and 80 years at time of consent and must not be a member
             of a vulnerable population.

          -  2. Subject or a legally authorized representative (where allowed per local
             regulations) must provide written informed consent prior to any trial related
             procedure.

          -  3. Subjects with moderate or greater tricuspid regurgitation determined by the
             assessment of a qualifying transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) and/or transesophageal
             echocardiogram (TEE).

          -  4. Subjects with moderate tricuspid regurgitation will only be included in the trial
             if moderate tricuspid regurgitation is accompanied by a tricuspid annular diameter of
             ≥ 40mm as measured by echocardiography.

          -  5. Isolated functional symptomatic tricuspid regurgitation of moderate to severe or
             greater, with annular dilatation of ≥ 40mm;

          -  6. Requirement for concomitant left heart valve surgery;

          -  7. Requirement for concomitant coronary artery surgery;

          -  8. Requirement for concomitant atrial fibrillation surgery;

          -  9. Available and able to return to the study site for post-procedural follow-up
             examination;

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Patient unable or unwilling to provide informed consent;

          -  2. Subjects with mild tricuspid regurgitation;

          -  3. Emergency surgery;

          -  4. Prior tricuspid valve leaflet surgery or any currently implanted prosthetic
             tricuspid valve, or any prior transcatheter tricuspid valve procedure;

          -  5. Subjects with percutaneous coronary intervention within prior 30 days prior to
             enrollment;

          -  6. Subjects with presence of any known life threatening (non-cardiac major or
             progressive disease), non-cardiac disease that will limit the subject's life
             expectancy to less than one year;

          -  7. Subjects with permanent or temporary pacemaker implantation;

          -  8. Subjects with severe, irreversible pulmonary hypertension in the judgment of the
             investigator;

          -  9. History of mitral/tricuspid endocarditis within the last 12 months;

          -  10. Subjects with contraindication or known allergy to device's components, aspirin,
             anti-coagulation therapy or contrast media that cannot be adequately premeditated;
