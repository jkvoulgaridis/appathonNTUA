      This study will test whether mindfulness meditation (MM) improves sympathetic function in
      chronic kidney disease (CKD) and whether transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS)
      optimizes the sympatho-inhibitory effects of mindfulness meditation (MM) and restores
      autonomic balance in CKD patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ~30 million people in the US have chronic kidney disease (CKD) and are at 5-15 fold greater
      risk of cardiovascular (CV) disease and mortality. A major factor contributing to increased
      CV risk in these patients is chronic elevation of sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity.
      New therapeutic strategies to safely and effectively ameliorate SNS over-activity are of
      paramount importance to improve clinical outcomes in this highly prevalent and high-risk
      patient population.

      This study will test whether mindfulness meditation (MM) improves sympathetic function in
      chronic kidney disease (CKD) and whether transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS)
      optimizes the sympatho-inhibitory effects of mindfulness meditation (MM) and restores
      autonomic balance in CKD patients.

    <measure>Change in mean Muscle Sympathetic Nerve Activity (MSNA) burst frequency (BF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Multiunit postganglionic sympathetic nerve activity is recorded from a tungsten microelectrode inserted into the peroneal nerve with a reference microelectrode inserted in close proximity. Efferent nerve signals are amplified, filtered, rectified and integrated (time constant 0.1 s) to obtain a mean voltage display of MSNA. MSNA bursts are automatically detected using the following criteria: burst-to-noise ratio of 3:1 within a 0.5-s search window, with an average latency of 1.2-1.3 s in burst occurrence from the previous R-wave. MSNA is expressed as burst frequency (BF, bursts/min).</description>

    <measure>Change in baroreflex sensitivity (BRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Afferent sympathetic baroreflex input travels to the brainstem via the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves and integrate with brainstem centers that regulate efferent SNS (sympathetic BRS) and parasympathetic (cardiovagal BRS) outflow. BRS is defined as the change in interbeat interval (IBI) in milliseconds per unit change in BP. For example, when the BP rises by 10 mmHg and IBI increases by 100 ms, BRS would be 100/10 = 10 ms/mmHg.</description>

    <description>Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) is delivered in 8 weekly 2.5-hour group sessions and one day-long retreat that occurs after the 6th session. MBSR teaches to become more aware of thoughts, feelings, and sensations, and to skillfully respond to stressors. Each of the sessions includes education about mindfulness and stress; experiential mindfulness practice, and discussion of participants' experiences with mindfulness practice. Participants learn formal mindfulness practices (e.g., meditation, yoga, body scan, body scan) as well as informal such as awareness of breath, thoughts, or emotions, and mindfulness of daily activities. Participants will receive digital audio (MP3) downloads with guided MM practices, a home practice manual, and handouts with each week's assignments. Daily home practice will consist of 40-45 minutes of recorded practice. Participants will log their daily practice. If a participant misses a class, it is possible to make up the class on a different day.</description>

    <description>8-week health enhancement program (HEP) is designed to provide a structurally parallel, active control intervention to MBSR with health benefits in their own right, while omitting any components of mindfulness. HEP matches MBSR in structure and content, and in parallel to MBSR, consists of music therapy, nutritional education, posture and balance movements, walking and stretching. Work with all practices with group discussion and exercises during an all-day &quot;spa day&quot; will match the all-day retreat in MBSR. HEP participants will meet with a health educator in a group setting for 8 weekly 2.5-hour sessions. Participants will receive MP3 downloads on an MP3 player with recordings of health education topics, a home listening manual, and weekly handouts with each week's listening assignments. Participants will listen to these MP3 recordings daily for 40-45 minutes and log their daily adherence.</description>

    <intervention_name>Transcutaneous Vagus Nerve Stimulation (tVNS)</intervention_name>
    <description>Transcutaneous Vagus Nerve Stimulation (tVNS) is delivered using gammaCore (Electrocore), a multi-use, hand-held, rechargeable portable device consisting of a rechargeable battery, signal generating and amplifying electronics, and a button for operator control of the stimulation intensity. Conductive gel is applied to the stainless steel round discs on the device and placed vertically on the skin overlying the vagus nerve under the angle of the mandible, between the trachea and sternocleidomastoid muscle. A low-voltage electrical signal is delivered consisting of 5-kilohertz (kHz) sine wave series for 1 ms and repeated every 40 ms, with a maximum delivery of 24 V and 60 milliampere (mA) output. Stimulation amplitude is adjusted by the user and is increased until there is a vibration and slight muscle contraction in the lower face or neck. Stimulation is delivered for 2 minutes on the left side of the neck, and 2 minutes on the right side of the neck, for a total 4 minutes per one dose.</description>
