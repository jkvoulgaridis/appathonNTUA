      This phase II trial studies how well polarized dendritic cell (aDC1) vaccine, interferon
      alpha-2, rintatolimod, and celecoxib work together in treating patients with HLA-A2 positive
      (+) melanoma that has not responded to previous treatment (refractory). The aDC1 vaccine
      contains white blood cells (dendritic cells or DCs) that stimulates the immune system.
      Interferon alpha-2 can improve the body?s natural response to infections and other diseases.
      It can also interfere with the division of cancer cells and slow tumor growth. Rintalolimid
      may stimulate the immune system. Celecoxib is a drug that reduces pain. This study is being
      done to find out if aDC1 vaccine, interferon alpha-2, rintatolimod, and celecoxib can prevent
      the growth and/or progression of melanoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the objective response rate to treatment with an autologous alpha-type-1
      polarized dendritic cells (alphaDC1)/TBVA vaccine (alpha-type-1-polarized dendritic cells
      loaded with tumor blood vessel-targeting antigenic peptides) plus cytokine modulating (CKM)
      regimen (rintatolimod, recombinant interferon alpha-2 [IFN-alpha2b] and, celecoxib) in human
      leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A2+ subjects with primary PD-1 resistant immuno-oncology
      (IO)-refractory melanoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the immune-related objective response rate (objective response rate [ORR]; per
      immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [iRECIST];) in the above patient
      population treated with autologous alphaDC1/TBVA vaccine plus cytokine CKM regimen followed
      by re-treatment with PD1 blockade (+/- CTLA4 blockade).

      II. Evaluate rate of durable responses (&gt; 6 months) on the combination treatment in the above
      patient population treated with autologous alphaDC1/TBVA vaccine plus cytokine CKM regimen
      followed by re-treatment with PD1 blockade (+/- CTLA4 blockade).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Examine whether the combination of peptide-loaded autologous alphaDC1 vaccines and
      tumor-selective chemokine modulation (CKM: IFN-a2b, rintatolimod, and celecoxib) improves the
      overall survival (OS) and immune-related progression-free survival (iPFS) in HLA-A2+ subjects
      PD-1/PD-L1-refractory melanoma compared to the historical control of the best supportive
      care.

      II. Identify the intratumoral and systemic immune correlates of the response to treatment.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive recombinant interferon alpha-2 intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes,
      rintatolimod IV over 2.5 hours, and celecoxib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-3.
      Beginning cycle 2, patients also receive alpha-type-1 polarized dendritic cells intradermally
      (ID) on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks up to 4 cycles in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. At 12 weeks, patients with progressive disease may
      switch to ipilimumab with or without a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor and patients with a complete
      response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) may switch to a PD-1/PD-L1
      inhibitor or best alternative care.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 2
      years.
