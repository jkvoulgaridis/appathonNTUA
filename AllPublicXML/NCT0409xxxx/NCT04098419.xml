  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will serve adolescents from low-income and historically underserved communities
      through expansion of existing after-school programs. Adolescents from these communities tend
      to have slower academic progression and higher high school dropout rates. Extracurricular
      activities, including informal education through after-school programming, have been
      suggested to improve these rates and increase college enrollment by supporting traditional
      classroom-based education. The proposed project aims to educate high school-aged adolescents
      in food, agriculture, natural resources, and human (FANH) sciences through informal food
      literacy education. The project also includes a two-tiered cross-age teaching model, allowing
      for adolescents to be educated by college interns and to become educators for younger youth.
      Existing curricula, that encompass FANH sciences, will be utilized at each stage of the
      project. The purpose of the project is not only to educate adolescents in FANH sciences, but
      also to advance their motivation and efficacy for graduating high school, attending college,
      and majoring in FANH sciences. The project aims to accomplish these objectives through
      empowering adolescents to obtain knowledge, skills, and excitement for food literacy. As this
      model has not been utilized previously, this project will produce a best practices guide for
      implementing the existing curricula within a two-tiered cross-age teaching model.
      Additionally, the college internship and mentoring program created through this project will
      be continued at the initial sites and expanded to other communities. This will allow for a
      sustainable approach to educating adolescents in FANH sciences and providing mentorship that
      encourages future enrollment in college.

    <measure>Self-Efficacy about Cooking Skills</measure>
    <time_frame>1 school year</time_frame>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Fruit and Vegetable Intake (Skin Carotenoids)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Fruit and vegetable consumption will be collected using reflection spectroscopy through an instrument called &quot;Veggie Meter.&quot; The Veggie Meter can be utilized to objectively estimate carotenoid-containing fruit and vegetable consumption through measurement of skin carotenoids in the fingertip. A handout about this tool will be provided to parents/guardians with the consent form. For the most reliable results, this measurement will be collected during the same time of year to limit false results due to seasonal changes in dietary pattern.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Dietary intake</measure>
    <time_frame>1 school year</time_frame>
    <description>A commonly used food frequency questionnaire will be utilized to measure dietary intake in adolescents and younger youth (Block Kids 2004). The tool has been determined to be appropriate for ages 7-17 years. To best assess the eating pattern of the target populations, the option for inclusion of food commonly eaten by Hispanic populations has been selected. This assessment tool will be provided in both English and Spanish so that parents/guardians can help participants complete the assessment at home. Additionally, serving size references will be sent home with the questionnaire. This assessment includes a variety of foods and asks participants how many days in the last week they consumed each food.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Household Food Security</measure>
    <time_frame>1 school year</time_frame>
    <description>Household food security will be measured using the USDA's U.S. Household Food Security Survey Module. This widely utilized 12-item module has been modified to a fillable questionnaire for parents or guardians of youth to complete.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Anthropometrics (to calculate BMI)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 school year</time_frame>
    <description>Height, and weight will be measured and used to calculate BMI percentile and BMI-z scores. Participants will be measured in light outdoor clothing after the removal of shoes. Height will be measured to the nearest 0.1cm using a transportable stadiometer and body weight will be measured to the nearest 0.1kg using an electronic scale. Waist circumference will be measured to the nearest cm using a body circumference measuring tape. Adiposity and obesity risk will be assessed via age- and sex-specific BMI percentile as recommended by the Expert Committee on Childhood and Adolescent Overweight and Obesity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Civic Responsibility</measure>
    <time_frame>1 school year</time_frame>
    <description>Civic responsibility will be measured using a reliable questionnaire developed as a part of the 4-H Youth Development Program Healthy Living Measures by the Service-Learning Research and Development Center at University of California, Berkeley. The 24-item questionnaire assesses civic responsibility by measuring three key aspects: connection to community, civic awareness, and civic efficacy. This assessment features a 6-point Likert scale.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Motivation for Educational Attainment</measure>
    <time_frame>1 school year</time_frame>
    <description>Motivation and self-efficacy for attaining higher education will be measured using the Adolescent Education Aspirations Questionnaire.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Social and emotional self-efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>1 school year</time_frame>
    <description>Portions of the Self-Efficacy Questionnaire for Children (SEQ-C) will be utilized to assess social and emotional self-efficacy. While originally developed in the Netherlands, this questionnaire was tested in two large samples of American adolescents in middle school and high school and found to be an appropriate tool with minor revisions. With assessment of academic self-efficacy being completed with the previously mentioned questionnaire, items referring to academics have been removed from this tool.</description>

    <measure>Disposition toward FANH sciences</measure>
    <time_frame>1 school year</time_frame>
    <description>Disposition toward FANH sciences will be assessed using a modified version of the STEM Semantics Survey. This five-part survey has been shown to reliably measure disposition toward STEM in high school-aged adolescents.</description>

    <description>The implementation for both school years will follow the same procedures with different cohorts. Sixteen adolescents will be recruited through existing after-school programs at each location (32 total each year). College interns will facilitate food literacy lessons after school once per week with high school-aged adolescents. Beginning in January, adolescents will participate in training led by project staff and college interns to become competent cross-age teachers for garden-enhanced nutrition curricula. This training will consist of instruction in utilization of inquiry-based teaching practices and will be followed by adolescents practicing facilitating the curricula in teaching pairs. Up to 32 younger youth participants at each location (up to 64 total each year) will be recruited from local elementary schools while adolescents complete the cross-age teaching training. With mentorship from college interns, adolescents will facilitate curricula in pairs with younger youth.</description>
