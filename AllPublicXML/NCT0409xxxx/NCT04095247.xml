  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study to investigate whether the use of an extra function of vagus nerve
      stimulator (VNS) can give an improved effect against epilepsy. Many epileptic seizures are
      accompanied by an increase in heart rate. One auxiliary function of a new type of stimulator
      is continuous measurement of cardiac activity, and when pulse rate increases an extra
      stimulation is delivered. It has been shown that this can interrupt attacks that are about to
      develop. In this project the investigators will test how well that works for patients in
      daily life. The new type of stimulator has similar design and location as the old one.
      Patients who have already been treated with VNS and who need to switch the stimulator because
      the battery is starting to run out, are asked whether they want to participate. The study is
      a randomized and blinded cross-over. The activation of the extra feature is done either in
      the first or the second treatment phase. Which phase is the phase with activated
      autostimulation will be decided by random selection and the patient does not know when the
      auxiliary function is started. The study period is 11 months. Patients are asked to fill in
      some questionnaires on seizures, quality of life and quality of sleep.

        Eligible for the study are subjects (males and females) 12 years of age or older who had
        been using a VNS for at least three years with a positive effect and are getting a device
        replacement due to low battery capacity or who had a replacement and had not started the
        additional ECG -triggered stimulation before the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects, 12 years of age or older, who have a VNS without ECG-triggered auto
             stimulation implanted, have a positive effect and have a device replacement with model
             106 or model 1000 due to low battery capacity,.

          -  Subjects, who have 2 or more seizure per month and not more than 28 days between
             seizures during the baseline.

          -  Subjects, who are on a stable regiment of antiepileptic drug treatment for at least 3
             month prior to enrollment and maintain on this regimen throughout the study.

          -  VNS parameters have not been changed I the last 3 month prior to enrollment.

          -  Subjects which are using an off time of at least 1.8 min. (If the patient is on a duty
             cycle involving an off-time of 1.1 min. or less, and willing to participate in the
             study the duty cycle will have to be changed to fulfill the inclusion criteria as
             follows. The off-time will be changed to 1.8 min. and the on-time accordingly to
             achieve about the same duty cycle as the patient had before. If the duty cycle is
             above 30% the parameters will be changed to 60 sec./1.8 min., if the duty cycle is
             between 30% and 23% the parameters will be change to 30 sec./1,8 min., if the duty
             cycle is 20% the parameters will be change to 21 sec./1,8 min. and if the duty cycle
             is 15% the parameters will be change to 14 sec./1,8 min. After at periode of 3 month
             observation the patient can be included in the study.)

          -  Either the subjects or the legal guardian are able to agree to participate by signing
             the informed consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with rapidly progressive neurodegenerative or rapidly progressing neoplastic
             disease.

          -  Subjects or legal guardians who are unable to understand the study procedures.
