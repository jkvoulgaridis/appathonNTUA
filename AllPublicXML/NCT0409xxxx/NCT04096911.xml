      The investigators propose to evaluate the efficacy of the combination of Pd-1 Monoclonal
      Antibody and HPV Vaccine in the patients with cervical cancer who fails in or can not endure
      the standard treatment
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The phase II study is a research which treat cervical carcinoma patients who recurred after
      at least one prior chemotherapy regimen with Sintilimab and HPV Vaccine. The primary endpoint
      is objective response rate; secondary endpoints are Progression-Free Survival, Overall
      Survival and duration of response. Efficacy will be assessed according to RECIST 1.1;
      progression-free survival is the time from study entry to time of progression or death,
      whichever occurs first; overall survival is the time from study entry to time of death or the
      date of last contact,. Furthermore, exploratory studies will be performed on archival tumor
      material (PD-L1 expression, next-generation sequencing).
