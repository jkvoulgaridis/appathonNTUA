  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a single blind, prospective study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      the Silk'n ToothWave Powered Toothbrush for stains reduction and improvement of teeth shade.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study includes a total of 84 treatment sessions, twice a day, and 4 clinic visits over a
      period of 6 weeks.

      One treatment group (Silk'n powered toothbrush - ToothWave) and 1 control group (an ADA
      approved powered toothbrush (PTB)) will participate in the study.

      For each patient, efficacy assessment data will be collected at baseline, 4 weeks, and at 6
      weeks. The average stain data will be calculated for each group.

      Treatment is defined as a timed, 2 minute brushing of the teeth according to the
      manufacturer's instructions, twice daily (morning and evening). Brushing will be undertaken
      using the Silk'n toothbrush and standard fluoride toothpaste. The control group will use an
      ADA accepted PTB and standard fluoride toothpaste.

    <description>Extrinsic Stains will be evaluated using the validated Lobene Stain Index (LSI)
Stain Intensity score range is between 0 and 3, where:
0 = no stain
= light stain
= moderate stain
= heavy stain
The mean stain intensity will be calculated for both the gingival and body regions of the incisor teeth for each subject.
Stain Area score rage is between 0 and 3, where:
0 = no stain
= stain covering up to one third of region
= stain covering up to two thirds of region
= stain covering more than two thirds of region
The mean stain area will be calculated for both the gingival and body regions of the incisor teeth for each subject.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Adult subjects aged 18-70, that are in good health.

          2. Subjects should have notable extrinsic dental stains on the 6 maxillary labial front
             teeth, or on the 6 mandibular front teeth (lingual or labial), with a total extrinsic
             tooth stain score ≥14 according to the LSI.

          3. Subject must have at least 2 natural anterior teeth, each having a mean Lobene
             composite score of ≥ 1.5 as assessed by the Investigator.

          4. Subject front teeth shade should be 9 or darker (meaning shade score should be between
             9 and 29), as assessed by the Vita bleachedguide 3D-Master or the Vita EasyShade
             device.

          5. The subjects should understand the information provided about the investigative nature
             of the treatment, possible benefits and side effects. Subjects will sign the Informed

          6. The subjects should be willing to comply with the study procedure and schedule,
             including the follow up visits, and will refrain from using any other teeth whitening
             technologies during this period.

          7. The subject did not perform any procedure for teeth whitening (either at home or in
             clinic) at least 3 years prior to participating in the study.

          5. Subjects that do not brush regularly.

          6. Any condition that might make it unsafe for the subject to participate in the study,
             at the discretion of the investigator.
