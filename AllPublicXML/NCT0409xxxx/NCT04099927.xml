        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Able to understand the study procedures, the risks involved and obtain written
             informed consent before any study related activity;

          2. Male or female between the ages of 18 and 65 years, inclusive;

          3. A total body weight ≥ 50 kg;

          4. End stage of renal disease (ESRD) participants who have been on hemodialysis
             (including hemodiafiltration) for at least six months and are currently on
             hemodialysis (including hemodiafiltration) three times a week.

          5. Male subjects with a partner of childbearing potential must be willing to use a condom
             when sexually active, throughout the study period and for 28 days following last study
             drug dosing. Female subjects must be post-menopausal for at least 1 year, permanently
             sterilized (e.g., tubal occlusion, hysterectomy,bilateral salpingectomy) or, if of
             childbearing potential, must be willing to use a highly effective method of
             contraception throughout the study period and for 28 days following last study drug
             dosing, and enter the trial only after menstruation is confirmed..

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Anticipated to receive a kidney transplant during the study;

          2. Known history of allergic reaction to opiates such as hives (Note: side effects
             related to the use of opioids such as constipation or nausea would not exclude the
             participants from the study);

          3. History of drug abuse in the past;

          4. Nicotine test positive;

          5. Alcohol breath test was positive;

          6. The average daily intake of alcohol in the three months before screening was more than
             15 g (15 g alcohol equivalent to 450 ml beer or 150 ml wine or 50 ml low-alcohol
             liquor).

          7. Could not obey the unified dietary arrangements and avoid taking coffee or tea during
             the study period;

          8. Blood pressure of upper limbs in supine position was : systolic pressure &lt; 110 mmHg,
             diastolic pressure &lt; 70 mmHg or systolic pressure &gt; 180 mmHg, diastolic pressure &gt; 110
             mmHg at screening or pre-dosing after confirmation in a repeat test;

          9. New York Heart Function Classification (NYHA) &gt; III in the screening stage, or
             abnormal electrocardiogram with clinical significance judged by researchers in the
             screening stage , including QTcF &gt; 480ms;

         10. Screening alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, gamma glutamyl
             transferase &gt; 1.5 × ULN, or total bilirubin&gt; 1.5 × ULN.

         11. Positive at screening for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody, Hepatitis B
             surface antigen (HBsAg), or Hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody.

         12. Undergone major surgery within 3 months prior to screening.

         13. Total blood loss ≥ 200 ml within 30 days prior to screening, excluding female bleeding
             during physiological period.

         14. Blood human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) test was positive.

         15. Opioids were used within a week before screening, or opioids other than research drugs
             could not be avoided during the study period.

         16. Previous participation in this trial, as defined by signing informed consent form;

         17. Participation defined as administration of investigational drugs in another clinical
             trial (including trial with medical devices) 3 months before screening, or currently
             participating in another clinical trial (including medical device trials);

         18. Any other medical or psychological condition, which in the opinion of the
             Investigator, might create undue risk to the participant or interfere with the
             participant's ability to comply with the protocol requirements, or to complete the
             study.
