    <textblock>
      Extension study for subjects who participated in a previous Astex-sponsored clinical study of
      ASTX727 (including, but not limited to ASTX727-01, ASTX727-02, ASTX727-04).
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this extension study are to provide ongoing long-term treatment with
      ASTX727 for subjects who were benefitting from ASTX727 treatment in a previous
      Astex-sponsored clinical study (parent study); to obtain long-term safety information; and to
      obtain survival information.

      Subjects will attend clinic visits on Day 1 of each 28-day cycle to undergo study procedures
      and to be given ASTX727 tablets for Days 1-5 of that dose cycle. Subjects should continue to
      receive the same ASTX727 dose and regimen they were receiving in the last cycle of the parent
      study in which they were originally enrolled. Subsequent treatment delays and/or dose
      reductions are at the discretion of the investigator as guided by the dose adjustment
      guidelines of the parent study protocol.

Subjects should receive ASTX727 at the same dose they received in the last cycle of their parent study; if an adjustment from that dose is required, a different total cycle dose may be employed, as guided by the dose adjustment guidelines in the parent study protocol.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects must fulfill all of the following inclusion criteria:

          1. Previous participation in an Astex-sponsored ASTX727 clinical trial (including, but
             not limited to studies ASTX727-01, ASTX727-02, and ASTX727-04) in which the subject
             was treated with ASTX727 and was still on active treatment with ASTX727 at the time of
             study completion as determined by Astex.

          2. Subject is considered to be benefitting from ASTX727 treatment in the opinion of the
             treating investigator at the time of parent study completion (Subjects must not be
             withdrawn from the parent study until eligibility for this study is confirmed).

          3. Subject is able to understand and comply with the study procedures and understands the
             risks involved in the study.

          4. Subject provides written informed consent before undergoing any study-specific
             procedure.

          5. Women of childbearing potential must not be pregnant or breastfeeding and must have a
             negative pregnancy test at screening. Women of childbearing potential must agree to
             practice 2 highly effective contraceptive methods of birth control and must agree not
             to become pregnant for 6 months after completing treatment; men with female partners
             of childbearing potential must agree to practice 2 highly effective contraceptive
             measures and must agree not to father a child while receiving ASTX727 and for at least
             3 months after completing ASTX727 treatment.

        Exclusion Criterion:

        1. Any subject who, in the opinion of the investigator, may have other conditions, organ
        dysfunction, or for whom safety data from parent study participation suggests the risks of
        continuing treatment with ASTX727 may outweigh the benefits.
