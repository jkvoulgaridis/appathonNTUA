      Prospective data will be collected in a minimum of 300 patients presenting with an acquired
      segmental mandibular defect ≥ 4 cm secondary to OSSC removal and who require mandibular
      reconstruction.

      The follow up (FU) will consist of standard of care (routine) procedures and data collection
      will be done at 3, 6, 12, 18 and up to 24 months after resection and/or reconstruction. The
      maximum FU for each patient within the registry will be 2 years after mandibular resection.

      Data collection will include confounding baseline data, tumor characteristics, neurological
      function, patient reported outcomes, quality of life as well as anticipated procedure-related
      adverse events (AEs). Available images will be collected and evaluated centrally to determine
      the location, positioning, osseointegration, bone quantity and quality of the transplants.

      Depending on the volume and quality of the collected data, different statistical analyses
      will be performed. Exploratory analyses will be conducted to find relationships between the
      different treatment modalities and their outcomes.

    <description>Change in the OHIP over the follow-up period.
The Oral Health Impact Profile is providing a comprehensive measure of self-reported dysfunction, discomfort and disability attributed to oral conditions. The OHIP is concerned with impairment and three functional status dimensions (social, psychological, and physical). Respondents are asked to indicate on a five-point Likert scale how frequently they experienced each problem. Response categories for the five-point scale are: &quot;Very often&quot;, &quot;Fairly often&quot;, &quot;Occasionally&quot;, &quot;Hardly ever&quot; and &quot;Never&quot;. The OHIP consists of 14 questions in which higher scores indicate worse outcomes.</description>

    <description>Oral squamous cell carcinoma staging according to TNM (Tumor, Node, Metastasis) system.
In the TNM system the &quot;T&quot; refers to the size and extent of the main tumor likert from T0 to T4 whereas T0 is the smallest and T4 the biggest size.
The main tumor is usually called the primary tumor. The &quot;N&quot; refers to the number of nearby lymph nodes that have cancer likert for N0 to N3 whereas N0 is the single nearby lymphnode and N3 multiple lymphnodes. The &quot;M&quot; refers to whether the cancer has metastasized likert from M0 to M1 whereas M0 is no distant metastasis and M1 is distant metastasis.</description>

    <description>One stage reconstruction: Osseous reconstruction is performed in the same surgery of the tumor/mandibular resection. It is also known as immediate or primary reconstruction.
Second stage reconstruction: Osseous reconstruction is performed after the tumor/mandibular resection surgery as an independent surgery. After the mandibular resection a temporary alloplastic bridging might be put in place. It is also known as delayed or secondary reconstruction.</description>
