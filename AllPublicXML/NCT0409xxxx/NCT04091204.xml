    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to explore a prognostic clinical and molecular biomarker profile in a
      population of BRCA wild-type recurrent high-grade ovarian cancer patients treated with
      olaparib as maintenance after response to a platinum based therapy as platinum sensitive
      recurrence treatment.

      This is a single arm, open-label Phase 2 study designed to evaluate the effect of maintenance
      olaparib treatment after response to platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with BRCA wild
      type platinum sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer. The goal is to identify a clinical and
      molecular profile able to select a group of patients, treated with olaparib as maintenance,
      with a favorable prognosis.
