  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, off label study, to provide interested ALS patients with
      Ciprofloxacin/Celecoxib fixed dose combination, while assessing safety and tolerability,
      routine disease progression measures (ALSFRS-R and Vital Capacity) and change in serum pNFH.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be prescribed a fixed dose combination of Ciprofloxacin and Celecoxib to be
      taken twice daily, and will be monitored for safety and tolerability. Additionally, routine
      progression measures will be assessed, as well as change in serum pNFH.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Able to comprehend and willing to sign an Informed Consent Form (ICF)

          2. Males or females between the ages of 18 and 75 years of age, inclusive

          3. Diagnosis of familial or sporadic ALS (defined as meeting the possible,
             laboratory-supported probable, probable, or definite criteria for a diagnosis of ALS
             according to the World Federation of Neurology El Escorial criteria) less than 5 years
             prior to baseline

          4. Patients may be on Riluzole and/or Edaravone; 30 days of stable use is required to
             make safety assessments more reliable

          5. Upright Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) ≥ 50% of predicted for age, height and sex at
             screening

          6. Patient is able to swallow tablets/ capsules

          7. A caregiver (if one is needed)

          8. Female patients must be post-menopausal (≥ 1 year) OR sterilized, OR if of
             childbearing potential (i.e., females who have had their first period unless they are
             anatomically and physiologically incapable to become pregnant), must have a negative
             pregnancy test, and agree to use contraceptive drugs or devices (e.g., diaphragm plus
             spermicide, or oral contraceptives) for the duration of the study and 10 weeks after
             the last treatment dose AND require male partners to use a condom during sexual
             intercourse

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. A past history of adverse reaction/hypersensitivity to either NSAIDs, celecoxib or
             fluoroquinolones, ciprofloxacin

          2. Any known clinically significant abnormal gastric mucosal initial gastroscopic of an
             erosion, ulcer or tumor or/and GI disorder

          3. Known history of impaired renal function.

          4. Known or suspected congestive heart and/or coronary heart disease, previous history of
             myocardial infarction, uncontrolled arterial hypertension, or rhythm abnormalities

          5. Known history of QT/QTc prolongation, Torsade de pointes (TdP) (e.g. heart failure,
             hypokalemia, family history of Long QT syndrome) and the use of concomitant
             medications that prolong the QT/QTc interval.

          7. Presence at screening of any medically significant cardiac, pulmonary,
             musculoskeletal, or psychiatric illness that might interfere with the patient's
             ability to comply with study procedures or that might confound the interpretation of

               1. Mean systolic blood pressure &gt;180 mm Hg; mean diastolic blood pressure &gt;100 mm Hg
                  (measurements taken after few min rest) that persist on 3 successive measurements
                  taken at least 2 minutes apart

               2. NYHA Class II or greater congestive heart failure

               3. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma requiring daily use of
                  bronchodilator medications

               4. Poorly controlled or brittle diabetes mellitus

               5. Cognitive impairment, related to ALS or otherwise, sufficient to impair the
                  patient's ability to understand and/or comply with study procedures and provide
                  informed consent

          8. Female who is pregnant or breastfeeding or with intention of becoming pregnant during

          9. Any impairment or social circumstance that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would

         10. Patient, patient's parent(s), or patient's legal guardian(s) is/are unable to
             understand the nature, scope, and possible consequences of the study

         11. Patient is participating in (or plans to participate in) any other investigational
