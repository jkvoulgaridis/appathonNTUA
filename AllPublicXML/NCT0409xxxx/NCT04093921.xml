      This is a randomized, motivational-interviewing-based intervention to improve
      readiness-to-change, or willingness to engage in a self-management approach to chronic pain,
      for patients referred to our intensive interdisciplinary pain rehabilitation day program.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Readiness to change, or willingness to engage in a self-management approach to chronic pain
      and disability, is the most powerful predictor of children's success in intensive pediatric
      pain rehabilitation. Motivational Enhancement Therapy (MET) is an approach that has been
      effective in increasing readiness to change and treatment engagement for other
      behaviorally-oriented health interventions. However, MET has never been systemically employed
      in the context of treating pediatric chronic pain and disability.

      This demonstration project seeks to test the effects of a novel telehealth intervention using
      motivation enhancement therapy to improve patient and parent engagement in, and outcomes of,
      an intensive interdisciplinary day hospital program for children with complex chronic pain
      conditions and associated disability, the Pediatric Pain Rehabilitation Center (PPRC). The
      intervention, PPRC-Prep, is a 4 week MET-based telehealth intervention that will be offered
      to families of children with refractory chronic pain conditions awaiting admission to the
      PPRC at Boston Children's Hospital at Waltham. Families approved for and awaiting PPRC
      admission will be randomized to receive PPRC-Prep along with usual care or to a comparison
      group receiving treatment as usual. Study aims include assessing the feasibility and
      acceptability of the intervention along with measuring its potential to increase readiness to
      engage in a self-management approach assessed at time of admission to the PPRC using
      established measures of readiness to change, pain acceptance, and committed action.
      Investigators will also evaluate the effects of PPRC-Prep on program length of stay and on
      reductions of disability and pain at PPRC discharge and short-term (8-week) follow up through
      comparison of families who undergo PPRC-prep with families who do not undergo PPRC-prep.
      Demonstrating the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of PPRC-Prep will enable the
      study team to establish this as a routine component of our approach to care for children with
      complex, refractory chronic pain and disability.
