    <textblock>
      The objective is to compare the efficacy and safety of CAPOXIRI+BEV therapy versus
      FOLFOXIRI+BEV therapy as first-line therapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer
      (mCRC).

    <textblock>
      QUATTRO-II is an open-label, multicenter, randomised, phase II study to investigate the
      efficacy and safety of CAPOXIRI+BEV versus FOLFOXIRI+BEV in 1st line mCRC.

      This study is composed two steps because of confirming of recommended dose (RD) for
      CAPOXIRI+BEV regimen.

        1. Dose finding step (Step1): CAPOXIRI+BEV doses findings were planned by 3+3 cohort
           design, register up to maximum of 12 cases.

        2. Randomised step (Step2): After confirmation of RD regarding CAPOXIRI+BEV, we will move
           to Step2 to compare the efficacy and safety between FOLFOXIRI+BEV and CAPOXIRI+BEV,
           register up to 65 cases.
