  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Xenografts are graft materials derived from the inorganic portion of animal bones; the most
      common source is bovine the removal of the organic component are processed to remove their
      antigenicity, while the remaining inorganic components provide a natural matrix as well as an
      excellent source of calcium. The disadvantage of xenografts is that they are only
      osteoconductive and the resorption rate of bovine cortical bone is slow.

      However leaving the jumping gap empty has been the gold standard for immediate implantation
      as the formed blood clot will allow bone fill in that area.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Not using a grafting material in the jumping gap was chosen as a comparator as it's the
      standard procedure usually applied and showed high success rates. This should allow us to
      assess whether the chosen grafting material would have a positive influence on the study
      outcomes as compared to it.

      Intraoral and extraoral autologous bone grafts could be considered as the &quot;Gold standard&quot;
      pre-prosthetic dentoalveolar reconstruction of atrophic jaws with cortico-cancellous bone
      grafts from intraoral and/or extraoral donor sites as a predictable technique for the
      facilitation of dental rehabilitation of atrophic ridges, associated with high bone survival
      rate and long term implant success. Autogenous bone corresponds to bone graft obtained from
      the same individual. It is considered the gold standard for filling of bone defects since it
      allows (I) osseointegration: direct contact with bone tissue without fibrous tissue ; (II)
      osteoconduction: support to bone growth (III) osteoinduction: differentiation of mesenchymal
      cells of surrounding tissue (receptor site) into osteoblastic cells ; and (IV) osteogenesis:
      bone neoformation by osteoblastic cells present in the graft material. Although few mature
      osteoblasts survive to grafting, precursor cells are responsible for the osteogenic potential

    <description>Eligible patients will be randomized in equal proportions between control group (immediate implant placement without bone grafts in the jumping gap) and study group (immediate implant placement with a mixture of Xenograft and autogenous bone placed in the jumping gap).
All patients will be evaluated by proper history taking and thorough clinical and radio graphical examination and assessed according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria.
Patients of both groups will be subjected to Cone beam Computed tomography (CBCT).
Primary impression will be taken, a study model will then be poured and then waxing up will be performed.
Patients will be instructed to rinse with chlorhexidine 0.1% mouthwash. Articaine 4% (1:100,000) local anesthesia will be given to the patient. Atraumatic extraction of the tooth or remaining root using No. 15c lancet and periotome</description>
