    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized phase III trial with a 2x2 factorial design with measurable
      residual disease and event-free survival as primary endpoints, respectively. Patients are
      upfront randomized for the two induction schedules (Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin (GO)-147 versus
      GO-1; ratio 1:1) and for Glasdegib or Placebo (double blinded, ratio 1:1) as adjunct to
      consolidation therapy and as single agent 6 months maintenance therapy. Chemotherapy backbone
      for induction therapy is standard 7+3 with cytarabine 200mg/m² continuously day 1 to day 7,
      daunorubicin 60mg/m² days 1, 2 and 3 and for consolidation therapy intermediate dose
      cytarabine (1g/m², bi-daily, days 1,2,3). The trial is designed to gain evidence of
      anti-leukemic activity of GO and Glasdegib in older patients with newly diagnosed acute
      myeloid leukemia.
