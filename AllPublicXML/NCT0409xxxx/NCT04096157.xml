  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the bioequivalence of isavuconazole following a
      single dose of isavuconazonium sulfate intravenous (IV) solution via nasogastric (NG) tube
      (test formulation) compared to a single dose of isavuconazonium sulfate capsules for oral
      administration (i.e., oral capsules administered to nonintubated participants)(reference
      formulation). In addition, this study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of
      isavuconazole and the general pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of isavuconazole when
      administered as a single dose of isavuconazonium sulfate IV solution via NG tube (test
      formulation) and a single dose of isavuconazonium sulfate capsules for oral administration
      (i.e., oral capsules administered to nonintubated participants) (reference formulation) under
      fasting conditions in healthy male and female participants.

      Eligible participants will participate in 2 treatment periods separated by a washout of at
      least 30 days between investigational product (IP) administrations in each period.
      Participants will be randomized to 1 of 2 sequences. Participants will be admitted to the
      clinical unit on day -1 of each period and will be residential for 5 days/4 nights.
      Participants will receive a single dose of isavuconazonium sulfate IV solution via NG tube
      (test formulation) or isavuconazonium sulfate capsules for oral administration (i.e., oral
      capsules administered to nonintubated participants) (reference formulation) under fasting
      conditions on day 1 of each period. Participants are to remain semirecumbent and avoid lying
      on either the left or right side for 4 hours postdose. Correct placement of the NG tube will
      be confirmed using X-ray radiography. Pharmacokinetic samples will be collected predose on
      day 1 of each period and at multiple time points postdose. Standard safety and tolerability
      assessments will be conducted. Participants will be discharged from the clinical unit on day
      4 of each period on the condition that all required assessments have been performed and that
      there are no medical reasons for a longer stay in the clinical unit. Participants will return
      for ambulatory visits to collect pharmacokinetic samples on days 8, 11, 15 and 21 of each
      period.

      The study will be completed with an end-of-study visit (ESV). The ESV will take place 5 to 9
      days after day 21 of period 2 or at early discontinuation from the study.

    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered an investigational product (IP), and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of IP whether or not considered related to the IP. An AE is considered &quot;serious&quot; if the investigator or sponsor view any of the following outcomes: Death, life-threatening, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly or birth defect, hospitalization, or medically important event. Treatment Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE) is defined as any AE which starts, or worsens, after the first dose of study drug through 30 days after the last dose of study drug.</description>
