    <textblock>
      ICU-associated weakness is a common experience for people following a critical illness. It is
      associated with important patient and system-relevant outcomes. Diagnosing ICU-associated
      weakness can be challenging because making the diagnosis relies on volitional participation
      in strength testing by the patient in a very ill population that is often sedated or
      restrained.

      This study proposes to test if bedside ultrasound of tibialis anterior (a non-invasive test
      that doesn't require active participation by the patient) correlates with clinical whole-body
      weakness in critically ill patients admitted to an ICU with sepsis.

      BACKGROUND

      Physical weakness is a common during and after critical illness. Weakness can develop for
      multiple reasons, but it can be generally be grouped into three overlapping categories:

        1. Nervous system dysfunction - weakness can result from impairments in the nervous system
           control of muscles;

        2. Muscle size reductions (i.e. sarcopenia) - muscles become smaller with disuse, and;

        3. Muscle force reductions (i.e. dynapenia) - muscles develop contractile impairments.

      In critical care, diagnostic criteria have been developed for a syndrome of weakness called
      intensive care unit-acquired weakness (ICU-AW). ICU-AW has important clinical implications.
      It is associated with delayed ventilator weaning, increased mortality, and longer lengths of
      stay in the hospital. ICU-AW can also have consequences for patients after they leave the
      hospital. ICU-AW can be implicated in impairments in quality of life and physical function
      such as difficulty climbing stairs, and delays in returning to work.

      Diagnosing ICU-AW is not trivial and it is centered on assessments targeted primarily to
      assessing dynapenia. The diagnostic criteria are clear but making the diagnosis relies on the
      active participation of patients, and the reliable subjective assessment by clinicians at the
      bedside. Factors such as sedation, restraint use, paralytic medications, pain, and dressings
      can all confound the assessment of a patient's strength.

      To augment patient assessments, it is possible that assessments of sarcopenia might be
      helpful in highlighting who might be at risk for muscle dysfunction in the ICU.

      RESEARCH QUESTION AND OBJECTIVES Do serial measurements of tibialis anterior muscle
      cross-sectional area (a muscle in the leg) using bedside ultrasound correlate with clinical
      weakness in people admitted to the ICU for sepsis?

      Primary Outcome:

      Determine if the rates of decline of tibialis anterior muscle cross-sectional areas (%/day)
      measured by bedside ultrasound on participants admitted to an ICU for sepsis correlate with
      bedside clinical measures of strength using the medical research council (MRC) sum score (a
      score between 0 and 60).

      Secondary Outcomes:

      Determine if rates of decline of tibialis anterior muscle cross-sectional areas correlate
      with:

        1. Ankle dorsiflexion strength, measured using the Medical Research Council (MRC) Scale for
           muscle strength (a score between 0 and 5);

        2. Illness severity at admission to the ICU, measured by the Sequential Organ Failure
           Assessment (SOFA) score (a score between 0 and 24);

        3. Duration of mechanical ventilation (days),

        4. Duration of ICU length of stay (days), and;

        5. Duration of hospital length of stay (days).

      METHOD Each day, new admissions to a mixed medical-surgical ICU will be screened. Any person
      admitted with a diagnosis of sepsis will be considered for invitation to the study. Potential
      participants will be excluded if they are children (age &lt; 18 years), if they have preexisting
      diagnoses that would plausibly affect the size of the muscles in their leg, or if they have
      medical conditions that would preclude an assessment of their strength. Participants who are
      appropriate for inclusion in the study will be approached for informed consent.

      For participants who consent, every second day the cross-sectional area of the tibialis
      anterior muscle bulk on each leg will be measured (cm^2) using bedside ultrasound. These
      measurements will be accompanied by a clinical assessment of strength using the Medical
      Research Council (MRC) strength scale on six muscle groups bilaterally (shoulder abduction,
      elbow flexion, wrist extension, hip flexion, knee extension, and ankle dorsiflexion).
      Participants will continue to be evaluated every other day until they leave the ICU, or until
      their 14th day of admission to the ICU. Chart reviews will supplement these data to allow for
      the determination of the secondary objectives (e.g. SOFA scores, hospital lengths of stay).

    <description>Assessed using bedside ultrasound with repeat assessments every second day up to 2 weeks of ICU admission, or until discharge from ICU to yield an overall rate of muscle area decline reported as a %/day average muscle atrophy rate.
Tibialis anterior cross-sectional area assessments will be assessed by measurement ultrasound to both legs with portable bedside ultrasound. The cross sectional area will be measured in cm^2 at 5 cm distal to the lateral eminence of the tibial tuberosity along the muscle belly. Image processing will be performed at the bedside using features available on the ultrasound device. Muscle boundaries will be marked on the device and the cross-sectional area (computed from the perimetral contour of the muscle section) will be determined. This process will be repeated for two times for each leg.</description>

        This study will include any adult participants that are admitted to a mixed
        medical-surgical ICU with a diagnosis of sepsis. There are no restrictions based on the
        source of the infection (e.g. upper respiratory tract infections vs. abdominal sepsis from
        a perforated viscous) and no restriction based on the treatment provided (e.g. surgery for
        source control vs. systemic antibiotics).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. adult patients (age &gt; 18 years);

          2. admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of sepsis, and;

          3. an ICU duration of stay of greater than 4 days (two allow for serial assessments of
             muscle strength and size).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any pre-existing diagnosis that would reasonably impact a participant's muscle bulk,
             strength, coordination, or ability to participate in the assessment

               -  Critical illness myopathy, critical illness neuropathy, and critical illness
                  polyneuropathy diagnosed in the current ICU stay are not to be considered
                  exclusion criteria as these diagnoses are directly related to the research
                  question

               -  Delirium is not considered an exclusion criteria for this study so long as at
                  least two strength assessments can be performed during the course of the
                  participant's ICU stay.

          2. Any activity orders or movement restrictions (including medical devices such as casts
             or external fixation devices) that would preclude accurate motor strength assessment.

          3. Dressings, casts, or medical implements that would preclude or impede ultrasound
             assessment of tibialis anterior muscle cross-sectional area in both legs.

          4. Patients who are &quot;proned&quot; or in positions that make assessing tibialis anterior with
             ultrasound or physical exam impractical.

          5. Re-admission to ICU within the same hospital stay.
