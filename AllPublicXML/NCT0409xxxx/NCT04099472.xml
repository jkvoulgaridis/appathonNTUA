  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Almost half of critically ill patients experience delirium. Delirium is associated with
      impaired cognition, mortality, and increased healthcare costs. Family members of critically
      ill patients are also at risk for adverse consequences such as depression and anxiety.

      One strategy that may help improve outcomes is to engage family members in the prevention,
      detection, and management of delirium. This study will employ an educational module to
      educate families on delirium symptoms, how to identify delirium, and how to prevent and
      manage delirium using non-pharmacological strategies.

      Family delirium detection may result in earlier and more accurate recognition of delirium and
      meaningful family involvement, and therein the potential for better patient and family
      outcomes. We aim to determine the efficacy of employing family-administered delirium
      prevention, detection, and management in the critically ill, compared to usual care. We
      hypothesize that family-administered delirium prevention, detection, and management in the
      critically ill will be superior to standard of care in:

        1. reducing psychological distress in family members,

        2. reducing the prevalence, duration, and severity of delirium in critically ill patients,

        3. increasing delirium identification in medical charts,

        4. increasing delirium knowledge in family members of critically ill patients, and

        5. reducing the burden of delirium experienced by family members and caregivers.

      This study will be a parallel-group randomized control trial with a 1:1 allocation ratio.
      Consecutive, eligible patients admitted to 4 ICUs in Calgary, Alberta, Canada with at least
      one family member present will be identified by discussion with the most responsible
      attending physician and bedside nurse. All eligible and consenting family members will
      receive standard care, which is an informational pamphlet on ICU delirium presented to all
      patients and families upon admission. Participants in both the intervention and control
      groups will also complete a demographics questionnaire, the Critical Care Family Needs
      Inventory (CCFNI), the Barriers to Care Questionnaire in the ICU (BCQ-ICU), the Caregiver
      Coping Strategies (CSS) questionnaire, and the Caregiver ICU Delirium Knowledge Questionnaire
      (CIDKQ) upon enrollment. Additionally, all family members will complete the Delirium Burden
      (DEL-B) questionnaire, Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (KPDS-10), Patient Health
      Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7) daily for a maximum of five
      days.

      Family members randomized to the intervention group will receive additional ICU delirium
      education, whereas the control group will not. The intervention includes components of
      delirium education, prevention/management and detection. Family members will receive
      education by watching a 6-minute education video or reading an education booklet with a
      trained research assistant on the signs of delirium, who is at risk, and what they can do to
      prevent and manage it. They will practice identifying delirium with the Sour Seven
      questionnaire using previously validated case vignettes of hypothetical ICU patients.
      Delirium prevention and management will include a daily checklist of non-pharmacological
      interventions to be completed by the family member. This will include an orientation protocol
      (e.g., provide visual and hearing aids, orientation of day/time/location, familiar objects
      from home, television during the day with daily news, non-verbal music), mobility protocol
      (cognitive activities depending on the patient's ability), and an environmental protocol
      (lights off at night and on during the day, ear plugs, noise reduction during the night). In
      addition to non-pharmacological delirium prevention and management, this list will have a
      checkbox indicating if the family caregiver notified any member of the bedside care team
      about symptoms of delirium.

      Family members in both intervention and control groups will also complete follow-up
      questionnaires at 1-month and 3-months through an online link to a REDCap survey. These
      questionnaires will include the Family Satisfaction for the Intensive Care Unit (FSICU),
      KPDS-10, GAD-7, PHQ-9, and CIDKQ .
