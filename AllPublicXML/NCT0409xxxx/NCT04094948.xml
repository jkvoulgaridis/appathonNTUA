    <description>The initial dose of clenbuterol will be 40 mcg per oral each morning for one week, followed by 40 mcg twice per day (BID) for the next 5 weeks until Week 6. If the 40 mcg BID per oral is well tolerated, the dose will be increased to 80 mcg each morning/40 mcg each evening for one week, followed by 80 mcg BID for the next 5 weeks until the Week 12 visit. If 80 mcg BID is tolerated at Week 12, the subject will continue on that dose until Week 52.</description>
