      To assess the performance of the Allegro in the hands of CLIA-Waived Point-of-Care users in
      at least three distinct Point-of-Care clinical settings and compare the performance
      characteristics to other accepted Point-of-Care methods and central laboratory reference
      methods.

      To assess the Ease of Use of the Allegro in the hands of the intended CLIA-Waived
      Point-of-Care users. CLIA-Waived operators will be provided with all package insert sheets, a
      Quick Reference Guide poster and Instructions for Use. No training, coaching, or prompting
      will be provided other than clarifying the protocol.

      Blood and urine tests are used in the assessment of diabetes and to guide clinical
      management. In the traditional model of care, blood samples are taken from patients at the
      clinic and are sent to the laboratory for analysis and the results may not be available for a
      number of hours/days after the clinic visit.

      A new analyser has been developed (Allegro™) which allows the tests to be undertaken at the
      clinic, with the results available in a few minutes. This means that patients can get
      immediate feedback and that the doctors/nurses can adjust treatment before the patient leaves
      the clinic. It is obviously important that this analyzer performs to a similar degree of
      accuracy to the laboratory analyses.

      The aim of this research study is to assess the accuracy of the Allegro™ analyzer compared to
      laboratory analyses on capillary and venous whole blood samples and urine samples. Three
      hundred sixty (360) patients with diabetes will be invited to give a venous blood sample,
      finger prick capillary blood sample and urine sample. The venous blood sample, finger prick
      capillary blood sample and urine sample will be analysed by both the Allegro™ analyser and
      laboratory analyses and the results compared. The Allegro™ results will not be used in the
      management of the patients' diabetes.
