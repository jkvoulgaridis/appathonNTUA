  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if a condensed version of the chemotherapy regimen
      busulfan, melphalan, fludarabine (bu/mel/flu) and the drug antithymocyte globulin (ATG—also
      referred to as rATG or thymoglobulin) can have the same or fewer number of severe side
      effects in people with various blood cancers 30 days after they receive an allogeneic
      hematopoietic cell transplantation.
