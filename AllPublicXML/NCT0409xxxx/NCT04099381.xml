  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autism is one of those disorders in Autism spectrum disorders (ASD), which characterized by
      social interaction abnormalities, impaired verbal and non-verbal communication, and
      repetitive, obsessive behavior, while the therapeutic effect of current treatments remains
      limited progress.

      The possible reason for ASD is neural hypoperfusion and immune dysregulation. The Human
      Umbilical Cord Blood Mononuclear Cells (hUCB-MNCs) have been shown to have the ability to
      modulate the immune response and enhance angiogenesis, suggesting the novel and promising
      therapeutic strategy. In this study, the safety and efficacy of hUCB-MNCs infusion will be
      evaluated in patients with Autism with regarding to HLA compatibility.

      Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are heterogeneous neuro-developed disorders. Autism is the
      most common disorder of the diseases characterized by dysfunctions in response to social
      interaction and communication, as well as the presence of repetitive and stereotyped
      behaviors. Recent reports of a sharp increase in the number of children with autism. The
      exact etiology of autism remains unclear. Compliance, the definition of effective treatments
      for autism is particularly difficult.

      Although it has been understood, it can be a question of immune dysregulation. Examination of
      the inflammatory cytokines, dysfunction of the immune system and the immune system. The Human
      Umbilical Cord Blood Mononuclear Cells (hUCB-MNCs) have been shown to have the ability to
      modulate the immune response and enhance angiogenesis, suggesting the novel and promising
      therapeutic strategy. Our study suggest that infusion of cord blood mononuclear cells will
      affect Autism.

      This protocol was developed on the basis of the results of the previously approved protocol
      of the center NCT03786744 (Transfusion of allogeneic cord blood samples in patients with
      autism spectrum disorders), which showed high efficiency in the rehabilitation of patients.
      The present protocol is intended for revealing the dependence of the clinical effect on the
      degree of tissue compatibility of umbilical cord blood samples and the recipient.

    <intervention_model_description>This is prospective, non-randomized (open-label) with control group study. In total, the study will involve 150 patients in three groups. The first and second groups will receive transfusions of umbilical cord blood hematopoietic cells, with varying degrees of selection for the genes of the HLA system. The third group will be the control group. In the control group, 50 patients with similar pathology will be examined, comparable in age, sex and degree of disorder of the type of &quot;para-copies&quot; against the background of standard therapy.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Evaluation of the survival of donor cells in the host body to determine the safety and duration of the cellular component. To do this, before the first injection of the cells, a sample of the patient's blood and a donor cord blood sample will be taken. 6 months after the first injection of the cells, immediately before the second injection, the patient's blood will be re-taken to conduct a study on chimerism. The obtained data will allow assessing the survival degree of donor material. The definition of chimerism is carried out by fragment analysis. For analysis, blood samples of the biomaterial will be collected from the patient before the cells are injected and 6 months after the injection.</description>

    <description>CD34+ cells are precursors of hematopoiesis and endothelium. Studies show that CD34+ cells, when injected into an ischemic lesion zone, exert protective properties on the affected cells, stimulate angiogenesis, and are involved in reducing inflammatory reactions. In this study, we plan to find a correlation between the concentration of the introduction of CD34+ cells and treatment effectiveness. The assessment of a cord blood sample will be carried out on a flow cytometer immediately before the injection of the cells or in the next 12 hours.</description>
