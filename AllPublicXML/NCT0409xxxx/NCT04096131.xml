      To determine if cataract surgery may have an impact on the natural history of early DME
      (E-DME)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cataract surgery worsens preoperative DME, deserving an adequate pre and postoperative
      treatment. A large British study demonstrated that even eyes without preexisting edema are at
      risk of DME development after surgery according to the gravity of retinopathy. A new DME
      classification (the ESASO Classification of DME) defines a new category of DME, named early
      DME (E-DME) as follow: presence of small intraretinal cysts associated with well-recognizable
      and detectable inner retinal layers, ellipsoid zone (EZ) and external limiting membrane
      (ELM), with increase in central subfield thickness (CST) and/or macular volume (MV) less than
      30% of maximum normal values.

      Due to its undetectable or minimal impact on visual function, E-DME has not yet been studied,
      and retinologists usually restrict treatment to more advanced cases.

      E-DME is the most frequent type of DME among the population undergoing cataract surgery,
      estimated by DICAT-I Study in 20.7% of the diabetic subjects, corresponding to 5.4% of the
      general population.

      It has been demonstrated that cataract surgery has a negative impact both on diabetic eyes
      with no DME and in eyes with advanced DME. Even E-DME therefore probably worsens after
      surgery but there are no data on this matter.

      Study Objective: to determine if cataract surgery may have an impact on the natural history
      of early DME (E-DME) Study Design: prospective multi-center observational case-control study

    <description>Changes in central subfield thickness (CST) and/or macular volume (MV) measured by SD-OCT in eyes with E-DME during the first 4 months after cataract surgery (Group 1) compared to eyes with the same condition but without any surgical intervention (Group 2).
Eyes in both groups developing a &quot;significant worsening&quot; of E-DME, defined as an increase of at least 50 microns in central subfield thickness (CST) or 0.5 mm3 in macular volume (MV) measured by SD-OCT will be withdrawn from the study to receive adequate therapeutic intervention.</description>

        Study Groups GROUP 1: Eyes with E-DME scheduled for cataract surgery GROUP 2: Control
        Group. Eyes with E-DME and clear media, non-significant cataract, pseudophakic (Group 2a:
        phakic; Group 2b: pseudophakic) or eyes with cataract scheduled for surgery after the end
        of follow up.

        Gold candidate: patient with bilateral E-DME and cataract in at least one eye.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Eligible patients will be identified during the regular preoperative cataract examination.
        In the presence of a diabetic patient, an OCT scan will be performed (according to the
        protocol, see below).

        Only eyes with E-DME will be eligible for the study.

        Inclusion criteria may be one of the following:

          1. Diabetic patients with bilateral E-DME and bilateral cataract. Both eyes will be
             enrolled: one eye will receive surgery at M4, the other at the end of follow up (M8)
             or later (gold candidate).

          2. Diabetic patients with bilateral E-DME and cataract in just one eye (gold candidate).
             The eye with E-DME and no cataract may be already pseudophakic (surgery performed at
             least 18 months before) or with clear media.

          3. Diabetic patients with E-DME and cataract in just one eye

          4. Diabetic patients with cataract and no E-DME in the eye scheduled for surgery but
             E-DME in the other eye. Only the eye with E-DME will be enrolled.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Past ocular surgery of any kind (except for cataract surgery) or ocular pathologies
             other than diabetic retinopathy.

          2. Macular edema considered to be due to a cause other than diabetic macular edema.

          3. OCT examination suggesting that vitreoretinal interface abnormalities (e.g., a taut
             posterior hyaloid or epiretinal membrane) are the primary cause of the macular edema.
             In the case of ERM, an OCT scan must be sent to the Coordinating Center for approval.

          4. Any ocular pathology or ocular condition is present (other than diabetes) that, in the
             opinion of the investigator, might affect macular edema

          5. History of any therapy (anti-VEGF treatment, focal/grid macular photocoagulation,
             intravitreous or peribulbar corticosteroids) for DME or diabetic retinopathy in the
             past 12 months.

          6. History of YAG capsulotomy performed within two months before enrollment.

          7. Aphakia.

          8. Evidence of uncontrolled glaucoma.

          9. Intraocular pressure must be &lt;25 mmHg, with no more than one topical glaucoma
             medication.
