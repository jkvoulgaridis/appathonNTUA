  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Regular bronchial clearance is essential in patients with cystic fibrosis for their bronchial
      health. SIMEOX® (Physio-Assist, Aix en Provence, France) is an innovative medical device for
      the drainage of the bronchial tree.

      By changing the rheological properties of mucus, SIMEOX® helps to mobilize secretions and
      assists their transport to the upper airways. This technology is based on fundamental
      research on bronchial mucus rheology. At the present time, SIMEOX® device is mainly used over
      a short period at the time or after an exacerbation in healthcare structures (hospitals,
      physiotherapy practices, post-care, and rehabilitation units, etc…). The clinical effects
      observed in the short term encourages long-term autonomous use by the patients themselves.

      The overall objective of this study is to evaluate the efficiency and acceptability of
      SIMEOX® used at home by the patient himself for bronchial clearance in patients with cystic
      fibrosis.
