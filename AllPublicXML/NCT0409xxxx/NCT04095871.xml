  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clean Intermittent Self-Catheterization (CISC) is a procedure of regularly emptying the
      bladder by introducing a single-use urinary catheter through the urethra. CISC are indicated
      in several situations in patients with neurological pathologies but also with urological or
      functional disorders.

      The announcement of the indication of CISC is often difficult and the acceptance of this
      therapy remains complicated, due to the invasive side, the dependence on a material and the
      time required to perform CISC.

      A few studies have assessed patient satisfaction and adherence to self-catheterization
      through quality of life questionnaires, but none have examined the impact of this technique
      on daily life through the duration of CISC.

      Primary aim is to evaluate the impact of time to perform CISC on patient adherence and
      satisfaction.

      Patients over 18 years old performed CISC for more than 1 month, exclusive or not, are
      included.

      History and treatment, age, professional activity, visuals disorders, technical aids for
      walking and the history of CISC with the date of initiation, the type of catheter, the
      carrier, the number of CISC per 24 hours, the position of realization, the use of a mirror
      and urethral sensitivity are recorded. Cognitive disorders, fatigue, psychological state,
      impact on quality of life are assessed on the day of the patient's consultation. The grip of
      the upper limbs is explored by Box and Block and Nine Hole Peg Test. The validated
      questionnaires,Intermittent Catheterization Satisfaction Questionnaire ( InCaSaQ),
      Intermittent Catheterization Difficulty Questionnaire (ICDQ), Intermittent Catheterization
      Adherence Scale (ICAS) are completed.

      At home, patients have to complete one calendar on the specific duration of a 24-hour
      self-catheterization and the next day a second calendar on the total duration of CISC

      Primary outcome is specific time of self-catheterization described by the timed duration from
      the moment when the circumstances of care are combined to carry it out : isolated place,
      nearby equipment.

      Secondary outcome is total time of self-catheterization described by the timed duration from
      the moment of the intention to self-catheter until the return to the initial activity.

      Influence of age, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), American Spinal Injury Association
      (ASIA), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (Moca), Fatigue Impact Scale (FIS), Box and Block and
      Nine Hole Peg Test, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Qualiveen
      Total,Intermittent Catheterization Satisfaction Questionnaire (InCaSaQ), Intermittent
      Catheterization Difficulty Questionnaire (ICDQ), Intermittent Catheterization Adherence Scale
      (ICAS) on time of self-catheterization are analysis.
