  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, open-label, randomized, single-dose, three-period cross-over study
      in healthy participants. The aim of this study is to provide clinically relevant information
      on the pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety profile of a new lower dose formulation ambrisentan
      (AMB) tablet, which is intended for pediatric use. The study will compare the relative
      bioavailability of the lower dose tablet, dispersed in water and administered orally, with
      the reference marketed AMB tablet in healthy adults. The total study duration for each
      participant is expected to be approximately 9 weeks.
