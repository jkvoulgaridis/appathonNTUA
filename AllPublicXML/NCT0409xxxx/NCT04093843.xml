      The purpose of this study is to find alternative treatments for patient's suffering from
      depression after having a stroke.This study aims to show that accelerated rTMS is a safe,
      effective,and convenient treatment for patient's suffering from post-stroke depression in the
      acute to subacute phase. This will be an open label trial and thus all participants will
      receive the active rTMS intervention.

      The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

        1. To assess the efficacy TMS in PSD. We hypothesize that there will be a decrease in the
           HAMD score in patients receiving TMS

        2. To assess the feasibility of an accelerated protocol using rTMS in patients with acute
           to subacute stroke and co-existing PSD. We hypothesize that the accelerated protocol
           will promote compliance in our patient population and that the administration of this
           intervention is feasible.

        3. To assess the safety of rTMS in patients with acute to subacute stroke. We hypothesize
           that the side effects of TMS will be minimal and the therapy will be well-tolerated and
           safe in individuals with recent strokes and co-existing PSD.
