  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study two different tablets for oral use of a known investigational medicinal
      product, called semaglutide, will be tested. One is the current formulation and the other one
      is a new formulation of semaglutide. Both will be administered as a tablet and are for the
      treatment of diabetes. Currently, semaglutide is only prescribed as injections for the
      treatment of diabetes in some countries. The aim of this study is to find out if the dosage
      strength of the current formulation of semaglutide can be reduced in the new tablet
      formulation. For this purpose, it will be measured how much semaglutide is taken up in the
      body from the two (2) different tablet formulations each with three (3) different dosage
      strengths. The tablet version of the study medicine is a new medicine that cannot yet be
      prescribed. Participants will either get semaglutide in the current tablet formulation
      previously tested in many large studies, or get the tablet that contains semaglutide in a new
      formulation - which treatment is decided by chance. Participants will get one tablet per day
      over 4 weeks in each of the 3 treatment periods (i.e. treatment in a total of 12 weeks). The
      tablets should be taken in the morning together with half a glass of water (120 mL), after an
      overnight fast of at least 6 hours (no food or drinks). Furthermore, water is not allowed
      from 2 hours before dosing. After dosing participants must wait 30 minutes before they may
      eat or drink. At home, participants must take their breakfast 30-45 minutes after dosing.
