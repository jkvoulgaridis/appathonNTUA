  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of standard of care combined with
      physical training versus standard of care during hospital admission in patients hospitalized
      with community acquired pneumonia
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pneumonia is the 5th main cause of hospital admission in DK with almost 50.000
      hospitalizations annually. Despite increased focus on mobilization, hospital admission is
      associated with bed rest, which have pronounced negative consequences on functional capacity,
      body composition and glucose metabolism. In frail surgical patients, bed rest and lack of
      physical rehabilitation during admission increases the risk of readmissions, morbidity, and
      mortality.

      This study is a randomized controlled trial, which investigates the impact of physical
      training during hospital admission in adult patients hospitalized with community-acquired
      pneumonia (CAP) compared to standard of care.
