  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity prevention programs in schools are essential to promoting healthy lifestyles. There
      are programs with positive effects on obesity parameters, but only a few of them have
      didactic material for its dissemination. In United States they have effective programs (with
      materials for their implementation) and some are already being implemented in different
      schools. In Mexico our study group has developed a program called &quot;Planet Nutrition&quot; that
      includes a manual.The main aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the program
      &quot;Planet Nutrition&quot;—a nutrition education and behaviour change program— on BMI Z score in
      school children compared to a control group at 9 weeks. This pilot stud is a randomized
      controlled trial. The study will be conducted with 41 participants. The primary outcome was
      the change in the BMI Z score from baseline to 9 weeks. Secondary outcomes were the changes
      from baseline to 9 weeks in body fat percentage, waist circumference, systolic and diastolic
      blood pressure, consumption of healthy and unhealthy food, physical activity and sedentary
      lifestyle, cardiorespiratory capacity and nutrition knowledge. Additionally BMI Z score will
      be measured at 21 weeks, after the summer vacations. Considering evidence that this period
      could have a negative impact on children´s weight.

    <description>A food consumption frequency questionnaire was used. It consisted in 12 cualitative questions that include different groups of food: fruits, vegetables, cereals and grains, legumes, dairy products, animal food, processed meats, fats and oil, sweetened beverages, snacks, candies and pastries. The options of the answers was: never or less than once a week, weekly or at least once a week, daily or at least once a day.</description>

    <description>It was measured by the Course Navette test to estimate the maxium oxygen consumption (Vo2 Max).The participants traveled a distance of 20 meters round trips, at the rhythm of a recording sound. The test is in one minute stages and the speed increases (0.85 km / h to 0.5 km / h). The participants were stopping when they felt tired. The test was carried out by the physical activity team of the study.</description>

    <description>- Nutrition education: It consists of 18 sessions of one hour, twice a week. Previously a nutrition manual with 26 topics was designed for these sessions. Behavior change strategies were used.The sessions were implemented by Nutrition interns.
- Physical activity sessions: There were designed and implemented by profesionals in the area. About 20 sessions of one hour, three times per week were provided.
- Parents information: Nine informational flyers with different topics of nutrition and health were sent.</description>
