  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized clinical trial is to determine the effectiveness of
      Battlefield Acupuncture (BFA) in addition to standard post-surgical shoulder physical therapy
      compared to a standard shoulder rehabilitation program in reducing medication use and pain in
      patients who have undergone shoulder surgery. Measurements of medication (opioid, NSAID,
      acetaminophen, etc.) use (daily number of pills consumed), pain rating, patient specific
      functional scale and global rating of change will be taken at 24-hours (baseline), 48-hours,
      72-hours, 1-week, and 4-weeks post-surgery. It is hypothesized that the inclusion of
      Battlefield Acupuncture will result in a decrease in post-surgical pain levels, reduced
      opioid medication use, and improved patient mood when compared to rehabilitation alone.

    <description>The POMS consists of 65 measures of mood organized into 6 mood scales: tension-anxiety, depression-dejection, anger-hostility, vigor-activity, fatigue-inertia, and confusion-bewilderment. Individual scales are combined to achieve the mood disturbance score (MDS), an aggregate indicator of overall mood. A greater MDS value indicates greater mood disturbance.</description>

    <description>Battlefield Acupuncture (BFA), an auricular acupuncture protocol developed in 2001 by Dr. Niemtzow (Ret. Colonel, USAF), is widely used among civilian and military medical providers to treat pain. Participants in the Experimental Group will receive BFA in addition to standard post-surgical rehabilitation up to four times following their shoulder surgery: 24-hours, 48-hours, 72-hours, and 1-week post-surgery.</description>
