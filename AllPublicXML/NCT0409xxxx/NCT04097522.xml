    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effectiveness of neurofeedback (teaching participants to gain
      control over their own brainwaves) in chronic pain. The study is made up of four pilot
      studies. Participants who take part will undergo the cold pressor test, submerging their hand
      in cold water in order to simulate chronic pain. Brain activity will be measured using
      electroencephalography (EEG).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain is a persisting pain which often exists in the absence of detectable tissue
      damage. It is also associated with feelings of depression, anxiety, and despair. Current
      treatments for chronic pain usually involves drug treatments, which often has unwanted side
      effects.

      This study aims to assess the effectiveness of neurofeedback, which refers to teaching
      participants to gain control over their own brainwaves, as an intervention to treat chronic
      pain. It is believed that by teaching participants to gain control over a brain signal
      associated with pain resilience, the participant can reduce some of the negative effects
      associated with chronic pain.

      Participants who take part in this study will have their brain activity recorded using
      electroencephalography (EEG), and have pain elicited using the cold pressor test (CPT), which
      involves the participant submerging their wrist in cold water to elicit a chronic pain-like
      sensation. This is a safe, regularly used method, and the participant is free to remove their
      hand early if the pain becomes too great.

      Some participants who take part will undergo neurofeedback training, which will involve them
      viewing a signal associated with pain resilience, and learning to increase it over multiple
      sessions.

    <intervention_model_description>Half of the participants that take part in the neurofeedback procedures will receive sham neurofeedback, whilst the other half will receive neurofeedback from an area the investigators believe to be associated with increasing pain resilience. Participants may or may not receive sham neurofeedback, and will be made aware of this fact.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>A number of the studies include double-blind neurofeedback, where half of the participants receive sham neurofeedback, and half receive actual neurofeedback from a region thought to increase pain resilience. The experimenter, participant, and care provider will all be blinded as to which condition the participant is in until the participant leaves the study.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in pain ratings</measure>
    <time_frame>Throughout the participant's time in the study, approximately 8-16 weeks. (16 sessions which occur approximately twice per week,depending on participant's availability.).</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will monitor changes in pain ratings, which are ratings of current pain level, given on a scale from 0-10 using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). These ratings will be given by participants while undergoing the experimental procedures in the study.</description>

    <measure>Smartphone app measures of changes in of chronic pain-related symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Throughout the participant's time in the study, an average of 12 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants may be given a smartphone app with which to record their current chronic pain levels using sliders.

Participants will be free to choose whether to use this or not.</description>
