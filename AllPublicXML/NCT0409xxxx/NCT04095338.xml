      The final goals of the present study is to propose a new approach in the hip fracture
      rehabilitation in elderly subjects, focused on the use of robotic device and to check the
      results not only at the end of the treatment but also in the long term, foreseeing 3
      follow-up.

    <textblock>
      Balance and deficit in walking are some of the main characteristics of aging and are
      considered among the risk factors for falls. Falls are a risk factor for future falls and are
      associated with other adverse health outcomes such as fear of falling or fractures. In
      particular, hip fracture in aged patients is an important health problem. In fact, one in
      three patients dies within the first year after injury, while survivors have poor quality of
      life For this reason, the development of prevention tools and innovative strategies in the
      rehabilitation field should be one of the main objectives in the treatment of the diseases
      afflicting the elderly, such as hip fractures. Effective interventions to promote hip
      recovery post hip fracture are characterized by intensive and repetitive movements. One
      treatment approach to increase number of steps during rehabilitation sessions and to improve
      the balance and the endurance of the patients is the use of robotic systems.

      This study is a randomized controlled trial. A total of 195 patients with hip fractures will
      be recruited and randomly divided into three groups, to receive a traditional rehabilitation
      program or a robotic rehabilitation in addition to the traditional therapy. Assessments will
      be performed at baseline, at the end of treatment and 6 months, 1 year and 2 years from the
      end of the treatment. For the study, post-hospitalization subjects will be taken into
      consideration, after four weeks from the hospitalization. A 20 treatment sessions will be
      conducted, divided into 3 training sessions per week, for 7 weeks. The control group will
      perform traditional therapy sessions lasting 50 minutes. The technological intervention group
      will carry out 30 minutes of traditional therapy and 20 minutes of treatment with a robotic
      system.

    <description>falling risk will be evaluated by the Tinetti performance oriented mobility assessment (POMA). POMA test has two subscales, Balance and Gait sections. Total score is obtained by adding the scores of the two subscales (balance + gait) . Total score &lt; 19 high fall risk, total score 19-24 medium fall risk, total score 25-28 low fall risk</description>

    <description>Each session will include 30 minutes of traditional physical rehabilitation therapy followed by 20 minutes of robotic training by Tymo system (Tyromotion, Austria), a wireless platform for the balance and the postural control training that simulates floor walking and stairs climbing. Tymo system is connected to a screen and provides virtual reality games, adaptable to the functional capacity of the patient. Through the games proposed, the physiotherapist will decide to work in a dimension (antero-posterior or medio-lateral dimension) or in two dimensions (combining the antero-posterior and medio-lateral movements).</description>

Patients will be asked to walk at a comfortable speed, while the physiotherapist will be able to work on different parameters such as step length, load distribution, and step height. The setting will take place taking into account the clinical conditions of each patient, customizing the intervention. The Walker View will offer visual and auditory feedback to the patient, so as to correct gait in real time.</description>
