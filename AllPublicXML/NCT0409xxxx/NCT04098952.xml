      This study aims to know the short-term effects of electric massage applied to the cervical
      region combined with local techniques on the temporomandibular joint versus an intervention
      that applies only local techniques in subjects diagnosed with temporomandibular disorders.

      This is an experimental study with a sample size of 42 subjects randomly divided into two
      groups: the control group, who underwent techniques of ischemic compression and decompression
      of temporals at the local level, and the intervention group, which, in addition to the
      techniques applied to the The control group is given an electric massage at the cervical
      level. Pre-and post-intervention levels of oral opening, Pressure Pain Threshold (PDU),
      perceived pain intensity and cervical range of motion were assessed. The assessments were
      made before the intervention, immediately after and after 4 weeks of follow-up.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in the assessment of the maximum amplitude of the vertical opening of the mouth:</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after the intervention as well as 4 weeks after the intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>The maximum vertical opening of the mouth was measured using a manual gauge. The measurements were taken with the subjects placed in the supine position on the stretcher, with the head resting on it, the cervical spine in a neutral position, knees slightly bent and the upper limbs extended along the body.
In this position, we ask participants to open their mouths as much as possible without causing pain. In this way, we obtain the measurement in millimeters the distance between the upper and lower central incisors.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in the assessment of pain intensity: VAS</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after the intervention as well as 4 weeks after the intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>To measure pain, the visual analog scale (VAS) has been used. The VAS scale is an instrument used very often to quantify the intensity of pain. The accuracy and validity of the EVA scale as a measure of pain has been demonstrated previously.
Participants were asked to indicate the degree of pain intensity in response to manual palpation of the central trigger point of the masseter bilaterally using a 10 cm analogue visual scale where 0 corresponds to &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 to &quot;worst pain&quot; that you can imagine. &quot; When performing the post-treatment assessment, a period of 1 minute of rest was left to prevent the change of position from influencing the data obtained, especially in the displacements of the pressure center.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in the valuation of pain threshold to pressure.</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after the intervention as well as 4 weeks after the intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>To measure the pain threshold to the pressure in muscle trigger points, a manual algometer with 1 cm2 of contact area was used. The algometer serves to record the minimum amount of pressure needed for the sensation of pressure to change to a sensation of pain. When this moment arrives, the subject will say &quot;already&quot; and the algometer immediately withdrawn, the pressure being recorded. The results obtained will be expressed in kg / cm2 (1,8).
The muscles assessed were masseter and superior trapezius, both bilaterally in the supine position. The pressure in both must be done in a direction perpendicular to the muscle fibers. In the case of the upper trapezius, the algometer will be placed on the trigger point 1 described by Travell and Simons (9). In the masseter, the pressure perpendicular to the algometer will be applied on the central trigger point of the superficial portion of said muscle as described by Travell.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in the assessment of cervical range of motion.</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after the intervention as well as 4 weeks after the intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>The goniometry is used to evaluate the range of joint movement. The range of cervical movement can be evaluated with many instruments, but the goniometer offers a simple and low cost alternative for evaluation.
In this case, for the measurement of the range of cervical movement we will use a universal goniometer that presents a scale of measurement in degrees. The patient will be placed in a sitting position in a chair and we will give him the order to perform the movement to be evaluated. The movements to be evaluated will be right and left rotation, flexion, extension and right and left inclination. We will prevent the patient from making compensations with other body regions.</description>
