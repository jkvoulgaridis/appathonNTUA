    <textblock>
      Phase 1 will evaluate the safety and tolerability at different dose levels of repotrectinib
      in pediatric and young adult subjects with advanced or metastatic malignancies harboring
      anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), receptor tyrosine kinase encoded by the gene ROS1 (ROS1),
      or neurotrophic receptor kinase genes encoding TRK kinase family (NTRK1-3) alterations to
      estimate the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) or Maximum Administered Dose (MAD) and select the
      Pediatric Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D).

      Phase 2 will determine the anti-tumor activity of repotrectinib in pediatric subjects with
      advanced or metastatic malignancies harboring ALK, ROS1, or NTRK1-3 alterations.

      Enrollment of subjects into Phase 1 will proceed concurrently by age as follows:

        -  Subjects 4 to &lt;12 years old will initially be enrolled in the Phase 1 part to determine
           the pediatric RP2D for this age group; once the pediatric RP2D is determined, subjects
           age 4 to &lt;12 years old may be enrolled into the Phase 2 part of the study.

        -  Subjects 12 to 25 years old will be directly enrolled into the Phase 2 part concurrent
           with Phase 1 enrollment.

      Phase 1:

      Approximately 12 pediatric subjects with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors,
      including a primary central nervous system (CNS) tumor, or anaplastic large cell lymphoma
      (ALCL), with disease progression or who are non-responsive or intolerant to available
      therapies and for which no standard or available curative therapy exists.

      Phase 2:

      Subjects will be enrolled in one of 3 cohorts as follows:

      Cohort 1: approximately 10-20 subjects with solid tumors characterized by NTRK fusion, TRK
      tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-naïve, and centrally confirmed measurable disease at
      baseline.

      Cohort 2: approximately 23 subjects with solid tumors characterized by NTRK fusion, TRK
      TKI-pretreated, and centrally confirmed measurable disease at baseline.

      Cohort 3: approximately 20 subjects with solid tumors or ALCL characterized by other
      ALK/ROS1/NTRK alterations or NTRK fusions without centrally confirmed measurable disease not
      otherwise eligible for Cohort 1 or 2.

                  QT syndrome, or any concomitant medication known to prolong the QT interval

          6. Peripheral neuropathy of CTCAE ≥grade 2.
