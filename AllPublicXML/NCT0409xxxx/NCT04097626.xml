      Subjects will complete an InBody test, demographic and physical activity survey, and
      food-frequency questionnaire via Qualtrics. Also, subjects may participate in a focus group
      and an individual interview.

      A minimum of 150 minutes of moderate exercise required each week and must be spread out in at
      least 2 days.

      Over the course of the study, subjects will complete InBody assessments, Food Frequency
      Questionnaire (items subjects are eating before, during, and after the investigator's study),
      and possible focus group questions (open-ended questions about thoughts and perceptions on
      exercise, nutrition knowledge, and health and nutrition history).

    <description>Body fat percentage will be tested using the InBody 770. This test will take less than 5 minutes to complete. The InBody 770 calculates the measured data using bioelectrical impedance. The testing will be done in the morning around the same time for each participant. Participants will be asked to refrain from eating or drinking that morning to be able to get the most accurate reading.</description>
