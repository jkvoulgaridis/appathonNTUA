  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      African American women 50 years of age and older with depressive symptoms, pain and
      difficulty with mobility will participate in the DAPPER intervention study that includes 8
      nurse visits in participants' homes to help participants with participants' pain and mood.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed intervention is called Depression and Pain Perseverance through Empowered
      Recovery (DAPPER). The investigators are adapting the Get Busy Get Better intervention by
      adding components (e.g. nurse visits and person directed goals) from the CAPABLE study for
      this intervention. The investigator will further develop the intervention through this
      two-phase pilot test. The aims of this pilot project are to 1) test the Depression and Pain
      Perseverance through Empowered Recovery (DAPPER) program for feasibility and acceptability.
      Specifically, the investigators will test the effect size of DAPPER on pain and depressive
      symptoms from baseline to 12 weeks (compare intervention to wait list control group) and then
      at 24 weeks to compare the intervention group to wait list control group once again. 2)
      estimate preliminary effect sizes for DAPPER in reduction pain and depressive symptoms, 3)
      measure effect sizes and feasibility of measuring cytokines and heart rate variability (HRV).

    <description>The DAPPER program is person directed and will consist of 8 nurse visits during which the nurse assesses each participant for pain, depression and frailty and then implements a manualized individually tailored intervention. Participants will be randomized into either the intervention or the wait list control group. Once the intervention group has completed the intervention group's visits, the wait list control group will begin the waitlist control group's visits. All participants will all be offered the same information and format of nurse visits. The nurses will systematically tailor the content of the visits to the participants' risk profile and goals based on protocols. All participants will be assessed at the start of the study, at 12 weeks and 24 weeks.</description>
