  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      IVC filters are mechanical filters placed in a patient's body to trap blood clots in the legs
      migrating to the lungs. When no longer indicated, interventional radiologists are consulted
      for IVC filter removal. Currently, many methods for extracting IVC filters exist. Two of the
      most common methods involve using an endovascular snare device or rigid forceps. We intend to
      prospectively compare these two methods in an attempt to see if one offers an advantage to
      the other. This will be compared by evaluating success rates and procedure time.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently the optimal method for IVC filter retrieval with respect to success rate and
      fluoroscopic time (i.e. radiation exposure) is poorly understood. Both snare and forcep
      techniques have independently evaluated in literature but have never been compared directly.
      The proposed study would prospectively assess whether one of these established technique
      offers an advantage with respect to either of these variables.

One month after filter retrieval, patients will be seen in clinic for follow-up. During this visit, a physicial assessment will done, including adverse events and review of medications.
Six months after filter retrieval, patient will be contacted by telephone for follow-up. Adverse event and medication review will be performed during this call.</description>

    <description>In the clinic, it will be explained to patient that they are asked to participate in a study that would randomize them to one of two established techniques for IVC filter removal. It will be explained these are both techniques that are used by interventional radiologists normally used for IVC filter retrieval.
One technique would be the utilization of an endovascular snare (like a lasso) device that is designed to catch the hook of the filter and allow it to be captured.
The other technique described will be the usage of a rigid forceps device that will be used to engage the filter apex directly and allow for the filter to be capture/removed.</description>
