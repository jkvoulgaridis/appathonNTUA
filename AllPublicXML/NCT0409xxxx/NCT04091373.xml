  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open label, cross-over study in healthy adult subjects to investigate
      cotadutide exposure after subcutaneous injection at 3 different anatomical sites. The study
      will be conducted at a single US center. Each subject will be randomized to receive a single
      SC dose of 100 μg cotadutide via a pen device according to 6 sequences of dosing. Each SC
      injection will be administered by a health care provider at a different injection site (arm,
      thigh, or abdomen) in each period. SC injection in the abdomen will be used as the reference
      treatment to determine the relative PK of cotadutide 100 μg SC injections in the arm and
      thigh. Each SC injection of cotadutide will be separated by 7 days washout. Blood samples for
      PK analyses of cotadutide will be taken pre dose and at 11 time points up to 48 hours after
      dosing (Days 3, 10, and 17).

          1. Healthy subjects aged 18 through 60 years (inclusive) at the time of screening.

          2. Electronic and/or written informed consent obtained from the subject prior to
             performing any protocol-related procedures, including screening evaluations.

          3. BMI between 19 and 30 kg/m2 (inclusive) at screening.

          4. Good general health as judged by the investigator, based on medical history, physical
             examination including 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG), vital signs, and blood and
             urinary laboratory assessments.

          5. Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine
             pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to the start of investigational product, and must
             not be breastfeeding.

          6. Female subjects of childbearing potential who are sexually active with a male partner
             must be using at least one highly effective method of contraception from screening and
             up to 4 weeks after the last dose of investigational product. As applicable, at least
             one method must be in effect prior to receiving the first dose of investigational
             product.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of, or any existing condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would
             interfere with evaluation of the investigational product, put the subject at risk,
             influence the subject's ability to participate, or affect interpretation of subject
             safety or study results.

          2. Inflammatory bowel disease, gastroparesis or other severe disease or surgery affecting
             the upper GI tract, which may affect gastric emptying or could affect the
             interpretation of safety and tolerability data.

          3. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; eGFR will be
             determined by the chronic kidney disease - epidemiology collaboration (CKD-EPI)
             equation.

          4. BP and heart rate in supine position outside the ranges of 90 140 mmHg systolic, 50-90
             mmHg diastolic and heart rate 40-100 beats/min following a 10 minute rest period.

          5. Active hepatitis B, measured by positive tests of surface antigen HBsAg and/or active
             hepatitis C, measured by positive hepatitis C virus antibody tests.

          6. Positive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies.

          7. Subjects with a history of acute or chronic pancreatitis.

          8. Subjects with a history of medullary thyroid carcinoma or multiple endocrine neoplasia
             syndrome type 2, and subjects with a screening/baseline serum calcitonin ≥ 50 ng/L.

             Alternatively, AST ≥ 5 × ULN, ALT ≥ 5 × ULN, or TBL ≥ 2 × ULN regardless of signs and
             symptoms. An isolated increase in TBL in subjects with known Gilbert's syndrome is not
             a reason for exclusion.

         10. Symptoms of acutely decompensated blood glucose control (eg, thirst, polyuria, weight
             loss), a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus or diabetic ketoacidosis.

             products.

         13. Use of any prescription or nonprescription medication, with the exception of permitted
             concomitant medications, within the last 72 hours prior to Day 1.

         15. Current smoker of cigarettes or other tobacco products.

         16. Habitual excessive consumption of methylxanthine containing (theophylline, caffeine,
             or theobromine) beverages and foods (eg, coffee, tea, red bull, cola, chocolate) as
             judged by the investigator.

         17. Blood donation within the last 3 months.

         18. Participation in any other study investigating other products or involving blood
             sampling within the past 30 days.

         19. Potentially noncompliant or uncooperative, as judged by the investigator.

         20. Substance dependence likely to impact subject safety or compliance with study
             procedures, to include a positive test result for drugs of abuse and/or alcohol at
             screening or prior to administration of investigational product on Day 1.

         21. Psychiatric illness such that subjects have been committed to an institution by way of
             official or judicial order.

         22. Involvement of any AstraZeneca, MedImmune, the contract research organization, or the
             study center employee or their close relatives.
