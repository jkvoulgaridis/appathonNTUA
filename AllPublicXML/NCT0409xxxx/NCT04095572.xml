  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Urological pathogens are effected by rising antimicrobial resistance rates due to the
      frequent use of antimicrobials for treatment and prophylaxis. Intravesical instillation with
      hyaluronic acid (HA) and chondroitin sulphate (CS) obtained positive outcomes in the
      treatment of overactive bladder, radiation cystitis and interstitial cystitis by
      replenishment of the glycosaminoglycan layer of the bladder. This study is to investigate
      whether intravesical instillation with HA-CS in patients with recurrent urinary tract
      infections (rUTI) is superior to a placebo instillation in terms of reduction of rate of
      symptomatic urinary tract infections (UTIs) (based on clinical diagnosis) needing treatment
      with antimicrobials within 12 months after randomisation.

    <description>Change in Acute Cystitis Symptom Score (ACSS). The first part of the ACSS questionnaire consists of 14 questions. The first 6 questions assess typical symptoms of UTI: frequency, urgency, pain and burning during urination, sensation of incomplete bladder emptying, pain/discomfort in the lower abdomen, visible hematuria. Each question concerning urinary symptoms allows the patient to choose one out of four answers indicating increasing severity of the particular symptom. The answers are assigned points from 0 to 3. The score can range between 0 and 18. It has been validated and a score ≥ 6 seems to be very indicative for the diagnosis of an UTI.</description>

    <time_frame>prior to randomisation and at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PUF questionnaire consists of 12 questions. The first two questions allow the patient to choose one out of five answers (points 0-3), the following questions one out of four (points 0-3) indicating increasing severity of the particular symptom. Seven of the questions concern symptoms (total count 23), four questions are part of the bother score (total count 12). Total score consists of symptom score and bother score (total count 35). The change of the score is calculated by subtracting the score at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months from the score at enrolment</description>

    <measure>Change in QoL Short Form (SF)-36 score</measure>
    <time_frame>prior to randomisation and at 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The QoL SF-36 consists of 36 items including eight independent scales and two main dimensions 35 of the items are compressed into eight multi-item scales: (1) physical functioning is a ten-question scale; (2) role-physical is a four-item scale; (3) bodily pain is a two-item scale; (4) general health is a five-item scale; (5) vitality is a four-item scale; (6) social functioning is a two-item scale; (7) role-emotional is a three-item scale; and (8) mental health is a five-item scale. Hence, in the SF-36 scoring system, the scales are assessed quantitatively, each on the basis of answers to two to ten multiple choice questions, and a score between 0 and 100 is then calculated on the basis of well-defined guidelines, with a higher score indicating a better state of health. The change of the score is calculated by subtracting the score at 12 month from the score at enrolment.</description>
