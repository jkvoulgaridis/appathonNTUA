    <textblock>
      This study will explore whether the use of a medication, Ketamine, can help patients who come
      to the ER with thoughts of suicide by improving their mood and reducing thoughts of suicide.
      Ketamine has been used for this purpose in patients who have been hospitalized, but it has
      not been well studied in the ER. The investigators are first trying to show that patients and
      doctors in the ER find the treatment acceptable. The investigators also hope to determine
      whether Ketamine is effective in decreasing the severity of patient's suicidal thinking while
      in the ER. If this treatment works, future studies will look at whether it can help patients
      be discharged from the hospital earlier.

      Research Procedures: Patients will be enrolled into the study on a voluntary basis after the
      research assistant has fully explained all the risks and benefits of the study (informed
      consent). Research assistants, Emergency Department staff, and the Psychiatry team will help
      identify patients for the study. Patients will be asked to complete surveys measuring the
      degree of their suicidal thinking and mood. Additional information will be collected on
      patients such as their demographics, current medications, and medical problems. Patients in
      the study will receive the medication, Ketamine, which will be given through an intravenous
      catheter (IV) at a dose based on the patient's weight and slowly infused over 40 minutes.
      Patients will be monitored during their stay in the Emergency Department by Emergency
      Department physicians and nurses for any signs of side effects to the medication. Patients
      will be asked to complete several surveys at specific time periods after the administration
      of Ketamine. All patients in the study will receive usual psychiatric care in addition to the
      study medication.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mood disorders complicated by suicidal ideation (SI) are common among patients presenting to
      the Emergency Department (ED). Under current standard practice, patients awaiting psychiatric
      evaluation in the emergency department do not typically receive interventions to address
      their mood disorder or SI. With no end to the extended ED boarding of psychiatric patients in
      sight, improvements in the acute treatment of SI with ketamine may help more patients receive
      prompt and appropriate treatment. Low-dose ketamine has been well studied in psychiatric
      literature. Studies involving a single dose of ketamine are promising, demonstrating both
      immediate and sustained reductions in suicidal ideations. Low dose ketamine has been
      well-studied in the ED for pain, asthma, and agitation, but not mood disorders or SI.

      This study aims to determine whether or not it is feasible to administer low dose ketamine in
      the emergency department for the management of mood disorders with SI. Feasibility of
      ketamine administration in the ED and will be determined by: (1) ability to recruit
      participants, (2) tolerability of the intervention, and (3) acceptability by
      patients/providers. The investigators will also explore whether the administration of
      ketamine results in improvements in mood and SI.

      This prospective open label feasibility pilot study will enroll 20 participants to receive
      ketamine at 0.5mg/kg infused intravenously over 40 minutes. Patients that have active
      suicidal ideation as determined by psychiatry staff who are being admitted to psychiatry
      under voluntary certification will be eligible for the study. The investigators will assess
      self-reported mood and suicidal ideations pre- and post-infusion of ketamine. Participants
      will complete assessments at baseline (pre-infusion), 2 hours and 6 hours post-infusion, and
      daily while in the ED until inpatient disposition.

      The investigators hypothesize ketamine administration will be feasible in the emergency
      department and will result in improved mood and decreased SI.
