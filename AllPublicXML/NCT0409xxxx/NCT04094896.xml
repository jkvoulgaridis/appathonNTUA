    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety ofTCHP
      (docetaxel/carboplatin/trastuzumab/Pertuzumab) and EC followed by
      THP(epirubicin/cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxe plus trastuzumab/Pertuzumab)regimens as
      Neoadjuvant Treatment in HER2- Positive breast cancer. The endpoint of pathologic complete
      response is used as a surrogate marker for survival. Safety and tolerability assessed by
      number of grade 4 toxicities and hospitalizations.

      Both TCHP (docetaxel/carboplatin/trastuzumab/Pertuzumab) and EC followed by
      THP(epirubicin/cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxe plus trastuzumab/Pertuzumab)regimens as
      Neoadjuvant Treatment for HER2-Positive Breast Cancer have been recommended by NCCN
      guideline. It is unknown which regimen is better. This study is to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety ofTCHP (docetaxel/carboplatin/trastuzumab/Pertuzumab) and EC followed by

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  • Histologically or cytologically confirmed HER2 positive invasive breast carcinoma

               -  Clinical stage #-#B

               -  Patients must have measurable disease as defined by palpable lesion with both
                  diameters ≥2cm measurable with caliper and/or a positive mammogram or ultrasound
                  with at least one dimension ≥2cm. Bilateral mammogram and clip placement is
                  required for study entry. Baseline measurements of the indicator lesions must be
                  recorded on the Patient Registration Form. To be valid for baseline, the
                  measurements must have been made within the 14 days if palpable. If not palpable,
                  a mammogram or MRI must be done within 14 days. If palpable, a mammogram or MRI
                  must be done within 2 months prior to study entry. If clinically indicated, xrays
                  and scans must be done within 28 days of study entry.

               -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group(ECOG) performance status 0 to 1 within 14 days
                  of study entry

               -  Normal (greater than 50%) left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) by
                  echocardiography

        bilirubin &lt; upper limit of normal Creatinine &lt; 1.5 mg/dL or calculated cranial cruciate
        ligament (CrCL) &gt;50mL/min using the Cockcroft Gault equation serum glutamate oxaloacetate
        transaminase(SGOT)(AST) or serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase(SGPT)(ALT) and Alkaline
        Phosphatase must be within the range allowing for eligibility

          -  Patients must be over 18 years old.

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test performed
             within 7 days prior to the start of treatment

          -  Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (barrier method of birth control) prior to study entry and for the duration of study
             participation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  • Metastatic disease

               -  Prior chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, biologic therapy, investigational agent,
                  targeted therapy or radiation therapy for current breast cancer. Patients with
                  history of breast cancer greater than 5 years from initial diagnosis are eligible
                  for the study. Patients may not have received anthracycline-based chemotherapy in
                  the past. Patients with history of ductal carcinoma in situ(DCIS) are eligible if
                  there were treated with surgery alone.

               -  History of previous or current malignancy at other sites with the exception of
                  adequately treated carcinoma in-situ of the cervix or basal or squamous cell
                  carcinoma of the skin. Patients with a history of other malignancies, who remain
                  disease free for greater than five years are eligible.
