  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, multi-center, factorial clinical trial to study the
      effectiveness of cerebral and peripheral electrical stimulation on pain and functional
      limitations associated with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). The study subjects will be randomly
      into four groups; (1) active trans-cranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) + active
      trans-cutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), (2) active tDCS + sham TENS, (3) sham
      tDCS + active TENS and (4) sham tDCS + sham TENS. The patient will be assessed by Brief Pain
      Inventory (BPI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), The Douleur Neuropathique en 4 questions
      (DN4), Quantitative sensory testing (QST), Pain Pressure Test (PPT) with algometer,
      Conditioned pain modulation (CPM), Patient ratings of improvement, or worsening, of the pain
      condition, Quality of Life short-form (SF)-36, Visual Analog Mood Scale (VAMS), Mini Mental
      Status Exam (MMSE) and Adverse Events Questionnaire (AEs). This study aims to investigate
      whether cerebral and peripheral electrical stimulation combined are more effective in
      relieving pain and functional limitations than the separate application of electrical
      stimulation in patients with CTS.

      The study will be carried out on patients attending (1) Physical Medicine, Rheumatology and
      Rehabilitation outpatient clinic in Suez Canal University Hospital, Ismailia, EGYPT, (2)
      Hiroshima University, (3) Department of Physical Medicine &amp; Rehabilitation, Juan Ramón
      Jiménez University Hospital, Huelva, Spain, and (4) University of Sherbrooke, Canada and
      diagnosed with CTS according to clinical examination and to the American Association of
      Neuromuscular and Electrodiagnostic Medicine (AANEM) practice recommendations for CTS.

      Study subjects will be divided into four groups:

      Group (1): (active comparator = tDCS-real (r) + TENS-r) will include 45 patients with CTS and
      will receive active anodal tDCS of M1 for 20 minutes, at 2 mA plus active TENS (the cathode
      will be placed on the carpal ligament, and the anode electrodes on the palmar area of the
      hand) for 20 minutes, and a total of 15 sessions for 3 weeks (5 per week) will be completed.

      Group (2): (experimental group= tDCS-r + TENS-sham (s)) will include 45 patients with CTS and
      will receive active tDCS M1 for 20 minutes plus sham TENS for 20 minutes, and a total of 15
      sessions for 3 weeks (5 per week).

      Group (3): (experimental group= tDCS-s + TENS-r) will include 45 patients with CTS and will
      receive sham tDCS M1 for 20 minutes (the set will be turned off after 30 seconds) plus active
      TENS for 20 minutes, and a total of 15 sessions for 3 weeks (5 per week).

      Group (4): (sham comparator = tDCS-s + TENS-s) will include 45 patients with CTS and will
      receive sham tDCS M1 for 20 minutes (the set will be turned off after 30 seconds) plus sham
      TENS for 20 minutes, and a total of 15 sessions for 3 weeks (5 per week).

      The study sample will be collected from all patients with CTS fulfilling the eligibility
      criteria, will be eligible to join the study (either referred for electrophysiological study
      or presented to the clinic for primary assessment). To make sure that no bias should enter
      the assessment of the results, neither the patient nor the clinicians will be aware whether
      active tDCS/TENS will be applied to a particular case. To ensure this result, one symbol of
      these four symbols (square, circle, star and triangle) will be applied to one group of the
      four groups in the physiotherapy sheet and only the physiotherapist knew the key for each
      symbol. At the end of the study, the four groups will be revealed in order to analyze the
      results according to proper statistical measures.

    <description>A short, self-report questionnaire includes 4 items that assess pain intensity (pain right now, pain on average in last 24 hours, worst pain in last 24 hours, and least pain in last 24 hours) using an NRS from 0 (no pain) to 10 (pain as bad as can imagine). The mean of these 4 pain items will be used as primary outcome. The BPI also includes 7 items that assess the impact of the pain on functioning using a 0 (no interference) to 10 (complete interference) rating scale, which will be used as a secondary outcome.</description>

    <measure>Quantitative sensory testing (QST)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Semmes-Weinstein Monofilament test kit will be used to evaluate sensory thresholds of the tips of the thumb, the index, and the middle fingers. The kit consists of 20 flexible nylon monofilaments of varying diameter and length to measure the level of skin touch sensation. The monofilaments have log numbers from 1.65 to 6.65 which begins with the light filaments (1.65-3.61) and progresses to heavy filaments of increasing diameter (3.84-6.65). Heavy filaments need increased pressure for touch to be recognized by patients. The tester applies each monofilament to the surface area of the skin with a perpendicular angle, then applies slight and steady pressure until the monofilament begins to bend, which is the end point of the test. The monofilament number 2.83 was defined as cut-off for normal sensation.</description>

    <time_frame>At baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Pressure pain threshold (PPT) is defined as the minimal amount of pressure where a sense of pressure first changes to pain. An electronic algometer will be used to measure PPT levels. The algometer consists of a 1 cm2 rubber-tipped plunger mounted on a force transducer. The pressure is applied approximately at a rate of 30 kPa/s, with the algometer placed perpendicular to the application point. Participants will be instructed to press switch when the sensation changed from pressure to pain. The mean of three trials (intra-examiner reliability) will be calculated and used for main analysis. A 30 s resting period will be allowed between each measure.</description>

    <description>A CPM paradigm with the cold pressor test will be was used. Participants will submerge one foot into an insulated container filled with cold water with the medial malleolus ~3 cm below the water line. The foot contralateral to the affected hand (or most affected hand in case of bilateral CTS) will be submerged. Participants will rate the cold-induced foot pain on a numric pain rating scale (NPRS), ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain imaginable). Immediately after maintaining the NPRS within the target score for 30 seconds, the test stimulus will be given. Pressure pain threshold (PPT) testing will be applied as a test stimulus. PPTs will be measured with a digital algometer. The participants will press a button as soon as the sensation of pressure changed to pain. PPT measurements will be taken on the thenar and hypothenar eminence of both hands, before cold water immersion and during cold water immersion.</description>
