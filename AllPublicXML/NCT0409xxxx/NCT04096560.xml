  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of TAK-994 following
      multiple oral doses in participants with narcolepsy with or without cataplexy (NT1 or NT2).

      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-994.

      The study will enroll up to approximately 126 participants. Participants will be randomly
      assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) in 2:1 ratio to one of the 6 treatment Cohorts:

      Cohort 1, NT1 Participants: TAK-994 Dose Level 1 Cohort 2, NT1 Participants: TAK-994 TBD
      Cohort 3, NT1 Participants: TAK-994 TBD Cohort 4, NT1 Participants in China: TAK-994 Cohort
      5, NT2 Participants: TAK-994 Cohort 6, NT2 Participants: TAK-994

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the North America, Japan, China, and European
      Union. The overall duration of the study is 35 days. Participants will be followed up for 7
      days after the last dose of study drug.

    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (example, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. A TEAE is defined as an AE with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug.</description>

    <description>The MWT is a validated, objective measure that evaluates a person's ability to remain awake under soporific conditions for a defined period. During each MWT session (1 session = 40 minutes), participants will be instructed to sit quietly and remain awake for as long as possible. Sleep latency in each session will be recorded on electroencephalography (EEG). If no sleep has been observed according to these rules, then the latency will be defined as 40 minutes.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Days 7, 14, 21, and 29</time_frame>
    <description>The ESS is a subjective, self-administered, validated scale (scored 0 to 3) to respond to each of the 8 questions of daily life that asks them how likely they are to fall asleep in those situations. The scores are summed to give an overall score of 0 to 24. Higher scores indicate stronger subjective daytime sleepiness, and scores below 10 are considered to be within the normal range.</description>

    <description>Participants will complete a daily patient-reported sleep diary to record self-reported narcolepsy symptoms. Participants will record episodes of cataplexy in the diary. The total number of events per week will be calculated.</description>

    <ipd_description>Takeda makes patient-level, de-identified data sets and associated documents available for all interventional studies after applicable marketing approvals and commercial availability have been received (or program is completely terminated), an opportunity for the primary publication of the research and final report development has been allowed, and other criteria have been met as set forth in Takeda's Data Sharing Policy (see www.TakedaClinicalTrials.com for details). To obtain access, researchers must submit a legitimate academic research proposal for adjudication by an independent review panel, who will review the scientific merit of the research and the requestor's qualifications and conflict of interest that can result in potential bias. Once approved, qualified researchers who sign a data sharing agreement are provided access to these data in a secure research environment.</ipd_description>
