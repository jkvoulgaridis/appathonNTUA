  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the
      Bionode IOP lowering system in eyes with elevated IOP. The contact lens being studied is
      similar to an ordinary contact lens that is worn to correct nearsightedness. But the study
      contact lens has been designed with a thin gold coil around the outside edge of the lens.
      This design helps deliver a low amount of energy to the eye, which is expected to help lower
      the pressure inside of the eye. The study contact lens is activated by a pair of glasses
      (Bionode spectacles) that you wear to apply the treatment to your eye. The study contact lens
      is only activated when the study glasses are activated.

      Subjects will be randomized in 1:1 ratio into two groups, designated Group A and Group B.
      During the study, randomized subjects will be fitted with a pair of study contact lenses,
      only one of which is embedded with a gold coil to receive electrical stimulation from the
      study spectacles, in the study eye. Subjects will also wear optical spectacles (study
      spectacles) that deliver the electrical stimulus the study contact lenses.

      Group A will receive electrical stimulation (test group), and Group B will not receive
      electrical stimulation (control group). Baseline IOP will be recorded prior to the 2-hours
      stimulation, and will be repeated post-therapy, at increments of 5 minutes, 30 minutes, 60
      minutes, and 2 hours from the conclusion of stimulation. The total duration of participation
      for each subject is up to approximately 5 weeks. The total expected duration of the clinical
      trial is approximately 4 months.
