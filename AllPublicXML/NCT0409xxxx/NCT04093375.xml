  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, open randomized clinical trial seeks to investigate whether radical
      prostatectomy with androgen deprivation therapy improves prostate-cancer specific survival
      and quality of life in comparison with radical radiation treatment with androgen deprivation
      therapy among patients diagnosed locally advanced prostate cancer. Lack of extensive PSA
      screening in mainland China, many new cases of prostate cancer are LAPCa. Surgery and/or
      radiation plus attempted chemotherapy are curative treatment for advanced solid malign tumors
      to control and eliminate the local and micro metastases. LAPCa is easy to metastasis, relapse
      and has a poor prognosis. For LAPCa, a single RP approach is generally not the preferred
      option because it is generally considered that radical surgery is difficult to completely
      remove the lesion and the long-term prognosis is not ideal. However, androgen deprivation
      therapy promotes the prognosis of LAPCa with lymph nodes or seminal vesicle metastases and
      improves the local control rate of tumor. What is more, for early localized prostate cancer,
      RT has similar efficacy to RP, for advanced tumor RT can not only relieve urinary tract
      obstruction and other symptoms, but also improve biochemical progression free survival and
      local oncological control. A randomized clinical trial comparing two multimodal treatment
      including RP or RT with ADT regimens is therefore warranted.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. 18≤Age ≤75, at the time of randomization.

          2. Confirmed as non-metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma by transrectal ultrasound biopsy
             in six months before enrollment and untreated.

          3. Tumor stage (T, M, N): according to 2018 NCCN prostate cancer guidelines T3 stage
             Significant extra-capsular tumor extension M0 (no sign of distant metastases) Nx
             (regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed). For patients with T4, the tumor should be
             confined to the bladder neck, and bilateral ureters should not be invaded.

          4. WHO score 0-1, ECOG score 0-2, and ASA grade I-III.

          5. At least 5 years life expectancy.

          6. The general condition and mental status of patients shall permit observation in
             accordance with the study protocol.

          7. Signed Informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Concomitant with other malignancies.

          2. With severe systemic disease (cardio-cerebrovascular disease, etc.) cannot tolerate
             surgery or radiotherapy.

          3. Clinical significant abnormal laboratory values at the discretion of the investigator,
             e.g. severe kidney function GFR &lt; 30 ml/ml or elevated liver transaminases above &gt; 10
             ULN.

          4. Involved in other clinical trials simultaneously.

          5. Any medical condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, might interfere with
             the evaluation of the study objectives.
