  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our proposal represents an integrated approach to determining the cardiovascular and
      metabolic effects of strawberry consumption in adults who have high risk for cardiometabolic
      disease.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current proposal aims to fill some of these important research gaps with regard the dose
      and time-course of strawberry consumption in a population where dietary intervention may of
      particular benefit for both primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular and metabolic
      disease. Participants will participate in a double blind, placebo-controlled, randomized
      crossover trial. Following a 10-day run-in where no berries are consumed, participants will
      be randomized via Latin-square design, to three different daily strawberry powder conditions
      for 4-weeks at a time, with a 7 day washout between conditions.
