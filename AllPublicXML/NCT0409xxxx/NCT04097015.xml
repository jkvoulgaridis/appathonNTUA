  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      NI-ES therapy is a treatment that is being studied to potentially treat pain associated with
      SCI and may help movement below the injury site.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this study is to assess the use of externally applied micro-current
      electrical stimulation in a subject with SCI to reduce pain and patient perceived improvement
      of quality of life first, and second, movement below the SCI injury. The Hypothesis is that
      NI-ES is beneficial in reducing pain following SCI injury, patient perceived quality of life
      measures, and functional outcomes. We plan to achieve this goal by conducting a Pain
      Questionnaire and assessment of movement below the injury site prior to external
      micro-current electrical stimulation with the Spinal Stim (Alpha-Stim M with the Ocular
      Interface and the Spinal Interface) and again six weeks following the first treatment. These
      results will be used to characterize the extent and duration of any improvement in pain and
      movement as a result of treatment with the Spinal Stim.

    <description>The treatment or intervention is the use of NI-ES using a signal generator, Alpha-Stim M, with an Ocular Interface connected to one channel and a Spinal Interface to the other channel. The treatment is done at home for 40 minutes at a time, twice a day. The upper lids of the closed eyes are treated for 10 minutes and the lower lids of the closed eyes are treated for 10 minutes, alternated throughout the treatment time. The Spinal Interface is placed above the SCI for 40 minutes. The entire procedure is repeated for another 40 minutes for a second time. The participant will treat himself at home.</description>
