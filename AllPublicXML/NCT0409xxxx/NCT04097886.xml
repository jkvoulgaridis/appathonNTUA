  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of timed exercise on human circadian
      rhythms. Subjects were randomized to 5 days of morning or evening treadmill exercise. A
      measure of internal circadian timing, or phase, was measured at baseline and following the
      exercise intervention. Change in circadian phase was compared between the morning and evening
      group.

      This study investigated the effect of morning versus evening exercise on internal circadian
      timing, or phase. Young, sedentary subjects were recruited for this study. Baseline measures
      included anthropometric, body composition, cardiorespiratory fitness, chronotype, and
      circadian phase. Subjects were randomized to 5 consecutive days of morning or evening
      exercise. Thirty minutes of exercise was performed at the designated time and intensity was
      maintained at a heart rate corresponding with 70% peak VO2. The measure of circadian phase
      was salivary dim light melatonin onset, indicated by the time when saliva melatonin
      concentration exceeded 4pg/ml. Post-exercise circadian phase was measured the evening
      following the last day of exercise. Changes in circadian phase were compared between morning
      and evening groups.
