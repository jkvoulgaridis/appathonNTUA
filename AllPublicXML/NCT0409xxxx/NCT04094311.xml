  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety of tisagenlecleucel that is out of specification( OOS)
      for release as commercial product.

      Specifically, this study will evaluate the safety of tisagenlecleucel in pediatric/young
      adult patients with relapsed/refractory (r/r) B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (pALL) and
      adult patients with r/r large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
      (DLBCL) not otherwise specified, high-grade B cell lymphoma, and DLBCL arising from
      follicular lymphoma, that is consistent with the Health Authority-approved indication in the
      product information for tisagenlecleucel in the respective country/region. In addition to
      safety, key efficacy of tisagenlecleucel that is out of specification (OOS) for commercial
      release will also be evaluated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients whose final manufactured tisagenlecleucel batches do not meet the approved local
      commercial release specifications are eligible for inclusion.Each case will be individually
      assessed for the expected benefit risk profile prior to release to the patient. Following the
      infusion of OOS tisagenlecleucel, the patient will be followed for 3 months on this study.

    <description>All patients eligible for treatment with tisagenlecleucel per the Health Authority-approved tisagenlecleucel product information in the respective country/region are considered eligible for this study . Patients will be divided into 2 groups:
Group A: Pediatric and young adult patients with B-cell ALL (pALL) who meet the indication in Health Authority-approved tisagenlecleucel product information in the respective country/region whose final manufactured product is OOS for commercial release.
Group B: Adult patients with r/r LBCL including DLBCL not otherwise specified, high-grade B-cell lymphoma, and DLBCL arising from follicular lymphoma, that is consistent with the Health Authority-approved indication in the product information for tisagenlecleucel in respective country/region but whose final manufactured product is OOS for commercial release/acceptance.</description>
