    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of using heat-activated NiTi with
      superelastic NiTi archwires during the initial phase of orthodontic treatment.

      Primary Objective:

      To compare the difference in the amount of crowding in the lower incisors after 4 and 8 weeks
      from the start of treatment.

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. To compare the amount of orthodontically-induced inflammatory root resorption (OIIRR) in
           the apical region of mandibular central incisors between the two groups of archwires

        2. To compare the amount of pain perception between the two groups of archwires during the
           1st week after each wire placement.

      Objectives: To compare the heat-activated nickel titanium (HANT) with superelastic nickel
      titanium (SENT) archwires in terms of their effectiveness in aligning teeth, possibility of
      inducing root resorption, and patient perception of pain during the initial phase of
      treatment.

      Subjects and Methods: Orthodontic patient aged 12 years or over with lower anterior crowding
      of 3-6 mm. who need treatment without extraction, were randomly allocated to the HANT and
      SENT archwires groups with a 1:1 allocation ratio. Archwire sequence in both groups was
      0.014-inch and 0.016-inch, respectively. Each archwire was placed for 4 weeks. Outcome
      measures included the amount of crowding using Little's irregularity index (LII), apical root
      resorption, and pain perception. The effectiveness of alignment was tested using 2X2 mixed
      factorial ANOVA, while root resorption and pain perception were tested by the Mann-Whitney U
      test, and Wilcoxon signed-rank test (P&lt;0.05).

    <masking_description>Blinding to treatment allocation was possible only for the investigator and data analyst because the clinicians could know the type of archwiers from their flexibility. All the trial documents were labeled with the study ID number, which was used for participant identification and data collection without unmasking the allocation group. This allowed the investigator to complete data collection and measurements blindly.</masking_description>

    <description>The study models, which should be free from any inconsistency (such as bubbles), were used to measure the Little's irregularity index (Little, 1975). This was calculated using a digital Vernier caliper to measure the extent of mesial and distal contact displacement from the mesial contact point of lower canine to that on the other side (to the nearest 0.01mm).</description>

    <measure>Root resorption</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Root resorption was evaluated pre-treatment and after 8 weeks using periapical X-ray with digital X-ray sensors (ATECO). Radiographic films were positioned using a customized sensor holder for the lower anterior teeth with a 7cm film-cone distance using long cone paralleling technique. The radiographs were made at 70kV and 8mA DC with an exposure of 0.25 seconds.</description>

    <measure>Pain perception</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluations of pain/discomfort was made in the evening on a daily basis over the first 7 days after bonding using a 10-point visual analog scale (VAS) of 10cm length. The highest pain level experienced should be reported by each patient. The recording sheet was received by all the patients on the day of bonding, it included seven visual analog scales (one for each day) and the patients were given oral instructions on how to finish the VAS by marking the point on the line which supposed to represent the maximum pain that they felt per day, with 0 refers to &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 refers to &quot;intolerable pain&quot;. Patients were reminded daily by a phone call or a text message to mark the recording sheet and to bring it on their next appointment.</description>
