  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Head and neck cancer squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a disease with poor survival,
      especially for African Americans, despite intense treatment including surgery, radiation, and
      chemotherapy. Delays between surgery and the start of postoperative radiation therapy (PORT)
      are common, cause excess mortality, and contribute to worse survival in African Americans.
      Our research team has developed NDURE (Navigation for Disparities and Untimely Radiation
      thErapy), a novel theory-based patient navigation (PN) intervention to decrease delays and
      racial disparities starting PORT. In this single-site, open label, single-arm trial, adults
      with surgically-managed, locally advanced HNSCC, will be enrolled in NDURE to assess the
      feasibility and acceptability of NDURE as a novel approach to decreasing delays and racial
      disparities starting PORT after surgery for HNSCC. The investigators will collect information
      about the accrual rate and NDURE completion rate. Participants will also complete validated
      questionnaires at baseline and post-intervention to evaluate the feasibility of outcome
      assessment for NDURE. Post-intervention, patients and providers will undergo interviews to
      obtain in-depth understanding of the content, format, timing, and delivery of NDURE to
      optimize the intervention in preparation for a future multi-site study. NDURE could provide
      the first effective intervention to improve the delivery of timely, equitable PORT after
      HNSCC surgery, thereby improving survival for patients with HNSCC, decreasing racial
      disparities in mortality, and developing new standards of clinical care.

      Design: The study design is a single-site, single-arm, trial of NDURE (Navigation for
      Disparities and Untimely Radiation thErapy) to assess the feasibility and acceptability of
      this patient navigation (PN) intervention to decrease delays and racial disparities starting
      postoperative radiation therapy (PORT) after HNC surgery

      Following screening and informed consent, sociodemographic and oncologic will be
      prospectively gathered about participants from validated questionnaires and the electronic
      medical record (EMR). Participants will undergo 3 sessions of NDURE. Measures of feasibility
      (enrollment, dropout, missed PN encounters, navigator caseload, and time allocation) will be
      assessed during delivery of NDURE. Questionnaires assessing symptom burden and health-related
      beliefs will be collected at baseline and post-treatment to assess the feasibility of data
      collection procedures and monitor completion rates. Following completion of NDURE, HNC
      patients will complete validated measures of acceptability related to satisfaction with PN.
      Post-NDURE qualitative work with patients and providers will help refine the intervention

      Treatment Allocation: Participants will be enrolled into NDURE

      Delivery of intervention:

      NDURE is a theory-based, multi-level PN intervention consisting of three in-person,
      clinic-based sessions of manualized PN with multiple intervention components that target
      system- (care coordination), interpersonal- (social support), and individual- (Health Belief
      Model; perceived susceptibility, severity, barriers, self-efficacy) level health behavior
      theoretical constructs to reduce barriers to care, increase HNSCC care delivery, and improve
      clinical outcomes (timely, equitable PORT). NDURE will be delivered from surgical
      consultation to PORT initiation (~3 months). The NDURE intervention consists of: Navigation
      Sessions, the Navigator Manual, the Navigator Patient Guide, structured EMR documentation,
      weekly conferences to facilitate care coordination, real-time patient tracking, and
      multidisciplinary reporting. The three in-person NDURE navigation sessions, which are
      expected to take 30-60 minutes each, will coincide with the presurgical consult, hospital
      discharge, and 1st postoperative clinic visit, time points chosen to facilitate case
      identification and coordination across key care transitions. Contact beyond the three
      prescribed in-person sessions will occur with a frequency and modality (e.g. text message,
      email, etc.) dictated by patient and navigator need. During the first in-person session, the
      navigator will 1) elicit barriers and facilitators to timely PORT from the patient,
      caregiver, and provider, 2) develop the personalized barrier reduction plan (BRP), review it
      with the patient, caregiver, and provider, and 3) implement the BRP. At the two subsequent
      in-person sessions, the navigator will review and update the BRP in an iterative, dynamic
      fashion, identifying new barriers and systematically tracking resolution of prior barriers
      until the start of PORT. The Navigator Manual provides a structured resource to guide
      intervention delivery and enhance reproducibility. The Patient Guide is 1) literacy-level
      appropriate, 2) personalized for each patient's care pathway and BRP, 3) updated
      longitudinally as the patient progresses along the cancer continuum, and 4) available to
      patients in print and/or electronically via the patient portal in the EMR.

      The sample size justification for this single-arm study is based on the primary feasibility
      endpoints of NDURE accrual and completion. In the randomized controlled trial (RCT) of NDURE
      (NCT04030130), the investigators plan to enroll 60% of eligible patients. The investigators
      expect similar accrual in this feasibility study and therefore, accruing to NDURE will be
      considered feasible if at least 15 of 25 eligible subjects enroll. Our sample size was
      selected to provide a small probability of having an observed accrual rate of at least 60%
      when the true accrual probability is actually less than 60%. For example, if the true accrual
      probability for our proposed design is 45% (35%), the probability of enrolling 15 or more of
      25 eligible subjects is only 10% (1%). Additionally, the investigators target an NDURE
      completion rate â‰¥85%. That is to say, NDURE is feasible if at least 13 of the 15 subjects
      enrolled complete all three in-person NDURE sessions. Accordingly, the sample size for the
      single-arm study was selected to provide a small probability of having an observed completion
      rate of at least 85% when the true completion probability of the intervention is actually
      less than 85%. For example, if the true completion probability for our proposed design is 70%
      (60%), the probability that 13 or more of the 15 enrolled patients complete all three
      in-person NDURE sessions is 13% (3%). Therefore, the probability of falsely declaring NDURE
      feasible is reasonably controlled based on this sample size.

      Statistical Methods of Analysis: This aim is descriptive, and the statistical analysis
      focuses on characterizing the feasibility and acceptability of NDURE. To examine patterns and
      characterize sociodemographic, oncologic, and symptom burden variables, the investigators
      will construct graphical displays and descriptive statistics (e.g. frequencies and percent
      for categorical variables and mean, median, standard deviation, and range for continuous
      variables). Feasibility measures for study accrual rate will evaluate the proportion and
      frequency of eligible patients who accrue (overall, white, and African American). Given its
      pilot nature, the study is not designed to evaluate racial differences in accrual, although
      reasons for study decline will be collected, analyzed for each racial subgroup, and used to
      refine recruitment. NDURE completion rate will be analyzed as 1) the percentage of enrolled
      patients who attend all three in-person NDURE sessions and 2) the proportion of three
      in-person NDURE sessions that are completed. For navigator caseload, the investigators will
      consider the frequency of simultaneous cases navigated. Navigator time allocation for direct
      and indirect time, as well as patient-report measures of satisfaction with navigation will be
      summarized as described above for continuous data. Study questionnaire completion rate will
      be calculated as the proportion of pre- and post-intervention questionnaires (n=5 each)
      completed. Qualitative data will be analyzed using established team codebooks and focus on
      the content, format, delivery, and timing of NDURE. Qualitative analysis of semi-structured
      interviews with patients and providers following the pilot will be analyzed using established
      codebooks from the study team for evaluating the feasibility and acceptability of
      clinic-based HNC interventions with a focus on the content, format, delivery, and timing of
      NDURE.
