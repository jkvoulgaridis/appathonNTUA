  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The most important factor for ease of operation and safety during spinal anesthesia is the
      determination of the spinal space. Increasing lumbar flexion facilitates access to the spinal
      space. Traditionally, patients undergo spinal anesthesia with lateral or sitting lumbar
      flexion.

      In a study by Martha L Walker et al., The maximum extension of the knees, adduction of the
      hip, and a modified sitting position with the back flexion, ie, the abdominal crunch
      position, were found to be effective in increasing the flexion of the lumbar spine.

      In our study, we aimed to measure the interspinal distance with the abdominal crunch position
      with the help of ultrasonography (USG) and to compare the interspinal distance with the
      measurements obtained in traditional positions (sitting position and lateral decubitus).

      Interspinal distance will be measured by ultrasonography by 3 different positions,
      respectively, for the patients who will undergo elective surgery and meet the study criteria
      and give voluntary consent.

      This evaluation process is to record and compare the measurement results. Patients will not
      undergo any interventional procedures.

      Patients who have difficulty in positioning due to hip, femur, knee and tibial fractures or
      arthrosis and who cannot be communicated will not be included in the study.

      One hundred of patients over the age of 18 who will undergo elective surgery will be included
      in the study.
