    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center observational follow-up study to collect saliva samples that allow
      pharmacogenetic analysis of the subjects that participated in the CC-90007-CP-003 study.

      Approximately 28 subjects with moderate and severe hepatic impairment and healthy control
      subjects with normal hepatic function will be enrolled.
