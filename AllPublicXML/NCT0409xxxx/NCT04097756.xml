  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I dose escalation and expansion study in patients with ER+, HER2- advanced
      breast cancer to explore the tolerance, PK/PD(pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics) profiles and
      preliminary anti-tumor activity of different doses of LX-039 tablets. The trial consists of
      two parts, dose escalation and dose expansion. Part 1 is the dose escalation phase with
      initial 6 dose groups, and &quot;3 + 3&quot; design is used to explore MTD of the drug; Part 2 is the
      dose expansion phase with 2 ~ 3 doses selected for expansion according to the escalation
      results of Part 1, and more subjects are enrolled to further observe the tolerance and
      preliminary anti-tumor activity of the drug. After the completion of dose expansion, the
      recommended phase II dose (RP2D) will be determined after discussion based on the obtained
      tolerance and PK/PD data.

LX-039 tablets will be administered in a therapeutic cycle of 28 days once a day orally. The subjects will continue therapy with LX-039 if good safety and tolerability were assessed by investigators after one cycle treatment. The treatment will continue until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or study termination.</description>
