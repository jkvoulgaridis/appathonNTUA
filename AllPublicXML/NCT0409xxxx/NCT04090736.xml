    <textblock>
      Randomized phase III, multicentre, open label clinical trial to compare pevonedistat in
      combination with azacytidine versus azacytidine alone, which can be considered a standard of
      care for patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia not eligible for intensive
      chemotherapy (thus not eligible for an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, 1:1 randomized multicentre, open label, phase III clinical trial to evaluate
      efficacy and safety of pevonedistat in combination with azacytidine versus azacytidine in the
      treatment of naïve adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia who are not eligible for
      standard induction therapy due to age, co-morbidities or risk-factors.

      Subjects will be randomized to one of the two treatment arms in a 1:1 ratio, both of which
      will have treatment cycles of 28 days:

        -  Arm A: Pevonedistat (PEVO) 20 mg/m2 IV on days 1, 3, and 5 plus Azacitidine (AZA) 75
           mg/m2 subcutaneous (SC) administered on a 5-on/2-off [weekend]/2-on schedule in 28-day
           cycles (IV AZA can be administered for any patients who have non-tolerated local
           reactions)

        -  Arm B: AZA 75 mg/m2 SC on a 5-on/2-off [weekend]/2-on schedule in 28-day cycle (IV AZA
           can be administered for any patients who have non-tolerated local reactions)

           466 subjects will be randomized in the study. Subjects will continue their study
           treatment until documented disease progression per Investigator assessment, unacceptable
           toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or the subject meets other protocol criteria for
           discontinuation

             required for eligibility assessment).

         16. Known hepatic cirrhosis or severe preexisting hepatic impairment.

         17. Patients with the following will be excluded: uncontrolled intercurrent illness
             including, but not limited to known cardiopulmonary disease defined as unstable
             angina, clinically significant arrhythmia, congestive heart failure (New York Heart
             Association Class III or IV; see Appendix 7), and/or ST elevation myocardial
             infarction within 6 months before first dose, or severe symptomatic pulmonary
             hypertension requiring pharmacologic therapy, severe uncontrolled ventricular
             arrhythmias, or electrocardiographic evidence of acute ischemia or active conduction
             system abnormalities. As an example, well-controlled atrial fibrillation would not be
             an exclusion whereas uncontrolled atrial fibrillation would be an exclusion. Patients
             with medical comorbidities that will preclude safety evaluation of the combination
             should not be enrolled.

         18. Subject has chronic respiratory disease that requires continuous oxygen, or
             significant history of renal, neurologic, psychiatric, endocrinologic, metabolic,
             immunologic, hepatic, cardiovascular disease, any other medical condition that in the
             opinion of the investigator would adversely affect his/her participating in this
             study.

         19. Treatment with strong Cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily A (CYP3A) inducers (see
             Appendix 8) within 14 days before the first dose of pevonedistat.

         20. Patients with uncontrolled coagulopathy or bleeding disorder.

         21. High blood pressure which cannot be controlled by standard treatments

         22. Prolonged rate corrected QT (QTc) interval ≥ 500 msec, calculated according to
             institutional guidelines.

         23. As infection is a common feature of AML, patients with active infection are permitted
             to enroll provided that the infection is under control and no signs of systemic
             inflammatory response beyond low grade fever that makes patient clinically unstable in
             the opinion of the investigator. Patients with uncontrolled infection shall not be
             enrolled until infection is treated and brought under control.

         24. Patients who have received an investigational agent (for any indication) within 5
             half-lives of the agent and until toxicity from this has resolved to grade 1 or less;
             if the half-life of the agent is unknown, patients must wait 4 weeks prior to first
             dose of study treatment.

         25. Systemic antineoplastic therapy for malignant conditions other than myeloid neoplasms
             within 14 days before the first dose of any study drug.
