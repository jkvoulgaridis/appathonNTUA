  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the visual disturbance profile of ACRYSOF VIVITY
      Extended Vision IOL Model DFT015 with those of diffractive extended depth of focus IOLs. IOLs
      are implantable medical devices intended for long-term use over the lifetime of the cataract
      patient.

      This study will be conducted in Australia and New Zealand. A total of 10 scheduled visits are
      planned. The visits include a screening visit, 2 operative visits, and 7 postoperative
      visits. Both eyes will be implanted. The second eye implant will occur within 7-21 days of
      the first eye implant. Individual subject participation is expected to last 6-7 months.

    <time_frame>Month 3 postoperative (Day 120-180 from first eye surgery)</time_frame>
    <description>QUVID is a patient-reported outcomes questionnaire that collects responses from the subject about vision-related experiences. A halo is a circular spreading of light around a light source, such as car headlights at night. The subjects will be asked, &quot;In the past 7 days, have you experienced halos?&quot; Subjects responding &quot;No&quot; will be automatically imputed as reporting &quot;Not bothered at all.&quot; Subjects responding &quot;Yes&quot; will be asked, &quot;In the past 7 days, how much have your halos bothered you?&quot; The percentage of subjects responding, &quot;Not bothered at all&quot; will be calculated as (# of subjects reporting &quot;Not bothered at all&quot; directly or by imputation) divided by (# of subjects responding to the halos experience question, regardless of response) times 100.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of subjects not bothered at all by glare (QUVID Question 3.3)</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 3 postoperative (Day 120-180 from first eye surgery)</time_frame>
    <description>Glare is a wide dispersion of light, such as an intensified reflection of the sun off a glass building. The subjects will be asked, &quot;In the past 7 days, have you experienced glare?&quot; Subjects responding &quot;No&quot; will be automatically imputed as reporting &quot;Not bothered at all.&quot; Subjects responding &quot;Yes&quot; will be asked, &quot;In the past 7 days, how much has your glare bothered you?&quot; The percentage of subjects responding, &quot;Not bothered at all&quot; will be calculated as (# of subjects reporting &quot;Not bothered at all&quot; directly or by imputation) divided by (# of subjects responding to the glare experience question, regardless of response) times 100.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of subjects not bothered at all by starbursts (QUVID Question 1.3)</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 3 postoperative (Day 120-180 from first eye surgery)</time_frame>
    <description>A starburst is a star-shaped spreading of light around a light source, such as car headlights at night. The subjects will be asked, &quot;In the past 7 days, have you experienced starbursts?&quot; Subjects responding &quot;No&quot; will be automatically imputed as reporting &quot;Not bothered at all.&quot; Subjects responding &quot;Yes&quot; will be asked, &quot;In the past 7 days, how much have your starbursts bothered you?&quot; The percentage of subjects responding, &quot;Not bothered at all&quot; will be calculated as (# of subjects reporting &quot;Not bothered at all&quot; directly or by imputation) divided by (# of subjects responding to the starbursts experience question, regardless of response) times 100.</description>
