  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is for patients with high grade glioma (HGG) or diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma
      (DIPG). Because there is no standard treatment for this cancer at this time, patients are
      being asked to volunteer in a gene transfer research study using special immune cells called
      T cells. T cells are a type of white blood cell that helps the body fight infection.

      The body has different ways of fighting infection and disease. No single way seems perfect
      for fighting cancers. This research study combines two different ways of fighting cancer:
      antibodies and T cells. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with
      cancers. They have shown promise, but have not been strong enough to cure most patients.

      We have found from previous research that we can put a new antibody gene into T cells that
      will make them recognize cancer cells and kill them. GD2 is a protein found on several
      different cancers. When we and other researchers tested DIPG/HGG cancer cells we found that
      many of these cancers also have GD2 on their surface.

      In a clinical trial for a different cancer in children (neuroblastoma), we made a gene called
      a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) from an antibody that recognizes GD2. We put this gene into
      the patients' own T cells and gave them back to 11 neuroblastoma patients. We saw that the
      cells did grow for a while, but started to disappear from the blood after 2 weeks. We think
      that if T cells are able to last longer, they may have a better chance of killing tumor
      cells.

      In this study we will add a new gene to the GD2 T cells that can cause the cells to live
      longer. We know that T cells need substances called cytokines to survive. We have added the
      gene C7R that gives the cells a constant supply of cytokine and helps them to survive for a
      longer period of time.

      In other clinical studies using T cells, some investigators found that giving chemotherapy
      before the T cell infusion can improve the amount of time the T cells stay in the body and
      therefore the effect the T cells can have. This is called lymphodepletion and we think that
      it will allow the T cells to expand and stay longer in the body, and potentially kill cancer
      cells more effectively.

      The GD2.C7R T cells are an investigational product not approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration.

      The purpose of this study is to find the largest safe dose of GD2-C7R T cells, and also to
      evaluate how long they can be detected in the blood and what affect they have on DIPG/HGG.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To prepare the DIPG/HGG specific T cells (GD2-C7R T cells), research staff will take some
      blood from the patient. We will grow the GD2.C7R T cells by infecting the T cells with a
      retroviral vector (a special virus that can carry a new gene into cells) containing one gene
      that can recognize and kill DIPG/HGG cells (GD2.CAR) and the new gene called C7R that will
      help these cells survive longer. After the new genes have been put into the T cells, the
      cells will be tested to make sure that they kill GD2-positive DIPG/HGG cells.

      Because we are growing the cells in the laboratory, we will also need to take blood to test
      for infectious viruses such as hepatitis and HIV (the virus that causes AIDS), and we will
      also ask patients to complete a questionnaire that is given to blood donors.

      The cells generated will be frozen and stored to give back to the patient. Because patients
      will have received cells with a new gene in them patients will be followed for a total of 15
      years to see if there are any long term side effects of gene transfer.

      Patients will be assigned a dose of GD2-C7R T cells. There is one dose where patients will
      only receive GD2 T cells without the C7R. The assigned dose of cells is adjusted based on
      body weight and height.

      In this study, patients will receive the GD2-(C7R) cells and also receive cyclophosphamide
      and fludarabine. These two drugs are standard chemotherapy medicines and may be given before
      the T cells to make space in the blood for the T cells to grow after receiving them.

      Cyclophosphamide and fludarabine will be given intravenously (through an i.v. needle inserted
      in a vein or your central line) for 2 days and then fludarabine alone on the third day.

      The patient will be given an injection of GD2-(C7R) T cells into the vein through an IV line
      at the assigned dose. Before receiving the T cell infusion, the patient may be given a dose
      of Benadryl (diphenhydramine) and Tylenol (acetaminophen). The infusion will take between 1
      and 10 minutes. We will then monitor the patient in the hospital for at least 3 days. The
      treatment will be given by the Center for Cell and Gene Therapy at Texas Children's Hospital.
      The patient will need to stay in Houston for up to 4 weeks after the infusion so we can
      monitor for side effects.

      The patient will have follow-up visits at weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8, then at months 3, 6, 9,
      and 12, and then twice a year for the next 4 years and annually for the next 10 years for a
      total of 15 years. The patient will also have scheduled disease evaluations after the T-cell
      injection at week 6 and then as clinically needed.

      After disease re-evaluation, the patient may be eligible to receive one additional dose of T
      cells if the following criteria are met: (1) The disease has not gotten worse and/or it seems
      the patient may benefit in the future from an additional dose. (2) The patient has not had a
      severe side effect caused by the infusion of GD2-C7R T cells. The dose will be at the same
      dose level as the first infusion and separated by at least 3 months such that we can make
      sure there are no severe side effects between infusions. If the patient receives an
      additional dose of GD2-(C7R) T-cells, then they will need to stay in Houston for up to 4
      weeks after the infusion as well so we can monitor for side effects.

      Medical tests before treatment--

      Before being treated, the patient will receive a series of standard medical tests:

        -  Physical exam

        -  Blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver function

        -  Measurements of the tumor by routine MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)

      Medical tests during and after treatment--

      The patient will receive standard medical tests when they are getting the infusions and
      afterwards:

        -  Physical exams

        -  Blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver function

        -  Measurements of the tumor by MRI imaging studies and spinal fluid analysis 6 weeks after
           the infusion and repeat MRI imaging at 3 months.

      Spinal Fluid Tests: One spinal tap will be performed as part of the study. This procedure is
      usually done under general anesthesia in children. After the skin is numbed, a long needle is
      placed into the lower back to remove 1-2 ml of spinal fluid (less than half a teaspoon).

      To learn more about the way the GD2-(C7R) T cells are working and how long they last in the
      body, an extra amount of blood will be obtained on the day that chemotherapy starts, the day
      of the T-cell infusion(s) and at the end of the T-cell infusion(s), 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks
      after the T-cell infusion(s) and every 3 months for the 1st year, every 6 months for the next
      4 years and annually for the next 10 years. The amount of blood taken will be based on weight
      with up to a maximum of 60 mL (12 teaspoons) of blood to be obtained at any one time. For
      children, the total amount of blood drawn will not be more than 3 mL (less than 1 teaspoon)
      per 1 kg of body weight on any one day. This volume is considered safe, but may be decreased
      if the patient is anemic (has a low red blood cell count).

      During the time points listed above, if the GD2-(C7R) T cells are found in the patient's
      blood at a certain amount, an extra 5 mL (about 1 teaspoon) of blood may need to be collected
      for additional testing.

      If the patient has a procedure where tumor samples are obtained, like a spinal tap evaluation
      or tumor biopsy, we will request a sample to be used for research purposes.

      The patient will receive supportive care for any acute or chronic toxicities, including blood
      components or antibiotics, and other intervention as appropriate.
