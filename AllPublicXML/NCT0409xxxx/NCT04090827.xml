  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 1 in 10 teenagers lives with a chronic health condition that will require
      ongoing care as they enter adulthood. Birth defects of the heart, also known as congenital
      heart disease (CHD) are more common than any other type of birth defect and affect about 1 in
      100 children, with most surviving to adulthood. However, most teenagers with CHD have little
      knowledge about their heart and lack confidence in talking with doctors and nurses about
      their health. These are essential skills when entering the adult-oriented health care system
      after graduating from pediatric care.

      In the current study proposal our team plans to evaluate the effectiveness of delivering
      1-on-1 teaching sessions for adolescents who live in smaller communities and can't easily
      come to Edmonton for appointments in the heart clinic. Fortunately in Alberta we have a
      widely available system called Telehealth that allows nurses and teens to meet by private,
      secure teleconferencing while hundreds of miles away. Telehealth is provided by health
      clinics around the province. We propose to use Telehealth in adolescents' home communities to
      provide these teaching sessions for 16-19 year olds with CHD who are soon going to be
      graduating from pediatric to adult care.

      Participants who receive a nurse-led teaching session will be compared with a similar number
      of adolescents who are not offered a teaching session, using a questionnaire that addresses
      skills related to taking care of their health condition. This questionnaire will be completed
      on-line (or if preferred by the participant, by letter mail) 1 month and 6 month after
      entering the study.

      Deciding which adolescents receive a nurse-led teaching session will be random, i.e. like the
      flip of a coin. Regardless, all participants will receive access to a website for young
      people with CHD called iHeartChange.

      PURPOSE:

      The Transitioning Rural Adolescents to Adult Care (TRAAC) Study is a mixed-methods randomized
      controlled trial (RCT) evaluating the impact of a Telehealth-based nurse-led transition
      intervention in combination with access to a CHD website, versus the CHD website alone, on
      preparing rural-based adolescents living with congenital heart disease (CHD) to successfully
      transition from pediatric to adult cardiology care.

      OBJECTIVES:

      The primary objective is to determine the impact of a nurse-led transition intervention in
      combination with access to the iHeartChange website, versus iHeartChange alone, on
      adolescents' self-management skills.

      The secondary objectives are to:

      (i) evaluate the impact of the nurse-led intervention on adolescents' self-efficacy

      (ii) measure iHeartChange use by participants , and

      (iii) explore potential influences on intervention effectiveness, using qualitative data.

      RESEARCH METHOD:

      Participants will be recruited through the Stollery Children's Hospital Outreach Pediatric
      Cardiology clinics. After discussion with the Research Coordinator, the participant will be
      emailed an online consent form, and baseline questionnaires through REDCap as well as an
      email from the iHeartChange website after the baseline questionnaires are complete.

      At the 1 month and 6 month post enrollment, participants will receive the link to complete
      the questionnaire via email. Should they not complete the questionnaire within the first 2
      weeks, they will receive reminder emails at 2, 4 and 6 weeks post initial send out. At the
      completion of the 1 month and 6 month questionnaires, the participant will receive a small
      incentive.

      For those assigned to the intervention group, a one-on-one telehealth session with the nurse
      will be set up. The session will take ~ 1 hour. Prior to the session the participant will
      receive a mail out transition package of additional written resources containing a &quot;When
      You're 18 booklet&quot; with transition specific information, disease specific information sheets,
      adolescent mental health resources, +/- endocarditis information if applicable.

      Participant heart history information will be collected as well as demographics by accessing
      their paper charts, eClinician, Netcare and Connectcare electronic medical records. Baseline
      data we are collecting includes current height, weight, date of birth, cardiac diagnosis,
      cardiac surgery and procedure information, medications, cardiology visits and other
      information from the cardiology clinic letters.

      DATA ANALYSIS:

      Each participant will be assigned an alphanumerical code and pseudonym. All qualitative data
      (nursing logs, text/email transcripts) will be transcribed, anonymized, and analyzed for
      codes, categories and subcategories. The unit of analysis will be the nurse-led session; all
      data for each session will be analyzed together to get a sense of what happened, what
      influenced what happened, and whether the intervention was successful. Categories will be
      given descriptors that use words as close to the data as possible; eventually, categories
      will be grouped into main categories. Thematic analysis will be used to define broader
      categories of potential influences on intervention effectiveness with the unit of analysis
      being the entire set of coded session data.

      The results of quantitative analyses will be compared with qualitative results to explore the
      extent to which there is agreement. Priority will be given to quantitative data; a nuanced
      understanding of what influenced intervention effectiveness will be sought through a process
      of integration.

    <intervention_model_description>To determine &quot;Intervention&quot; vs. &quot;iHeartChange only&quot;, a biostatistician will prepare the randomization sequence. Permuted-block randomization with varying block sizes and equal allocation ratio will be used to ensure balanced allocation of patients between the 2 treatment arms. Blocks of sizes 2 and 4 will be randomly mixed to overcome the problem of predicting the allocation for the last few entries in each block. A given cardiologist's patients will be allocated to iHeartChange or the intervention group equally, preventing potential bias by cardiologist co-intervention</intervention_model_description>
