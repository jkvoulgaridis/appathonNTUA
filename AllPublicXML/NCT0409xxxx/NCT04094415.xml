    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to collect information on how semaglutide works in real world
      patients. Participants will get semaglutide prescribed to them by their doctor. The study
      will last for about 6 to 8 months. Participants will be asked to complete some questionnaires
      about their health and your diabetes treatment. Participants will complete these during their
      normally scheduled visits with their doctor.

    <time_frame>Baseline (week 0), end of study (week 28 to 38)</time_frame>
    <description>The status version (DTSQs) provides a measure of how satisfied patients are with their current diabetes treatment. It consists of 8 questions, which are to be answered on a Likert scale from 0 to 6 (0 = very dissatisfied to 6 = very satisfied). Six questions are summed to produce a total Treatment Satisfaction score. The remaining two questions are concerning perceived frequency of hyperglycaemia and perceived frequency of hypoglycaemia, respectively.</description>

    <description>The change version (DTSQc) has the same 8 items as the status version, but is reworded to direct the patients to compare the experience of the current treatment with the experience of previous treatment. Each question is scored on a scale of -3 to +3 (-3 = much less satisfied now to +3 = much more satisfied now), with 0 (midpoint), representing no change.</description>
