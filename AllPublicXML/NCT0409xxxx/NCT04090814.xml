  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this cross-over study 25 patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP) were tested for pain
      relief in 2 conditions: while using the Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS)
      application and without using it. Primary outcome: Movement-Evoked Pain (MEP). This was
      measured using the Back Performance Scale (BPS) and a 5-minute walk test (5MWT). Participants
      performed 5 functional tasks and were asked to rate their pain before, during, and after each
      movement on a numeric rating score scale. The same principle will be used for the 5MWT: for
      each walking-minute, 3 pain measurements will be assessed.

    <description>Pain that is experienced in response to 2 physical tasks: the Back Performance Scale and the 5 minutes walk test. Participants performed 5 physical tasks (= 1) grasping toes with fingertips in a sitting position; 2) forward bending from standing; 3) picking up paper from standing; 4) long-sitting from supine and 5) lifting a 5kg box from floor to table) and walked for 5 minutes. Participants provided a pain rating on a 11 points Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) with the endpoints no pain&quot; (0) and &quot;excruciating pain&quot; (10). Pain will be assessed during the physical tasks (=at the same moment).</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  chronic nonspecific LBP for at least 3 months' duration: non-specific LBP implies that
             patients are not allowed to have any evidence of specific spinal pathology (e.g.,
             hernia, spinal stenosis, spondylolisthesis, infection, spinal fracture or malignancy).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  spinal surgery in the past 6 months

          -  severe underlying comorbidity (like diagnosed diabetes, cardiovascular problems,
             etc.),

          -  pregnant or given birth in the preceding year,

          -  having initiated a new LBP treatment in the 6 weeks prior to study participation
