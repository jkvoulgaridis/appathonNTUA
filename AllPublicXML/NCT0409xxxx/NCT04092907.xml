  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of HBM9036 Ophthalmic
      Solution versus placebo in the treatment of dry eye
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HBM9036 is a molecularly engineered tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1) fragment.

      A total of 100 subjects are expected to be randomized. Subjects will be randomized 1:1 at
      Visit 2 to HBM9036 Ophthalmic Solution or placebo group, bilaterally BID for eight weeks. The
      primary efficacy endpoint is sign changes from baseline in change from pre- to post-CAE
      inferior corneal staining score (ICSS) of the study eye evaluated at week 8 .
