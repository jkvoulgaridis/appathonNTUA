  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is to compare hysteroscopic repair and transvaginal intervention for correcting
      uterine defect in patients with post cesarean scar defect (PCSD) and the reproductive
      prognosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Post cesarean scar defect (PCSD), refers the lower uterine segment form a reservoir-like
      pouch during healing process after transverse lower uterine segment cesarean section
      connected with uterine cavity. The pouch has a valve-like effect, obstructing blood drainage
      and accumulating blood in depression. These causes may lead to a variety of gynecological
      disturbances, secondary dysmenorrheal and infertility. Some patients can occur some serious
      obstetric complications, such as cesarean scar pregnancy and even the rupture of uterus
      during a subsequent pregnancy. At present, the causes and mechanisms of PCSD are not clear,
      diagnosis and treatment are not uniform. Surgical methods include abdominal surgery,
      laparoscopic surgery, transvaginal surgery, hysteroscopic surgery, hysteroscopic with
      laparoscopic surgery and so on. Hysteroscopic and transvaginal surgery to treating PCSD both
      are minimally invasive and feasible surgical approach. However, hysteroscopic surgery and
      transvaginal surgery have not been compared for correcting the uterine defect in patients
      with PCSD before.

Failure: menstrual duration was reduced by less than 2 days or had no obvious change, and TVU showed the liquid dark area in lower segment of uterus did not narrow.
