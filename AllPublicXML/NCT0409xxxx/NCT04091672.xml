    <measure>Confirmed Healing</measure>
    <time_frame>Prior to or at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Healing is defined as complete closure characterized by 100% skin re-epithelialization without drainage, confirmed at two consecutive study visits at least 2 weeks apart by direct visualization by a Blinded Evaluator. The incidence of healing is hypothesized to be non-inferior for RECELL-treated areas as compared to Control areas.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Actual Expansion Ratios</measure>
    <time_frame>Prior to or at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Actual expansion ratio, computed as the ratio of measured treated area to the measured donor site area, will be calculated separately for RECELL and Control (including donor skin needed for secondary treatments). The actual expansion ratios will be compared as a new ratio (ratio of ratios). The actual expansion ratio achieved with the use of RECELL is hypothesized to be superior to the actual expansion ratio associated with the Control.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient requires autografting for treatment of an acute full-thickness skin defect
             (e.g., trauma- or surgery-related).

          2. The maximum area requiring autografting is 50% Total Body Surface Area (TBSA).

          3. Two comparable areas requiring autografting, each at least 160 cm2 (or 320 cm2
             contiguous), excluding face and genitalia. When hands or joints are included in the
             treatment areas, comparability of treatment areas means that each area (RECELL and
             Control) must include the same contralateral joint and/or hand.

          4. The patient is at least 5 years of age.

          5. The patient (or parent/guardian) is willing and able to comply with all compulsory
             study procedures and visit schedule.

          6. The patient agrees to abstain from any other treatment (e.g., external fixation) of
             the study treatment areas for the duration of his/her participation the study (1
             year).

          7. The patient agrees to abstain from enrollment in any other interventional clinical
             trial for the duration of his/her participation the study (1 year).

          8. In the opinion of the investigator, the patient and/or guardian must be able to:

               1. Understand the full nature and purpose of the study, including possible risks and
                  adverse events,

               2. Understand instructions, and

               3. Provide voluntary informed written consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Not able to understand English or Spanish.

          2. The area requiring autografting sustained a burn injury.

          3. The treatment area has previously failed to heal subsequent to surgical intervention
             for closure.

          4. The patient is unable to follow the protocol requirements.

          5. The patient has a condition that in the investigator's opinion may compromise patient
             safety or trial objectives.

          6. Current use of medications that in the investigator's opinion may compromise patient
             safety or trial objectives.

          7. The patient has a known hypersensitivity to trypsin or compound sodium lactate for
             irrigation (Hartmann's) solution.

          8. The patient is pregnant or breast-feeding (pregnancy test should be performed in
             accordance with local institutional requirements).

          9. Life expectancy is less than 1 year.
