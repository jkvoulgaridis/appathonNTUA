    <textblock>
      This retrospective and prospective study is to investigate the incidence of
      Carbapenemase-producing bacteria (CPB) at the University Hospital Basel, the time to
      detection of CPB and to initiation of infection control measures, the risk factors associated
      with carriage of CPB, type and duration of previously administrated antibiotic medication,
      antibiotic treatment, as well as to assess the outcomes of the affected patients.
