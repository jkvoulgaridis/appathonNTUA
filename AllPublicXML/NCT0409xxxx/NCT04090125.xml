  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to examine the effectiveness of the Physical Activity and
      Symmetry (PAS) program, compared to an attention (ATT)control group, for patients with
      post-total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The investigators hypothesize that the PAS treatment will
      result in meaningful improvements in physical activity (PA) and joint loading symmetry
      compared to the ATT group.

    <textblock>
      Background and Significance: Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has been shown to decrease pain
      and to improve range of motion and some aspects of physical function. However, accumulating
      evidence shows that patients have persistent deficits in other critical outcomes following
      TKA. First, the majority of patients do not substantially increase physical activity beyond
      levels prior to TKA, remaining well below Department of Health and Human Services
      recommendations and levels of healthy individuals. This has serious negative implications for
      both joint health and overall health. Second, studies show that gait asymmetries are common
      following TKA, such that patients continue to load the non-surgical leg more heavily during
      walking, even when the post-surgical leg is pain free. This places the contralateral limb at
      risk for developing or worsening osteoarthritis. Other research shows there is large
      variability in post-TKA rehabilitation, along with sub-optimal exercise content.
      Collectively, these findings emphasize the critical need to improve the post-TKA
      rehabilitation process. However, there are currently no evidence-based approaches to improve
      overall physical activity and deficits in joint loading symmetry that have been identified
      following TKA.

      Study Aims: This research project will provide important preliminary information on the novel
      post-TKA PAS program through achieving the following specific aims: 1) Obtain preliminary
      data on the efficacy of the PAS program with respect to the change in objectively assessed
      physical activity, measured via accelerometers; 2) Obtain preliminary data on the efficacy of
      the PAS program with respect to change in peak load symmetry during walking, measured by a
      novel 3-sensor insole device; 3) Assess the feasibility and acceptability of the PAS program
      following TKA.

      Study Description: Investigators will conduct an exploratory randomized controlled study,
      with n=72 patients &gt;=18 years receiving post-TKA physical therapy (PT) at a UNC Healthcare
      System clinic. Patients will be equally allocated to the PAS intervention or an attention
      (ATT) control group.

    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 3</time_frame>
    <description>Self-Reported Physical Activity will be assessed using the Modified version of the CHAMPS (Community Health Activities Model Program for Seniors) Physical Activity Measure. Data from the questionnaire is used to determine variety, frequency, and minutes per week from physical activity. Separate scores are derived for physical activities of moderate or greater intensity (metabolic equivalents MET ≥ 3.0) and for all activities listed (light, moderate, and vigorous). Estimates of frequency (days per week) range from 0 to 7 days per week. Estimates of Variety (# different activities), while open, generally ranges from 0 to 5, values above 5 are checked. Estimates of minutes, generally range from 0 to 180 per day. Individuals reporting more than 180 minutes per day are checked. For all physical activity outcomes higher values equal a greater amount of activity.</description>

    <description>The PAS program will be initiated during the final usual care PT visits. The PAS content will be included within the last two routine PT visits (Sessions 1 and 2). Session 1 will emphasize the importance of PA in TKA recovery, work with participants to establish SMART goals regarding overall PA and provide community-based and other resources to support overall PA. Session 2 will include balance exercise content to improve joint loading symmetry and home exercises will be assigned. Then, PAS participants will receive a follow-up phone call after 4 weeks (to assist with activity progression and problem-solving) and an additional in-person visit after 8 weeks (to visually monitor exercise performance and re-assess proportional weight-bearing ability).</description>
