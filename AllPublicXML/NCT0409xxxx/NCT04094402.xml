      Cross-sectional epidemiological study in patients with diagnosis of GERD (Gastroesophageal
      Reflux Disease) and with current treatment or with a history of recent treatment with some
      PPI (Proton Pump Inhibitor), in order to evaluate the persistence and / or relapse of
      symptoms of GERD.

      OBJECTIVE: To carry out an evaluation about the persistence and / or relapse of symptoms in
      Colombian patients with diagnosis of GERD.

      MATERIALS AND METHODS: A multicentric cross-sectional epidemiological study will be carried
      out in Colombian patients with diagnosis of GERD and with current treatment or with a history
      of recent treatment with some PPI (Proton Pump Inhibitor). The persistence and / or relapse
      of symptoms will be evaluated as the main variable. The secondary variables to be evaluated
      include: Demographical analysis, treatment (s) used by patients, adverse events associated
      with the treatments, comorbidities and risk factors. The analysis will be carried out from
      two perspectives: A first descriptive approach and a second analytical approach, with a level
      of significance of 5%.
