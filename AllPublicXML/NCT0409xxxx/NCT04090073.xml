  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: The investigators' previous study demonstrated that electroacupuncture (EA)
      reduces the duration of postoperative ileus and hospital stay after laparoscopic colorectal
      surgery within a traditional perioperative care setting. Recent evidence also suggested that
      a 'fast-track' (FT) perioperative program may help accelerate recovery after colorectal
      surgery. It is uncertain whether the combination of EA and FT program will result in faster
      recovery after laparoscopic colorectal surgery when compared with FT program alone.

      Objectives: To compare the efficacy of EA combined with FT program versus FT program alone in
      reducing the duration of postoperative ileus and hospital stay after laparoscopic colorectal
      surgery

      Design: Prospective randomized trial.

      Subjects: 72 consecutive patients undergoing elective laparoscopic resection of colonic and
      upper rectal cancer without conversion will be recruited.

      Interventions: Patients will be randomly allocated to one of the two groups receiving either
      EA + FT program, or FT program alone.

      Outcome measures: Primary outcome: time to defecation. Secondary outcomes: duration of
      hospital stay, time to resume diet, pain scores, analgesic requirement, morbidity, quality of
      life, and medical costs.

      Conclusions: This study serves as a good example that illustrates an integrated approach in
      combining Chinese and Western models of health care. It will provide evidence-based
      clarification of the role of EA in enhancing recovery after laparoscopic colorectal surgery
      within a FT perioperative care setting. As laparoscopic colorectal surgery has been shown to
      have a higher direct cost than the open counterpart, a faster postoperative recovery may help
      reduce the financial burden to the hospital/healthcare system.

    <description>SF-36 Health Survey is a 36-item, patient-reported survey of patient health. It consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. The eight sections are: vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning, and mental health. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.</description>

    <description>EORTC QLQ-C30 is a generic questionnaire for assessment of quality of life (QoL) in cancer patients. It includes 30 items, 24 of which are combined to form a global QoL scale, five functional scales (physical, role, emotional, cognitive, and social), and three symptom scales (fatigue, nausea/vomiting, and pain). The other six single items evaluate dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties. All questionnaires responses and scores will be linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale. A higher score on the global QoL and functional scales represents a higher level of QoL and functioning, whereas a higher score on the symptom scales/items represents a higher degree of symptoms or dysfunction.</description>

    <description>EORTC QLQ-CR38 is a specific questionnaire module specifically designed for assessment of quality of life (QoL) in patients with colorectal cancer. It consists of 38 items covering symptoms and side effects related to different colorectal cancer treatment modalities. The module contains four functional scales (body image, sexual functioning, sexual enjoyment, and future perspective) and eight symptom scales/items (micturition problems, chemotherapy side effects, gastrointestinal tract symptoms, male sexual problems, female sexual problems, defecation problems, stoma-related problems, and weight loss). All questionnaires responses and scores will be linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale. A higher score on the global QoL and functional scales represents a higher level of QoL and functioning, whereas a higher score on the symptom scales/items represents a higher degree of symptoms or dysfunction.</description>
