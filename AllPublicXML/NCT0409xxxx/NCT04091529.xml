      To perform the use of radiofrequency myolysis (RFM) for the treatment of intra-uterine
      fibroids through less invasive access by combining trans-vaginal ultrasound, hysteroscopy and
      laparoscopy

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Given that the RF ablation of solid tumors of the liver and other organs is successfully used
      as a usual approach, the investigators have decided to transfer this technology to an
      original treatment of uterine fibroids. The access to each individual fibroid was determined
      considering passage of the needle towards its centre through only compromised tissue and by
      the shortest possible route by combining trans-vaginal ultrasound, hysteroscopy and
      laparoscopy. To optimize radiofrequency myolysis, in fact, the investigators decided to
      improve the procedure by inserting three innovative elements: application of a virtual needle
      tracking system to follow the RF electrode during the ablation session, real-time monitoring
      of RF ablation by contrast-enhanced ultrasound and systematic biopsy of the lesions before
      electro-coagulation.

    <description>The ablation device consisted of an radiofrequency (RF) energy generator (STARmed, RF generator VRS01) and an electric pump for the continuous cooling of the electrode tip. The RF generator to which the electrode (STARmed Gyeonggi-Do, Korea) is connected displays simultaneously the temperature of the electrode tip, the tissue impedance characteristics, the power and the ablation time. A 35 cm long 18Gauge internally cooled electrode with an exposed tip of 10 mm or a variable exposed tip was used</description>
