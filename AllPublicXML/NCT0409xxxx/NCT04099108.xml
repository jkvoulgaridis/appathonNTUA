  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A single-centre, two-arm, parallel randomised controlled trial (RCT) to compare the combined
      effect of early intravenous bolus amino acid supplementation and mobilisation versus standard
      of care on changes in muscle mass over the first week in ICU. Half of study participants will
      receive the study intervention (in-bed cycling followed by an intravenous bolus amino acid
      supplement), while the other half will receive standard of care only.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Critical illness survivors often suffer from severe muscle mass depletion and a profound
      long-term functional impairment. Hence effective strategies, or a combination of strategies,
      are needed to reduce skeletal muscle wasting during critical illness. Although amino acids
      and mobilisation are both known to stimulate the mechanistic target of rapamycin pathway
      (MTOR) pathway for muscle protein synthesis in healthy adults, there are no trials to date
      investigating the combined approach of combined cycle ergometry and bolus amino acid
      supplementation on muscle accretion in the ICU.
