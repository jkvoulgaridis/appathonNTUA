  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effect of Atrial Septal Defect (ASD) closure by using larger devices on the improvement
      in biventricular function remains an area of active research. Therefore, the aim of the
      current study is to assess the degree of improvement in biventricular dimensions and function
      by using 2-Dimensional echocardiography derived Strain and Strain Rate and Tissue Doppler.
      Moreover, to identify the relationship between the left and right ventricular systolic and
      diastolic function and device size.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In most echocardiographic studies, left ventricle (LV) systolic function was normal in the
      patients with ASD and only a few cases had a reduced LV ejection fraction with severe right
      ventricle (RV) volume overload. The device closure of ASD increases immediately the blood
      flow to the left ventricle and may unmask subtle abnormalities in systolic and diastolic
      function. Currently, clinical research in cardiac mechanics is moving from short- and
      long-axis LV and RV function and ejection fraction to two and three- dimensional (2D, 3D)
      ventricular deformation studies (Strain and Strain Rate quantiﬁcation). These methods are
      independent of ventricular geometry and allow quantiﬁcation of myocardial motion and
      deformation in different directions (longitudinal, radial, and circumferential), while
      conventional methods mainly rely on the assessment of radial function. Strain imaging has
      also been used to demonstrate that patients who underwent device closure of an ASD had better
      LV and RV longitudinal deformation than patients who underwent surgical closure of an ASD.
      However, the effect of device size on the LV systolic and diastolic function is still under
      investigations. For all these reasons the researchers intend to measure RV and LV
      haemodynamic changes by 2-D Transthoracic Echocardiography (TTE) derived Tissue Doppler and
      Strain quantification in ASD before and after transcatheter closure with special emphasis on
      the assessment of the relationship between device size and biventricular systolic and LV
      diastolic function.

    <description>Isolated ostium Secundum ASD patients who are involving in this study have been already selected for intervention before the starting time of the study. The ASD patients who will be scheduled for transcatheter closure have either haemodynamically significant shunt fraction (Qp/Qs &gt; 1.5) or echocardiographic signs of right heart dilation or RV volume overload and pulmonary hypertension related symptoms. 2-D TTE derived Tissue Doppler and Strain Imaging will be done for all patients at baseline, 24 hours and 1-3 month post-procedure. Correlation between the device size and echocardiographic variables will be performed. Comparison between the results of the 2D-TTE derived Strain Imaging procedures will be done between baseline data and those obtained one day after the procedure and at one month follow up.</description>

        The study includes two groups: 1. Patients with isolated Secundum ASDs who are referred for
        possible elective transcatheter closure of the defects. Comparison between the results of
        the haemodynamic 2D echocardiography derived Strain and Strain Rate imaging procedure will
        be done as follow:

        a. Echo 1 - performed just before the procedure b. Echo 2 - performed the day after the
        procedure c. Echo 3 - performed 1-3 months following the procedure

        2. Control group: age and gender-matched healthy subjects are being examined to assess
        their LV and RV haemodynamic parameters and strain results and compare these data with the
        study group.
