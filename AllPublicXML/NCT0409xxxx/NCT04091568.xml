  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this observational study is to explore and compare patients' experiences of asleep
      and awake fibreoptic intubation using a semi qualitative patient questionnaire. In
      particular, investigators will investigate the occurrence of negative experiences, such as
      distress and discomfort.

      This study aims to investigate whether there are significant differences in aspects of
      patient experience during AFOI and asleep fibreoptic intubation. The study will be conducted
      at University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust and Oxford University Hospitals
      Foundation Trust.

      Investigators are not aware of any studies to date comparing patient experiences of AFOI with
      asleep fibreoptic intubation to ascertain the significant differences in side effects. If
      there is no evidence of any significant difference in negative patient experiences, this
      might help to encourage anaesthetists to reduce their threshold for AFOI and to use this as
      first choice for anticipated difficult airway management.

      A member of the research team will approach the patient about the study and obtain written
      informed consent, if the patient is willing and able to participate. The participant will be
      provided with a specifically designed questionnaire, covering several aspects of patient
      experience. A mixture of free response answers and numerical rating scales will be used. The
      member of the research team approaching the patient with the questionnaire will be blinded to
      the intubation procedure, ensuring consistent application of the questionnaire and minimising
      bias. This will then be the end of the study for the participant.

    <description>Participants will be asked to rate the discomfort during the procedure on a Visual Analogue Score (0-10). There will also be space for patients to write comments explaining their score. These comments will then be used for content analysis, for example to explore different aspects of the procedure that caused distress.</description>
