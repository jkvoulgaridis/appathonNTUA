    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this protocol is to evaluate the feasibility of acquiring
      simultaneous 4D ultrasound and 4D MRI scans. The imaging performance of the US and MRI scans
      will be characterized. The secondary objective of this study is to determine if several
      salient features identified in the US scan can be used to predict target motion identified in
      the MR scan.

      The goal of radiotherapy treatment of cancer is to cure or locally control the disease while
      minimizing complications to healthy tissue. Given the complexity of tumor and normal tissue
      response to radiation, precise and accurate delivery of absorbed dose distributions, within
      known tolerances, is necessary to achieve the maximum therapeutic ratio. The complex
      treatment process of radiotherapy introduces geometrical uncertainties including respiratory
      induced tumor motion. The goal of this research is to develop and validate a novel
      image-guidance technique to directly track tumor motion using a 4-dimensional (4D) planar
      ultrasound (US) transducer during radiation therapy that is coupled to a pre-treatment
      calibration training image set consisting of a simultaneous 4D ultrasound and 4D magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) acquisition. The image sets will be rapidly matched using advanced
      image and signal processing algorithms, allowing the display of virtual MR images of the
      tumor/organ motion in real-time from an ultrasound acquisition.

    <description>To conduct non-contrast agent MR and ultrasound scans in order to evaluate and demonstrate, on a continuing basis, the technical and clinical feasibility of new or modified features (the &quot;Prototype&quot;) of a combined MRI and ultrasound system, and software. Prototype MRI and ultrasound systems are defined as components of the MRI system (software) and ultrasound system (hardware and software) that have been modified in some form.</description>

    <measure>MR/US Motion Management Platform</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The goal of this trial is to assess the feasibility of implementing the system into clinical practice and to compare the dosimetric advantages of its use. In a retrospective analysis, the patients' standard treatment plan with ITV expansion will be directly compared with a second treatment plan using a smaller respiratory-gated margin (i.e., GTV-only expanded for PTV without ITV expansion). Normal tissue constraints will be specified and follow standard clinical constraints. The percent of liver volume receiving greater than 18 Gy will be used as a quantitative metric to assess the dosimetric impact of our platform. In addition, overall treatment time with the relative &quot;beam on time&quot; and duty cycle will also be compared. Additionally, the ultrasound acquisition during treatment will be used to assess intra- and interfraction changes in breathing patterns as the patients progress through treatment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Accuracy of image-guidance technique</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The accuracy of our image-guidance technique will be done by showing that several salient features identified in the US scan can be used to predict/model target motion identified in the MR scan. In this context the target will be a large easily identifiable structure in the test subject (e.g. cyst, vessel). MRI and ultrasound images will be acquired simultaneously such that the motion of tissues or organs in the body can be effectively tracked as a function of respiratory state in the subject. In this manner, the ultrasound system will allow real-time tracking of salient features in the patient that are indicative of the respiratory state.</description>

    <measure>Test/re-test</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>A secondary objective of this substudy is to evaluate the accuracy of probe re-position during subsequent treatment sessions (i.e. test/re-test) in cancer patient subjects. The probe will be positioned during one of the patient subjects and images will be acquired. During a subsequent treatment session the probe will be re-positioned and images will be acquired. The image data will be used to evaluate to measure the concordance between the two datasets.</description>
