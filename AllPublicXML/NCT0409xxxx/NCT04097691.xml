      Observational cohort prospective study with the following of 100 patients of type 1 and type
      2 diabetes mellitus in 2 groups each group 50 patients, each group 30 males, and 20
      females,35 patients with type 2 diabetes and 15 patients type 1 diabetes all have diabetic
      peripheral neuropathy, the second group is considered as control. the ages of all patients
      are between 20 and 50 years.

      The first group was on subcutaneous glucose 0.5 ml per site around subcutaneous nerves in the
      foot region both on palm and sole.which is repeated every 2 weeks for 2 months.

      Pain severity was evaluated by using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) which is a numerical
      rating scales, with a straight horizontal line of 100 mm. which is directed from the left
      with severe pain to the right with no pain. 1-3 = mild pain,4-6 = moderate pain,7-10 = severe
      pain.

      The evaluation of neuropathy was done by using the Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument
      (MNSI) after translation to the Arabic language.which consists a 15 self-administered
      questionnaires and examination lower extremities which comprise inspection and examination of
      vibratory senses and ankle reflexes. A score which is more than 7 was suggested to be
      abnormal.
