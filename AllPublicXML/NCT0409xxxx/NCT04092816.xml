  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm pilot study to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a novel
      psychosocial intervention to improve psychosocial outcomes for parents with advanced cancer
      and their co-parents. In this single-center study, we will recruit ten mothers with
      metastatic breast cancer and their co-parents as dyads (N=20) to participate in the Fathers
      and Mothers Invested in the Lives of their Youth (FAMILY) intervention. Patient and co-parent
      dyads will participate in 2-3 study visits with an intervention facilitator and a
      post-intervention feedback interview. Participants will also complete baseline and follow-up
      study surveys. The final products of this study will be the FAMILY intervention manual and
      training materials, and fidelity assessments.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancer is the leading disease-specific cause of early parental death in the United States and
      having dependent children worsens suffering for parents with advanced cancer and their
      families. The FAMILY intervention consists of manualized visits with a trained intervention
      facilitator and psychoeducation materials to help parents cope with cancer-related parenting
      concerns. The purpose of the intervention is to improve parenting concerns, emotional
      well-being, and end-of-life (EOL) preparation among participants. This study will evaluate
      whether a psychosocial intervention to reduce psychological distress and improve EOL
      preparation for mothers with metastatic breast cancer and their co-parents can be acceptable,
      feasible, and relevant to the target patient population.

      This study is needed in order to generate critical data to: (1) refine the intervention in
      preparation for a pilot efficacy randomized controlled trial (RCT); and to generate
      preliminary data demonstrating the feasibility and acceptability of core intervention
      components. The preliminary data will support future grant applications for a full-scale
      efficacy RCT.
