  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim 1: To conduct a formative evaluation of museum-based programming to address loneliness
      and social isolation.

      Aim 2: To develop a consensus-derived Model Museum-Based Program (MMBP) to address loneliness
      among individuals with chronic pain.

      Aim 3: To evaluate the feasibility of museum experiences to reduce loneliness and pain among
      isolated individuals with chronic pain.

      Due to safety concerns related to the covid pandemic in-person museum programming could not
      continue and virtual versions of the interventions were created. We will publish results on
      both the in-person and virtual versions of the intervention as well as a pooled analysis.
