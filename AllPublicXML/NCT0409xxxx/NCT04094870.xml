      This pilot study will evaluate, through quantitative and qualitative methods, whether
      different treatments for postpartum depression are feasible and acceptable in postpartum HIV
      infected women on antiretrovirals (ART). The study will take place at several clinics in
      Lusaka, Zambia.

      The standard of care for treating postpartum depression in the US is antidepressants,
      psychotherapy or both. Little data exist on the best method for treating perinatal depression
      (PND) in Sub-Saharan Africa. This is a mixed method study including a pilot randomized
      controlled trial (RCT) of antidepressant medication (ADM) versus interpersonal psychotherapy
      (IPT) and qualitative semi-structured interviews (SSIs). The study will enroll 100 pregnant
      HIV infected women over the age of 18 seeking postnatal care and continuing antiretroviral
      therapy in pregnancy. An additional 20 women enrolled in the RCT will be invited to
      participate in SSIs. Each participant will be followed for 24 weeks.

    <description>The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) is a 10-item self-report used to measure postpartum depression with score range 0-30, a higher score indicates greater symptom burden. A score of &gt; 6 is indicative of a woman being at risk of perinatal depression.</description>

    <description>MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) is a brief structured diagnostic interview and is designed to assess the most common psychiatric disorders in ICD-10 and DSM-5. We will use the following MINI modules: major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. Questions are rated dichotomously (yes/no) and clinical judgment should be used in coding the responses, asking for examples if needed. Participants will be eligible for the study if they are diagnosed with depression or anxiety based on the MINI assessment.</description>
