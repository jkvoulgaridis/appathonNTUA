      The investigators aim to study whether surgical resurfacing of the sigmoid sinus and jugular
      bulb will result in elimination of venous pulsatile tinnitus.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently there is no known treatments with efficacy for venous pulsatile tinnitus without
      any pathology. The investigators hope to learn that in surgery, resurfacing of the sigmoid
      sinus and jugular bulb (acoustic dampening) will eliminate symptoms such as pulsatile
      tinnitus in patients. The knowledge learned will significantly help treat and alleviate
      future patients that have pulsatile tinnitus.

      The purpose of the study is to examine whether surgical resurfacing of the sigmoid sinus and
      jugular bulb will result in elimination of pulsatile tinnitus in human subjects.

    <intervention_model_description>Surgery arm - patient undergoes tympanomastoidectomy (approx 2 hour operation on ear and mastoid) where a local soft tissue flap is transferred to cover the sigmoid sinus, a cartilage and perichondrial graft is taken from the tragus to cover the jugular bulb). Patient has routine follow up - H&amp;P, 2 weeks after surgery and then H&amp;P, Audiometry and Tympanometry over 12 months post surgery (3rd month, 6th month and 12th month). Non surgery arm - patient has audiological consult and fitting of masking device.
The Patient has a routine follow up - H&amp;P, 2 weeks after masking fitting and then H&amp;P, Audiometry, Tympanometry over 12 months (3rd month, 6th month and 12th month). Patient cross over to change arms, at 6 months, if they have no resolution of symptoms.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Screening performed at outpatient clinic after consultation for management of venous pulsatile tinnitus. Consent and formal recruitment into study performed at preoperative visit or at audiological visit.
The masking device is a hearing aid that provides sound that is aimed to negate the internal sound from the pulsatile tinnitus. Almost all hearing aid can be converted to a masking device for tinnitus. It is externally worn on the ear and provides sound at a desired volume. The benefits of wearing the masking device are that it may reduce the volume of the pulsatile tinnitus. As it is worn on the external ear and is not invasive there are minimal risks but potential risks could include irritation of the external ear and discomfort from wearing.</description>
