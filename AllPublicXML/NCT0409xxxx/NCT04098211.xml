  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to gather information on the possible symptoms that patients
      with atypical neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 2 (also known as aTPP1 or atypical
      tripeptidyl peptidase deficiency) have and how they change over time.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aims characterize the natural history of atypical TPP1 deficiency patients via
      longitudinal multidisciplinary assessments.

      Multifaceted clinical, laboratory, imaging, and diagnostic assessments will be performed at
      regular intervals upon enrolled aTPP1 deficiency patients, collated, and analyzed over a
      three-year longitudinal period.

    <measure>CLN2 Disease Severity Scoring</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and every 3 months afterwards, up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Modified Hamburg Rating Scale. The rating scale consists of two domains (motor function, language). Within each domain, a score from 0 to 3 is assigned and overall scores are calculated by summing the domain scores for final rating of 0 (severely impaired) to 6 (normal).</description>

    <measure>Electroretinogram (ERG)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and every 6 months afterwards, up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Standard ERG will be performed to measure function of cones and rods of the inner and outer photoreceptor layers which amplitudes are typically decreased in classical TPP1 deficiency.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and every 6 months afterwards, up to 3 years</time_frame>

    <measure>Gait Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and every 6 months afterwards, up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Gait assessment is acquired utilizing infrared sensors applied to participant's clothing and will include collection of walking speed, cadence, swing phase, stride length and time, walking base width, stance phase, and double limb support phase.</description>

    <measure>Cognitive Assessment, Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children version 4 (WISC-IV)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and every 12 months afterwards, up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>WISC-IV will generate a full scale of intelligence quotient and five primary index scores: Verbal Comprehension, Visual Spatial, Fluid Reasoning, Working Memory, and Processing Speed. The WAIS-IV is scored by summing the raw scores for each subtest; each raw subtest score is then converted to a scaled scored. They are then combined to create a Full Scale IQ Index score. Test takers will also be given a score on the General Ability Index (GAI).</description>
