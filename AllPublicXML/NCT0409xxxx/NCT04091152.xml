  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the last ten years, gerontechnology is becoming an increasing topic in geriatric medicine.
      Nevertheless, there are still few studies assessing the usability of technologies in old
      patients, especially when they are hospitalized. Moreover, it has been shown that new
      technologies could be a source of ageism, thence the importance of involving the old people
      in the development of these technologies.

      Tik easy is a subsidiary of La Poste Company. Tik easy as designed a new tablet PC for old
      people. Research tends to show that the use of tablet PC can promote health and well-aging,
      and delay cognitive decline. In this study, we want to give a free access to &quot;Ardoiz&quot;, the
      tablet PC designed by Tik easy, for old patients hospitalized in a geriatric acute care unit.
      The &quot;Ardoiz&quot; tablet PC allows to:

        -  Maintain the family and social bond (send and receive messages, share photos and videos,
           call remotely between the patient and his family)

        -  Discovering the Internet at his own pace (browse the Internet with daily updated
           contents such as news, content on cooking, music, etc.).

        -  Prevent cognitive aging (stimulate cognitive abilities with the DYNSEO games).

        -  Facilitate online administrative procedures.

      The &quot;Ardoiz&quot; tablet PC will be given to old patients hospitalized in the acute care geriatric
      unit of the university hospital of Angers. Patients and their relatives will have a free
      access to &quot;Ardoiz&quot; during their hospitalisation. The maximum duration of use will be 9 days.
      After the using period, a survey will be proposed to the patients and their relatives. This
      survey include questions concerning usability (using the validated SUS questionnaire),
      ergonomics (using non validated specific questionnaire with closed questions oriented on
      &quot;Ardoiz&quot; device), satisfaction (general and specific questions using non validated
      questionnaire with forced choice Likert scale in 4 points and closed questions). After
      recruiting all expected patients and relatives; the survey will also be submitted to the
      professional caregivers of the unit.
