  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-masked, randomized-controlled, dispensing clinical trial. A total of
      approximately 40 eligible hyperopic and myopic subjects will be targeted to complete the
      study. The subjects will be fit in the first study lens and worn for a total of 8-12 days
      following a 7±3 day wash-out period. The procedures will be repeated for the 2nd lens.

    <measure>Lens Centration</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 8 to12-day follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The position of the lens is observed with the subject's eyes in the primary gaze position. Lens centration relative to the cornea is rated as, Centered (Optimal), Slightly decentered, or Substantially decentered.</description>

    <measure>Lens Movement</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 8 to 12-day follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The vertical movement of the contact lens shall be observed in the subject while remaining in primary gaze, upward, and then when the study lens is gently pushed upward. The movement will be graded as Excessive, Unacceptable Movement; Moderate, but Acceptable Movement; Optimal Movement; Minimal but Acceptable Movement; and Insufficient, Unacceptable Movement</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjective Lens Handling</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 8 to 12-day follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>CLUE Handling is assessed using the Contact Lens User Experience (CLUE™) Questionnaire. CLUE™ is a validated patient-reported outcomes questionnaire to assess patient experience attributes of soft, disposable contact lenses (comfort, vision, handling, and packaging) in a contact lens-wearing population in the US, ages 18-65. Scores follow a normal distribution with a population average score of 60 (SD 20), where higher scores indicate a more favorable / positive response. 97% of the scores fall within 0 and 120 (mean +/- 3XSD).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Potential subjects must satisfy all the following criteria to be enrolled in the
             study:

               1. The subject must read, understand, and sign the STATEMENT OF INFORMED CONSENT and
                  receive a fully executed copy of the form.

               2. The subject must appear able and willing to adhere to the instructions set forth
                  in this clinical protocol.

               3. The subject must be between 40 and 70 years of age (inclusive).

               4. The subject's distance spherical equivalent refraction must be in the range of
                  +1.25 D to +3.75 D or -1.25 D to -4.00 D in each eye.

               5. The subject's refractive cylinder must be ≤0.75 D in each eye.

               6. The subject's ADD power must be in the range of +0.75 D to +2.50 D.

               7. The subject must have best corrected visual acuity of 20/20-3 or better in each
                  eye.

               8. Subjects must own a wearable pair of spectacles if required for their distance
                  vision.

               9. The subject must be an adapted soft contact lens wearer in both eyes (i.e. worn
                  lenses a minimum of 2 days per week for at least 8 hours per wear day, for 1
                  month of more duration).

              10. The subject must either already be wearing a presbyopic contact lens correction
                  (e.g., reading spectacles over contact lenses, multifocal or monovision contact
                  lenses, etc.) or if not respond positively to at least one symptom on the
                  &quot;Presbyopic Symptoms Questionnaire&quot;.
