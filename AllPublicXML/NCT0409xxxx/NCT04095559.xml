      This study is to investigate the correlation and to obtain the coefficient of correlation
      between the global and local bipolar signals (voltage maps) of the LA in sinus rhythm using a
      focal 4.5 mm irrigated-tip ablation catheter (in combination with microelectrodes), a
      ring-electrode circular mapping catheter and a microelectrode multipolar catheter in
      combination with the Rhythmia system.

      Current hypothesis of the mechanism of atrial fibrillation (AF) is a combination of local
      firing mainly triggered from the pulmonary veins and atrial substrate due to atrial
      remodelling sustaining AF. Whereas for paroxysmal AF, pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) is still
      the mainstay of interventional treatment, a left atrial (LA) substrate-based ablation
      especially in patients with persistent or long-standing persistent AF may be reasonable to
      improve freedom from AF. In addition, even in patients with paroxysmal AF, substrate-based
      ablation strategies have been shown to improve outcome. Substrate characterization of the LA
      is currently performed using the focal ablation catheter with a 3.5mm irrigated tip catheter
      with a 2 mm interelectrode spacing, a circular (Lasso) or spider like diagnostic (Pentaray)
      catheter with 1 mm size of the ring electrodes and 2 mm to 4 mm interelectrode spacing.
      Consequently, the cut-off values to delineate healthy tissue from diseased substrate are
      defined based on these measures. Since the electrode size and distance between the electrodes
      determines the bipolar voltage amplitude and morphology (beside their orientation with regard
      to the propagation wavefront), differences in bipolar voltage values must be expected between
      different catheter types and especially for the novel micro-electrode catheters IntellaMap
      Orion and IntellaNav MIFI OI. With the knowledge of the relationship between the bipolar
      voltage maps created with the different catheter types, information/knowledge from one study
      obtained with a specific catheter can be transferred to patients treated with the other
      catheter types. This study is to investigate the correlation and to obtain the coefficient of
      correlation between the global and local bipolar signals (voltage maps) of the LA in sinus
      rhythm using a focal 4.5 mm irrigated-tip ablation catheter (in combination with
      microelectrodes), a ring-electrode circular mapping catheter and a microelectrode multipolar
      catheter in combination with the Rhythmia system.
