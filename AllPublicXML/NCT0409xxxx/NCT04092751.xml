    <textblock>
      This is an Open-Label, Randomized, Two-Period, Crossover Study to Evaluate the Effect of Oral
      Doses of SCY-078 (Ibrexafungerp) on the Pharmacokinetics of Pravastatin Administered Orally
      to Healthy Subjects
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The two period crossover study will consist of two treatments administered in random order
      separated by a minimum 10 day washout interval (between the last dose in the first period and
      the first dose in the subsequent period).

      28 healthy adult male and female subjects will be enrolled to determine the effects of
      SCY-078 on the pharmacokinetics of a single-dose of PRA.

      Subjects will undergo a screening visit 4 weeks prior to dosing.

      Subjects will be randomized to a treatment sequence (AB or BA) in a crossover fashion:

      Treatment A = Single oral 20-mg dose of PRA on Day 1 AM.

      Treatment B = Twice daily (BID) oral doses of SCY-078 750 mg (5 X 150-mg tablets) on Day 1
      and Day 2; and on Day 3 a single AM dose of oral SCY 078 750 mg followed one hour later by a
      single 20-mg oral dose of PRA.

      All subjects will be admitted to the clinical site on Day -1 in each period and will then
      fast overnight and will stay in the clinical site until the final procedures are performed in
      that treatment period, and then they may be discharged.

      For Treatment B, on Day 1, 2, and 3, limited PK blood samples will be collected for SCY 078
      assays.

      For Treatments A on Days 1 and 2, and Treatment B on Day 3, serial PK blood samples will be
      collected for PRA assays.
