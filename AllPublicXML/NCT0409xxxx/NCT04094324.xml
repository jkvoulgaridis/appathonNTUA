  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over the last decades, there has been an increase in the number of children and youth with
      mental illness, such as anxiety and depression. Mental illness in youth has a strong negative
      influence on the youth's quality of life and generally leads to dysfunction in several
      important areas, such as school and social activities. Early detection and treatment of
      mental illness entails great treatment benefits, and thus provide opportunity to prevent or
      reduce individual suffering.

      Youth who suffer från Medical conditions, such as diabetes, epilepsy, gastro-intestinal
      disease, and obesity, show an increased risk of developing mental illness. There are
      well-established, careful programs for examining somatic co-morbidities to diseases in
      children and youth. Currently, despite the fact that mental illness is more common in these
      children than medical sequelae and despite that such a procedure is recommended, no routine
      exist for examining mental health in children and youth presenting for treatment at pediatric
      clinics in Skåne. The absence of such a general screening entails that mental illness rarely
      is recognized by medical care providers until it has become severe.

      The purpose of this study is to describe the prevalence of mental illness in children and
      adolescents, 11-18 years of age, that undergo Medical treatment at a Clinic for children and
      youth. Groups recruited for the first part of the study are obesity clinics and gastro
      clinics. In addition, we want to examine if mental health affects outcome success in their
      medical treatment. The long-term main objective of this project is early discovery and
      treatment of mental illness in somatically ill children and youth, thereby preventing the
      development of severe mental illness, and to reduce suffering.

      By the end of the project we will have a well-functioning routine for examining mental health
      status in 11-18 years olds that present for and undergo treatment in Clinics for children and
      youth in Skåne. Furthermore, we hope that the screening tool can contribute to, and affect,
      nationally established guide-lines regarding the discovery and treatment of mental illness in
      children and adolescents within pediatric care.

      Children and youth, 11-18 years of age, that receive treatment for obesity or Irritable Bowel
      Disease (IBD), will be asked to fill out three questionnaires on an iPad during a regular
      visit at their clinic. Information about the study will be sent home before the visit, and
      will be repeated again at the clinic.

      The questionnaires takes about 10-15 minutes in total to answer, and the Child will be able
      to sit in a separate room while answering. The questionnaires are well validated screening
      tools for various forms of mental illness; General anxiety disorder 7 item scale (GAD-7)
      (anxiety), Psycic Health questionnaire 8 items (PHQ-8) (depression), The Child Eating
      Disorder Examination 8 items (ChEDE-Q8) (eating habits), and Pediatric quality of Life
      inventory (PedsQL).

      Patients that receive high scores will be offered a psychologist appointment for further
      evaluation and treatment (e. g. individual- or family centered therapy).
