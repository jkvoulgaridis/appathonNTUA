      Exploring directional lead

  <detailed_description>

      This is a single-centre, double-blinded cross-over study comparing the standard electrode
      configuration (ring-mode) vs. directional electrode configuration for steered stimulation of
      deep brain stimulation (DBS) patients.

      The study will follow 2 phases.

      Phase 1:

      Visit 1 Screening/Baseline (T0):

      As per current standard care for patients undergoing subthalamic deep brain stimulation
      (STN-DBS), participants will be screened 3-6 months before the DBS STN implant surgery (T0)
      according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria.

      Visits for standard practiced care for programing of DBS Between 1 to 3 months after the
      surgery, programing of the DBS system for the 20 patients will be done in an open label
      fashion in order to find the contact able to reduce the motor symptoms without the side
      effects. This will be done according to the standard of practice currently adopted at Toronto
      Western Hospital.

      Phase 2:

      Visit 1

      Randomization: 4 months +/- 4weeks after the surgery, patients will be randomized to two type
      of stimulation:

        1. Standard : The percentage of current allocated to the central split contacts will be
           evenly distributed in order to perfectly mimic a standard ring contact. All possible
           types of frequencies and pulse widths will be used. The same amount of current for each
           of the active contacts will be used.

        2. Directional: contacts 1-8 will be used in any possible configuration and using different
           amount of current for each of the active one as well as different frequencies. In
           conclusion, all the capabilities of the DBS system will be used.

      Possible adjustments to stimulation parameters (e.g. pulse width, amplitude threshold) will
      be performed to achieve an optimal therapeutic window for each patient.

      Visit 2 Follow up visit at 6 months +/- 4 weeks of the surgery for neurological examination
      if required.

      Visit 3 (T1):

      Cross over : 7 months +/- 4 weeks after the surgery patients will be switched to the other
      type of stimulation . Raters and patients will be blinded to the group allocation.

      Visit 4:

      Follow up visit at 9 months +/- 4 weeks of the surgery for neurological examination if
      required.

      Visit 5 (T2):

      End of study visit at month 10 +/- 4 weeks after the surgery. There might be unscheduled
      visits in case of unexpected clinical conditions (i.e. occurrence of side effects or
      worsening of motor conditions). Participants will be in this study for a maximum of 16
      months. Throughout the whole study, participants will visit the clinic without their regular
      medication as part of standard treatment practice. All the stimulation adjustment will be
      performed by the same unblinded physician or sub-investigator.
