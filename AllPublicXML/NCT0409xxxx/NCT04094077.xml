      This study evaluates the clinical impact of AGuIX® nanoparticles in combination with
      Fractionated Stereotactic Radiation in oligo brain metastases.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AGuIX® (Activation and Guidance of Irradiation by X-ray, NH TherAguix) are Gadolinium
      chelated polysiloxane based nanoparticles with Magnetic Resonance contrast properties, able
      to accumulate in the tumor through the enhanced permeability and retention effect and
      sufficiently small (sub-5 nm diameter) to allow for renal clearance.

      AGuIX® nanomedicine can be used as:

        -  Positive contrast agent for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). It displays higher
           efficacy than commercial contrast agents and so it can be used to delineate precisely
           the tumors.

        -  A booster of Radiotherapy during the radiotherapy protocol, after the localization of
           the tumor.

      This is permitted by the high radiosensitizing potential of AGuIX® that allows a local
      increase of efficacy of X-ray damages. French and international groups have demonstrated the
      radiosensitizer effect of AGuIX® to improve the efficacy of radiotherapy.

      Thanks to a difference in porosity between the vascular networks, AGuIX® penetrates and
      resides in tumor tissues, but not in healthy tissues.

    <description>The primary endpoint is the rate of local control defined as the proportion of patients with a complete response, a partial response or a stable disease. Response of Brain lesion will be evaluated using the RECIST classifications with partial response (PR, &gt; 30% decrease in longest diameter), stable disease (SD &lt;30% decrease and &lt;20% increase in longest diameter), progressive disease (PD &gt; 20% increase in longest diameter) and Complete response (CR) (complete disappearance of the brain lesion).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Distant Brain failure</measure>
    <time_frame>6 month and at 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Distant Brain failure is defined as the presence of new brain metastases or leptomeningeal enhancement outside the irradiated volume.</description>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tumor target volume</measure>
    <time_frame>4 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Tumor target volume agreement is the comparison between both the MRI images with AGuIX® and Gd-chelates. It is defined as the correlation between the irradiation volume calculated based on the MRI before nanoparticles injection and the volume calculated after nanoparticles injection.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>From Day 1 to Day 45</time_frame>
    <description>The assessment of safety will be based mainly on the frequency of adverse events based on the common toxicity criteria (CTCAE-V5.0) grade.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>FACT-Br</measure>
    <time_frame>45 days, 3 month, 6 month, 9 month and 12 month</time_frame>
    <description>The FACT-Br consists of a general version (FACT-G) and a brain subscale (BRCS). The FACT-G consist of 27 questions with 4 domains assessing physical well-being (score range: 0-28), social/family well-being (score range: 0-28), emotional well-being (score range: 0-24) and functional well-being (score range: 0-28). The BRCs is a 23-item questionnaire related to neurological concerns that provides an additional set of disease-specific questions pertaining to brain neoplasms (score range: 0-92). The FACT-Br total score is the sum of the FACT-G total score and the BrCS score. Positive change scores indicate improved quality of life.</description>

    <measure>MMSE</measure>
    <time_frame>45 days, 3 month, 6 month, 9 month and 12 month</time_frame>
    <description>The MMSE is an 11-item measure that tests five areas of cognitive function: orientation, registration, attention and calculation, recall and language. The minimum score is 0 and the maximum score is 30 with higher MMSE scores indicating better cognition.</description>
