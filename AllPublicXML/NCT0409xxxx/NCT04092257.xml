      The purpose of this study is to assess completion and performance of the following novel
      invasive cervical cancer (ICC) screen-and-treat algorithm among 625 HIV-positive women in
      Lilongwe, Malawi: 1) rapid testing of self-collected vaginal brush for primary high risk
      (hr)-human papillomavirus (HPV), 2) same-day visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) for
      women who are hr-HPV positive, and 3) thermocoagulation for VIA positive/ablation-eligible
      (by cervical colposcopy) women.

    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, prospective study of 625 HIV-positive women attending ART clinics in
      Lilongwe, Malawi. The primary objectives of this study are to assess completion of a novel
      ICC screen-and-treat strategy among HIV-positive women in Lilongwe, Malawi, using
      self-collected vaginal brush for hr-HPV testing, followed by same-day VIA and
      thermocoagulation for HPV-positive/VIA-positive/ablation-eligible (by colposcopy) women, and
      to determine the 24-week efficacy of thermocoagulation among HIV-positive women with CIN2/3.
      The secondary objective will be to evaluate the performance of the ICC screen-and-treat
      strategy by estimating overtreatment for women who are
      HPV-positive/VIA-positive/ablation-eligible, and undertreatment among
      HPV-positive/VIA-negative women.

    <description>Participants will self-collect a vaginal brush for hr-HPV testing. HPV-positive women and every 10th consecutive HPV-negative woman will complete same-day VIA with colposcopically-directed cervical biopsy and ECC (if lesion seen), and thermocoagulation if ablation-eligible by colposcopy. If no lesion is seen on colposcopy, the woman will have a cervical pap smear and ECC collected, and no thermocoagulation will be performed. Finally, women who are suspicious for cancer at VIA will undergo colposcopically-directed cervical biopsies.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Females ≥ 25 years of age at study entry and ≤ 50 years of age (per current Malawi
             National Cervical Cancer Control Program guidelines for screening).

          2. Females with confirmed HIV-1 infection. FDA-approved testing methods should be used
             when possible.

          3. Ability and willingness of participant to provide written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Current or prior history of cervical, vaginal or vulvar cancer or dysplasia

          2. Current symptomatic sexual transmitted infection requiring treatment (women will be
             allowed to be in the study upon successful treatment)

          3. Prior HPV vaccination.

          4. Participants with known allergy to acetic acid.

          5. Participants with a history of total hysterectomy.

          6. Participants who are pregnant or plan on becoming pregnant during the study period.

          7. Participants who are less than 12 weeks postpartum.

          8. Participants with other illnesses that would limit compliance with study requirements
             or in the opinion of the investigator or designee, have a problem that would make
             participation in the study unsafe or complicate interpretation of study findings.
