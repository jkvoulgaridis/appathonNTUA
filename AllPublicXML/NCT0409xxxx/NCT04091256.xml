  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical study is to evaluate the effect of desensitizing toothpaste
      containing zinc-carbonate hydroxyapatite nanocrystals in reducing or controlling DH after 8
      weeks of treatment

      This clinical study design is an 8-week single center, before and after use of desensitize
      dentifrice. This study will conducted in the College of Dentistry Qassim University. 72
      patients surfing from DH, include in the study fulfill the inclusion criteria. All subjects
      20 to 70 years of age in good health, and must have 2 teeth with DH, will be included in this
      study. Screening will be performed for the selection of patients, which fulfill the inclusion
      criteria. Baseline data will be recorded and Sensitivity was assessed by air-blast
      sensitivity, using Schiff Sensitivity Scale (SSS).

      Sensitivity was assessed by air-blast sensitivity, using Schiff Sensitivity Scale (SSS)
      described as follows.

      0 = Subject does not respond to air stimulus

        1. = Subject responds to air stimulus but does not request discontinuation of stimulus

        2. = Subject responds to air stimulus and requests discontinuation or moves from stimulus

        3. = Subject responds to air stimulus, considers stimulus to be painful, and requests
           discontinuation of the stimulus
