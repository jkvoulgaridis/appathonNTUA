      Patients followed in Internal Medicine bring together favorable conditions for the use of
      alternative medicines. While some are recognized for their benefits, some can, on the
      contrary, harm the patient. It is therefore proposed to make a complete descriptive inventory
      of these practices, through an anonymized questionnaire. The main objective is the evaluation

      Patients followed in Internal Medicine department bring together favorable conditions for the
      use of alternative medicines. While some are recognized for their benefits, some can, on the
      contrary, harm the patient. It is therefore proposed to make a complete descriptive inventory
      of these practices, through an anonymized questionnaire. The main objective is the evaluation
      of the proportion of the use of alternative medicines in patients with autoimmune diseases in
      the department of Internal Medicine .

      At all times alternative medicine has existed. Internal Medicine deals with rare autoimmune
      diseases, of which there is not always a cure. Even when the treatment is optimal, there are
      often subjective complaints.Patients followed in Internal Medicine therefore have favorable
      conditions for the use of alternative medicines. While some are recognized for their
      benefits, some can, on the contrary, harm the patient. It is therefore proposed to make a
      complete descriptive inventory of these practices, through an anonymized questionnaire. This
      information will make it possible to target the patient's needs, and to be able to offer
      alternative medicines that are better focused, without calling into question their
      conventional treatment
