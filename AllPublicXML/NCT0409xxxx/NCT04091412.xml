  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intracranial artery stenosis is the leading cause of stroke onset or recurrence in Asian.
      Multiple studies have shown that anterior circulation is most common in intracranial artery
      stenosis, especially the middle cerebral artery in patients with symptomatic or asymptomatic
      ischemic stroke. Based on the clinical experiences, we found that the cerebral collateral
      development can affect clinical symptoms seriously in patients with large artery stenosis.
      Compensated blood flow can reach the ischemic area through collateral circulation (including
      circle of Willis, leptomeningeal collaterals, extracranial to intracranial collaterals, and
      new angiogenesis) when the blood-supplying artery of the brain is severely stenotic or even
      occluded, however, considerable differences across individuals exist. Studies have shown
      statins and butylphthalide can promote collateral circulation. The influencing factors on
      collateral circulation building have not been completely identified yet, but a recent
      research found that Naturally occurring variants of Rabep2（Rab GTPase binding effector
      protein 2）are major determinants of variation in collateral extent and stroke severity in
      mice. On this basis, clinical trials have been conducted in order to confirm that the Rabep2
      gene is associated with individual differences in the collateral circulation.

      Summarizing new findings, we suspect whether the difference in the degree of collateral
      circulation is significant for long-term prognosis in patients with cerebral large arterial
      occlusion, and whether promoting collateral circulation and new angiogenesis can become a new
      treatment approach. Hereby, we plan to recruit 500 patients with cerebral large-artery
      occlusion, collect clinical and Imaging (CTA) information, analyze and investigate if the
      difference in the degree of collateral circulation can be the independent influencing factor
      for long-term prognosis. This study will collect blood sample of patients and further examine
      SNPs of Rabep2, and will then analyze the correlation between Rabep2 and patients with
      cerebral large-artery occlusion. This project will follow up rolled patients for 1 year,
      observe if long-term intake of butylphthalide can promote cerebral collateral development.
