  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To report the outcomes of a series of patients with recurrent anterior and/or posterior
      shoulder instability who underwent surgical repair of the affected labrum using the SureLock
      all-suture anchor.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patient-reported outcomes data have been collected among patients undergoing shoulder labrum
      repair with SureLock all-suture anchors from January 2014 to May 31, 2018. These patients
      have completed clinical and quality-of-life outcome instruments pre-operatively, and have
      been stored securely in the OBERD database. Pre-op scores will be compared to post-op scores
      and analyzed using a one-way ANOVA test with a post-hoc Scheffe procedure.

      Patient identifying information will be removed and de-identified codes will be used. Any new
      prospective data gathered prospectively for the purposes of this study will be entered and
      stored securely as above.

      Data collection forms will consist of the following Patient-Reported Outcome Surveys: WOSI
      Index, ASES Shoulder Score, and the SF-12.

    <description>Patients undergoing isolated anterior or posterior glenoid labrum repair using the SureLock All-Suture Anchor will experience statistically significant improvement in shoulder function assessed through the Western Ontario Shoulder Instability Index (WOSI) outcome measure. The WOSI is a 21-item scale used to measure shoulder related quality of life in patients with symptomatic shoulder instability.</description>

    <description>Patients undergoing isolated anterior or posterior glenoid labrum repair using the SureLock All-Suture Anchor will experience statistically significant improvement in shoulder function assessed through the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeon Score(ASES) outcome measure. The ASES is a condition-specific scale that is intended to measure functional limitations and pain of the shoulder.</description>

    <description>Patients undergoing isolated anterior or posterior glenoid labrum repair using the SureLock All-Suture Anchor will experience statistically significant improvement of health-related quality of life through the SF-12. The SF-12 is a short survey that is weighted and summed to provide easily interpretable scaled for physical and mental health. The range is from 0-100, 0 being the lowest level of health and 100 indicates the highest level of health.</description>

    <description>The assessment of safety and performance will be evaluated by analyzing implant survivorship. This will be established by recording the incidence and frequency of revisions, complications and Adverse Events. Relation of the events to either implant or instrumentation should be specified.</description>
