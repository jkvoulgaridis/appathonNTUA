  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There has been an increasing interest in Kinesiology Tape(KT) and Biomechanical Tape(BT) in
      clinics and athletic competitions. Recently; the performance increasing effect of taping
      methods on healthy subjects in sports is being investigated.

      Kinesio Taping (KT) is a technique utilizing a two way elastic tape originally created by
      Kenzo Kase in the 1970s. KT is a complementary method which is used as an adjunct to major
      therapy approaches in various musculoskeletal and neurological diseases.4 KT is employed in
      sports injuries and various health problems; but there is limited scientific evidence
      evaluating KT effectiveness and the results are inconsistent.5 One of the KT potential
      benefits is that of raising the range of motion through increasing blood circulation or
      through stimulation of cutaneous mechanoreceptors and this way it affects fascial tissue.6-8
      Biomechanical Taping (BT) is a technique utilizing a four way elastic tape originally created
      by Ryan Kendrick in the 2010s. BT is a complementary method for supplementing load
      absorption, force contribution and modifying movement. BT affects tissues and movement in a
      mechanical way and it is almost a completely different method from KT. Kase's hypothesis is
      that KT affects fascial tissues and mechanoreseptors, but Kendrick's hypothesis is that BT
      ,which is applied in shortened position and cross joint segments, will gain potential energy
      in case of an extremity realized movement with antagonist activity. Then the weak agonist
      muscle gets activated for repositioning the extremity; this potential energy turns to kinetic
      energy like a released bow. As a result of kinetic energy, it may support the movement with
      using passive mechanical strength.9 In this study, the investigators aim to illustrate
      immediate effects of various taping methods on the performances of healthy subjects. In that
      way the investigators test hypothesis that different taping methods affect healthy subjects
      to improve performance. The investigators; investigate strength, active range of motion and
      vertical jump height as a parameters of performance with No Tape(NT), Sham Tape(ST), KT and
      BT.

    <intervention_model_description>This study was conceived as a randomized placebo controlled prospective trial. With the aim of blocking effects of morphological specifities of participants, this study was designed on a four stage application on the same participants. This stages were (1) control testing with No Tape(NT) (2) placebo testing with Sham Tape(ST) application (3) Kinesology Tape(KT) application (4) Biomechanical Tape (BT) application. With the aim of blocking bias effects, randomization was designed with the computerized system using four way algorithm which led to NT, ST, KT and BT applications for each participant in mixed order but all applications have equal time in order.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>A fotoelectrical sensor base &quot;Micro Gate Opto Jump Next®, software version 1.10, BFS Vertical Jump protocol with three jumps&quot; was used for quantitative analysis of Counter Movement Vertical Jump (CMVJ). Minimum, maximum and average values of jumping height for all jumps (10) were recorded as canti-meter (cm).</description>

    <description>A hand held electronic dynamometer &quot;MicroFet® 2&quot; was used to evaluate isometric bilateral knee extension and ankle dorsal flexion strength.11 Measurements were repeated three times and maximum value of strength was recorded as Kilogram-Force (Kg-F).</description>

    <description>A wide angle webcam &quot;logitech® c920 full hd pro web cam&quot; that was integrated with opto jump software was used for assessment of active range of motion in front of jumping on image based assessment tool of opto jump software. Acromion, Trochantor major of femur, lateral epicondyle of femur, Lateral Condyle of Tibia and medial malleolus of tibia were marked for the indicator before the jumps. Videos, recorded at the same time with jump and synchronous with jumping values, were used for resolving knee and hip flexion degrees before jump with maximum height and they were assessed with indicators on computer surface on optojump software. Values recorded as degrees (º).</description>

    <description>In ST stage; medical purpose, hypoallergenic OctaCare® Rigid Transparent Plaster was applied as a rigid tape. This tape is also used under rigid tapes for protecting the skin. In this study investigators didn't prefer extra rigid tape on the plaster because that was very light and less sensitive material to our knowledge so it suited our aim of placebo control.</description>
