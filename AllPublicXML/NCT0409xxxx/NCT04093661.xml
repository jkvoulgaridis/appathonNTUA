    <description>The primary objective of this study performed according to an observational post-ad-hoc design measures the perioperative EEG overall power signature. Approximately 150 children admitted from 06/2017 to 06/2019 to the Charité will be enrolled in the study. They are followed up until their discharge from the recovery room.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Anesthetic depth</measure>
    <time_frame>06/2017 - 06/2019</time_frame>
    <description>Anesthetic stage is related to typical time points during an anesthetic procedure - as &quot;loss of consciousness&quot;, &quot;intubation&quot;, &quot;stable anesthesia&quot;, &quot;extubation&quot;, &quot;regain of consciousness&quot;. Approximately 150 children admitted from 06/2017 to 06/2019 to the Charite will be enrolled in the study. They are followed up until their discharge from the recovery room.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Medication</measure>
    <time_frame>06/2017 - 06/2019</time_frame>
    <description>Medication data are captured from the patient sheets. Approximately 150 children admitted from 06/2017 to 06/2019 to the Charite will be enrolled in the study. They are followed up until their discharge from the recovery room.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Emergence Delirium</measure>
    <time_frame>06/2017 - 06/2019</time_frame>
    <description>Delirium is captured form the PAED Score data in the patient records. Approximately 150 children admitted from 06/2017 to 06/2019 to the Charite will be enrolled in the study. They are followed up until their discharge from the recovery room.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of anesthesia</measure>
    <time_frame>06/2017 - 06/2019</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of anesthesia is captured from the patient records and measured until the end of surgery. Approximately 150 children admitted from 06/2017 to 06/2019 to the Charite will be enrolled in the study.</description>
