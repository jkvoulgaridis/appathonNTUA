  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this pilot study is to establish the feasibility and initial efficacy of the
      combination of phentermine and topiramate for adolescents and young adults who require
      additional risk reduction after bariatric surgery. This study will use a randomized,
      placebo-controlled, double-blinded design to evaluate an adjunctive 12-week intervention of
      phentermine + topiramate + standard of care vs. placebos + standard of care 6 months after
      bariatric surgery, among 12 to 24 year olds who don't achieve expected weight loss or who
      remain severely obese (n=10 total).

    <description>Validated questionnaire: Eating in the Absence of Hunger-Parent (EAH-P) completed by the parent/guardian about their adolescent/young adult. This measure has 14 items.
Each item is on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1= &quot;never&quot; to 5= &quot;always&quot;. A higher score indicates more eating in the absence of hunger.
Total and sub scales are calculated by taking the average of the items. Total score measures the overall construct &quot;Eating in the Absence of Hunger&quot; Subscales include: &quot;External Cues&quot; (4 items); &quot;Response to negative affect&quot; (6 items); &quot;Fatigue/Boredom&quot; (4 items).</description>

    <measure>Change in Cognitive Restraint, Disinhibited Eating, and Predisposition to Hunger</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The &quot;Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire&quot; will be completed by the adolescent/young adult. This is a 51-item measure that is divided into 2 parts, and assesses 3 eating behaviors: 1) Cognitive Dietary Restraint (20 items), 2) Disinhibited Eating (16 items), and 3) Predisposition to hunger (15 items). Higher scores in each domain indicate more of each of those behaviors.
The minimum score for factors 1, 2, and 3 are: 0, 0, and 0. The maximum score for factors 1, 2, and 3 are: 20, 16, and 15 Part I includes items 1-36 rated as either True (1) or False (0) Part II includes items 37-51 and is rated on a 4-point Likert-like scale with one exception- item 50 is rated on a 6-point scale.
Scores for each of the three eating behaviors are calculated by taking the average of the items, and are most commonly reported separately, not as a total score.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>PedsQL instrument will be completed by the adolescent/young adult. There are 4 scales: Physical Functioning (8 items), Emotional Functioning (5 items), Social Functioning (5 items), and School Functioning (5 items) and 3 Summary Scores: Total Scale Score (23 items), Physical Health Summary Score (8 items), and Psychosocial Health Summary Score (15 items).
Items are rated on a 0-4 scale. Items are reverse scored and linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale, such that 0=100, 1=75, 2=50, 3=25, and 4=0.
Higher scores indicated better health-related quality of life. Scale Scores are calculated as the sum of the items over the number of items answered.
Psychosocial Health Summary Score is calculated as the sum of the items over the number of items answered in the Emotional, Social, and School Functioning Scales.
Physical Health Summary Score is the same as the Physical Functioning Scale Score.</description>
