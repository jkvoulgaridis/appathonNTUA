        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient has clinically confirmed documented diagnosis of Beta Thalassemia Major,
             according to the current clinical criteria, and are on blood transfusions.

          2. Patient has been on a stable maintaince therapy with deferasirox for at least during
             last 3 months.

          3. Patients current chelation therapy is considered inadequate, meaning that there is
             evidence from clinical monitoring that chronic iron overload is present (e.g. serum
             ferritin &gt;1,000 µg/l), for at least during the last 3 months.

          4. The ferritin level has been stable with max 10% difference between max-to-low, and the
             iron chelator treatment dose has been unchanged during the last 3 months

          5. Patient is aged 18 years or older at screening.

          6. Female patients are only eligible for the study if they are either surgically sterile
             or at least 2 years postmenopausal, or have a negative result of serum hCG test at
             screening and if willing to use acceptable, effective methods of contraception during
             the trial and for three month after the end of trial participation as defined inpoint
             7.7. of this the protocol.

          7. Male patients must either be surgically sterile or he and his female spouse/partner
             who is of childbearing potential must be willing to use highly effective methods of
             contraception consisting of 2 forms of birth control (1 of which must be a barrier
             method) starting at screening and continuing throughout the study.

          8. Patient is fluent in the local language and provides written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Known history or presence of clinically significant other, hematologic, endocrine,
             oncologic, pulmonary, immunologic, genitourinary, psychiatric, or cardiovascular
             disease or any other condition which, in the opinion of the Investigator, would
             jeopardize the safety of the subject or impact the validity of the study results.

          2. Known or suspected allergy hypersensitivity or idiosyncratic reaction to NBMI or any
             other drug substances with similar activity.

          3. History of drug or alcohol addiction requiring treatment.

          4. History of malabsorption within the last year or presence of clinically significant
             gastrointestinal disease or surgery that may affect drug bioavailability, including
             but not limited to cholecystectomy.

          5. Presence of hepatic or renal dysfunction. (SGOT and SGPT and bilirubin &gt; X3 (3 fold)
             UNL. creatinine &gt; 1.5mg/dl).

          6. Female patient who is pregnant (serum hCG level consistent with pregnancy diagnosis);
             or breastfeeding.

          7. Participation in a clinical trial that involved administration of an investigational
             medicinal product within 90 days prior to drug administration, or recent participation
             in a clinical investigation that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would jeopardize
             subject safety or the integrity of the study results.

          8. Have clinically significant abnormal laboratory values (e.g. liver enzymes).

          9. Have clinically significant findings from a physical examination (e.g. fever).

         10. Patient has Inflammatory disorders, liver disease such as hepatitis, malignancy or
             other condition that could influence ferritine levels and therefore validity of study
             results.
