  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The specific aim is of this study is to gain a better understanding of the patient
      characteristics, treatment responses, survival outcomes, and adverse events associated with
      PRRT in patients with gastroenteropancreatic primary NETs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) make up a large range of malignancies that arise from
      neuroendocrine cells in multiple organs of the body. Hallet et al conducted a large
      population-based study that demonstrated that 21% of NET patients presented with metastatic
      disease and another 38% developed metastases after resection of the primary tumor (Hallet et
      al., 2015). This burden demonstrates the need for effective systemic therapy for advanced
      NETs. Options for systemic therapy include peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT).

      A need for more prospective series are needed on treatment responses and survival outcomes
      related to gastroenteropancreatic primary NETs treated with PRRT was identified. Thus the
      purpose of this study is to collect clinical data related to treatment of
      gastroenteropancreatic primary NETs s with PRRT. Clinical data related to patient
      characteristics, treatment responses and survival outcomes related to the treatment of
      gastroenteropancreatic primary NETs with PRRT and on adverse events and complications related
      to PRRT treatment will be collected.
