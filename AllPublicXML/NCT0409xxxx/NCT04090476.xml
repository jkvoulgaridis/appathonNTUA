      BIG for Life is a a Community-based Weekly Exercise Group for Individuals With Parkinson's
      Disease With a Focus on Improving Ability to Walk, Balance, and Perform Daily Activities With
      an Emphasis on &quot;Moving Big&quot;. The Purpose of This Pilot Study is to Investigate the Impact of
      a Weekly Exercise Group on Motor Function (i.e. Balance, Gait, Strength, Balance Confidence),
      Ability to Perform Activities of Daily Living, and Quality of Life Measures Such as Sleep and
      Depression in Individuals With Parkinson's Disease.

      We will test the hypotheses that participation in this exercise group may:

        1. improve mobility level and balance confidence

        2. improve performance of activities of daily living

        3. improve quality of life, sleep, or depression

      BIG FOR LIFE PILOT STUDY PROTOCOL

      Background Information

      Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition that affects cognitive
      and motor function, which negatively affects the quality of life of those afflicted with the
      disease. While proper medical management and medication can mitigate some symptoms through
      alteration of the underlying disease process, research has shown participation in an
      appropriate exercise program is critical to preserving cognitive and motor function.

      The Lee Silverman Voice Treatment (LSVT) was originally developed in 1987 to improve voice
      quality and volume in those with Parkinson's Disease. The program has expanded to include a
      movement program for physical and occupational therapy called LSVT Big. This program is
      performed following a set protocol of one-hour, individual treatment sessions, performed four
      consecutive days per week for four consecutive weeks. This program focuses on enhancement of
      movement quality to improve mobility and functional skills through use of daily exercises,
      functional skill training, and gait training. The LSVT Big program has been found to be an
      effective treatment for those individuals with Parkinson's Disease, showing improvements in
      balance, mobility, ability to perform dual task, postural control, and reduction in fall
      risk.1,2,3 There has been little research performed to date regarding the use of the
      components of this program to assist with maintenance of function for participants who have
      successfully completed the LSVT Big program. The BIG for LIFE program is a newly developed
      community-based exercise group for those with Parkinson's Disease who have completed the LSVT
      Big program.

      While the LSVT Big program is a well-established adjunct to standard medical and physical
      therapy protocols, with significant body of clinical research supporting its use. The BIG for
      LIFE program is built upon the foundation of LSVT Big protocol, and carries these principles
      into a community-based peer-group exercise program. However, as BIG for LIFE is newly
      introduced program, there is relatively little research evidence supporting its use as a
      continuation of the LSVT/Big protocol. This study seeks to build that evidence by evaluating
      the efficacy, safety and feasibility of BIG for LIFE to maintain motor and cognitive function
      following completion of LSVT/Big, and determine whether participation in a community-based
      peer-group exercise program will increase adherence to a home exercise program. Completing
      the proposed studies will provide needed evidence and will also provide information regarding
      continued use of the LSVT Big daily exercises upon discharging from skilled physical therapy.

      There is significant research supporting the use of a home and community exercise programs as
      key strategies to slow the progression of PD and facilitate adaptations to this degenerative
      disorder. The BIG for LIFE program is an extension of the LSVT Big program that carries
      forward the key principles of large amplitude movements, dynamic vocalization and adapts them
      to a community-based peer-group exercise program. As such, BIG for LIFE allows participants
      to continue to work with a physical therapist on movement and balance strategies in a less
      intensive program than LSVT/Big, and reinforces strategies to maintain and improve ability to
      perform activities of daily living. Furthermore, BIG for LIFE exercise sessions are held in a
      group setting that encourages peer interaction and feedback, which can be an important aspect
      of understanding and addressing the psychosocial adversity many individuals with PD
      experience. Our study will obtain objective measures of motor performance, participant
      self-assessments of balance, activities of daily living, quality of life, depression, sleep
      and anecdotal evidence of participant experience with this program. Completion of the
      proposed research will provide much needed evidence supporting the use of this program, which
      may translate to improving quality of life for persons with PD.

      Our proposed study will evaluate BIG for LIFE as a community exercise program, and will
      determine whether a weekly exercise session is adequate to maintain physical and cognitive
      function for a period of 8 weeks. It is reasonable that our proposed project could, in the
      future, be translated into a longitudinal, placebo-controlled trial evaluating whether BIG
      for LIFE is an effective intervention to favorably alter the degenerative progression of
      cognitive and motor function over a longer follow-up period.

      Specific Objectives

      The specific objective of this study is to investigate the impact of this weekly exercise
      group (BIG for LIFE) on motor functions (i.e. balance, gait, strength, balance confidence)
      and quality of life functions (sleep, depression, activities of daily living)

      We will test the following hypotheses:

        1. that participation in this community-based exercise group will improve mobility level
           and balance confidence

        2. that participation in this group will increase performance of activities of daily living

        3. that participation in this group will increase quality of life, sleep, or depression
           measures

      Study Design/Procedures

      We propose a single-site, observational pilot study. Study subjects will be recruited to
      participate in a weekly community-based Parkinson's exercise group. Prior to enrollment, we
      will obtain informed consent, and interview prospective candidates to determine eligibility:
      inclusion/exclusion criteria including medical history of PD and mobility level. If enrolled,
      study participants will complete a total of eight group exercise sessions. At the initial
      session, participants will undergo cognitive (Montreal Cognitive Assessment, MOCA 4),
      physical assessments (10 meter walk test, 6 minute walk test, 5 Times Sit to Stand, and the
      Mini Bestest 5) and routine baseline medical assessments (Appearance, Pulses, BP) and
      complete self-assessments regarding balance (Activities Balance Confidence Questionaire,
      ABC5) and quality of life (PDQ-396,PHQ-9, PDSS-27, functional tasks form); these assessments
      will be repeated at the final visit. During each of the visits the LSVT Big daily exercises
      will be performed along with functional tasks and gait/balance tasks. The functional tasks
      and gait/balance tasks will change weekly to monthly and all activities will be modified to
      the participant's mobility level. We will compare changes in assessment and questionaire
      scores before and after completion of the 8-week intervention, anticipating that participants
      will either improve or not experience significant degradation of cognitive, physical or motor
      function, as can be observed in PD patients after completion of LSVT BIG.

      This study's exercise group will be conducted by a two licensed Physical Therapists with
      certificates of specialization in Neurology and delivery of the LSVT Big program and student
      physical therapist, with career aspiration of specializing in neurologic physical therapy and
      and a specific interest in working with individuals with PD. As a collaborative research team
      the interest is in implementing and assessing community-based exercise programs for the PD
      population.

      Enrolled subjects will participate in a 8-week series of peer group exercise sessions. Each
      class will last one hour and will be facilitated by a physical therapist and physical therapy
      students. The location of the exercise sessions is at 604 Old Liverpool Rd, Liverpool, NY
      13088, site of the Rock Steady Boxing Gym. During each session, the daily exercises as part
      of the LSVT Big program will be performed and modified to the participant's ability level,
      along with performance of functional tasks stations (i.e. putting on a jacket, putting on a
      sock, etc.) which will rotate weekly to monthly, and gait tasks (i.e. forward, backwards,
      stepping over obstacles). Incidental health findings revealed during the medical assessment
      or throughout the duration of the study will be managed by referral back to the managing
      physician. (ie: depression, blood pressure concerns, etc). Health findings specifically
      related to depression as can be elicited with sensitive questions on the PHQ-9, will be
      tracked and referred back to the managing physician . If it is determined that the
      participant is a danger to themselves or others, emergency services will be contacted
      immediately.

      Completion of this pilot study will provide key validating data testing the feasibility and
      safety of the BIG for LIFE program as a community-based intervention. Furthermore, our
      proposed study will provide a firm foundation upon which we could expand and improve the
      longitudinal and examination of the efficacy of BIG for LIFE as a means to mitigate
      progressive decline in cognitive, physical and motor function, with the ultimate goal of
      preserving quality of life in patients with PD.

      Eligibility Criteria

      We aim to recruit 20 subjects to our study, using a rolling enrollment process in which new
      participants will join ongoing exercise groups of up to 30 participants. Participants will be
      recruited by contacting local neurologists, support groups and PD specific exercise groups
      and providing brochures and flyers with recruitment information. Interested candidates will
      be contacted by the study team, and provided specific information about the study and the
      informed consent process. Applicants will be mailed information about the study as well as
      forms indicating willingness to participate and informed consent. Once enrolled, the
      participants will be scheduled for their weekly peer-group exercise sessions. At the first
      session, the participants will undergo cognitive assessment (Montreal Cognitive Assessment4)
      and physical assessments(10 meter walk test, 6 minute walk test, 5 Times Sit to Stand, Mini
      Bestest5) and complete questionaires (Parkinson Disease Quality Life 396, Activities Specific
      Balance Questionaire5, Patient Health Questionnaire, Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale,7 and
      Functional Tasks Recording Form). Upon completion of the 8 week exercise program, assessments
      and questionaires will be repeated, and the participants will be interviewed to gain
      anectdotal insight into their experience with the program. Using the rolling enrollment
      strategy, we will be able to accumulate data to provide interim insight into the progress on
      our study objectives, and to assess whether the number of subjects estimated is appropriate
      to achieve statistical power to support or reject our hypotheses.

      Inclusion criteria: People with Parkinson's disease age 18 or over, male or female will be
      included.

      Exclusion criteria: Persons under the age of 18 and those without a diagnosis of Parkinson's
      disease will be excluded from the study. Individuals with PD who are bed bound or wheelchair
      bound will be excluded. Scores of &lt;23 on the MOCA will be excluded due to risk of cognitive
      impairments which may limit participation and ability to consent. Participants must be
      cleared for participation in the community exercise program by their physician.

      Statistical Methods/Data Analysis and Interpretation The aim of this study is to use
      quantitative analysis from scoring of self-assessments and physical assessments. Statistical
      methods and data analysis will be conducted by Upstate with support from the Center for
      Outcomes Research.

      All physical, cognitive, and self-assessments will be collected by licensed physical
      therapists specializing in neurology and physical therapy students with oversight of licensed
      physical therapists. Pre- and post- intervention assessments will be collected (10 meter walk
      test, 6-minute walk test, 5 Times Sit to Stand, Mini Bestest, ABC, PHQ-9, PDSS-2, Functional
      Task Recording Form, PDQ-395,6,7) to determine functional changes during the study period.
      Data will be analyzed using repeated-measures statistics as appropriate, and will be subject
      to intermittent evaluation to determine statistical power of our study design. We will also
      collect data regarding the safety (e.g. falling at home or in-session) and feasibility
      (attendance and home exercise adherence). As PD is a neurodegenerative condition it is
      anticipated that some individuals, particularly those with a history of rapid symptomatic
      progression, may experience a decline in motor function during their enrollment. Our proposed
      study will follow the magnitude and trajectory of functional decline in our participants,
      allowing us to draw association between initial performance, independent exercise and
      physical activity levels and participant attendance and engagement. Furthermore, a
      questionnaire at the completion of the protocol will be provided, allowing for subjective
      assessment of participant experience and potential refinement of the protocol.

      Schematic Diagram of Study Design

      Once enrolled, the participants will be scheduled for their weekly peer-group exercise
      sessions. At the first session, the participants will undergo cognitive assessment (Montreal
      Cognitive Assement4 MOCA) and physical assessments(10 meter walk test, 6 minute walk test, 5
      Times Sit to Stand, Mini Bestest5) and complete questionaires (Parkinson Disese Quality Life6
      PDQ-39, Activities Specific Balance Questionaire5 ABC, Patient Heath Questionnaire PHQ-9,
      Parkinsons Disease Sleep Scale PDSS-27, and Functional Tasks Recording Form FT). Upon
      completion of the 8 week exercise program, assessments and questionaires will be repeated,
      and the participants will be interviewed to gain anectdotal insight into their experience
      with the program.
