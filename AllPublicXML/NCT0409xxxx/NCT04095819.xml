  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Subdural Hematoma (cSDH) is a common hematologic problem particularly in older
      patients. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of middle
      meningeal artery (MMA) embolization compared to traditional surgical strategies for patients
      presenting with chronic subdural hematoma (cSDH). Although MMA embolization is
      minimally-invasive procedure that is routinely used for the treatment of tumors or vascular
      formations (1), this study investigates the use of an established procedure for a new disease
      state.

    <textblock>
      The purpose of the research study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a new,
      less-invasive procedure to treat chronic subdural hematoma (cSDH). A subdural hematoma occurs
      when blood collects on the brain's surface beneath the skull. Subdural hematomas can be
      life-threatening. They usually result from a head injury. This study will compare the new
      procedure to conventional surgical treatment of chronic subdural hematoma (cSDH). The new
      procedure is called middle meningeal artery embolization (MMA).

      Current or conventional treatment of chronic subdural hematoma (cSDH) involves surgery (burr
      hole drainage and craniotomy) to access and remove the cause of the bleeding that is causing
      the subdural hematoma.

      The new procedure, MMA embolization, involves guiding a catheter that is inserted into a
      blood vessel to the area of the brain that is supplying blood to the subdural hematoma.
      Particles or a special type of glue will be released to stop the bleeding that is causing the
      subdural hematoma. This technique has been used to treat other brain conditions, for example,
      (to treat tumors or malformation of blood vessels).
