    <textblock>
      This study is to assess the usability and acceptability of a digital food consumption diary
      as part of the perioperative management of gastrointestinal oncology patients and to evaluate
      the impact of a digital food diary on adherence to dietician-recommended plan and on quality
      recovery, using a commercially available smart phone application.

    <measure>Usability of Smart Phone Application</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Usability of smart phone application will be captured by (1) number of days that entries have been made by the study participants and recorded as a percentage of the total number of days after discharge from the hospital (obtained from mobile application (2) number of meals recorded in the application per day (obtained from mobile application) and (3) Exit Questionnaire (6 questions of 12). The Exit Questionnaire includes a mixture of 5-point Likert-scale, yes or no, and open-ended items to assess usability. Questions on the 5 point scale use 1 as an indication of difficulty in using application and 5 would be ease of use.</description>

    <measure>Acceptability of Smart Phone Application</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patient's acceptability of the mobile application to assist with postoperative nutrition goals will be captured by the Exit Questionnaire (6 questions of 12). The Exit Questionnaire includes a mixture of 5-point Likert-scale, yes or no, and open-ended items to assess acceptability. Questions on the 5 point scale use 1 as an indication of acceptability issues of the application and 5 would be acceptability.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adherence to Recommended Nutritional Plan</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Adherence to the participant's recommended nutritional plan will be calculated by participant's energy (caloric) intake over time, as recorded in the digital food diary, and compared to estimates of the optimum energy needs established by the dietician. Adherence will be reported as a percentage of estimated energy requirements.</description>
