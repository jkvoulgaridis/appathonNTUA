  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will measure the effect of a novel pharmacy practice model on pediatric patients
      with hypertension. In North Louisiana, many patients have to travel to see subspecialists for
      treatment for hypertension and elevated blood pressure, which has many costs including direct
      medical costs, direct nonmedical costs, and indirect costs like missed time from work,
      school, or social obligations. Also, many patients who have to travel to get to their
      appointments have a high rate of missed appointments, which can be bad for overall health.

      This study will use a pharmacist to perform collaborative drug therapy management with
      pediatric cardiologists to manage therapy for patients with hypertension or elevated blood
      pressure. Patients will monitor blood pressure at home and follow up with the pharmacist by
      telecommunications. Pharmacist drug therapy management and telemedicine have been studied
      separately, but this is the first study with pharmacist drug therapy management by
      telemedicine for pediatric patients. If this model is successful, it could be replicated in
      other rural areas to improve patient care and reduce healthcare costs.

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of elevated blood pressure or hypertension.

          -  Physician decision to treat with drug therapy or lifestyle modifications and physician
             referral to pharmacist.

          -  Consent both to therapy with pharmacist and participation in study (Note: in the state
             of Louisiana, patients must provide consent to be treated in a collaborative drug
             therapy management program).

          -  For patients younger than 18, informed assent and parental permission to participate
             in the study. For patients who turn 18 during the study, informed consent will be
             obtained on the first visit after they turn 18.

             during the control period.

          -  A waiver of consent has been obtained for historical data.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Physical preclusion to taking blood pressure, such as lack of limbs or any congenital
             or acquired anatomical defect preventing routine measurement of blood pressure

          -  Participation in another treatment or intervention study for hypertension during the
             study period

          -  Inability to speak English
