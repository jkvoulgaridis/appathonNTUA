    <textblock>
      Based on the EHP-30 questionnaire, the pain score and general well-being of all patients will
      be assessed with and without taking a specialized nutraceutical. These patients will be
      taking continuous oral contraception, for 3 months before inclusion till at least end of the
      study or not taking any oral contraception at all during the study due to
      contraindication(s).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain relief</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>pain relief monitored via the Assessment of Pelvic Pain (Visual Analogue scale, VAS) in the Endometriosis Health Profile 30 questions (EHP-30) at baseline and after 3 months of study product intake. The mean of all 3 VAS scales is taken to monitor the evolution of the pain of the subjects. Scores can be given from 0 to 10 with 0 as no pain and 10 as unbearable pain.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Inflammation marker C-reactive protein (CRP)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>CRP will be measured at baseline and after 3 months of study product intake. High CRP values (&gt;3mg/L) indicate inflammation while low CRP values (&lt;1 mg/L) indicate no inflammation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>General well-being</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The general well-being will be monitored via the Endometriosis Health Profile questionnaire with 30 questions (EHP-30) at baseline and after 3 months of product intake. These scales are transformed into a score from 0 to 100, in which 0 indicates a better health status, while 100 indicates a worse quality of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The need for analgesics</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The need for analgesics while taking the study product will be monitored via an analgesic diary completed every time the subject takes pain medication. Over 3 months, the total need for analgesics per month will be counted and compared inbetween both groups.</description>
