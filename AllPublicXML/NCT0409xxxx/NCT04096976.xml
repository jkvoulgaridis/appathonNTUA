    <textblock>
      Near-Hanging is a catastrophic event that has been merely studied in the literature. We aimed
      to report the outcomes, and early predictors of hospital survivors in critically ill patients
      with near-hanging.

      Patients admitted to 31 university or university-affiliated participating ICUs in France and
      Belgium between 1992 and 2014 were studied retrospectively. Hospital survival was the main
      judgment criterion.

        All eligible cases extracted from the participation ICUs hospital registries were included
        in the present study if they were older than 18 years, with in- or out-of-hospital
        near-hanging self-arm, and if they required ICU management.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  any of the following code corresponding in the International Statistical
             Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision: Intentional
             self-harm by hanging, strangulation and suffocation (X70). Local investigators
             reviewed the medical records of the patients thus identified to select adults admitted
             to the ICU after successfully resuscitated near-hanging injury.

          -  older than 18 years

          -  requiring ICU management
