  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the increasing average of life span, age-related neurodegenerative disorders such as
      Dementia is a major health concern in nowadays society. However, strategies for long-term
      management of Dementia symptoms/manifestations need to be optimized. Physical exercise is a
      widely recommended intervention for most disease conditions, known to promote not only
      physical but also mental health. In the context of Dementia, the outcomes of exercise
      interventions are unclear. Therefore, the relevance of this research topic relies on the need
      to integrate the current knowledge about the protective effect of exercise, as a potential
      therapeutic intervention to Dementia management. The investigators hope to add information to
      alert institutions, experts and caregivers about the feasibility and benefits of exercise,
      involving different physical and cognitive components, as a co-adjuvant non-pharmacological
      tool for Dementia older adults

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With global aging, there is an increase in the prevalence of pathologies, such as Dementia.
      Thus, countries and organizations have been developing strategies to mitigate this public
      health problem. In addition to the positive and well-established relationship between
      physical exercise (PE) and physical health and more studies have focused on the possible
      benefits in mental health. PE rises aerobic fitness by increasing brain flow and perfusion,
      with possible impact on brain structure and cognition in older adults with dementia. Among
      others, PE seems to: 1)promote increased levels of different growth factors with impact on
      the neural and cognitive structure and function, 2)attenuate the pro-inflammatory state, with
      repercussions on muscle mass and functionality, 3)decrease the risk of falls, fractures and
      preserve the autonomy.

      Moreover, PE seems to have the potential to oppose to some manifestations of Dementia.
      However, there are no recommendations for PE in older adults with Dementia, regarding the
      type of exercise, duration, intensity and according to the stage of disease or environmental
      setting. Studies have demonstrated that multicomponent training (MT), integrating several
      physical abilities important for performance in activities of daily living and involving
      group activities with a social and playful character and cognitive stimulation, is presented
      as an effective means to improve the physical and cognitive function in institutionalized and
      community-dwelling older adults. Thus, considering its wide application and feasibility, it
      is pertinent to evaluate how this type of PE can be an alternative low-cost therapeutic to
      preserve cognitive function, functionality and thus postpone the probable
      institutionalization. This study aims to evaluate the effect of an MT intervention on
      cognitive function, neurotrophic, inflammatory and oxidative factors, physical fitness, body
      composition and bone mineral density (BMD) in elderly with Dementia. The sample will
      integrate older adults with Dementia, allocated into training group (TG) and control group
      (CG). The TG will be submitted to a 10-month bi-weekly MT intervention. The following
      evaluations will be performed before, after 10 months of training and after 3 months of
      detraining: 1) Cognitive Function, 2) Physical Fitness, 3) Blood Pressure and arterial
      stiffness, 4) Cardiovascular risk, inflammatory and neurotrophic markers 5) BMD and 6)
      Functional capacity 7) Quality of Life 8) Caregivers quality of life 9) Dietary and
      hydration. Based on the results obtained, the investigators hope to add information about the
      beneficial contribution of MT to raise awareness to institutions, specialists and both formal
      and informal caregivers to the importance, feasibility, and adherence of this practice in the
      older adults with Dementia. The investigators believe that the knowledge and experience
      available in the research team is a guarantee of the feasibility and success of the project.

    <description>The trail-making test is a neuropsychological test of visual attention and task switching. The task requires a subject to 'connect-the-dots' of 25 consecutive targets on a sheet of paper. Two versions are available: A, in which the targets are all numbers (1,2,3, etc.), and B, in which the subject alternates between numbers and letters (1, A, 2, B, etc.). The goal of the subject is to finish the test as quickly as possible, and the time taken to complete the test is used as the primary performance metric.</description>

If &quot;yes&quot;, then the caregiver rates the severity of the symptom on a 3-point scale and caregiver distress in a 5-point scale. The NPI provides a total severity score ranged 0-36 with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms.</description>
