      This multicenter, prospective, open-labeled 2-arm, randomized non-comparative phase II trial.
      This phase II trial is based on a 2-stage Simon's optimal design. Randomization 1:1 with 1
      patient randomized in experimental arm A (association of nivolumab plus relatlimab) and 1
      patient randomized in arm B (treatment by nivolumab alone).
