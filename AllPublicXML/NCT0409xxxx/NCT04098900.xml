    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-center study with a minimum of three CLIA-waived intended operator
      sites in the United States in which prospectively self-collected vaginal specimens obtained
      from subjects who are symptomatic or asymptomatic for CT, NG, or TV will be evaluated with
      the Click Sexual Health Test in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) waived
      setting. Subjects interested in participating in this study will be assessed for eligibility
      and asked to give informed consent and assent, if applicable, by the Investigational Review
      Board (IRB). Only those subjects who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria may be
      enrolled in the study.

    <description>Questions are around three domains of interest: i) instructions, ii) operations, and iii) visual interpretation for the Click device for detection of CT, NG, and TV with patient self-collected specimens.
The 5-point Likert scale will measure responses to questions in the form of: (1) Strongly Disagree, (2) Disagree, (3) Neutral, (4) Agree, and (5) Strongly Agree</description>
