  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, an increasing number of retrospective and prospective observational studies
      have indicated that a subset of rectal cancer patients may avoid surgery if they can achieve
      a complete response to chemoradiotherapy. Prospective trials, including the previous Danish
      Watchful Waiting trials (NCT00952926, NCT02438839) in early rectal cancer have demonstrated
      high levels of organ preservation with dose-escalation, but it is unclear whether this was
      primarily due to tumor stage or dose level.

      The aim of the present study is to investigate if a higher dose of radiotherapy is superior
      compared to a standard dose in patients with early rectal cancer undergoing chemoradiotherapy
      with curative intent.

    <textblock>
      The main curative treatment modality for rectal cancer is surgery, potentially combined with
      chemotherapy and radiotherapy to lower the risk of local recurrence. In recent years, an
      increasing number of retrospective and prospective observational studies have indicated that
      a subset of patients may avoid surgery altogether if they can achieve a complete response to
      chemoradiotherapy. These studies have mainly focused on locally advanced tumors with a high
      risk of local recurrence. Smaller, less advanced tumors appear to respond better to
      chemoradiotherapy, but the optimal treatment for non-surgical management has not been
      established. Prospective trials, including the previous Danish Watchful Waiting trials
      (NCT00952926, NCT02438839) in early rectal cancer have demonstrated high levels of organ
      preservation with dose-escalation, but it is unclear whether this was primarily due to tumor
      stage or dose level. High-level evidence is currently absent for the question of radiotherapy
      dose, especially in early stage cancers.

      The aim of the present study is to investigate if a higher dose of radiotherapy is superior
      compared to a standard dose in patients with early rectal cancer undergoing chemoradiotherapy
      with curative intent.

    <description>QLQ is a 30-question assessment of quality of life. Twenty-eight questions are assessed on a scale of 1 (Not at all) to 4 (Very much); 2 questions are assessed on a scale of 1 (very poor) to 7 (excellent). Score range 0- 100. In the function scales, score 100 is best (more function). In the symptom scales, score 100 is worst, (more symptoms). The colorectal cancer module QLQ-CR29 should always be complemented by QLQ-C30. It contains four functional scales and 18 symptom scales. Some scales are dependent on gender and some are for patients with or without a stoma. There are 19 individual items assessed on a scale of 1 (Not at all) to 4 (Very much). Scores are totaled from each item to form the scales, and then normalized to 0-100.</description>
