      This cluster-randomized school-based study will examine the effectiveness of a teen dating
      violence (TDV) and sexual violence (SV) prevention program called Expect Respect for
      preventing serious violence perpetration among middle school students.

      This cluster-randomized controlled school-based study will examine the effectiveness of a
      support group-based teen dating violence (TDV) and sexual violence (SV) prevention program on
      the primary prevention of serious (and potentially lethal) violence perpetration among middle
      school students (both male and female-identified) who have prior exposure to trauma and
      violence. Expect Respect gender-specific support groups are for youth with prior history of
      exposure to violence including witnessing domestic violence, loss of loved one to homicide,
      TDV, and SV.

      Expect Respect is a theory and research-informed program intended to alter norms condoning
      violence and rigid gender expectations that foster violence perpetration, promote bystander
      intervention, and reduce TDV/SV perpetration. Implemented by trained facilitators, the
      24-session curriculum focuses on gender equity and respect, recognizing abuse and impact on
      self and others, regulating emotions, skills for healthy relationships, and becoming active
      proponents of safe and healthy relationships.

    <intervention_model_description>This cluster-randomized school-based study will examine the effectiveness of a support group-based teen dating violence (TDV) and sexual violence (SV) prevention program on the primary prevention of serious (and potentially lethal) violence perpetration among middle school students (both male and female-identified) already exposed to violence. The study will be located in western Pennsylvania across 36 middle schools (anticipated number of 'clusters'), randomized either to receive the &quot;Expect Respect&quot; program (i.e., intervention schools, n=18) or to an enhanced usual care condition (n=18 schools).</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Experimental: Expect Respect Support Group Expect Respect is a program intended to create safe, trauma-informed space for young people who have been exposed to violence, to promote positive bystander intervention and healthy relationship skills, to alter norms that foster TDV/SV perpetration, and reduce violence perpetration through weekly support groups with students at elevated risk for such perpetration. Youth with prior history of exposure to violence are invited to in-school gender specific support groups that take place over 24 in-classroom sessions.
Expect Respect addresses violence perpetration prevention with youth already exposed to violence by recognizing violence as a problem that is fueled by gender norms that promote dominance and challenging the need to control and exert power in relationships especially with the use of violence, while simultaneously strengthening emotion regulation, social skills, and connectedness.</description>
