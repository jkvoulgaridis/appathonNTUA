  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Interventional strategies aim to restore tissue perfusion. However, despite the simple
      reopening of a narrowed artery they affect endothelial function, perpetuating dysfunctional
      vascular homeostasis. PTA and atherectomy might alter the endothelial function but the
      mechanisms are incompletely understood. The primary goal of atherectomy is vessel preparation
      and improving compliance, which could aid in preserving vessel functions. Aim of this study
      is to determine safety, efficacy, patency and vessel functions in the femoropopliteal artery
      following atherectomy and DCB.
