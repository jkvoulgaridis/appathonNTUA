      Recently, epidemiological studies had shown an increase in hip fractures with aging of the
      population. Osteoporosis had been defined by a mean of -2.5 SD upon DEXA scan, which is not a
      practical tool to use in patients with recent hip fractures until management of such
      fractures either with fixation or replacement. Also it have been found that assessment of
      osteoporosis using the Singh index is not a reliable method for osteoporosis diagnosis .

      Osteoporosis may affect the decision making for dealing with per-trochanteric fractures as
      some surgeons prefer to do hip replacement for fear of fixation failure, while others still
      convinced that fixation with good reduction and appropriate placement of lag screw within a
      TAD less than 25mm is the best even with unstable types specially after the progress in
      proximal femoral nails .

      CT scan can be used for osteoporosis measurement. Even it can detect stress fractures that
      are not diagnosed using DEXA scan. It can be used to assess BMD in specific regions like
      spine or hip in a quantitative manner that can be compared to the T score used with DEXA scan
      . Again It can assess the presence of comminution in the anterior and posterior cortices that
      might not be easy with x-rays. The thickness of the lateral wall can be better measured
      through CT scan which is a critical measure while deciding to fix trochanteric fractures
      using whether DHS or PFN .

      The purpose of this prospective clinical cohort study is to assess the sensitivity of CT scan
      for localized osteoporosis detection that can be used in patients with hip fracture and
      detection of comminution and thin trochanteric lateral wall that might not be accessible with
      x-rays. And whether these independent factors could predict the fixation failure iagnosed

    <description>Quantitative CT scan to measure localized osteoporosis and detection of cortices comminution.
Blinded surgeon decision as regard to replace or to fix using DHS or PFN (depending on x-rays data only).
Pathological assessment of osteoporosis in retrieved bone in patients whom hip replacement was decided.
Assessment of fixation failure in fixed fractures if occurred.
Fixation failure is defined as:
5.1. Lag cut through 5.2. Lag cutout 5.3. Z-effect (lag penetration) 5.4. Non-union (within 6 months) 5.5. Loss of reduction with progressive varus deformity 5.6. Femoral fracture 5.7. Intra-operative fracture of lateral wall or anterior cortex</description>
