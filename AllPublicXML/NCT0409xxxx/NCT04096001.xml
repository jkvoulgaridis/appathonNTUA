  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption (AUDIT-C)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Post-treatment at 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The AUDIT-C is a widely used 3-item self-report screen for hazardous or harmful alcohol consumption that is based off of the 10-item original AUDIT.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The Drug Abuse Screening Test 10 (DAST-10)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Post-treatment at 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The DAST-10 is a brief, 10-item self-report assesses consequences related to drug abuse, excluding alcohol and tobacco.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8)</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-treatment at 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The CSQ-8 is an 8-item self-report scale measuring satisfaction with treatment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Usage Rating Profile Intervention Acceptability Subscale (URPI-usability subscale)</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-treatment at 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>URPI-Acceptability Subscale is 6-item subscale from the URP Intervention Revised (URP-IR) scale. The URPI-Acceptability inquires about intervention acceptability. Responses range from 1= &quot;slightly disagree&quot; to 6=&quot;strongly agree&quot;. Scores are averages, with greater scores indicating greater intervention acceptability.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Usage Rating Profile Intervention Feasibility Subscale (URPI-feasibility subscale)</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-treatment at 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>URPI-Feasibility Subscale is 6-item subscale from the URP Intervention Revised (URP-IR) scale. The URPI-Feasibility inquires about factors that impact treatment usage (i.e., intervention quality). Responses range from 1= &quot;slightly disagree&quot; to 6=&quot;strongly agree&quot;. Scores are averages, with greater scores indicating greater intervention feasibility.</description>

    <intervention_name>Woebot-SUDs (W-SUDs)</intervention_name>
    <description>Woebot-SUDs (W-SUDS), an artificially intelligence-powered conversational agent on a smartphone app, eliminates most current SUDs treatment barriers while simultaneously leveraging technology to enhance user experience and engagement. W-SUDs expands and refines existing SUDs treatments by adapting skills from cognitive behavioral therapy, motivational interviewing, and dialectical behavior therapy.</description>
