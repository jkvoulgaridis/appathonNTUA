      The study Patients Commitment to compression therapy (POMP) is observational, prospective.
      After the Phlebologist consultation after 1 month and 1 year, a telephone questionnaire is
      carried out for the patients included in the study with the involvement of a company
      specializing in conducting a telephone questionnaire. Patients will be interviewed about the
      implementation of the doctor's recommendations regarding compression therapy over a period 1
      month and 1 year.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phlebologists will include in the study patients who have consulted and need compression
      therapy using a compression hosiery. Patients are recommended compression hosiery that meet
      RAL-GZ 387, Oeko-Tex Standart 100. At the same time, the design of this study does not
      provide for restrictions on the acquisition by patients of other type compression hosiery.

      Inclusion of patients in the study is carried out only after obtaining written informed
      consent from them for data registration and subsequent telephone questionnaires. Demographic,
      anamnestic, sociological data, such as educational level, labor characteristics (heavy
      physical labor, prolonged orthostasis, prolonged sitting position) recorde in the patient's
      individual card. Women provide information on the number of births, menopause, use of hormone
      replacement therapy at the time of the study. A diagnosis performed for each lower limb
      according to only the clinical part of the CEAP classification without other details. The
      phlebologist individually for each patient determines the mode of wearing compression
      hosiery. In addition to compression therapy, it is possible to prescribe any other type of
      drug and / or surgical treatment. In the subsequent analysis, data on the lower limb with
      more severe manifestations of venous insufficiency are used.
