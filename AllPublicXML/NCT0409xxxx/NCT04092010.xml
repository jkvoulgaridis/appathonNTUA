  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a community-based efficacy trial (n=388) of a stepped-care model
      intervention to strengthen the capacity of Head Start to address parental depression and
      related adversities. Head Start mothers with symptoms of depressed mood or anhedonia, and
      their Head Start children, are enrolled across 12 Head Start centers.

      The research study aims to improve developmental outcomes for Head Start children by
      delivering stepped care intervention that incorporates depression prevention and linkage to
      formal mental health care to mothers. Mothers with low baseline depressive symptoms are
      offered a problem-solving intervention while mothers with greater symptoms are offered
      engagement sessions to link them to formal mental health services. At each problem solving
      session participant's symptoms are assessed and if the symptoms meet pre-specified 'step-up'
      criteria, they are converted to Engagement sessions.

      Over 12-months, the intervention's effect will be assessed on a series of outcome measures
      for mothers; mechanisms by which maternal depression is theorized to impact young children;
      and child outcomes.

    <description>The Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms (QIDS) will be used to assess the incidence of moderate to severe depressive symptom episodes, as defined by a QIDS score ≥ 11. The QIDS is a 16 item self-administered instrument with potential responses for each item of 0 to 3. Higher scores are associated with greater depressive symptoms.</description>
