  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intimate partner violence (IPV) disproportionately affects immigrant women. However,
      immigrant women remain an understudied and underserved population in need for evidence-based
      rigorously evaluated culturally competent interventions that address the health and safety
      needs of immigrant women. This study uses a sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trial
      (SMART) design to rigorously evaluate an adaptive culturally informed intervention tailored
      to needs of immigrant women with IPV experiences. For the first stage randomization,
      participants will be randomly assigned to an online intervention or the usual care control
      arm and safety, mental health and empowerment outcomes will be assessed at 3, 6 and 12 months
      follow up. For the second stage randomization, women who do not report significant
      improvement in safety (i.e., reduction in IPV) and in empowerment from baseline to follow up
      points (i.e., non-responders) will be re- randomized to the augmented intervention components
      (text only or a combination of text and phone) developed in the formative phase. Data on
      outcomes (safety and empowerment) will be assessed at 6 and 12 months of re- randomization.
      By re-randomizing participants, the study will assess the relative effectiveness of two
      strategies for augmentation (text only or a combination of text and phone) on safety and
      empowerment outcomes among the non-responders of the online intervention. In addition, the
      study will compare the non-responder group of women to the responder group of the online
      intervention to determine if the strategies of augmentation brought the non-responders to the
      level of responders on safety and empowerment. Finally, the study will identify facilitators
      and barriers to the adoption, implementation and maintenance of use of the original and
      augmented intervention by programs serving immigrant women and design strategies to decrease
      barriers and build on strengths.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in severity of physical violence as assessed by the revised Conflict Tactics Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The adapted version of the Revised Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS2; Straus 1996) is used to measure severity and frequency of the abusive or violent acts in intimate partner relationships. The CTS2 subscales include physical aggression, injury, psychological aggression and sexual coercion. Response categories range from 0=never to 6= more than 20 times within the past 12 months; 7 = not in referent period but happened before. Higher values on the measure within the past 12 months indicate severe or more frequent experiences of violence. The CTS-2 items are scored using the severity-times-frequency weighted score, as recommended by Straus.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in depressive symptoms as assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) is a 9 item measure to assess past two weeks depression symptoms based on the diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV). Each of the 9 items score from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day). A total score is computed to measure severity of depression by summing the items. Higher scores indicate more severe depression symptoms (1-4=minimal depression, 5-9=mild depression, 10-14=moderate depression, 15-19=moderately severe depression, and 20-27= severe depression).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as assessed by the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (16 items) is used to measure symptoms of PTSD derived from the DSM-IIR/DSM-IV criteria for PTSD, with scores ranging from 1 to 4. The items represent intrusion/re-experiencing, avoidance/numbing and hypervigilance/arousal symptom clusters. The scale for each question includes four categories of response: &quot;1=Not at all,&quot; &quot;2=A little,&quot; &quot;3=quite a bit,&quot; &quot;4=extremely,&quot; rated 1 to 4. A total score is obtained using the mean of responses to the items. Higher scores indicate more severe PTSD symptoms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in overall empowerment as assessed by the Personal Progress Scale-Revised</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Personal Progress Scale-Revised (PPS-R; Johnson et al., 2005) is a 28 item self-report measure of empowerment designed to assess multiple areas associated with empowerment such as positive self-evaluation, self-esteem, ability to regulate emotional distress, gender-role and cultural identity awareness, self-efficacy, self-care, problem-solving, assertiveness skills, and access to resources. Participants' responses are rated on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (Almost Never) to 7 (Almost Always). The items are summed to create a total score for empowerment. The range of scores is 28-196 with higher scores indicating a greater degree of empowerment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in empowerment related to safety as assessed by the Measure of Victim Empowerment Related to Safety (MOVERS) scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The MOVERS is a 13 item scale that measures empowerment within the domain of safety (e.g., extent to which a participant has developed a set of safety-related goals and a belief in her ability to accomplish them, the extent to which she feels that her efforts to achieve safety trigger new difficulties and extent to which she has knowledge about and access to support). Participants respond to each item using a five-point scale from &quot;1=never true&quot; to &quot;5=always true&quot;. The scores on the measure are summed and averaged to produce a total score. The scores range from 13 to 65 with higher scores indicating a greater degree of empowerment related to safety.</description>

    <description>For second stage randomization, the text messaging intervention will follow-up with non-responder group of immigrant women (those who did not improve in intervention or control arms above) on their enactment of tailored (tailored to the DA Score and priorities) safety plan provided in the online weWomen intervention or non-tailored (standard list of resources) safety recommendations provided in the usual care control arm</description>

    <description>Second stage randomization will involve both text (described above) and phone calls for non-responder group of women in intervention or control arm. The phone calls will draw from motivational interviewing adapted for abused women, solution focused therapy and a strengths perspective to discuss women's safety concerns and other needs, and strategies to strengthen social support networks</description>
