      OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the presence of risk factors associated with the use / prescription of
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) in patients diagnosed with osteoarthritis (OA).

      MATERIALS AND METHODS: A multicentric, cross-sectional epidemiological study, will be carried
      out in patients ≥ 38 years of age, with a previous diagnosis of primary or secondary OA,
      according to criteria of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR). The presence of at least
      one risk factor for the use / prescription of NSAIDs is the main variable. The secondary
      variables to be evaluated include: Demographical characterization of the patients, current
      disease status (level of pain and functional limitation), treatment (s) used (related or not
      to OA) and events side effects associated with the treatment (s). The analysis will be
      carried out from two perspectives: A first descriptive approach and a second analytical
      approach.
