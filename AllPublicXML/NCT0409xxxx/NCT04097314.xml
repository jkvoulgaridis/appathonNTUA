  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Microvascular angina (MVA) is caused by abnormalities of the small vessels in the heart.
      Endothelin is a small chemical that circulates and accumulates in the blood vessel walls,
      causing them to narrow or go into spasm and thicken in the longer term especially as levels
      of endothelin increase. As a result, patients experience pain, psychological burden and an
      inability to carry out daily activities.

      Originally developed by AstraZeneca for cancer treatment, prior research has confirmed that
      Zibotentan relaxes the small blood vessels of patients with MVA which lends support to the
      idea that Zibotentan may bring some benefits to patients with MVA. This trial therefore
      proposes to look into re-purposing zibotentan as a new treatment for patients with MVA. The
      primary objective is to assess the effect of add-on treatment with Zibotentan to treadmill
      exercise times in adult patients with MVA and impaired exercise intolerance. Zibotentan could
      provide a new treatment pathway for patients, as well as be made available to the NHS at
      substantially lower cost than the currently used medications.

      The trial aims to initially invite approx. 356 participants for genetic testing. A minimum of
      100 participants will go forward into the main study, receiving either 10mg zibotentan or a
      dummy matched tablet (placebo) daily over two 12 weeks periods of each, completing their
      final visit at week 34. The study assessments will involve a health check at each visit,
      including information on the patient's wellbeing, blood tests, some quality of life
      questionnaires, and an exercise test. Participants will also have the option to consent to
      additional sub-study cardiovascular MRI scanning. Finally, participants will be invited to
      provide consent for long-term follow-up (maximum 20 years) of their electronic medical
      records (no additional patient contact).
