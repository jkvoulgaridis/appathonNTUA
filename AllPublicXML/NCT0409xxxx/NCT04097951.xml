          2. Those who weigh more than 50 kg and whose calculated BMI is within the 18.0-29.0 kg/m2
             range BMI = (weight [kg])/(key [m])2

          3. A person who is judged to be suitable for a test through physical examination and
             examination according to this test plan. That is, a person who has no congenital or

          4. A person who is judged to be suitable for a test in accordance with this test plan (if
             the results of a clinical laboratory test are within or outside the reference value of
             the hospital affiliated with Inha University Medical Center, the tester determines
             that there is no clinical significance)

          5. After hearing the detailed description of this clinical trial and fully understanding
             it, the person who agrees in writing to decide his/her participation and to comply
             with the precautions

        Exclusion Criteria:

             system, endocrine, blood and tumor, mental illness, and urinary tract

          2. Persons with gastrointestinal relationship diseases (such as gastrointestinal ulcers,
             gastritis, gastrointestinal tract diseases, Crohn's disease, etc.) that may affect the
             absorption of clinical trial medications, and persons with past history of
             gastrointestinal relationship surgery (except for simple appendectomy or hernia
             surgery)

          3. Those with genetic problems such as galactose intolerance, Lapp lactase deficient or
             glucose-galactose malabsorption

          4. A person with a history of hypersensitivity or clinically significant hypersensitivity
             to a drug or other drug (aspirin, antibiotics, etc.) that contains the components of
             Montelukast and the components of Bepotastine or the same family.

          5. A person who showed a clinically significant low blood pressure (hydraulic &lt; 90mmHg)
             or high blood pressure (hydraulic ≥ 150mmHg or dilatant blood pressure ≥ 95mmHg)
             during the screening test

          6. One of the following results is displayed in a screening test:

               -  AST or ALT &gt; Double the normal range limit

               -  Total bilirubin &gt; 2.0 mg/dL

             alcohol) or who cannot abstain from drinking during clinical trials

          8. Those who smoke continuously (more than 10 days) or who cannot quit smoking during the
             clinical trial period.

          9. Those who participated in other clinical or biological equivalence tests within six
             months prior to the date of the first medication (the last day of the medication for
             clinical or biological equivalence tests)

         10. A person who donated all blood within 60 days prior to the date of the first
             medication, or who donated the ingredients within 30 days, or who received the blood
             within 30 days.

         11. Those who have taken any prescription or herbal medicine within 14 days prior to the
             date of the first dose or who have taken any general medication (OTC) within 7 days

             according to the judgment of the tester.)

         12. A person who has taken a medication that induces and inhibits the drug metabolic
             enzyme, such as barbital drugs, within one month before the start of the test

             *Medically accepted contraceptives: intrauterine devices, vascular surgery, intubation
             and block contraception (male condoms, female condoms, cervical caps, contraceptives,
