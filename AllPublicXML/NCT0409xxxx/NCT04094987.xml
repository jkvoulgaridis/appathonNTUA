  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Quadratus Lumborum block (QLB) is a recently described regional block. The block has been
      shown to be the result of abdominal analgesia as a result of administration between the
      quadratus lumborum (QL) muscle and the medial leaf in the thoracolumbar fascia. In this
      block, local anesthetic drugs are made between the quadratus lumborum (QL) muscle and the
      medial leaf in the thoracolumbar fascia. By this means, it has been reported to have provided
      a good analgesia since it relieved the somatic pain better in upper and lower abdominal
      surgeries.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      QLB analgesic mechanism is include a lot of theory. in this study is research relationship
      between fascia pressure effect to relationship block success. We will use the ultrasound
      -guided anterior Quadratus Lumborum Block . Local anesthesic will be injected between
      quadratus lumborum muscle and psoas muscle with ultrasound. İn the Block procedure during
      will used the pressure line addition the block needle .
