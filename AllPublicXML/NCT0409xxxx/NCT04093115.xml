  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CX1106 is a novel inhibitor of thymidylate synthase (TS) developed as a potential antitumor
      agent by virtue of the rate limiting role of TS in the biosynthesis of thymidine. CX1106
      differs from other TS inhibitors such as pemetrexed, raltitrexed, CB3717, and fluorouracil in
      that it does not require active transport for uptake into cells. CX1106 also lacks a
      glutamate moiety and thus does not require polyglutamation for antitumor activity. More than
      1000 patients with various malignancies have been treated with CX1106 to date in previous
      various clinical trials.

      The investigators suggest a study of CX1106 in patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC
      who are resistant or ineligible/intolerant to platinum-based chemotherapy. The aim of current
      trial is to evaluate the antitumor efficacy and safety profile of CX1106.
