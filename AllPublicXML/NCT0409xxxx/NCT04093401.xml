  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While current guidelines call for annual follow-up for patients with a history of basal cell
      carcinoma, compliance with these guidelines is imperfect. It is hypothesized that if patients
      are informed of the quantitative risk of a subsequent basal cell carcinoma based on
      individualized risk factors, the compliance rate for follow-up will improve.

      The primary objective of this study is to assess one-year compliance with requested follow-up
      for patients with recent history of basal cell carcinoma, among those who receive standard
      sun avoidance counseling and request for follow-up compared to those who receive, in
      addition, an estimate of their mathematical risk of a subsequent basal cell carcinoma based
      on individualized risk factors.

      This is an open-label, single-blind study to evaluate the effect of informing subjects of
      their individualized risk of a subsequent basal cell carcinoma on proportion of subjects who
      achieve compliance with requested follow-up with a dermatology healthcare provider, defined
      as in-person follow-up within 365 days following diagnosis of initial basal cell carcinoma.

      Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to &quot;intervention&quot; (knowledge of individualized risk) or
      &quot;control&quot; (lack of awareness of individualized risk). Investigators will be aware of the
      modelled risk of a subsequent basal cell carcinoma for all subjects, but only subjects
      randomized to the &quot;intervention&quot; arm will be informed of their modelled risk. All subjects
      will receive standard sun avoidance counseling and will be requested to follow-up no later
      than 365 days from initial basal cell carcinoma diagnosis.
