  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of belantamab mafodotin in combination with
      VRd compared with VRd alone in adult participants with transplant ineligible (TI) newly
      diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM). The study will consist of 2 parts: part 1 will evaluate
      the safety and tolerability of different doses/dosing regimens of belantamab mafodotin in
      combination with VRd in an escalating manner and will determine the recommended phase 3 dose
      (RP3D). Part 2 will evaluate the efficacy and safety of the selected RP3D of belantamab
      mafodotin in combination with VRd compared with VRd alone.

    <intervention_model_description>The study consists of two parts. The dose selection part (Part 1) will evaluate the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of belantamab mafodotin in combination with VRd in up to 5 cohorts and will determine the RP3D of belantamab mafodotin in combination with VRd. The randomized Phase 3 part (Part 2) of the study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of the RP3D of belantamab mafodotin plus VRd compared with VRd alone.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Part 2: Change from Baseline in Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) as measured by European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of life questionnaire (EORTC QLQ)-C30</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to an average of 44 months</time_frame>
    <description>EORTC QLQ-C30 is a 30-item questionnaire containing both single- and multi-item measures. These include 5 functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social functioning), three symptom scales (fatigue, pain, and nausea/vomiting), a global health status/QoL scale, and 6 single items (constipation, diarrhea, insomnia, dyspnea, appetite loss, and financial difficulties). Scores for each scale and single-item measure are averaged and transformed linearly to a score ranging from 0-100. A high score for functional scales and for Global Health Status/QoL represent better functioning ability or HRQoL, whereas a high score for symptom scales and single items represents significant symptomatology.</description>

    <measure>Part 2: Change from Baseline in HRQOL as measured by EORTC QLQ-MY20</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to an average of 44 months</time_frame>
    <description>EORTC QLQ-MY20 symptoms (pain) domain is a supplement to the QLQ-C30 instrument used in participants with multiple myeloma. Only the Disease Symptoms domain of the QLQ-MY20 will be administered, which includes bone aches or pain, back pain, hip pain, arm or shoulder pain, chest pain, and pain increasing with activity. As with the QLQ-C30, QLQ-MY20 domain scores are averaged and transformed linearly to a score ranging from 0-100. Higher score represents a high level of symptomatology or problems.</description>

    <measure>Part 2: Changes from Baseline in participants-reported outcome common terminology criteria for adverse events (PRO-CTCAE) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to an average of 44 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PRO-CTCAE includes an item library of 124 items representing 80 symptomatic toxicities drawn from the CTCAE. PRO-CTCAE provides a systematic yet flexible tool for descriptive reporting of symptomatic treatment side effects in cancer clinical trials. In the present study, a subset of items selected from the PRO-CTCAE Version 1.0 Item Library will be administered. The symptoms and related impacts will be assessed using PRO-CTCAE score.</description>

    <measure>Part 2: Changes from Baseline in ocular surface disease index (OSDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to an average of 44 months</time_frame>
    <description>The impact of potential ocular toxicity on function and health-related quality of life will be assessed with the use of the visual function questionnaire the OSDI. OSDI is a 12-item questionnaire designed to assess both the frequency of dry eye symptoms and their impact on vision-related functioning. The OSDI has demonstrated good reliability, validity, sensitivity, and specificity, and can be used as a complement to other clinical and participative measures of dry eye disease by providing a quantifiable assessment of dry eye symptom frequency and the impact of these symptoms on vision-related functioning. The symptoms and related impacts will be assessed using OSDI score.</description>
