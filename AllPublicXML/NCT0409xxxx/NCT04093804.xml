  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to perform a prospective randomized trial among female patients
      undergoing reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) to determine if a larger glenosphere allows
      greater range of motion without an impact on complications.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A current research debate is whether glenosphere size has a significant clinical impact on a
      patient's range of motion (ROM) following RSA. Some researchers have shown an association
      between increased glenosphere size and improved ROM, but no study has determined the absolute
      minimal motion differences that would be recognizable or beneficial by patients. This is
      mostly attributable to limitations such as small sample sizes as well as the fact that
      shoulder dynamics are multifactorial in nature. Most studies have shown an increased ROM with
      larger glenosphere sizes.1 Because smaller patients are often times female and receive
      smaller implants, female patients may be more susceptible to limited ROM. The purpose of this
      study is to determine if a larger glenosphere allows for greater ROM in female patients
      undergoing RSA.

    <intervention_model_description>This study is a randomized trial consisting of female patients undergoing reverse shoulder arthroplasty for rotator cuff tear arthropathy or a massive irreparable rotator cuff tear. The experimental group will receive a 36mm glenosphere and the control group will receive the standard 32mm glenosphere. All other conditions of the surgical procedure will be identical as well as the clinical follow-up.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Two randomized study groups will be formed with the consented patients (experimental and control). All patients will undergo reverse shoulder arthroplasty by the Principal Investigator. The experimental group patients will receive a 36mm glenosphere and the control group will receive a 32mm glenosphere. All other procedures during the surgery are identical between groups.</description>
