    <textblock>
      The success of dental visit depends on the child's behavior and cooperation which can be
      recognized from the child's first visit. Child's behavior can be affected by the parenting
      style. There are four types of parenting styles: authoritative, authoritarian, permissive and
      neglecting, each affects the child in different ways.

      Recently parenting styles became very interesting since parents are the primary caregivers
      and they have a great impact on the child's psychological and emotional development.

      However, every parent seeks for a rapid and easy treatment for their children, but if the
      child is uncooperative that will require multiple dental visits , more expenses or he/she
      might undergo general anesthesia which is more expensive.

      Also, the parent-child relationship is very important ,bad relationship can cause
      insecurities, lack of self confidence and trust, resulting in the future a fearful and
      irresponsible man / woman.
