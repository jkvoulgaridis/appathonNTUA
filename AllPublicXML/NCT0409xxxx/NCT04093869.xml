  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effectiveness of a coping skills and exercise (CSTEX) intervention
      among post lung transplant patients aimed to reduce distress and improve functional capacity.
      Half of the patients will receive CSTEX and half will receive the standard of care plus
      transplant education (SOC-ED).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will aim to evaluate the effectiveness of the CSTEX intervention in (i) reducing
      distress and (ii) improving functional capacity. It is hypothesized that compared to SOC-ED,
      the CSTEX intervention will result in 1) greater reductions in global distress measured by an
      established psychometric test battery; and 2) greater improvements in functional capacity
      assessed by distance walked on a standard Six Minute Walk test (6MWT).

    <description>The CSTEX condition has two integrated components: the CST component will systematically train patients in the use of coping skills for stress reduction and promote key transplant-specific health behaviors. The exercise component of the intervention will progressively increase participants exercise and promote daily physical activity through motivational interviewing strategies.</description>
