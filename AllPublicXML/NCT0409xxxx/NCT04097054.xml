  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to develop, implement a planning tool for rare and complex
      visceral surgical procedures. With the successful implementation of the planning tool the
      study will contribute to the improvement of intraoperative processes and their outcome in low
      volume surgery and offer an alternative to continued centralization of surgical care
      especially in case of geographical or disease specific premises.

      The quality of the intraoperative process is still a blind spot, when it comes to clinical
      surgical research in the operating room. In contrast to pre and postop process optimization
      with tools like the World Health Organization (WHO) checklist or the Enhanced Recovery after
      Surgery (ERAS) protocol intraoperative processes tend to be poorly defined especially in rare
      and complex visceral surgery (e.g. esophageal, pancreatic rectal resection, sarcoma surgery,
      revisional bariatric surgery). This leads to delay, increased stress of the operating team
      and increased intraoperative mistakes and eventually increased complication rates. From
      previous investigations we know that step by step planning and briefing of the entire OR Team
      can reduce operative interruptions. With the development of a dedicated planning tool which
      allows to create and distribute step by step protocols for rare and complex visceral surgical
      procedures to the entire OR Team we hope to decrease delays and reduce OR time variance.

      Objective: Development and implementation of a planning tool for rare and complex visceral
      surgical procedures.

      Outcomes: Primary outcome: (delay/variability) operative times as defined as time from skin
      incision to skin closure

      Secondary outcomes:

        -  Costs

        -  Influence of preoperative augmented planning on degree of and quality of teaching

        -  Level of stress of each operating team member

        -  Number of intraoperative mistakes

        -  Number and severity of intraoperative and postoperative complications

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>delay/variability of operative time</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year, measured after every operation</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome is the (delay/variability) of operative time as defined as time from skin incision to skin closure that will be recorded with the hospital OR planning program (Ismed Protect Data) and compared to preoperatively planned times.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Costs</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year, calculated after every case once patient is dismissed</time_frame>
    <description>Costs will be calculated as intraoperative delay compared to preoperative planning in minutes multiplied with the OR minute costs of the institution in addition to the average salaries per minute of the involved surgical staff. OR minute costs will be calculated by dividing the OR and anesthesia cost units through the overall operative time in the institution. The OR cost unit includes the personnel expenses for operating nurses and other staff (including cleaner and others) as well as maintenance costs (single use equipment, depreciation on buildings and running expenses like water and electricity etc. The cost unit anesthesia includes all expenses for personnel (doctors and nurses), depreciation for respirators and other devices as well as expandable materials.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Level of stress</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year, measured during every operation</time_frame>
    <description>Level of stress of each operating team member will be assessed directly postoperatively with a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) report (operated on an ipad for data collection). The VAS Scale will consist of a 0 (no stress) to 7 (maximum stress) item scale.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of intraoperative mistakes</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year, measured during every operation and compiled after the operation is finished</time_frame>
    <description>Number of intraoperative mistakes will be recorded with a pedal button operated by the first assistant on the demand of the lead surgeon.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number and severity of intraoperative complications</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year, measured during every operation and compiled after the operation</time_frame>
    <description>Number and severity of intraoperative complications will be assessed directly postoperatively by the lead surgeon and or first assistant, audio video records are available for review purposes. Postoperative complications will be recorded after discharge on the basis of discharge summary and proceeding notes of the patient.</description>

    <description>Patients in the interventional arm are operated after augmented planning of the procedure. The plan is prepared by the surgeon and made available to the study team a day prior to the procedure and on a screen in the OR during the procedure. The plan includes the current and next operative step, the used equipment and the approximate time used as well as the estimated time of when the procedure will end.</description>

    <description>In the control cases no particular planning and distribution of operative plan is performed. The standard preparation only includes the distribution of information on the desired positioning of the patient, necessary special equipment and the overall estimated OR time.</description>
