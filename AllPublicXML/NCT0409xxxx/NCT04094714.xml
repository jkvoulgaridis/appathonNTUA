      Epidemiological study (cross-sectional study) in order to determine the patients who present

      OBJECTIVE: To determine the proportion of patients who present an adequate control of the
      Blood Pressure (BP), in a population of Colombian patients diagnosed with Arterial
      Hypertension (AH) and who are under pharmacological treatment.

      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Epidemiological study (cross-sectional study), multicentre type, in
      patients older than 18 years with prior diagnosis of AH in Colombia. The blood pressure
      control will be evaluated as the main variable (only one single blood pressure check in the
      doctor's office). Other secondary variables to evaluate are: demographical analysis, type (s)
      of antihypertensive treatment (s) used in patients, level of BP control, adverse events
      associated with antihypertensive treatment, comorbidities and risk factors, adherence,
      perception about the possible benefits of the use of combined therapy in &quot;mono-tablet&quot; versus
      &quot;multi-tablet&quot;. The analysis will be carried out from two perspectives: A first descriptive
      approach and a second analytical approach, with a level of significance of 5%.
