  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel study investigating the
      efficacy of Brain Octane® Oil on cognition, coordination, reaction time and measurements of
      physical performance in recreationally active adults. Thirty eligible participants will
      consume the investigational product or placebo for 27 days. 15 participants will consume the
      investigational product and 15 participants will receive the placebo product to consume.

      The primary outcome is assessing reaction time, cognition, and the ability to perform
      cognitive tasks. Assessments will be conducted at baseline, and end of study (30 days apart).

    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Dynavision is a large, computerized light board with 64 buttons arranged in five concentric circles around an above-center, LCD display called the T-scope. The device allows for adjustable height and is adjusted for each participant such that the T-scope is approximately at eye level.The D2 version of the device connects to a laptop computer where results are displayed in a graph format, presenting individual progress. Participants will have their visual, motor, and physical reaction time measured using the Reaction Mode and Mode A on the Dynavision D2.</description>

    <description>The Dynavision is a large, computerized light board with 64 buttons arranged in five concentric circles around an above-center, LCD display called the T-scope. The device allows for adjustable height and is adjusted for each participant such that the T-scope is approximately at eye level.The D2 version of the device connects to a laptop computer where results are displayed in a graph format, presenting individual progress. Participants will have their cognition measured using the Mode B on the Dynavision D2 device.
The Serial Sevens Test was first introduced in the 1940's by Hayman for neurological examinations with regards to mental function in individuals with brain lesions. Over time, it has been modified and used to analyze cognitive function in healthy individuals.</description>
