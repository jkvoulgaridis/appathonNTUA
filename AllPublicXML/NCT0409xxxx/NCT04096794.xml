    <textblock>
      The China Alliance for Type 1 Diabetes (CAT1D) is committed to exploring and implementing the
      model of graded diagnosis and treatment of type 1 diabetes and comprehensive management of
      outpatient service, carrying out a series of educational activities for patients, and
      cooperating in the development of multi-center prospective clinical research on type 1
      diabetes.

      1. Through the CAT1D, expand the cohort construction of type 1 diabetes patients and
           first-level relatives in China, establish the electronic information database of type 1
           diabetes, and lay a foundation for obtaining the research data of type 1 diabetes in
           China.

        2. observe and study the occurrence and development rules of acute and chronic
           complications of type 1 diabetes in China, analyze the influencing factors, and provide
           intervention means for reducing acute complications and preventing chronic
           complications.

        3. Through the established management platform and structured education system, verify and
           promote the comprehensive management mode based on structured education, and build a
           standard treatment plan and process based on evidence-based science and suitable for
           Chinese people and medical background.

        4. By using mobile health (mHealth) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies, a new
           mode of intelligent structured education is established, which provides a new way to
           explore the individualized education management mode and improve the outcome of chronic
           diseases through modern technology.
