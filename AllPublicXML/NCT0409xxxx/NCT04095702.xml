      RCI-Pacifiers have been utilized for decades in the NICU to provide benifical Non-Nutritive
      Suck. They have been instrumental in transitioning premature infants from gavage to breast
      feeding Yiallouerou, S, et al, studied the effects of dummy/pacifier on autonomic activity
      during sleep and found pacifier use to be protective during sleep. Risks and Benefits of
      Pacifiers have cleary been identified Sexton, S and Natsale, R have identified that
      nonnutritive suck is a natural reflex for a fetus and newborn. Traditionally, the pacifier
      has been used as a method for fulfilling an infants innate desire to suckle. Study subjects
      will be introduced to either a standard/traditional pacifier (without stabilizing/weighted
      attachment) or a stabilizing/weighted pacifier. Standard/traditional pacifiers will be issued
      to patients that have been assigned an odd number study identifier and , stabilzing/weighted
      pacifiers will be issued to patients that have been assigned an even number study identifier.
      All eligible infants born at 30 weeks to 37.6 weeks who meet study criteria will be included.
      All staff/caregivers will be trained in proper placement of a stabilizing pacifier prior to
      use. Stabilizing pacifiers will not be placed on the infants chest. Traditional pacifiers
      will be used as standard of care at EH. The Neonatal Infant Pain Score (NIPS) scale and a
      caregiver survey will be used to determine efficacy.

    <time_frame>48 hours</time_frame>
    <description>To determine if the weighted pacifier is safe in supporting non-nutritive suck. Neonates will be measured in facial expression, cry, breathing pattern, and state of arousal. Each category get a rating of 0 or 1, with 0 being negative and 1 being positive.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>efficiency determined by an Efficiency of Loss scale</measure>
    <time_frame>48 hours</time_frame>
    <description>To determine if the weighted pacifier is efficient in supporting non-nutritive suck. The neonates will be observed for a period of 10 minutes each time the pacifier is introduced. The observer will count the amount of time the neonate's pacifier pop from his/her mouth.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Caregiver stress determined by a Likert Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>48 hours</time_frame>
    <description>To determine if a caregiver's stress level decreases when an infant is provided with a stabilizing/weighted pacifier versus a traditional pacifier. The scale will consist of questions asking about the caregiver's stress. The caregiver will answer the questions with a 1-5 rating, with 1 being strongly disagree and 5 being strongly agree.</description>
