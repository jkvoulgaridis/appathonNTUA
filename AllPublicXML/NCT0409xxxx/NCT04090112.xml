  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coughing during extubation of endotracheal tube (ETT) is a common problem that leads to poor
      surgical results including hemodynamic change, rebleeding at the surgical wound and wound
      dehiscence. Recently, lidocaine has been introduced for reducing coughing during extubation.
      However, data comparing routes of lidocaine application are lacking, thus, this study
      compared the combination of lidocaine sprayed on laryngeal inlet and cuff of ETT versus
      intravenous lidocaine injection for efficacy in reducing coughing

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prospective randomized control trial was conduct with 164 patients. They were randomly
      allocated into Gr. A and B. Group A received four puffs of 10% lidocaine sprayed at the cuff
      of ETT and four puffs at laryngeal inlet whereas Gr. B received 15 mg/kg of 2% lidocaine
      intravenous injection prior to extubation. The same general anesthesia protocol was applied
      in all of the patients. Incidence and severity of cough during extubation was evaluated.
      Furthermore, incidence of 24-hour postoperative adverse events (including sore throat,
      dysphagia, and hoarseness) and hemodynamic response after extubation were analyzed.

    <description>Incidence of postoperative sore throat was recorded by two blinded anesthetist nurses . The numeric rating scale (0 = no, 10 = extreme) was used for evaluation of sore throat. If the numeric rating scale was more than 3, it was considered as a significant adverse event.</description>
