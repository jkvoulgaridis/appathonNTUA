    <textblock>
      The COSMID (Comparison of Surgery and Medicine on the Impact of Diverticulitis) trial is a
      pragmatic, patient-level randomized superiority trial of elective colectomy vs. best medical
      management for patients with quality of life (QoL) limiting diverticular disease. A parallel
      observational cohort will include those who are disinclined to have their treatment choice
      randomized, but are willing to contribute information about their outcomes. The goal of the
      COSMID trial is to answer the question: For patients with QoL-limiting diverticular disease,
      is elective colectomy more effective than best medical management? The hypothesis being
      tested in the COSMID trial is that patient-reported outcomes (PROs) among patients in the
      surgery arm will be superior to those in the best medical management arm.

    <textblock>
      For over 50 years, professional society recommendations for the management of uncomplicated
      diverticulitis included early elective surgery to prevent the need for an emergency operation
      and avoid the risk of colostomy. Over the last 15 years the notion that a patient must have a
      certain number of episodes of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis (AUD) before undergoing
      elective colectomy has changed dramatically. This was, in part, due to studies showing that
      emergency surgery for complicated disease is much more likely to be needed during the first
      episode of diverticulitis, making the notion of prophylactic elective colectomy for AUD less
      relevant. Furthermore, clinicians realized that most recurrent episodes of AUD could be
      managed with outpatient antibiotics alone and that &quot;best medical management&quot; - including
      fiber supplementation, mesalazine, rifamycin and probiotics - could reduce symptoms between
      episodes of AUD. All of the components of best medical management have some, albeit limited,
      evidence of effectiveness, most in improving symptoms rather than reducing the risk of
      recurrence and are relatively safe and inexpensive. Best medical management is far less
      invasive than elective surgery but infrequently prescribed the US, in part because of limited
      insurance coverage. Alternatively, resection removes the diseased segment of colon, does
      relieve symptoms and decreases the risk of recurrence.

      In 2014, guidelines from the American Society of Colorectal Surgeons (ASCRS) abandoned
      &quot;episode count&quot; as an indication for surgery in patients with AUD and instead recommended
      individualizing the decision to operate for AUD based on the &quot;effects on lifestyle
      (professional and personal) of recurrent attacks&quot;. Decision making about surgery in patients
      with lingering symptoms after recovery from an episode of AUD has not been the specific focus
      of an ASCRS guideline, but recommendations about elective surgery emphasize individualizing
      decision making based on the overall impact of the disease on the patient.These
      recommendations for individualization of treatment based on the quality of life (QoL) impact
      of recurrent AUD and lingering symptoms highlight the decision that hundreds of thousands of
      people now have to make each year. Based on the effect of the disease on their QoL they must
      choose between two very different treatment options: elective colectomy vs. best medical
      management. While the recommendation to individualize treatment based on the QoL impact is a
      step forward in advancing patient-centered care, the comparative effectiveness of these two
      treatments on symptoms and QoL has not been well studied.

      This will be a multi-site, open randomized trial in which participants with either recurrent
      AUD or lingering symptoms after an episode of AUD are randomized to one of two initial
      treatment strategies, elective segmental colectomy (performed laparoscopically when possible)
      and best medical management.

    <description>Elective segmental colectomy for diverticular disease involves removal of the segment of colon (most commonly sigmoid and/or left colon) where there has been disease identified by computed tomography imaging or colonoscopy. Elective colectomy usually removes the affected colon along with adjacent segments that have diverticula, with a primary anastomosis performed to reestablish bowel continuity. Most surgeons now perform the procedure using a laparoscopic approach, when possible, and sometimes use a temporary, protective stoma if the re-connection is considered high-risk. The technique for laparoscopic resection is not specified by the protocol (allows for any number of laparoscopic port sites, all incision types, hand-assistance and robotic) with details of the technique recorded. If randomized to elective colectomy, patients will be encouraged to undergo the procedure within 6 weeks of assignment.</description>

    <description>Medical management for diverticular disease has been used for over 30 years and includes a set of interventions, all components of which have been the subject of small, but often positive trials. All patients randomized to medical management or who select it as their treatment in the observational cohort will view a video (provided in English and Spanish) that explains each element of the medical management &quot;toolbox&quot;: diet and exercise recommendations, fiber supplementation (e.g., augmenting dietary fiber or over the counter fiber supplements), with mesalazine tablets or suppositories, probiotics and rifamycin. In consultation with their physician, they will be recommended to a regimen of diet and exercise and fiber supplementation. Clinicians will be asked to consider rifamycin (dose/frequency) for those with AUD who are not responding to diet and exercise and mesalazine (dose/frequency) for those with lingering symptoms who are not responding to diet and exercise.</description>

Based on the &quot;evidence-based best medical toolbox&quot; clinicians will be asked to consider rifamycin (dose/frequency) for those with AUD who are not responding to diet and exercise and mesalazine (dose/frequency) for those with lingering symptoms who are not responding to diet and exercise.</description>
