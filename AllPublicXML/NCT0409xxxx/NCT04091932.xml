    <textblock>
      This is a one-center, single-arm and prospective study, planing recruiting 10 AIDS-associated
      PML patients. All patients will receive PD-1 inhibitor (Pembrolizumab) for 12 weeks, and the
      dose for each time is 2 mg per kg/weight, and the frequency is once per 4 weeks. The effect
      and safety of Pembrolizumab on AIDS-associated PML will be evaluated.
