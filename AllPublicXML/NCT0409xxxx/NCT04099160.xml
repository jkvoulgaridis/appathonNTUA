  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Neurophysiology of Pain Questionnaire was first developed in English to test whether
      healthcare staff and patients could exactly understand pain neurophysiology. This
      questionnaire which contains 19 items was developed from the exam questions of students
      interested in post-graduate pain medicine. Catley et al. (2013) investigated the psychometric
      properties of the modified Neurophysiology of Pain Questionnaire with a few word differences
      from the original version by conducting a rash analysis on 300 patients with chronic spinal
      pain. Acceptable internal consistency and test-retest reliability of the questionnaire were
      recorded. However, it was stated that 7 items negatively affect psychometric properties of
      the questionnaire. As a result, the author concluded that the questionnaire had sufficient
      psychometric properties for use in chronic spinal pain subjects, but further studies were
      needed. The Neurophysiology of Pain Questionnaire was used to measure a knowledge about pain
      in different studies. The validity and reliability studies of the Dutch, French and Brazlian
      Portuguese versions of the Neurophysiology of Pain Questionnaire were conducted in the
      literature. The aim of our study was to translate the Revised Neurophysiology of Pain
      Questionnaire into Turkish language and to investigate its psychometric properties.

    <description>The Revised Neurophysiology of Pain Questionnaire consists of 12 items and measuring the level of knowledge about pain neurophysiology. High score indicates a high level of knowledge about pain neurophysiology.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analogue Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>1 minute</time_frame>
    <description>Visual Analogue Scale assessed pain severity. Visual Analog Scale is a straight horizontal line of fixed length, usually 100 mm. The ends are defined as the extreme limits of pain. hence the left end is usually labeled 'no pain', and the right end usually labeled 'extreme pain'. The score is determined by measuring the distance (mm) on the 10-cm line between the &quot;no pain&quot; anchor and the patient's mark by using a ruler. The scale is provided a range of scores from 0-100. High score indicates a high level of pain..</description>
