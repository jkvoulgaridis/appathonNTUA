    <textblock>
      This study will test the effects of a social media game on the physical activity of older
      adult women. The game will consist of playful weekly challenges that require sharing
      photographs on a private social media group and also wearing an activity monitor to track
      steps. Participants will be randomized to this game group or to receive the activity monitor
      only.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Older adult women are at risk for negative health impacts of physical inactivity, but current
      strategies to increase their activity have had disappointing long-term results. The
      intervention tested in this study seeks to test an innovative intervention that targets older
      womens' perceptions of enjoyment and their personal identity and values. The investigators
      will test the efficacy of a 12-month social media-based physical activity intervention for
      sedentary older adult women. Participants will be randomized to receive a standard
      Fitbit-only intervention or to an enhanced Fitbit + weekly social challenges intervention.
      The investigators hypothesize that participants in the enhanced intervention will demonstrate
      greater increases in autonomous regulation and objectively-measured steps as compared to
      those in the standard intervention. The investigators will also measure outcomes after a 6
      month maintenance period (18 months after beginning the intervention). Additional outcomes
      will include engagement with the social network and self-reported playful experiences.
