      This open label, dose escalating study is a phase I/IIa first in man study designed to
      evaluate the safety and tolerability of intratumoral administration of a novel oncolytic
      adenovirus (ORCA-010) in treating diagnosed treatment naïve Patients with localized prostate
      cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is divided into two parts. In Part A of the study, cohorts of subjects will be
      administered escalating doses of ORCA-010, using the 3+3 design. When the Maximum Tolerated
      Dose has been determined in Part A, a group of 12 new subjects will be treated in Part B of
      the study at this dose, with two administrations separated by a 2-week interval.

    <description>To evaluate safety and tolerability of intratumoral administration of ORCA-010 according to CTCAE V5.0. The primary endpoint of this study is to assess Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) and the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) for ORCA-010 to determine the final safety dose of administration for Phase IIa/Part B.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Biological activity of ORCA-010</measure>
    <time_frame>365 days</time_frame>
    <description>To explore the biological activity of intratumoral administration of ORCA-010. Biological activity of ORCA-010 will be measured by assessing viral replication by measuring ORCA-010 virus DNA in blood. In addition, virus replication and spread will be assessed by staining prostate cancer tissue obtained through prostate biopsies with adenovirus specific antibodies. Subject's serum will be assayed for antibody responses against ORCA-010.</description>

    <measure>Antitumor immune responses</measure>
    <time_frame>365 days</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate potential antitumor immune responses following ORCA-010 administration. Subject's serum will be analyzed for antibody responses against tumor-associated antigens (e.g. PSA, PSMA, PCA3, and Prostein). Subject's Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) will also be analyzed for cellular immune responses against tumor-associated antigens.
Prostate biopsies will be taken to detect local antitumor immunological reactions (eg. infiltration and activation of T cells).</description>

    <description>Single dose-escalation of ORCA-010, Dose Cohort 1: 1x10*11 viral particles.
Single dose of ORCA-010 will be administered for the first subject only and all relevant safety data for this subject will be reviewed by the DSMB prior to enrolling additional subjects.
After the DSMB review, subjects will be enrolled in groups of three (including the first subject) and assessed for safety and Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT) after a single dose of ORCA-010.
Group of 3 subjects.
Dose will be escalated to the next cohort based on safety and toxicity results from the 3 treated subjects to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose, if not determined by this cohort.</description>

    <description>The investigational new drug ORCA-010 is a novel and improved oncolytic adenovirus based on the adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) genome. ORCA-010 replicates specifically in cancer cells and not in normal tissue cells. Its replication has been shown in a wide variety of cancer cell types, and it is not limited to prostate cancer.</description>
