  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present studies demonstrated that pro-inﬂammation, systemic oxidative stress and
      dysfunction in the brain-gut microbiota axis were involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD)
      pathogenesis. These results implied the decreased regulation of inflammation-associated risk
      and microbiota in AD patients could provide the novel strategies for combating the disease.
      This study was designed to assess the addition of Wismemo in treatment of cholinesterase
      inhibitors (such as donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine) in the AD patients.

    <textblock>
      Previously studies have shown some probiotics could improve stress-related diseases such as
      anxiety, autism, depression and schizophrenia might be through regulating brain-gut
      microbiota axis, pro-inﬂammation and oxidative stress. Although recent clinical study
      indicated that mix-probiotics (containing Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei,
      Bifidobacteria bifidum and Lactobacillus fermentum) consumption could improve the cognitive
      function of dementia patients.

      In this clinical study, whether Genmont specific strain probiotics could improve the clinical
      syndromes and delay worsens in Alzheimer's dementia patients with regular treatment were
      clarified. A Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial would be carried
      out. AD's patients with regular treatment are additive consumption multi-strain probiotic
      supplement (Wismemo). Half of participants will receive Wismeno and regular treatment in
      combination, while the other half will receive placebo and regular treatment in combination.
      To evaluate of the effect of probiotic supplementation on cognitive, emotional and related
      status on Alzheimer's dementia patients.
