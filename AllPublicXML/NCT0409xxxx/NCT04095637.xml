  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this prospective, randomised, single-blinded, controlled trial is to
      compare clinical outcomes and accuracy of implant positioning in Mako robotic UKA versus
      jig-based Oxford UKA with navigation control. Patients receiving the Mako robotic UKA
      (Stryker Ltd) will form the investigation group and those undergoing the jig-based Oxford UKA
      (Zimmer-Biomet Ltd) with navigation control will form the control group.

      The primary objective in this study is to compare accuracy of component positioning as
      assessed by postoperative low radiation dose CT scan between conventional Jig-based Oxford
      UKA with navigation control and Mako robotic UKA.
