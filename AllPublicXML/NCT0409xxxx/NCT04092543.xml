  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The CT-DRAGON score can predict long-term functional outcome after acute stroke treated by
      thrombolysis. However, implementation in clinical practice is hampered by a lack of
      validation in the broad spectrum of stroke patients undergoing thrombectomy, whether or not
      in combination with thrombolysis or conservative treatment. Furthermore, the CT-DRAGON score
      considers multiple items, which are not always readily available in every setting. This study
      aims to investigate whether either a simplified version of the CT-DRAGON score with only
      three clinical items or a machine learning technique could be as powerful and more feasible.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to validate the CT-DRAGON score in all ischaemic stroke localisations
      and for all treatment options, including a conservative treatment policy. The predictability
      will then be compared with on the one hand simplified prognostic models that include only a
      selective set of highly predictive parameters that have already been described in the
      literature, such as patient age, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and
      pre-stroke modified Rankin Scale (mRS). On the other hand, machine learning techniques, that
      incorporate a large set of variables and have recently shown some promising results, will
      also be applied to predict long-term outcome after ischaemic stroke.

    <description>The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) is a publically available global health assessment tool that allows measurements of symptoms, functioning, and healthcare-related quality of life.The scoring system of the PROMIS Global-10 allows each of the individual items to be examined separately to provide specific information about perceptions of physical function, pain, fatigue, emotional distress, social health and general perceptions of health.The summed total is reported as 0 to 48 with higher scores reflecting less pain and better function.</description>

    <description>Change in NIHSS over time: baseline (diagnosis stroke), 3 months and one year follow-up. The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) is a tool used by healthcare providers to objectively quantify the impairment caused by a stroke. The NIHSS is composed of 11 items, each of which scores a specific ability between a 0 and 4. For each item, a score of 0 typically indicates normal function in that specific ability, while a higher score is indicative of some level of impairment. The individual scores from each item are summed in order to calculate a patient's total NIHSS score. The maximum possible score is 42, with the minimum score being a 0.</description>
