    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to observe the safety and effectiveness of the
      WATCHMAN FLX™ Left Atrial Appendage Closure (LAAC) Device for subjects with non-valvular
      atrial fibrillation to reduce the risk of stroke in Hong Kong area.

    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, non-randomized, multi-center observational study. The primary
      Effectiveness Endpoint is the occurrence of non-effective LAA closure defined as any
      peri-device flow &gt; 5mm demonstrated by TEE/CT/MRI at First Follow-up.The primary safety
      endpoint is the occurrence of one of the following events between the time of implant and
      within 7 days following the procedure or by hospital discharge, whichever is later: all-cause
      death, ischemic stroke, systemic embolism, or device or procedure related events requiring
      open cardiac surgery or major endovascular intervention such as pseudoaneurysm repair, AV
      fistula repair, or other major endovascular repair. Secondary effectiveness endpoint is the
      occurrence of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism at 12 months from the time of implant.

          2. Patients who are willing and capable of providing informed consent, participating in
             all testing associated with this clinical investigation at an approved clinical
             investigational center;
