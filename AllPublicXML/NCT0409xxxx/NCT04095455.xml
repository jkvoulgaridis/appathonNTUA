  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Postoperative pain is one of the greatest patient concerns following surgery.
      However, general anesthesia cannot provide adequate postoperative pain control and the
      routine use of parenteral opioids aggravates postoperative sedation, nausea, emesis, impaired
      oxygenation and depressed ventilation.

      Hypothesis:

      The investigators assume that both ultrasound guided Modified Pecs Block and combination of
      Ketamine and Magnesium sulphate infusion can achieve better analgesia in major breast cancer
      surgery in the form of reducing total amount of intraoperative fentanyl requirement and
      reducing postoperative morphine requirement and improvement of postoperative VAS scores both
      at rest and during shoulder movement so we plan this study to evaluate this assumption

      Surgery on the chest wall is relatively common and can be associated with significant
      postoperative discomfort and pain; and one of the most common surgical sites on the chest
      wall is the breast, with the main indication for breast surgery being breast cancer. Breast
      cancer has continued to be the most common cancer in females, accounting for approximately
      31% of all newly detected cancer cases in the female population, worldwide. (1, 2) Thousands
      of patients undergo surgery in the mammary and axillary regions every year, and these
      procedures tend to cause significant acute pain and may develop in to cases of chronic pain
      in 25-60% of cases. (3) Pain can be controlled using systemic opioids which have a
      respiratory depressant effect and causing nausea and vomiting.

      Also can be controlled using epidural catheter that can cause haemodynamic instability, so we
      are searching about how to devrease pain with less complications.
