      In this proposed study a novel technique that utilizes bone screws as an anchorage device
      will be used to facilitate suturing and ensure graft tissue immobilization on full thickness
      recipient bed preparation sites. Currently, no information is available on free gingival
      graft treatment outcomes comparing full thickness recipient bed preparation, i.e., no
      periosteum remaining under the free gingival graft, with the aid of bone screws versus a
      conventional partial thickness recipient bed preparation with periosteum remaining under the
      graft. The purpose of the present study is to investigate the effect of these two different
      recipient bed preparations on soft tissue dimension change, graft and surgical wound healing,
      patient comfort, surgical complication frequency and operator satisfaction after free
      gingival graft to increase the width of keratinized gingival tissue in mandibular posterior
      sites. The purpose of the present study is to investigate the effect of these two different
      recipient bed preparations on soft tissue dimension change, graft and surgical wound healing,
      patient comfort, surgical complication frequency and operator satisfaction after free
      gingival graft procedure to increase the width of keratinized gingival tissue in mandibular
      posterior sites. The specific aims of this research study contain two aspects:

        1. To compare the wound healing of a free gingival graft using either a partial thickness
           flap or full-thickness flap preparation with bone screws at the recipient site around
           mandibular posterior areas.

        2. To assess patient comfort and surgeon satisfaction with a free gingival graft procedure
           using these two different recipient bed preparations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While the presence of a sufficient size of keratinized oral mucosa is favorable, the surgical
      procedure to increase the size is technically difficult. In the traditional way, preparation
      of the gum bed for a graft tissue is done with partial-thickness flap elevation, in which
      part of the mucosa and submucosa, but not the periosteum (dense fibrous membrane covering the
      surface of bones), are separated from underneath bone. In the traditional method of gum bed
      preparation, separation of the mucosa and submucosa from underneath periosteum and bone
      should be done with extremely caution to avoid damaging the periosteum. Therefore, the
      traditional method of gum bed preparation is not only time consuming but also problematic
      because of more bleeding when compared to full thickness flap elevation, in which the mucosa
      and submucosa together with the periosteum are separated from underneath bone. In order to
      stabilize gum graft on bone surface, a new technique is applied in this study by using two
      bone screws as anchorage to fastened the graft on the exposed bone through suturing. In the
      present study, we will compare patient quality of life, operator satisfaction, and
      differences in surgical wound healing between these two different bed preparations. The
      results of this study could help establish a more patient- and operator-friendly surgical
      protocol for the use of gum graft to increase the width of keratinized oral mucosa.

    <measure>Graft width, length and area</measure>
    <time_frame>During the surgery, at the 1-, 2-, 4-, 8- week visits</time_frame>
    <description>Graft length and width will be confirmed after harvest and remeasured in situ, using a digital caliper, after completion of the surgical procedure. Subsequently, graft length and width will be measured on clinical images obtained at the post-op visits. A mirror image photo of the grafted site will be taken with a single-lens reflex camera and the dimension will be measured and analyzed with Image J software. Size markers will be used to calibrate image magnification. Graft area will be calculated from the length and width measurements.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Wound healing index</measure>
    <time_frame>At the 3-day, 1-, 2-, 4-, 8- week visits</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical photographs of the recipient sites will be taken at baseline, immediately after surgery, and at each follow-up visit, to record the appearance of the graft. A size marker will be used to standardize photos. Small size mirror will be placed with caution to avoid any disturbance of the surgical site, and mirror image photo will be taken. Wound healing index by Pippi et al. , which is the modified Wound Healing Index by Landry et al., is customized and used to evaluate the healing potential of the graft.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Graft thickness</measure>
    <time_frame>During the surgery, at the 8-week visits</time_frame>
    <description>Graft thickness will be measured in situ with digital caliper, and at the 8-week follow-up visit using an endodontic reamer, at five (5) predetermined points. A central point will be located at the geometric center of the graft, where the two diagonals of the square intersect. The other four points will each be located on the diagonal, at 3 mm from the corner of the graft. Pre-fabricated acrylic stent with holes for the measurements will be used to standardize measurement location. At 8 weeks, graft thickness measurements will be repeated following topical and local anesthesia using infiltration.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Graft mobility</measure>
    <time_frame>At the end of surgery, at the 8-week visits</time_frame>
    <description>At the end of the procedure, graft mobility will be assessed indirectly and graded. While exerting tension on the cheek/vestibule, graft will be observed for mobility. Mobility will be graded indirectly, by exerting tension on the cheek/vestibule, and directly, by applying gentle force on the graft using a periodontal probe, in a manner similar to the functional approach used to locate the mucogingival junction.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Biochemical wound assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>At the 3-day, 1-, 2- week visits</time_frame>
    <description>Wound fluid will be collected from the transplanted graft site. Paper strips will be left in place for 30 sec and then immediately transferred to a micro-moisture meter to determine the volume of collected fluid. Following volume measurement, paper strips will be immediately placed into a vial, on ice; fluid collection will be repeated after 5 minutes. Then the vial with the 4 paper strips will be transferred to a -80˚C freezer until further analysis. Expression of angiogenesis biomarkers will be quantified with the use of a human angiogenesis custom array kit according to the manufacturer's protocol.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Surgical time</measure>
    <time_frame>During the surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Length of surgery will be measured at the time the operator starts the first incision in the recipient bed and stopped when the last suture placement is placed. Bed preparation and graft placement will be independently timed to compare between procedures and with operator's opinion.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain assessment.</measure>
    <time_frame>At the 3-day, 1-, 2-, 4-, 8- week visits</time_frame>
    <description>A visual analogue scale (VAS) will be used to measure daily pain intensity at each postoperative week. The self-reported degree of pain will be scored, with 0 defined as the absence of pain and 10 as the maximum tolerable level of pain. The intake of NSAIDs will be also recorded. .</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>OHIP-14</measure>
    <time_frame>Right before the surgery and at the 3-day, 1-, 2-, 4-, 8- week visits</time_frame>
    <description>The oral health-related quality of life will be assessed by the Oral Health Impact Profile scale (OHIP-14). Participants will be asked how frequently they had experienced the impact on each category in OHIP-14 with a 5-point scale (from 0 to 4). The total score of OHIP‐14 will be calculated by adding the sum of each category from 14 questions (total score ranges from 0 to 56 points). Higher scores imply a poorer oral health quality of life, whereas lower scores indicate a better one.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Operator-centered outcomes</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after the surgery, 2-week post-op visit and when an operator has conducted all allocated cases</time_frame>
    <description>Immediately after the surgery, operators will receive custom questionnaire to assess the difficulty of the surgery. Each step of the surgery will be categorized and will be marked with 10-point scale (from 0 to 10) based on the surgical difficulty and time management.
After completion of the 2-week post-op visit, operators will be asked to assess difficulty of screw removal (test group only).
Also, after each enrolled operator has conducted all allocated cases (2 cases of full-thickness flap group and 2 cases of partial-thickness flap group, possibly up to 1 year.), including all 2-week post-op visits, he/she will be asked to report their preference of procedure (control or test)</description>
