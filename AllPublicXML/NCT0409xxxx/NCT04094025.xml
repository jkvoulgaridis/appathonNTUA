      This is a randomized, evaluator-blinded study consisting of one (1) group. The study will
      assess skin irritation as well as sensitization for d-ATS patch in healthy subjects. All
      three (3) articles (d-ATS patch, placebo patch, and saline patch) will be applied
      simultaneously on the back of each subject. Healthy subjects will be enrolled to participate
      in two (2) phases: A Screening Phase and a Treatment Phase. The total duration of the study
      for each subject will be about 10 - 16 weeks. The Re-challenge Test will only be performed
      for subjects who experience any type of sensitization during Challenge Period.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject provides written informed consent prior to entering the study or undergoing
             any study procedures;

          2. Healthy male and female (non-pregnant, non-lactating) 18 - 65 years of age inclusive;

          3. Subject is considered by the Principal Investigator/Sponsor to be healthy on the basis
             of medical history, physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG) and
             clinical laboratory test results. Deviations or excursions considered to be
             non-clinically significant as per the Principal Investigator are acceptable;

          4. Subject has a normal screening ECG; non-specific ST-T wave changes or other changes
             deemed by the Principal Investigator as not clinically significant are acceptable;

          5. Female subject is (i) a woman physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant
             [confirmed to be post-menopausal (having amenorrhea for &gt;12 months), has had a
             hysterectomy with or without bilateral oophorectomy at least 6 months prior to the
             Screening Visit] or (ii) a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a
             negative pregnancy test at the Screening Visit and must agree to either abstain from
             sexual intercourse or use two forms of reliable barrier method of contraception (e.g.,
             condom with spermicide, diaphragm, IUD, contraceptive sponge) for at least 14 days
             before and throughout the duration of study (from Screening Visit through the
             Follow-up Visit) or have used a hormonal method of contraception for at least 30 days
             before the study and will continue to use the same type of hormonal contraceptive
             during the study. Acceptable forms of birth control include (i) surgical sterilization
             (such as a tubal ligation), which occurred more than 3 months prior to the Screening

             injections), (iii) an intrauterine device, (iv) barrier method (condom or occlusive
             cap [diaphragm or cervical/vault caps] used with spermicidal
             foam/gel/film/cream/suppository), (v) Vasectomy in male partner, which occurred more
