          -  Signed and dated written informed consent and assent, where applicable, in accordance
             with International Conference on Harmonisation-Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP) and
             local legislation prior to admission to the trial.

          -  Male or female patients. Female of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must confirm that
             sexual abstinence is standard practice and will be continued until 3 months after last
             drug intake, or be ready and able to use a highly effective method of birth control
             per International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) M3 (R2) that results in a low
             failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly, in
             combination with one barrier method, from 28 days prior to initiation of study
             treatment, during treatment and until 3 months after last drug intake. Sexual
             abstinence is defined as abstinence from any sexual act that may result in pregnancy.
             A list of contraception methods meeting these criteria is provided in the parental
             information.

          -  Patients with evidence of fibrosing Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) on High-Resolution
             Computed Tomography (HRCT) within 12 months of Visit 1 as assessed by the investigator
             and confirmed by central review.

          -  Patients with Forced Vital Capacity (FVC)% predicted ≥25% at Visit 2. [Note: Predicted
             normal values will be calculated according to GLI (Global Lung Initiative)]

          -  Patients with clinically significant disease at Visit 2, as assessed by the
             investigator based on any of the following:

               -  Fan score ≥3, or

               -  Documented evidence of clinical progression over time based on either

                    -  a 5-10% relative decline in FVC% predicted accompanied by worsening
                       symptoms, or

                    -  a ≥10% relative decline in FVC % predicted, or

                    -  increased fibrosis on HRCT, or

                    -  other measures of clinical worsening attributed to progressive lung disease
                       (e.g. increased oxygen requirement, decreased diffusion capacity).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) and/or Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT)&gt;1.5 x Upper
             Level of Normal (ULN) at Visit 1.

          -  Creatinine clearance &lt;30 mL/min calculated by Schwartz formula at Visit 1. [Note:
             Laboratory parameters from Visit 1 have to satisfy the laboratory threshold values as
             shown above. Visit 2 laboratory results will be available only after randomization. In
             case at Visit 2 the results do no longer satisfy the entry criteria, the Investigator
             has to decide whether it is justified that the patient remains on study drug. The
             justification for decision needs to be documented. Laboratory parameters that are
             found to be abnormal at Visit 1 are allowed to be re-tested (once) if it is thought to
             be a measurement error (i.e. there was no abnormal result of this test in the recent
             history of the patient and there is no related clinical sign) or the result of a
             temporary and reversible medical condition, once that condition is resolved.]
