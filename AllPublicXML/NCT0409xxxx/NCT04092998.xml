    <textblock>
      Circumcision is one of the most commonly performed surgical procedures worldwide. It is known
      that more than one million children are circumcised annually in the USA alone . Moreover, the
      WHO has begun to recommend circumcision on the basis of studies indicating its positive
      effects on human health and especially its role in protection from AIDS . Because of this,
      thousands of people have been circumcised by many migratory circumcision teams, especially in
      Africa.

      Considering that 1 200 000 children are born annually in Turkey and 51% of them are male, on
      the basis of data from the Turkish Institute of Statistics, it may be speculated that about
      60 000 circumcisions are performed annually in Turkey.

      However, the circumcision procedure cannot be performed in health institutions as a routine
      procedure because of health regulations. When the Social Security Institute incorporated
      circumcision into the social insurance coverage in 2007, it led to circumcision being
      performed in the health institutions. Health institutions that were already burdened cannot
      meet the demands for circumcision. Thus, the search has begun for faster and reliable
      circumcision techniques with fewer complications. The present study aimed to compare bipolar
      thermal cautery-assisted circumcision technique, considered to be capable of meeting such
      demands, with the classical circumcision technique.

      Aim of Work This study is aiming to assess the outcome of using thermo cautery in
      circumcision

      Surgical Steps:

      small skin incision over prepuce by thermo cautery

      stitching if there is bleeding

      Insertion of a urinary catheter if suspect uretheral injury
