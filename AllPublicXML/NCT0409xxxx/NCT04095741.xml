  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With this investigation, researchers wil look for a link between the appearance of anorexia
      nervosa and autism spectrum disorders in minors. Previous studies made clear already that
      patients with anorexia nervosa show elevated characteristics of autism spectrum disorder,
      when being meassured in adults and in patients in the acute fase of their anorexia nervosa.
      The purpose of this invenstigation is to see if their is also an elevated incidence of
      characteristics of autism spectrum disorder in minors with anorexia nervosa in remission.

      34 patients who are still minors and were previously treated in the Child and Adolescent
      Psychiatry Department (PAika) of the University Hospital in Brussels, will be contacted to
      ask if they would volunteer in this investigation. If the minors and their parents give their
      permission, they will be asked to fill in multiple questionnaires, measuring the current
      symptoms of anorexia nervosa, characteristics of autism spectrum disorder and global
      functioning of the minors. The questionnaires will be send and returned by post.
