  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of administering a
      single intravenous (IV) infusion dose of TAK-925 to participants with idiopathic hypersomnia
      (IH).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study in participants with IH is called TAK-925. The study will
      have 2-treatment crossover groups. The study will evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK),
      pharmacodynamics (PD), safety, and tolerability of a single intravenous (IV) dose of Dose A
      in participants with IH.

      The study will enroll 40 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the two
      treatment sequence groups as indicated below:

        -  TAK-925 + Placebo

        -  Placebo + TAK-925

      On Day 1 of each treatment period, TAK-925 or placebo will be administered as a single 9-hour
      infusion.

      The multicenter study will be conducted in US and Japan. The overall duration of treatment in
      this study is approximately 43 days including up to 28 day screening period and a follow up
      safety visit 7 days post last dose for all.

    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (example, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. A TEAE is defined as an AE with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug.</description>

             screening.

          4. Nicotine dependence that is likely to have an effect on sleep (eg, a participant who
             routinely awakens at night to smoke) and/or an unwillingness to discontinue all
             smoking and nicotine use during the study.

          5. Alcohol use that is likely to have an effect on sleep and/or an unwillingness to
             discontinue all alcohol use from 72 hours before check-in through discharge on Study

    <ipd_description>Takeda makes patient-level, de-identified data sets and associated documents available for all interventional studies after applicable marketing approvals and commercial availability have been received (or program is completely terminated), an opportunity for the primary publication of the research and final report development has been allowed, and other criteria have been met as set forth in Takeda's Data Sharing Policy (see www.TakedaClinicalTrials.com for details). To obtain access, researchers must submit a legitimate academic research proposal for adjudication by an independent review panel, who will review the scientific merit of the research and the requestor's qualifications and conflict of interest that can result in potential bias. Once approved, qualified researchers who sign a data sharing agreement are provided access to these data in a secure research environment.</ipd_description>
