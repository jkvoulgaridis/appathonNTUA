  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Researchers are trying to test a MR imaging method for detection of Cerebral Spinal Fluid
      (CSF) flow in the brain to help diagnosis and better understand diseases that affect brain
      function.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to figure out if MR imaging can detect movement of CSF (fluid
      around the brain) to help better diagnosis and understand the cause of diseases that affect
      brain function. We are doing this research study to find out if movement of CSF is different
      between healthy adults and those with a disease that affects brain function.

    <description>Participants will be asked to complete a MRI screening form to check for the presence of metallic implants and materials. People with pacemakers, aneurysm clips, and cochlear implants, or metal/foreign objects in their eyes cannot have an MRI and will not be able to participate in the study.
Pre-menopausal females will be asked if they think they may be pregnant. If yes, a urine pregnancy test will be performed.
Those who meet eligibility criteria for the study and have agreed to participate will be taken to the MRI suite when MR imaging of the brain will be performed.</description>

    <description>You will be asked to lie down on the bed of the MRI scanner. Then a MRI coil/&quot;antenna&quot; will be placed over your head. This will allow us to get clearer pictures of the tissue of interest. The MRI machine makes loud knocking sounds. Because of this you will be asked to wear earplugs. You will receive a &quot;squeeze ball&quot; alarm in case you need urgent help. We will be able to talk with you and hear you during the MRI exam. The entire MRI scan will last about 45-60 minutes. The MR exam will include standard clinical images as well as the CSF flow imaging.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A healthy control will be defined as an otherwise healthy person who does not have a
             medical condition that affects brain function or have problems with concentration,
             memory, balance, or coordination.

          -  Patients who have a suspected diagnosis of altered CSF dynamics including but not
             limited to normal pressure hydrocephalus will be referred to Dr. Cogswell by their
             care team to be included in the study. Conditions of altered CSF dynamics include
             obstructive and non-obstructive hydrocephalus and may be associated with headaches
             and/or decreased cognitive function.

          -  Similarly, patients with impaired cognitive function including but not limited to
             Alzheimer's disease will be referred to Dr. Cogswell by their care team to be included
             in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with non-MRI compatible devices

          -  required sedation

          -  women who may be pregnant will be excluded.

          -  The first 10 subjects with normal pressure hydrocephalus will not have previously been
             shunted.
