  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine the validity of a point-of-care nerve conduction
      device (NeuroMetrix) and Rydel-Seiffer tuning fork in assessing the level of peripheral
      neuropathy in patients with chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN).
      Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a common, persistent toxicity among
      patients who receive chemotherapy. It is characterized by a variety of sensory and motor
      symptoms such as numbness, tingling, reduced sense of touch, reduced proprioception
      (awareness of your limb and body position in space), pain, weakness, balance disturbances,
      and deficits in motor skills.

    <time_frame>Baseline to 30 days after 3 week treatment sessions</time_frame>
    <description>Participants with chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) will have their level of periphal neuropathy assessed with the Rydel-Seiffer Tuning Fork while using a point-of-care conduction device (NeuroMetrix). The level of periphal neuropathy will be measured by vibration detection using a Rydel-Seiffer graduated tuning fork placed on the dorsum of the right great toe between the nail and the distal interphalangeal joint. The two arms of the 128 Hz tuning fork are fitted with calibrated weights at the ends, and as the amplitude decreases, the intersection of the triangles moves upward on the weight. This test will be performed three times and a mean of the scores calculated. Vibration sensation is lost sooner in CIPN, which means that lower scores are associated with increased CIPN.</description>

    <measure>Quality of life Improvement measured with FACT/GOG-NTX Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 30 days after 3 week treatment sessions</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life improvement with electroacupuncture treatment will be measured using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy/Gynecologic Oncology Group-Neurotoxicity questionnaire (FACT/GOG-NTX). The FACT/GOG-NTX questionnaire uses 37 questions with a scale ranging from 0-4, with 0 being Not at All and 4 being Very Much.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of life Improvement measured the Neuropathic pain scale (NPS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 30 days after 3 week treatment sessions</time_frame>
    <description>The NPS has 3 questions using a scale ranging from 0-100 with 0 being No Numbess Sensation to 100 being Worst Numbness Imaginable. The NPS also has 10 Yes or No questions about pain. A score of 1 is given to each question answered Yes and a score of 0 to each questions answered No. The total score is calculated as the sum of the 10 questions, and the cut off value for the diagnosis of neuropathic pain is 4/10.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive electroacupuncture for 30 minutes once per week for a total of 3 weeks. The acupoints will be stimulated by the electroacupuncture machine with alternating frequencies in order to induce endorphins at different points in the nervous system. Frequencies between 2 Hz and 100 Hz will be utilized. Sterile single-use needles will be placed at Ba Feng, four points on the dorsum of each foot between the digits. KI2 (Rang Gu), a point located at the soles of the feet and SP-4 (Gongsun) will also be needled per recommendation of our acupuncturist. A total of 12 needles will be used per participant.</description>
