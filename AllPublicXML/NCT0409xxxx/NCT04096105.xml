  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomized, parallel design study to evaluate the PK, safety,
      tolerability and immunogenicity of single SC doses of CC-93538 in healthy Japanese and
      Caucasian adult subjects.

      A total of approximately 48 subjects, 24 Japanese and 24 Caucasians, will be enrolled.
      Japanese subjects will be enrolled first and randomized 1:1 to receive a single SC dose of
      either 180 mg or 360 mg CC-93538. Caucasian subjects will then be enrolled and matched to
      Japanese subjects (1:1) by weight (± 20%) and receive the same single SC dose of either 180
      mg or 360 mg CC-93538.

             time of signing the ICF.

          2. Subject must have a body weight of at least 40 kg; a BMI ≥18 and ≤ 30 kg/m2 at
             screening. Japanese and Caucasian subjects will be matched by body weight (± 20%).

          3. Japanese subjects must have been born in Japan and not have lived outside of Japan &gt; 5
             years, have both parents and grandparents of Japanese origin, and have not
             significantly modified their diets since leaving Japan.

          4. Caucasian subjects must be of European or Latin American descent (ie, White).

          5. Subject must be in good health, as determined by the Investigator on the basis of
             medical history, clinical laboratory safety test results, vital signs, 12-lead ECG,
             and PE at screening.

          6. Female subjects not of childbearing potential must:

               1. Have been surgically sterilized (hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; proper
                  documentation required) at least 6 months before Screening, or

               2. Postmenopausal (defined as 24 consecutive months without menses before Screening,
                  with a follicle stimulating hormone [FSH] level in the postmenopausal range
                  according to the laboratory used at Screening); FSH to be performed at the
                  discretion of the Investigator in consultation with the Medical Monitor.

          7. Females of child-bearing potential (FCBP) must agree to practice a highly effective
             method of contraception throughout the study and for 5 months after the last dose of
             investigational product (IP). Acceptable methods of birth control in this study are
             the following:

               -  Combined hormonal (containing oestrogen and progestogen) contraception, which may
                  be oral, intravaginal, or transdermal

               -  Progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation,
                  which may be oral, injectable or implantable

               -  Placement of an intrauterine device or intrauterine hormone-releasing system

               -  Bilateral tubal occlusion

               -  Vasectomised partner

               -  Sexual abstinence

          8. Male subjects must:

               1. Practice true abstinence (which must be reviewed on a monthly basis and source
                  documented) or agree to use a latex condom during sexual contact with FCBP while
                  participating in the study until 5 months after the last dose of IP.

               2. Agree to refrain from donating sperm during the study until 5 months after the
                  last dose of IP.

             Periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, postovulation methods), withdrawal
             (coitus interruptus), spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhoea method are not
             acceptable methods of contraception. Female condom and male condom should not be used
             together.

          9. Subjects must understand and voluntarily sign an ICF prior to any study-related
             assessments/procedures being conducted, and must be able to comply with the
             requirements of the study, including the study visit schedule and other protocol
             requirements. Must be able to communicate with the Investigator and

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The presence of any of the following will exclude a subject from enrollment:

          1. Subject has any significant medical history/condition, laboratory abnormality, or
             psychiatric illness that would prevent the subject from participating in the study.

          2. Subject has any condition including the presence of laboratory abnormalities, which
             places the subject at unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in the study.

             least 24 hours prior to dosing (Day 1) and throughout the study

         14. Subject has tattoos (&gt; 25% of their body) or other skin markings (eg, scars) that, in
             the opinion of the investigator, would prevent visualization of dermatologic changes
             due to study treatment

         15. Subject has been diagnosed with or is being treated for a parasitic/helminthic
             infection or subject has systemic or diarrheal illness following travel or residence
             in endemic areas of parasitic/helminthic infections, history of clinical
             schistosomiasis, and history of travel to endemic areas within preceding 6 months.

         16. Subject has a history of tuberculosis, listeriosis, or untreated parasitic infections.

         17. Subject has a history of hereditary fructose intolerance.

         18. Subject is, for any reason, deemed by the Investigator to be inappropriate for this
