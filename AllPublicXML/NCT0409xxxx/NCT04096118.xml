  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer is the most-common cancer of the gastrointestinal tract. The number of
      positive lymph nodes and total number of lymph nodes retrieved are important prognostic
      factors. In patients who do not receive preoperative chemoradiation, the total number of
      lymph nodes should be more than 12 nodes to predict accurate staging. In cases of
      locally-advanced rectal cancer when patients receive neoadjuvant chemoradiation it is
      sometimes impossible to retrieve adequate amount of lymph nodes due to the chemoradiation
      effect. Therefore, this study was to evaluate and predict survival rates based on positive
      lymph node ratio.

      The primary endpoint of this study was to assess the lymph node ratio as another predictor
      for survival rate in preoperative chemoradiation rectal cancer patients. The other secondary
      objective was to determine the relationship between total harvested lymph nodes and survival
      rate in each stage. This is a retrospective, single-centered study, collecting data of
      patients from January 2011 to December 2017. Including a total of 163 patients with rectal
      cancer who underwent surgery following neoadjuvant chemoradiation. Using Cox regression and
      Kaplan-Meier survival analysis to determine whether the lymph node ratio can be used to
      predict the survival rate and determine the cut-off value to distinguish the prognosis of the
      disease.
