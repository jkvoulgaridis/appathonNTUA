  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glaucoma is an ocular condition in which optic nerve damage occurs, frequently in the
      presence of increased pressure within the eye. Micro-invasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS) refers
      to a new group of surgical procedures which are characterized by the following features: high
      safety profile, minimal trauma, ease of use and rapid recovery. There are 3 main groups of
      MIGS devices, which drain fluid to different regions in the eye: the Schlemm's canal, the
      suprachoroidal space and the subconjunctival space. Though MIGS devices were introduced in
      the United States of America, Canada and Europe more than 5 years ago, and have attained the
      CE mark and FDA approval for some devices. Studies have shown that these devices have a high
      safety profile and are effective (1-5). However, MIGS devices are only recently available in
      Asia, and data on their clinical outcomes in Asian patients are limited.

      -  Data will be collected for 5 years after surgery, and the data collected will be the
           routine examination findings and investigations before and after surgery (as part of
           standard medical treatment)

        -  Visual acuity testing, refraction, humphrey perimetry, heidelberg retinal tomography,
           anterior segment optical coherence tomography, pre-operative endothelial cell count,
           corneal pachymetry, intraocular pressure measurement, number of glaucoma medications

        -  A log will be used to keep track of subject's wishes on the return for incidental
           findings (IF) according to subject's choice during the signing of consent form (however,
           we do not anticipate any incidental findings related to the study as this is an
           observational and non-interventional study).

        -  In case of return incidental finding for subject who consented, PI will inform the
           research subject, or his legally authorised representatives, information and feedback on
           IFs.

        -  PI with sufficient time for explanation and for the research subject to ask questions.

        -  Sufficient information will be provided to the research subject or his legally
           authorised representative so that he can make an informed decision as to whether to
           return to the Institution for medical consultation, seek an opinion elsewhere, or to
           have no follow-up action with regards to the IF.

      Sample size and power calculations are not applicable as this observational study involves
      Medical Records Review and is not an interventional study.The recruitment target of 500 is
      based on the upper limit of the estimated number of patients who will undergo micro-invasive
      glaucoma surgical device implantation during the study period, though it is likely to be an
      overestimation. Pre-operative intraocular pressure and number of glaucoma medications will be
      compared with post-operative intraocular pressure and number of glaucoma medications at one
      year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years and 5 years after surgery, using the paired t-test.
      Statistical significance is set at p&lt;0.05

      All activities involving the patient will be performed as part of the routine diagnostic or
      standard medical treatment as part of the subject's standard care. This is an observational
      study and no activities outside standard care will be performed as part of this study.The
      activities not involving the patient includes screening, data collection, data analysis.
