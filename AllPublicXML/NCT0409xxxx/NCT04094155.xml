  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A subarachnoid hemorrhage occurs in about 10 out of 100,000 people each year. This bleeding
      leads to irritation and constriction of blood vessels in the brain (vasospasm) in two out of
      three people affected within four to 21 days and thus to reduced blood flow. This can lead to
      a stroke and serious damage. In order to be able to diagnose and treat a constriction of the
      blood vessels at an early stage, there are various examination methods which, however, have
      various disadvantages such as radiation exposure of the patient, low sensitivity or high
      effort. Therefore, the prediction and timely therapy of vascular constrictions is currently
      only successful in a few cases before the reduced blood flow has already led to irreversible
      damage.

      The aim of this study is to investigate whether the so-called retinal vascular analysis can
      be used in addition to previous standard examinations for the early detection of diseases of
      the cerebral blood circulation. This method has few side effects and has been successfully
      used for 50 years to examine the blood circulation in the eye.
