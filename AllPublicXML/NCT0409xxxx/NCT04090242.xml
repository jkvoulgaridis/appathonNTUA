  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label, parallel-group, randomized controlled study in subjects
      with type 2 diabetes using multiple daily injection (MDI) insulin therapy. Subjects will be
      randomized to either receive the DC App and BD Nano 2nd Gen pen needles (intervention) or
      continue their standard of care using their current pen needle and diabetes management
      (control). The study will consist of four visits and two scheduled phone calls across a total
      of 10 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At Visit 1 (Day -14) site staff will screen and enroll qualified subjects, provide a BGM
      (Accu-Chek Guide) and attach a blinded flash glucose sensor (Libre Freestyle) to the back of
      the arm. Subjects will complete any applicable baseline Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO)
      questionnaires and be sent home with no changes to their current therapy. While at home
      Subjects will be asked to test blood glucoses using the provided BGM and continue their usual
      insulin dosing before returning to clinic for Visit 2. Visit 2 will consist of randomization
      (Interventional Group or Control Group). The control group will be continued on their current
      pen needle and receive standard visit education as needed. The intervention group will be
      trained on the use of the DC App and be switched to BD Nano 2nd Gen pen needle. During weeks
      3 through 8, subjects in both groups will continue their usual insulin routine, with the
      control group adhering to their usual practice of managing their diabetes and the
      intervention group utilizing the DC app for relevant educational content and tips plus using
      the BD Nano 2nd Gen for all insulin injections. During Visit 3 subjects will get a 2nd fGM
      sensor placed and be instructed to continue their insulin routine for the final 2 weeks.
      Visit 4 is the last visit where subjects will have their fGM removed, return the BGM,
      complete applicable PRO surveys, an injection technique questionnaire and be discharged.

A mean item score of ≥2 is considered moderate distress or greater. The emotion burden subscale score is calculated by averaging 5 items. A mean item score &gt;2 indicates moderate distress or greater. The physician distress subscale score is calculated by averaging 4 items. A mean item score &gt;2 indicates moderate distress or greater. The regimen distress subscale score is calculated by averaging 5 items. A mean item score &gt;2 indicates moderate distress or greater. The interpersonal distress subscale score is calculated by averaging 3 items. A mean item score of ≥2 indicates moderate distress or greater.</description>

The IDSRQ has seven sub-scales (satisfaction, interference of treatment with daily activities, diabetes-related worries, clinical efficacy, psychological well-being, social burden, and treatment preference). Each sub-scale is calculated as a mean of their corresponding items with scores ranging from 0-100. Higher scores represent higher levels of satisfaction, perceived clinical efficacy, and psychological well-being, interference with daily activities, diabetes-related worries, and social burden.</description>

Items 1-10 are scored as follows: 1= none of the time, 2 = some of the time, 3 = most of the time, and 4 = all of the time. Item 11 is reversed scored. The ARMS-D total is a sum of all items for a possible score ranging from 11-44. The ARMS-D refill sub-scale is a sum of 4 items for a possible score ranging from 4-16. The ARMS-D medication taking sub-scale is a sum of 7 items for a possible score ranging from 7-28. Lower scores indicate better adherence.</description>
