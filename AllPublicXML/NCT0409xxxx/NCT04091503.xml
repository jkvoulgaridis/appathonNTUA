  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to determine the safety, tolerability, and the maximum
      tolerated dose intranasal administration of temozolomide (TMZ) as a single agent in Treatment
      on the patients with GBM.

      Intranasal administration is a new method of treating brain tumours for the direct
      administration of drugs, inhibitors or viruses, with minimal involvement of the BBB. The
      investigators know the orally prescribed standard chemotherapy temozolomide (TMZ) is widely
      used to treat glioma tumours.

      Received evidence of safety and efficacy in a full cycle of preclinical trials (on GLP
      Standart) and tests of calculated doses of intranasal administration of TMZ in healthy
      volunteers.

      Intranasal administration of temozolomide is considered as GBM therapy, which provides direct
      access to a therapeutic dose of the drug into the brain (to the neoplastic process) with low
      toxicity

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are trying to evaluate a clinically potentially effective intranasal way of
      delivering TMZ to the brain, taking into account the anatomical structure of os ethmoidal.

      The most important factor in the effectiveness of the drug is the achievement of an adequate
      amount of the active agent in its unbound state with albumin on the blood of a patient and
      the exposure time to the tumour process. Failure to comply with this requirement
      (difficulties in overcoming the BBB) was identified as the main obstacle to the successful
      treatment of all types of brain tumours. Translation to improved clinical outcomes in a
      patient with GBM has not yet been realized. The investigators will use modified temozolomide
      (without changing the chemical formula) to exclude as much as possible Anosmia, Hyposmia and
      other violation of the identification of odours with participants.

    <description>Intranasally Modified Temozolomide is administered to patients at a dose of 75/150/200 mg / M2 for five days continuously. After the 5-day course, patients do not take treatment for two days, and they will be examined on an outpatient basis (blood tests, kidney and liver tests, visually mucous membranes of the mouth, nasal cavity, olfactory rapid tests, including the University of Pennsylvania test, etc.).
After 30 days after the first intranasal administration of Modified Temozolomide (IM-TMZ), all patients undergo an MRI of the brain with perfusion and ultrasound of the abdominal cavity as an outpatient, after which the results are evaluated</description>
