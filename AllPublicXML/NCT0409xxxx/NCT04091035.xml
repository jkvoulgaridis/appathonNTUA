    <textblock>
      By using national databases in Sweden the aim of the present project is to:

        1. Investigate if the incidence of our most common diseases, such as fracture and
           cardiovascular disease, has changed from 1970-2017

        2. To investigate whether the risk of death for our most common diseases have changed from
           1970-2017.

        3. To investigate the risk of a new episode after suffering from our most common diseases
           from 1970-2017

        4. To investigate the risk factors for our most common diseases, and whether these have
           changed from 1970.

        5. To investigate how severe disease or death affects the health of a close relative.
