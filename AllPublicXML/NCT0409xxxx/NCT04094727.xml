  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, acceptability, and
      feasibility of targeted delivery of a package of malaria interventions for improving
      effective coverage and reducing Plasmodium falciparum malaria transmission among malaria
      high-risk populations in Northern Namibia. Previous research identified cattle herders and
      agricultural workers as populations at higher risk of infection. The investigators
      hypothesize that targeted delivery of interventions will lead improve coverage in these
      groups and lead to a reduction in P. falciparum transmission.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is the second phase of work in Zambezi and Ohangwena Regions, Namibia, building
      off a formative phase of work that characterized the risk behaviors migratory patterns,
      health-seeking behaviors, intervention strategies and social networks of agricultural workers
      and cattle herders, who are previously identified malaria high-risk populations (HRPs). This
      phase of the study now aims to determine the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness,
      acceptability, and feasibility of targeted delivery of a package of malaria interventions for
      improving effective coverage and reducing Plasmodium falciparum malaria transmission in these
      regions among these populations.

      The study will specifically assess the coverage and impact of interventions delivered at
      worksites to HRPs, including presumptive treatment administered alongside vector control
      interventions (indoor residual spraying [IRS], long-lasting insecticidal nets [LLINs], and
      topical repellents). The effectiveness of these interventions will be compared against areas
      with no study interventions (standard of care) over the course of implementation (November
      2019 - May 2020). Primary outcomes will include the coverage of each intervention at
      worksites over the study period and PCR-based P. falciparum prevalence measured at endline.
      Following a baseline cross-sectional survey in November/December 2019, the interventions will
      consist of 2 rounds of presumptive treatment spaced at least one month apart between January
      and March, and delivery of vector control interventions at worksites and key access points
      with support from employers, with the primary evaluation to be conducted through an endline
      cross-sectional survey in April/May 2020. Secondary outcomes around effectiveness will be
      assessed through incident case data providing measures of incidence in HRP and non-HRP
      populations, odds of infection associated with each intervention in cases compared to
      controls and entomological data collection. In addition, operational and feasibility outcomes
      will be assessed through qualitative data collection, population size estimation of HRP
      groups and a global positioning system (GPS) logger study.

    <description>For all eligible HRPs in intervention areas, after obtaining informed consent, presumptive treatment for malaria will be carried out using artemether-lumefantrine (AL) at two time points.
Enhanced vector control activities will include: (1) a mop up indoor residual spraying (IRS) campaign and (2) distribution of long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs) and/or vector control packs with topical repellent.
The intervention arm will also receive the standard of care in Namibia.</description>

    <description>All eligible HRPs will be presumptively treated with artemether-lumefantrine (AL) at two timepoints, separated by at least one month. All individuals who have provided informed consent, meet eligibility criteria, are not pregnant or breastfeeding, and who do not have symptoms associated with severe malaria or another severe illness, will be offered an age-appropriate course of AL (age-specific blister packages). AL is currently the first line drug used for uncomplicated malaria in Namibia, and has been used previously in northern Namibia for focal mass drug administration and has no severe adverse effects and is well-tolerated, with high adherence and acceptability in this context. AL requires two daily doses for three consecutive days, for a total of six doses. The first antimalarial dose will be delivered by directly observed therapy (DOT) and subsequent doses will be left with the subject, with instructions to self-administer them.</description>

    <description>The mop up indoor residual spraying (IRS) campaign will be targeted to farms and cattle posts/kraals in intervention areas in December 2019 to fill gaps from the routine spray campaign (September to November 2019) and utilize the same insecticides and protocols as the national campaign. The team will spray each unsprayed structure with the recommended solution of dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane (DDT) for traditional structures and/or Actellic for modern structures, tarps and tents.
Alternative vector control interventions, including LLINs (long-lasting insecticide treated bed nets), sprayed tents/tarps and topical repellents will be distributed to eligible HRPs between November and January 2020 during one round.</description>
