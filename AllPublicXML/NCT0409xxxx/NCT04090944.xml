  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Proper position of a laryngeal mask airway (LMA) requires confirmation to ensure the
      adequacy of laryngeal seal and pulmonary ventilation. This confirmation may help in
      prevention of the peri-operative airway complication and ventilation events associated with
      LMA placement
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is common practice to inflate the cuff of LMA with the maximum recommended volume (size 3,
      20 ml; size 4, 30 ml; size 5, 40 ml), as illustrated in several studies , but it may become
      more rigid which may cause displacement of the LMA and decreases the airway sealing of LMA,
      more pressure on pharyngeal mucosa which might cause severe mucosal ischemia leading to post-
      operative sore throat, dysphagia or hoarseness.

      Ultrasonography can reliably confirm correct placement of supraglottic devices like laryngeal
      mask airway (LMA) and rules out causes of inadequate ventilation , also it was found to be a
      sensitive in detecting rotational malposition of LMA in children.

      the replacement of air with saline in LMA cuffs enable detection of cuffs in the airway
      allowing visualization of the surrounding structures and tissues as the ultrasound beam can
      be transmitted through the fluid—filled cuffs without being reflected from air mucosal
      interface.

      the adequacy of LMA position will be confirmed by a fiberoptic laryngoscope (FOL)

    <description>The LMA LarySeal Multiple will be inserted using the blind technique which involves holding the LMA like a pen guided into the pharynx with the index finger of the operator at the junction of the tube and the bowl, with the operator at the head of the patient and the LMA facing caudally.
The position of LMA will be assessed by another anesthetist (blinded assessor) using the fiberoptic laryngoscope (KARL STORZ 11301BN1, Germany) per the grading devised by Aoyama et al.</description>
