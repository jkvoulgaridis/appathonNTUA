  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will be included 60 women with FPHL. The diagnosis of FPHL will be established by
      clinical (Ludwig classification) and trichoscopic evaluation of frontal and occipital regions
      of the scalp.

      Enrolled women will be randomly assigned into 3 treatment groups: group A will apply topical
      minoxidil 5% in 90% ethanol and 5% propylene glycol, group B will apply topical minoxidil 5%
      in pure ethanol alone and group C will apply pure ethanol (placebo) twice daily.

      The treatment will be continued for six months with regular visits at 3 months intervals.

      The medications will be provided in bottles which were identical in shape and color, and were
      coded by a third party.

      Both patients and investigator will be blinded to the medication. Disclosure of the codes
      will be done, by a third party, at the end of the study.

    <measure>Ludwig scale grading system</measure>
    <time_frame>0-6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The 3 grades will be defined. Grade 1, (Thinning of hair is seen mainly over the anterior part of the crown with minimal widening of the parting width). Grade 2, (Thinning of the crown becomes more evident because of an increase in the number of thin and short hairs). Grade 3, (The crown becomes almost total bald, but the frontal hair line is still maintained).</description>
