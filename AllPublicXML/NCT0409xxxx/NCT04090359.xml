  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to the compare clinical outcomes of patients undergoing a revision
      total hip arthroplasty (THA) with the use of a dual mobility bearing versus a single bearing
      design with the use of a large femoral head (36mm or 40mm). We hypothesize the use of
      dual-mobility components in revision THA will be associated with a lower dislocation rate in
      the first year following surgery.

    <description>If patients are randomized to the conventional, single bearing cohort, surgeons will use their preferred implant design at their discretion using a 36 or 40mm head, depending on the diameter of the cup and manufacturer specifications. All surgeries will be performed via the posterior approach, per the participating surgeon's usual standard. Patients will be on postoperative hip precautions for 6 weeks, per departmental protocol. No braces will be utilized.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Any patient older than 18 years of age scheduled for a revision THA, including
             revision of both components, conversion of a hip resurfacing to THA, conversion of a
             hemiarthroplasty to THA, and revision of single components which allow implantation of
             dual-mobility bearings. In addition, patients undergoing reimplantation of a total hip
             arthroplasty following a two-stage revision for periprosthetic infection will also be
             included. Only patients with an acetabular shell diameter capable of accommodating at
             least a 36mm femoral head will be included.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Less than 18 years of age, primary THA,

          -  conversion of non-arthroplasty femoral neck fracture fixation to THA,

          -  patients unwilling to participate.

          -  patients where the surgeon makes the intraoperative decision to use a constrained
             liner will be excluded.
