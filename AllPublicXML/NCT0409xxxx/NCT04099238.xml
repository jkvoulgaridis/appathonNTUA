  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will characterize patients with ischemic stroke, a condition which occurs when a
      vessel supplying blood to the brain is obstructed, and a subpopulation of patients with
      irregular and often rapid heart rate (atrial fibrillation) in a UK general population using
      The Health Improvement Network (THIN) database.

      The main aim of the study is to estimate in how many patients atrial fibrillation was
      diagnosed at the moment of stroke and to describe whether these patients received OAC at the
      time of the stroke. In addition, researchers want to learn about the relative risk of
      ischemic stroke when such patients did not continue OAC treatment.

      The primary objectives of the study are to determine the incidence of ischemic stroke in
      patients registered in the British primary care THIN database and to investigate the OAC
      exposure, OAC treatment patterns and the relative risk of having an ischemic stroke in
      relation to OAC treatment for a subgroup of patients, who were diagnosed with non-valvular
      atrial fibrillation (NVAF) prior to ischemic stroke.

      Secondary objectives are to determine the number of patients having NVAF diagnosed at the
      time of ischemic stroke and within 1 and 12 months after ischemic stroke; to describe
      cardiovascular risk factors for ischemic stroke and pharmacological treatments before and 12
      months after ischemic stroke, and to estimate the case-fatality at 1 and 12 months after the
      occurrence of ischemic stroke.
