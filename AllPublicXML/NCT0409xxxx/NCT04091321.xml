    <textblock>
      This study uses a single questionnaire to evaluate two separate primary outcomes:

        1. To identify association between chronic headache in women who have given birth to
           children as compared to a control group of women who have raised children but have not
           given birth to them

        2. To identify association between chronic back pain in women who have given birth to
           children as compared to a control group of women who have raised children but have not
           given birth to them

      Chronic headache and back pain have an excess prevalence in women as compared to men. This
      study uses a single survey that uses logic to assess for association between childbirth and
      chronic headache and between childbirth and chronic back pain using screening questions. The
      questions are, &quot;Do you suffer from chronic headaches&quot; and &quot;Do you suffer from chronic back
      pain&quot;. Depending on the answer to the screening question, the subject will be given further
      questions only related to the syndrome that they endorsed.

      Arm 1) There is an association between chronic headache and childbirth over and above raising
      children. Secondary outcomes are temporal association between onset or worsening of headache
      and childbirth, association between migraine headache and childbirth, association between
      chronic headache and anesthetic complications.

      Arm 2) There is an association between chronic back pain and childbirth over and above
      raising children. Secondary outcomes are temporal association between onset or worsening of
      back pain and childbirth, association between chronic headache and anesthesia.
