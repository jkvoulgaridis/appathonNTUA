  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A number of studies have reported the presence of polyphenolic compounds in artichokes, being
      the most abundant the caffeoylquinic acids (CQAs), which are esters between quinic acid and
      the hydroxycinnamate caffeic acid. The fate of artichoke polyphenols in humans after
      ingestion is currently unknown. The acute study will provide novel information on the
      bioavailability and metabolism of artichoke polyphenols, which will give important insights
      to understand the potential health benefits of artichoke consumption.

      Health men and women participants (n=8) aged between 18 to 40 years old will be recruited.
      Participants will consume a normal ration of artichokes once. The participants will provide
      the investigators with urine and blood samples for polyphenol analysis at baseline and at
      different time points until 24 hours.
