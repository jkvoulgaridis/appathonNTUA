  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The PRESTIGIO Registry is an Observational, prospective, multicentre study that includes
      patients, regularly followed by Italian Infectious Disease Centres, with HIV-1 infection and
      documented resistance to the 4 classes of antiretroviral drugs: nucleoside reverse
      transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI),
      protease inhibitors (PI), and integrase inhibitors (INSTI).

      Main objective of this register is to evaluate in the study population:

        -  the long-term effectiveness of different antiretroviral regimes;

        -  evolution of the genotype and phenotypic susceptibility of antiretroviral drugs used in
           patients with virological failure;

        -  mortality;

        -  incidence of opportunistic AIDS-related infections and chronic conditions (comorbidity);

        -  determinants of clinical outcomes including virological/immunological/inflammatory
           markers.

        -  antiretroviral therapy (ART) compliance and health assessments;

        -  drug-economy indications related to the clinical management of this complex
           sub-population.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The PRESTIGIO Register consists of a systematic and continuous collection of data on
      clinical, laboratory and treatment characteristics of patients with documented resistance to
      the 4 classes of antiretroviral drugs that meet the defined inclusion and exclusion criteria.

      All the clinical centres of Infectious Diseases of the different Italian regions can
      participate in the implementation of the Registry. Based on an analysis conducted on data
      collected in an AIFA register, established for the purpose of monitoring the use of
      dolutegravir (DTG) 50 mg Bis in Die (BID) and containing about 200 patients with the criteria
      specified in this protocol, the size currently conceivable for this register in Italy is
      about 300 patients.

      The collection of clinical information and biological samples will begin once the Ethics
      Committee of the participating centers has approved the participation in the registry and
      will continue for at least three years.

    <description>to evaluate the characteristics of the study population, will be carry out specific observational studies with the following collected data:
demographic characteristics
clinical characteristics (HIV transmission mode, pre-ART viral load, CD4+ nadir, co-infection with hepatitis B and C viruses and previous treatments, previous AIDS events);
lifestyle factors
comorbidity (cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, liver disease, fractures and osteoporosis, cognitive dysfunction, COPD, sexually transmitted diseases);
antiretroviral and concomitant drugs;
adherence to antiretroviral therapy;
Laboratory parameters: CD4, CD8, HIV-RNA, lipids, glucose, liver and kidney parameters;
resistance tests for INSTI, NRTI, NNRTI, PI;
the historical genotypes (resistance and viral tropism)
any hospitalizations;

      At enrolment, plasma and cell samples of peripheral blood mononuclear cells(PBMCs) are
      collected for subsequent virological and immunological investigations. The samples to be
      collected for each patient are: 6 plasma aliquots (1.5-2.0 ml/each) and 6 PBMC aliquots (3-5
      million/each).

      Sample collection should be repeated at the end of each subsequent year of follow-up.

      The collected biological samples are sent to the biobank of the coordinating centre and
      stored in a biological bank with ISO 9001:2000 quality certification (Biorep srl,
      http://www.biorep.it/).

        The Italian PRESTIGIO register will include patients who are regularly monitored according
        to the principles of good clinical practice in the Italian Infectious Diseases Centres of
        all Italian regions.

        Patients will be included in the registry once informed consent has been obtained (Annex 2)
        signed to allow for the recording and analysis of clinical/laboratory data and for the
        collection of biological samples, subject to the guarantee of anonymity and independence of
        therapeutic choices and clinical management, which will be the sole responsibility of the
        treating physician. The consent collected must be entered in the Register.
