  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glioma is the most common primary malignant brain tumour in adults and has an extremely poor
      prognosis. The aim of this study is to quantify the degree of early step fatty acid oxidation
      in gliomas as imaged by 18F-FPIA PET/MRI in 10 evaluable patients.

      The Investigators hypothesise that FPIA uptake will be higher in high-grade gliomas compared
      to lower grade gliomas, in keeping with a higher propensity of high grade tumours to generate
      ATP and NADPH via fatty acid oxidation under bioenergetic stress.

      10 evaluable participants with suspected cerebral glioma on previous MRI who are due to
      undergo surgical resection or biopsy will be enrolled into the study. The patients invited to
      participate in the study will provide full consent, but will only undergo 18F-FPIA PET/MRI
      imaging once they have satisfied the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Once these have been
      satisfied, eligible participants will proceed to 18F-FPIA PET/MRI.

      On the day of imaging the participants will undergo a blood test to measure plasma
      concentrations of carnitine. During the scan, a single dose of 18F-FPIA (maximum, 370 MBq) IV
      will be administered to the participant followed by a whole brain dynamic PET/MRI scan over
      66 minutes. During the MRI sequences, the participant will receive an additional IV bolus of
      Gadolinium contrast medium administered through a peripheral venous cannula. Arterial blood
      sampling through a peripheral arterial line will be performed to determine the concentration
      of radiotracer within arterial plasma. All the participants that are enrolled into the study
      will undergo biopsy or surgical resection as part of their routine clinical care, from which
      their tumour grade will be confirmed; the Investigators will obtain tissue from these
      procedures to perform metabolomics, genomics and proteomics. Surgery or biopsy will be
      performed typically within 2 weeks but no later than 3 months.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients with radiological evidence of suspected cerebral glioma due for surgery or biopsy
        and with the following characteristics will be recruited:

          -  Age â‰¥18

          -  Tumour size at least 2 cm.

          -  WHO performance status 0 - 2.

          -  If female, the subject is either post-menopausal (at least 1 year), or surgically
             sterilized (has had a documented bilateral oophorectomy and/or documented hysterectomy
             for at least 2 years,), or if of childbearing potential, must have a negative urine
             beta human chorionic gonadotropin pregnancy test done at initial screening and on the
             day of tracer administration. The result of the pregnancy test must be known before
             administration of 18F-FPIA injection.

          -  The subject is able and willing to comply with study procedures, and signed and dated
             informed consent is obtained.

          -  The subject has a satisfactory medical history as judged by the investigator with no
             significant co-morbidities, physical examination, and vital signs findings during the
             screening period (from 21 days before administration).

          -  The subject's clinical and laboratory tests are within normal limits and/or considered
             clinically insignificant.

        Exclusion

          -  The subject has received any chemotherapy, immunotherapy, biologic therapy or
             investigational therapy within 14 days or five half-lives of a drug (whichever is
             longer) prior to the first dose of 18F-FPIA injection. The subject is pregnant or
             lactating.

          -  The subject is diabetic or has uncontrolled blood glucose or blood lipid levels
             (clinical decision by investigator), any other chronic illness that will preclude
             brief discontinuation of medication, or musculoskeletal condition that would not allow
             comfortable performance of a 66-minute study.

          -  The subject has received another investigational radioactive tracer within 1 month
             before administration of 18F-FPIA injection.

          -  Anticoagulation therapy, prolonged prothrombin time, abnormal Allen's test.

          -  Unsatisfactory renal function (eGFR&lt;60)
