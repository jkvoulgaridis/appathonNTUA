  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patellofemoral pain (PFP) is a chronic condition characterized by retro- or peri-patellar
      pain during everyday activities that load the patellofemoral joint, such as sitting, jumping,
      or walking. PFP is one of the most common knee conditions affecting the general population,
      affects approximately 1 out of 4 school aged youth and is more common in females. The pain
      associated with PFP adversely affects daily activities, reduces physical activity, and may
      contribute to patellofemoral osteoarthritis. Participants with PFP exhibit aberrant
      biomechanics during functional movement which may be, in part, due to altered brain activity
      in response to movement-associated pain. Participants with knee injuries do exhibit depressed
      sensorimotor brain activity in response to patella displacement relative to healthy controls,
      but these findings are limited as patella displacement is dissimilar to functional movement
      (e.g., flexing the knee and hip to get out of a chair). The investigators have successfully
      developed paradigms to assess knee motor control during functional movement (see methods
      below) using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in healthy participants with no
      knee pain. The investigators aim to replicate these paradigms in those with PFP to assess
      this populations' neurophysiologic response to knee movement. Results from this investigation
      will assist in refining subsequent training and prevention programs to promote more adaptive
      neuroplasticity.

      All MRI scanning will be performed on 3 Tesla Philips MRI scanners (3T Achieva in S-Building
      and 3T Ingenia in T-Building) located in Imaging Research Center (IRC) in the Cincinnati
      Children's Hospital Research Foundation (CCHRF). Sedation will not be used for any of the
      test visits. The entire MRI protocol will include high resolution T1-weighted 3D images, a 61
      direction diffusion tensor imaging sequence, resting state fMRI, and task-based fMRI. The
      fMRI tasks will be focused on motor function, participants will be asked to lower extremity
      movements such as hip and knee flexion and extension. Also, for 15 minutes, the researcher
      will place one hand above the participants' knee and apply intermittent pressure to their
      quadriceps and medial aspect of the patella. VAS scales will be administered after every fMRI
      task to assess subjective perceptions of pain. The MR scan will be completed in 75 minutes or
      less. Peripheral pulse oximetry and respiration waveforms will be collected for data analysis
      in order to minimize the potential confounding effect from the physiological changes. A
      practice session of the fMRI paradigms will be completed just prior to scanning to allow the
      participant to ask any questions and be familiar with the protocol.

      The hardware and software are not FDA cleared, but also not FDA regulated as they are not
      medical devices. According to the FDA, a medical device is intended to diagnosis and or treat
      diseases while affecting the structure or function of any part of the body
      (https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/Overview/ClassifyYourDevice/u
      cm051512.htm). This is not the case for our study as participants will already be diagnosed
      with PFP by a medical professional and the protocol will not alter any function or structure
      of the human body. the leg press task is simply used to facilitate naturally occurring
      movement of the leg and hip and not intended to treat patellofemoral pain. This method is
      simply to further understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying natural movement in this
      population.

A 13-item questionnaire aimed at the assessment of fear of movement/re-injury. Each item is provided with a 4-points Likert scale with scoring alternatives ranging from &quot;strongly disagree&quot; [0] to &quot;strongly agree&quot; [4] (12). This gives a possible total raw score range from 0 to 52.</description>

    <description>We aim to recruit approximately 30 healthy female volunteers with PFP. Only females will be recruited for this study as they are 2 to 10 times more likely to develop PFP than males. Females participants with PFP (age 7-40 years old) will be recruited from local school districts local sports clubs and teams, local colleges, adult sport leagues, and professional sports teams, through our well established network with area coaches and athletic trainers</description>
