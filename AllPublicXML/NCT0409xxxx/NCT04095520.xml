  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-carious cervical lesions are defined as loss of pathological material not associated with
      caries in the enamel-cement junction of the tooth. The etiology of these lesions has been
      defined as brush abrasion, acid-induced erosion and abstraction due to microstructure losses
      due to stress concentration in a particular region of the tooth. These lesions should be
      restored using minimally invasive techniques. The necessity of restorative treatment is
      directly related to the size of the lesion, sensitivity and aesthetic requirements. However,
      restorative procedures are often challenging because the cavity preparation does not provide
      adequate retention, and often the cervical end margin is positioned under the gingiva. This
      leads to contamination of the operation site with blood, saliva and gingival fluid.

      Several restorative options have been proposed for the treatment of cervical caries-free
      lesions. However, due to their high aesthetic properties, improved adhesive capacity and
      mechanical properties, composites have been accepted as the most suitable choice. Clinical
      studies have demonstrated that marginal adaptation, marginal discoloration, and roughening
      methods for retention are the most important factors in the clinical performances of
      composite restorations in cervical lesions. Therefore, injectable composites with wettability
      and better adaptability to cavity margins have been introduced. However, the low filler
      contents of fluid composites and their weak mechanical properties compared to conventional
      composites have led researchers to doubt their use in caries-free cervical lesions. As a
      result of the developed material technology, injectable composites with high filler which
      have reduced polymerization shrinkage have been developed with simplified filler procedure.
      However, investigators have not encountered any studies investigating which etching technique
      this material will exhibit better clinical performance and comparing it with traditional
      pasty composites. The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical performance of
      traditional paste type and injectable composites which will be made by using two different
      etching techniques.
