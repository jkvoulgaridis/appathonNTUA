  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial will evaluate the use of one versus two DNA vaccines, delivered concurrently with
      PD-1 blockade using pembrolizumab followed by treatment with pembrolizumab alone, and
      delivered over a prolonged period of time (for a maximum of 2 years (32 cycles) or until
      radiographic progression) on the treatment of castrate-resistant, metastatic prostate cancer.
      The hypothesis to be tested is that delivering two vaccines with PD-1 blockade will elicit a
      greater frequency and magnitude of tumor-directed CD8+ T cells, and thereby increase the
      percentage of patients experiencing objective anti-tumor effect as measured by PSA declines
      and/or objective radiographic responses. Participants must be 18 years of age or older and
      can expect to be on treatment for 2 years (32 cycles) and on study for up to 4 years
      (including 2 years of follow up via phone).

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The expected 6-months PFS rate in Arm 1 (pTVG-HP DNA vaccine and Pembrolizumab) in this participant population is 20-30%. It is hypothesized that adding pTVG-AR DNA vaccine (Arm 2) will increase the 6-months PFS rate to at least 55%.
The 6-month PFS rate will be calculated for each study arm along with the corresponding two-sided 95% confidence interval which will be constructed using the Wilson score method. Participants who withdraw from the study without a progression or death event before the 6-month assessment will be excluded from this analysis.

          -  Metastatic disease as evidenced by the presence of soft tissue and/or bone metastases
             on imaging studies (CT of abdomen/pelvis, bone scintigraphy)

          -  Castrate-resistant disease, defined as follows:

               -  All participants must have received (and be receiving) standard of care androgen
                  deprivation treatment (surgical castration versus GnRH analogue or antagonist

                  antagonist must continue this treatment throughout the time on this study.

               -  Participants may or may not have been treated previously with a nonsteroidal

                  be off use of anti-androgen for at least 4 weeks (for flutamide, apalutamide, or
                  enzalutamide) or 6 weeks (for bicalutamide or nilutamide) prior to registration.
                  Moreover, participants who demonstrate an anti-androgen withdrawal response,
                  defined as a &gt; 25% decline in PSA within 4-6 week of stopping a nonsteroidal
                  antiandrogen, are not eligible until the PSA rises above the nadir observed after

             recurrence-free for &gt; 3 years are eligible.

          -  Participants with known brain metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis

          -  Participants who have received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose

             rabies, Bacillus Calmette - Guérin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza
             vaccines for injection are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however,

             the past 2 years (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or
             immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic
             corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is
             not considered a form of systemic treatment.

          -  Any other medical intervention or condition, which, in the opinion of the PI or

             treatment period.

          -  Any known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
