  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, single arm study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of anti-PD-1 antibody
      in combination with pegaspargase in treatment of newly diagnosed advanced stage NK/T-cell
      lymphoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Extranodal natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphoma (ENKTL), nasal type, is a distinct and
      heterogeneous histopathologic subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), accounting for 5%~10%.
      The frequency of ENKTL among NHL patients is significantly higher in Asia than in Western
      countries, with poor prognosis. L-asparaginase-based chemotherapy has improved the survival
      for these patients with advanced stage. However, there is no standard of care for those
      patients with advanced stage. Anti-PD-1 antibody has been proven its efficacy in relapsed or
      refractory NK/T cell lymphoma. This open-label, single arm study will evaluate the efficacy
      and safety of PD-1 antibody in combination with pegaspargase in treatment of newly diagnosed
      advanced stage NK/T-cell lymphoma.

    <description>An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events.</description>
