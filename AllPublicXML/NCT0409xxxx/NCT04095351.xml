  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite a number of prospective studies already initiated in the past years, the current
      epidemiology and course of interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pulmonary hypertension (PH) in
      patients with connective tissue disease (CTD) is still not well defined, particularly
      regarding its prevalence, incidence and the management of a broad spectrum of disease
      presentations.

      Major challenges include the identification of patients with progressive disease, the
      appropriate time point of therapeutic intervention and the underlying driver of disease
      (inflammatory or pro-fibrotic stimulus or both?).

      To address these issues in Western Austria, a progressive registry of patients with CTD
      exploring routine clinical and pathophysiological characteristics of ILD and PH will be
      conducted. This multidisciplinary, prospective and observational registry aims to collect
      comprehensive clinical data on incidence, prevalence and course of disease regarding all PH
      and ILD presentations in a real-world setting.

      Specifically, this registry will collect demographic data, disease-related clinical data,
      routine laboratory values (including antibody-profile and iron status), diagnostic
      procedures, significant comorbidities, therapeutic managements (e.g. thoracic ultrasound,
      HRCT), and disease outcomes over 10 years.

      In addition, blood biobank samples for translational research will be collected in a subgroup
      of patients with systemic sclerosis over serial time points to study the systemic
      inflammatory and profibrotic phenotype of patients. In summary, this registry will monitor
      the disease course of pulmonary manifestations of patients with CTD and may be
      hypothesis-generating and provide new insights in underlying inflammatory/pro-fibrotic
      patterns.

      From each patient with proven systemic sclerosis one serum vial of 10 ml and 2 EDTA vials à
      10 ml will be taken. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells are isolated from the EDTA blood
      samples, an stored at -80°C.The serum samples will be centrifuged and the resulting serum is
      collected in cryovials and stored at -80 °C until measurement. Samples and data will be
      stored and archived central according to the new standards of the biobank facility of the
      medical university of Innsbruck.
