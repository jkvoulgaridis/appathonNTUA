  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been estimated that increasing the use of skilled care during childbirth could prevent
      up to 1.5 million maternal and newborn deaths and stillbirths by 2025. Conditional cash
      transfer programs, in which women receive cash payments conditioned on the use of maternal
      health services, are increasingly being used as a mechanism to increase uptake. In this
      study, the investigators randomly assign households to receive varying cash amounts
      conditioned on uptake of recommended pregnancy and delivery care. The investigators crosscut
      this with an intervention in which pregnant women receive information about their risk type.
      This randomized trial will provide new evidence about the potential efficacy of targeting
      cash transfers by pregnancy risk. This study will take place in 288 primary health service
      areas (HSAs) in Nigeria.
