      This study aims to investigate the efficacy of a 7-day genotypic resistance-guided triple
      therapy, compared with empirical concomitant therapy, for first-line eradication of H.
      pylori.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Empiric eradication of H. pylori becomes steadily more challenging because of increasing
      antibiotic resistance. In high-resistance countries where bismuth and/or tetracycline are
      unavailable (eg; Greece), non-bismuth quadruple therapies are currently recommended as
      first-line therapeutic options; however, eradication rates &gt;95% are infrequently achieved and
      even &gt;90% are disputed. Antimicrobial susceptibility-guided therapy is a promising
      alternative in order to maintain high therapeutic efficacy. However, traditional
      culture-based susceptibility testing methods have several shortcomings, including they are
      time-consuming and they do not 100% reflect in vivo eradication. Recent guidelines also
      recommend the use of molecular testing for evaluation of H. pylori antibiotic susceptibility.
      Nevertheless, the efficacy of genotypic resistance-guided treatment of H. pylori has been
      seldom appraised. Therefore, the investigators conducted this prospective randomized
      controlled trial aiming to investigate the efficacy of a 7-day genotypic resistance-guided
      triple therapy, compared with empirical concomitant therapy, for first-line eradication of H.
      pylori.

    <time_frame>At least 6 weeks after treatment completion</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events were investigated by means of a structured clinical interview immediately after the completion of therapy. The subjects were asked to grade the severity of adverse events according to their influence on daily activities, experienced as &quot;mild&quot; (transient and well tolerated), &quot;moderate&quot; (causing discomfort and partially interfering with daily activities), or &quot;severe&quot; (causing considerable interference with daily activities).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Compliance rates</measure>
    <time_frame>At least 6 weeks after treatment completion</time_frame>
    <description>Drug compliance was determined by counting unused medication. For this purpose, any tablet that was not consumed was brought back to the clinic for pill count. Poor compliance was defined as taking less than 80% of the total medication prescribed.</description>

    <description>In the group of genotypic resistance-guided triple therapy, a molecular assay based on DNA-strip technology was used to determine the genotypic resistance of H. Pylori to clarithromycin (23SrRNA mutations) and fluoroquinolones (gyrA mutations) from gastric biopsy specimens. According to 23SrRNA and gyrA mutational analyses, a 7-day tailored triple therapy therapy was given as follows:
Wild-type 23SrRNA: Clarithromycin-based triple therapy comprising esomeprazole 40 mg b.i.d., amoxicillin 1 g b.i.d. and clarithromycin 500 mg b.i.d.
23SrRNA mutated/wild-type gyrA: Levofloxacin-based triple therapy comprising esomeprazole 40 mg b.i.d., amoxicillin 1 g b.i.d. and levofloxacin 500 mg b.i.d.
23SrRNA mutated/gyrA mutated: Rifabutin-based triple therapy comprising esomeprazole 40 mg b.i.d., amoxicillin 1 g t.i.d. and rifabutin 150 mg b.i.d.</description>
