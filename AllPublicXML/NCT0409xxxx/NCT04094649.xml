  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an early feasibility study to evaluate the proof of concept of modulation of glycemia
      by non-invasive ultrasound vagus nerve stimulation. This protocol is exploratory in nature,
      therefore it is not intended to capture statistically valid results or test statistical
      hypotheses. However, statistical analysis of the primary endpoint will be performed to allow
      more critical reflection of the data and to estimate the treatment effect for consider-ation
      in further studies.

  <detailed_description>

      The DECIMA device comprises an array of two focused ultra-sound applicators arranged with
      overlapping foci to deliver acoustic energy to a known focal depth within tissue. The focused
      ultrasound applicators are each comprised of an ultra-sound-emitting piezoelectric element
      coupled to a focusing lens. The array of the DECIMA device is coupled with an ultra-sound
      imaging system to locate the cervical vagus nerve, and a control system to deliver short
      bursts of ultrasound energy that are controlled by the operator in time and intensity.

      The imaging system and the array of applicators are calibrated together, so the power is
      focused at a known location relative to the imaging system screen. Each focused applicator's
      lens is joined to an ultrasound coupling cylinder filled with water. Each coupling cylinder
      is lined with thin plastic film at the skin. The ultrasound output power of the applicators
      is monitored by each applicator's control unit which includes a display of the ultrasound
      intensity.

      To perform ultrasound stimulation, ultrasound gel is placed on the skin over the nerve area
      in the neck. Then the coupling cylinders and imaging transducer are placed against the gel,
      then the DECIMA position is fixed in place by a support arm.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a single-site, double-blind, randomized, prospective, sham-controlled, crossover early feasibility study to determine whether uVNS inhibits postprandial hyperglycemia in humans. Adults with DMT2 will be recruited and randomized to active uVNS or sham uVNS across two sessions according to a 2x2 crossover design.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Randomization will be assigned by the clinical research facility. One of the two experimenters will be blinded. The unblinded experimenter is needed to aim the stimulation to the vagus nerve or sham location. The blinded experimenter will acquire, process, and analyze all data.
Participants will be told that they may or may not feel the stimulation. The uVNS probe will be placed on their neck for each stimulation burst with the unblinded experimenter control-ling whether active or sham uVNS is delivered as determined by the crossover assignment.</masking_description>
