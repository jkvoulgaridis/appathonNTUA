      Phase 1 First-in Human randomized, open-label, active control standard of care study of the
      safety of HBN-1 administered as pharmacologically induced hypothermia as an adjunct to
      standard of care targeted temperature management in adult patients who have experienced
      out-of-hospital-cardiac arrest. HBN-1 will be administered IV as a loading dose infusion
      followed by a 12-hour maintenance infusion.

      Phase 1 First-in Human randomized, open-label, active control standard of care study of the
      safety of HBN-1 administered as pharmacologically induced hypothermia as an adjunct to
      standard of care targeted temperature management in adult patients who have experienced
      out-of-hospital-cardiac arrest.

      HBN-1 will be administered as an IV solution according to a weight-based escalating loading
      dose infusion rate scheme involving three sequential cohorts with a loading dose of HBN 1
      administered over 60 minutes (Cohort A), 45 minutes (Cohort B), or 30 minutes (Cohort C). For
      all cohorts, the loading dose will be followed by a 12-hour maintenance infusion of HBN-1.

      Dosing cohorts will include a minimum of 6 subjects randomized in a 2:1 ratio of HBN-1 plus
      standard of care versus standard of care alone. Individual cohorts may be expanded to up to a
      maximum of 12 subjects . If the cohort is expanded, the additional subjects will receive
      HBN-1 + SOC.

      During the loading dose and maintenance infusion, physical exam, temperature, assessment of
      shivering, ECG, vital signs, clinical laboratory, blood alcohol level, and neurologic status
      will be monitored.

             pulseless electrical activity

          3. Return of spontaneous circulation within 50 minutes of the event

          4. FOUR Motor Score &lt;4

          5. Maximum estimated weight not to exceed 100 kg

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Return of spontaneous circulation &gt;8 hours

          2. Known history of prior cardiac arrest, alcohol, or substance abuse or dependence

          3. Presumed etiology of cardiac arrest is trauma, hemorrhage, or sepsis

          4. Comfort measures only or anticipated withdrawal of life-support within 24 hours

          5. Is within a protected population group (eg, pregnant or breastfeeding or incarcerated
