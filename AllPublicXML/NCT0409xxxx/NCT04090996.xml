  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease affecting the central
      nervous system. It is the leading cause of severe non-traumatic disability in young adults
      (20-40 years). It affects more than 540,000 individuals in Europe and around 2.8 million
      people worldwide. The etiology of MS remains unknown to date, but probably results from a
      genetic predisposition associated with environmental factors (vitamin D deficiency, tobacco,
      vaccines, stress, diet, ...). MS is a neurological disease in which demyelination and axonal
      loss lead to many symptoms such as fatigue, spasticity, decreased sensitivity, muscle
      weakness, balance disorders, oculomotor visuals.

      The Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), which is used to rate functional disorders in MS
      patients, tends to underestimate these neurological disorders, which are often present in the
      early stages of the disease and are an important issue. major in the management and evolution
      of the disease.

      Recently, it has been shown that motor and cognitive disorders appear in the early stages of
      the disease, yet these functions are not systematically evaluated in the early stages of the
      disease. These isolated or associated disorders often lead to real difficulties in realizing
      everyday activities. Since this disease affects young people who still have a professional
      activity, it is important not to underestimate the presence of these functional and cognitive
      disorders.

      It is therefore necessary to seek more precise means of evaluation to detect certain
      neurological disorders.

      Thus, the evaluation of these functions participates in the follow-up of the patient and
      makes it possible to better apprehend the evolution of these disorders in MS.

      The investigators will use the concept of double-task to measure and evaluate these
      functional and cognitive disorders.

      The dual task (DT) , is defined by the simultaneous completion of two tasks, one called
      &quot;primary&quot; and the other called &quot;secondary&quot;, for which the performance changes are measured.
      The dual task paradigms are based on the assumption that two concurrently performed tasks
      interfere if they use identical functional and / or brain subsystems. In the case of a
      paradigm involving walking and another task, the interference is based on the assumption of
      the joint play of attention. The primary task is then the &quot;attentional&quot; task and the
      secondary task is represented by walking. Observed inferences are changes in the performance
      of one or both tasks that are measured by comparing single and dual task performance.

      The assessment of DT's capabilities would improve the early detection of motor disorders in
      MS patients. Early identification of postural instability would make it easier to target care
      and improve patient follow-up. Conducting work on the concept of DT would improve our
      knowledge of this paradigm in MS.

      Finally, a better understanding of double-stained mechanisms in MS could offer training
      programs
