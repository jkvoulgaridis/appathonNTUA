      investigate beneficial effect of an herbal tea prepared from carob pulp and pods (Ceratonia
      siliqua), anise seed (Pimpinella Anisum L), wild thyme, green tea and eucalyptus leaves with
      Manuka honey (natural sweetener) on lipid profile and insulin resistance, CRP (C-reactive
      protein), CBC (complete blood count), liver function test, kidney function tests,
      inflammation and anthropometric indices in adults living in Amman Jordan

      This study will be carried out to examine the effect of herbal tea in recruited subjects in
      an intervention single-group pretest-posttest study for a period of 7 weeks. Subjects will
      consume twice a day for a period of 7 weeks an herbal tea of (carob, anise, wild thyme, and
      eucalyptus leaves) before eating. The total sample (n=30) adults aged (19-57 years) , body
      mass index BMI range (19-35 kg/m2)
