  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thyroid associated ophthalmopathy (TAO) is a common autoimmune disorder. The pathogenesis of
      TAO is unclear, and studies found that T cell, B cell and monocytes, macrophages and mast
      cells are located in the orbital tissue of TAO. Dysthyroid optic neuropathy (DON) is the most
      serious complication of TAO, which can cause blurred vision, color vision and vision function
      damage, and affects the quality of life. Investigation of the therapeutic effect of orbital
      decompression may provide some clues to make the policy at treatment of DON. We explore the
      therapeutic effect of orbital decompression in patients with DON in both eyes.

    <description>Orbital decompression was performed by the same doctor with rich clinical experience. MPT should be implemented in the patients with obvious thyroid disorder before orbital decompression surgery which should only be performed when thyroid function was stabilized. The surgery was performed under general anesthesia. An arcuate incision was made in the skin 2 mm below the lower eyelid margin, and the tissue under the incision were separated to the periorbita and orbital septum. Part of the medial orbital wall, inferior orbital wall and partial tissue of ethmoidal sinus were removed, and an appropriate amount of adipose tissue was excised. MPT was conducted after the surgery, at a dose of 1g methylprednisolone per day through intravenous injection for 3 consecutive days with a total amount of 3g methylprednisolone. After 3 days of intravenous injection of methylprednisolone, prednisone was orally taken by the patients at a dose of 30 mg/day which was gradually reduced.</description>
