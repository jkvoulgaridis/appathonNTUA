    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the acceptance, engagement and outcomes of a digital
      care program for chronic musculoskeletal conditions affecting the shoulder, elbow, hip, knee,
      ankle and spine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SWORD Health has developed a novel digital biofeedback system for home-based physical
      rehabilitation - SWORD Phoenix- which is an FDA-listed class I medical device. The company
      has previously conducted two pilot studies (NCT03047252; NCT03045549) comparing a digital
      rehabilitation program using this device against conventional face-to-face physical therapy.
      These studies have proven the feasibility, safety and effectiveness of this medical device on
      rehabilitation after total knee and hip arthroplasty.

      SWORD Health is now seeking additional validation of its digital programs on chronic MSK
      conditions, to assess the acceptance, engagement and outcomes of these clinical programs.
      This study will also unveil disease-specific human motion patterns that may be used to inform
      the development of new diagnostic and treatment tools.

      Data to be collected on every individual undergoing our programs includes:

        1. data that is sourced from the subject through online assessment forms

        2. data that is sourced from the subject, collected by the physical therapist managing that
           subject (i.e. suggestions for improvement);

        3. data that is generated by the physical therapist through interaction with the web-based
           Portal (i.e. session composition in terms of exercises, sets, repetitions, usage or not
           of external resistance)

        4. data generated by the patient through interaction with the mobile app (i.e. pain and
           fatigue levels, satisfaction)

        5. data that is generated automatically by the medical device (i.e. range of motion,
           compliance)

      Collection and objective analysis of the collected data will allow:

        1. Monitoring of user needs, engagement and satisfaction to guide further improvements;

        2. Analysis of the effectiveness of these digital care programs;

        3. Correlation of results with patient's demographic and clinical profiles;

        4. Compilation of patient cohorts to increase and disseminate knowledge on each disorder,
           its progression and response to physical therapy programs;

        5. Explore the cost-efficiency of these digital programs

        6. Development of novel intelligent tools to assist therapists with patient management.

    <description>Change in condition-specific clinical outcomes over time, measured through the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM).
FAAM is a self-report measure that assesses physical function of individuals with lower leg, foot, and ankle musculoskeletal disorders. Thus instrument included 2 subscales: 1) Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) with 21 items and 2) Sports with 8 items. For each subscale patients are asked to answer each question with a single response that most clearly describes their condition within past week. To calculate the score for either subscale, the total number of points are added, divided by the total number os possible points (ADLs-84; Sports-32) and then multiplied by 100.</description>

    <description>Individuals included will be offered a program based on three pillars: education, cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) and therapeutic exercise.
The therapeutic exercise component will be delivered in the form of exercise sessions to be performed independently by the individual at home using SWORD Phoenix. These programs will have a duration of between 8 and 12 weeks, according to the condition, following pre-defined protocols. These protocols can be adapted to the needs, performance and progress of each individual by their assigned physical therapist. Individuals will be asked to perform at least 3 exercise sessions per week, in different days, but will not be excluded in case of lower adherence.
In addition to the exercises, the individuals will also have access to educational articles written by the clinical team, as well as to a CBT program delivered through a combination of written articles and pre-recorded audio sessions.</description>
