  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this phase II advanced melanoma study, all patients will receive treatment with
      nivolumab/ipilimumab plus cabozantinib for a 12 week induction period followed by nivolumab
      plus cabozantinib maintanence to complete up to 2 years of therapy unless disease
      progression, dose limiting toxicity, provider/patient decision or patient withdrawal of
      consent occurs. The primary endpoint is the one year PFS rate. Patients will have staging
      scans at baseline and every 12 weeks during the first 2 years on study. Safety evaluations
      including labs, EKG and history and physical will occur at each visit. Baseline tumor sample
      is required and on treatment biopsy will be optional of superficial tumor in the skin,
      subcutaneous tissue or lymph node that is palpable.

      Subjects will receive nivolumab, ipilimumab and cabozantinib until either disease
      progression, the occurrence of unacceptable drug-related toxicity or for other reason(s) for
      subject withdrawal. Treatment will continue for up to 2 years unless there is disease
      progression, drug intolerance or other reason for discontinuation discussed with the
      principal investigator (PI). Patients with ongoing complete or partial response may
      discontinue therapy after 1 year on treatment at the discretion of the treating investigator.

          6. Adequate organ and marrow function.

          7. Capable of understanding and complying with the protocol requirements and must have

             than 6 months from last dose.

          2. Receipt of any type of small molecule kinase inhibitor (including investigational
             kinase inhibitor) within 2 weeks before first dose of study treatment.

             except for superficial skin cancers, or localized, low grade tumors deemed cured and
             not treated with systemic therapy.

         16. Subjects with a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (&gt;
             10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14
             days of study drug administration. Inhaled or topical steroids, and adrenal
             replacement doses &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents are permitted in the absence of
