      To assess a 15-day wear period for the Cascade CGM. This study includes ten subjects who will
      interface with the system and take finger stick BGM glucose values for calibration. The wear
      period includes four in-clinic days frequent blood draws and eleven at home days at a single
      testing site.

               -  18 years of age or older

               -  Currently self-monitoring capillary blood glucose (on average at least three
                  times per day or more) or on a CGM for at least three months

               -  Willing to have blood glucose levels manipulated into high and low glucose levels
                  during in clinic days if deemed appropriate per the protocol based on insulin
                  use.

               -  Willing to follow all study procedures, including attending all clinic visits
                  during which a venous line will be inserted for blood sampling, wearing CGM
                  sensors for entire study, performing fingertip glucose tests for self-monitoring
                  and calibration, and keeping a diary of activities.

               -  Be willing to wear two investigational CGM devices.

        Exclusion Criteria:

               -  Symptomatic coronary artery disease with a history of angina, or history of a
                  myocardial infarction or coronary intervention (e.g., percutaneous transluminal
                  coronary angioplasty [PTCA], stent placement), or coronary artery bypass graft
                  (CABG) within the past six months

               -  Diagnosis of the following diabetic autonomic neuropathies: orthostatic
                  hypotension, heart rate anomalies, gastroparesis

               -  Cerebrovascular incident within the past six month

               -  History or presence of eczema, psoriasis, atopic or contact dermatitis
