  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lateral lumbar interbody fusion (LLIF), as a minimally invasive technique, is an indirect
      decompression technique, and its decompression effect is not as thorough as traditional
      posterior decompression surgery. For certain patients with severe lumbar stenosis, additional
      posterior decompression is required. However, whether additional posterior decompression is
      necessary for these patients is unknown. Radiographic predictors of failed indirect
      decompression via LLIF is unknown. In current randomized, controlled trial , the
      investigators compare the clinical outcomes of patients with severe lumbar stenosis who
      received LLIF plus posterior decompression and those without posterior decompression.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current randomized controlled trial consists of two groups. Patients included in the
      study are with Schizas's stenosis grades C. Patients in one group received transpsoas lateral
      lumbar interbody fusion. Patients in the other group received transpsoas lateral lumbar
      interbody fusion plus posterior decompression. Patients will be followed for one year.
      Clinical outcomes of the two groups will be compared. And radiographic predictors of failed
      indirect decompression via LLIF will be analyzed.

    <description>The ZCQ is a disease-specific self-report outcome instrument commonly used in trials to measure treatment outcomes in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis.The result is expressed as a percentage of the maximum possible score (22.22% - 100%). The score increases with worsening disability.The The ZCQ consists of three subscales: symptom severity scale, physical function scale and patient's satisfaction with treatment scale.</description>

    <description>LLIF is an indirect decompression technique, and does not directly remove the disc or osteophyte protruding into the spinal canal. Its decompression effect is not as thorough as traditional posterior decompression surgery. Usually, posterior decompression is required for patients who have unsuccessful indirect decompression.</description>
