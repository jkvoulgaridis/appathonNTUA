  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an initial pilot study to test feasibility, participant engagement and satisfaction,
      and clinical and neurobiological target engagement of a behavioral treatment called &quot;ASCEND&quot;
      that combines computer-based cognitive training and coaching of cognitive strategies to
      improve daily cognitive functioning in individuals with stroke.

    <description>ASCEND combines computer-based cognitive training exercises, homework exercises to enhance cognition, and coaching sessions delivered in-person and via telephone/videoconference by a neuropsychologist. ASCEND includes 24 total computer training sessions of 30 minutes each, for a total of 12 hours. ASCEND includes 8 coaching sessions of 45 minutes each. The computer exercises aim to improve attention, working memory (WM), and cognitive control through a series of engaging and interactive computer games (e.g., card games, driving simulation). The homework exercises and coaching sessions aim to assist the participant in generalizing and transferring skills from the computer exercises to daily life and to develop further strategies to compensate for attention and WM difficulties in daily life.</description>
