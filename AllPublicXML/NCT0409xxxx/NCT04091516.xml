  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective study aims to assess the feasibility and implementation of a plant-based,
      weight-loss program in an office setting. The study will also assess changes in body weight,
      blood pressure, plasma lipids, glycated hemoglobin, and body composition with a 12-week,
      plant-based, weight-loss program. These health benefits may illustrate feasibility to
      physicians and healthcare professionals elsewhere.

    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective interventional study to evaluate the feasibility, implementation
      and efficacy of 12-week plant-based, weight-loss program that is carried out in an office
      setting and is open to participation to the general public via local print and online
      advertising or whichever methods apply. The program will include weekly education and
      support, and assessment of blood pressure, lipids, hemoglobin A1c, and body composition
      before and after starting the program. The price of the program, $645, will cover the costs
      of weekly education, blood pressure check, laboratory testing and body composition analysis.

    <description>With participants wearing light, indoor clothing but without shoes, body weight will be measured to the nearest 0.1 kg, using a digital scale. Body weight will also be assessed at each weekly session, but only data from the week 1 (pre-program) and week 12 (post-program) will be included in the analysis.</description>

    <description>Body composition will be measured by dual energy x-ray absorptometry (Lunar iDXA, GE Healthcare; Madison, WI) with Encore® 2005 v.9.15.010 software. The iDXA can measure body composition with low x-ray exposure and short scanning time. The iDXA unit will be calibrated daily using the GE Lunar calibration phantom, and a trained operator will perform all scans following standard protocol for participant positioning. The iDXA is equipped with the CoreScan module (GE Healthcare, Madison, WI), which can also provide an estimate of visceral adipose tissue volume and mass.</description>
