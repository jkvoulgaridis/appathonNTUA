      Randomized treatment trial of baking soda, UrocitK, or LithoLyte to determine if baking soda
      and Litholyte are as effective as UrocitK in raising 24 hour urine citrate and pH.

      Participants will not be required to attend any study visits outside of normal clinical
      encounters. Participants enrolled in the study will be randomized to treatment upon
      enrollment. Blocked randomization will be conducted, utilizing sex (M/F) and recurrent stone
      former (Y/N) as algorithm variables. Participants randomized to potassium citrate will be
      provided a prescription for 40 mEq potassium citrate and will be provided the usual
      instructions on how to take it (potassium citrate has been used for decades in clinical care
      of patients with stones; thus, standard instructions will be provided). This is usually in
      divided doses (such as 20 mEq twice daily) with meals. Participants randomized to LithoLyte®
      will be provided 40 mEq of alkali in the form of LithoLyte® and advised to take 20 mEq twice
      daily according to package instructions, once in morning and once at bedtime; no requirements
      about proximity to meals are necessary. Participants randomized to baking soda will be
      provided instructions for using baking soda to provide 40 mEq alkali, to be accomplished by
      dissolving ¼ teaspoon baking soda in water or other beverage (any amount) in the morning on
      an empty stomach and ½ teaspoon baking soda in water or other beverage again at bedtime, also
      on an empty stomach. The 24-hour urine results that are available upon enrollment will be
      used for pre-intervention values. The 24-hour results from each participant's followup clinic
      encounter, which is 3 months post initiation of treatment, will be used for post-intervention
      values. Thus, no extra encounters are required for participation in the study. Additionally,
      no extra tests are required for participation in the study as participants would normally
      complete a post-treatment 24-hour urine collection anyway. Participants will be screened for
      eligibility as described above, i.e., by pre-clinic review of schedules and 24-hour urine
      results. Only those meeting inclusion criteria will be invited to participate and enrolled,
      provided that informed consent is provided by signing the signature page of the
      consent/authorization form. The treatment/intervention period is 90 days (approximately 3
      months). However, it should be noted that, as these are clinical interventions that would be
      prescribed or recommended anyway, it is expected that participants will continue treatment
      indefinitely and under supervision of urology and/or Metabolic Stone Clinic providers. If the
      participant has failed the randomized therapy they are assigned to, they will be clinically
      assigned a different treatment option (one of the remaining two) and continue to be followed
      up per study protocol. Participants will also be asked to complete a medication questionnaire
      and log, as well as the Wisconsin Stone Quality of Life (WISQOL) questionnaire. All study
      procedures are considered standard of care, except for: randomization into treatment and the
      medication questionnaire and log.
