    <textblock>
      This research project is being conducted to investigate changes in secondary impairments,
      functional mobility skills, and gait variables in children with spasticity following
      selective percutaneous myofascial lengthening. The research project proposed here will be the
      first to use instrumented three-dimensional motion analysis to investigate the effects of
      selective percutaneous myofascial lengthening on gait kinematics and kinetics. The objectives
      of the study are to:

        1. Compare gait kinematics and kinetics in children and young adults with lower extremity
           spasticity before and after selective percutaneous myofascial lengthening to determine
           the effects of this procedure on functional mobility.

        2. Identify changes in impairments and activity limitations following selective
           percutaneous myofascial lengthening .

        3. Identify changes in a family or caregivers perceived quality of life after their child's
           selective percutaneous myofascial lengthening .

      The aim of this study is to identify and describe the specific changes in secondary
      musculoskeletal impairments, activity limitations, and gait kinematics and kinetics after a
      selective percutaneous myofascial lengthening procedure. Gait kinematics and kinetics
      includes the motion of joints and body segments, and force and power, at each lower extremity
      joint, respectively. The results of this study will provide preliminary information on how
      this form of soft tissue lengthening affects functional mobility skills in children with
      spasticity. The study is expected to run for two years and the primary study endpoint is when
      participants have completed their second post- operative data collection session.
