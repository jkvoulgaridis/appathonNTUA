      This study seeks to correlate microbial sequencing data from a punch biopsy in patients with
      skin cancer both melanoma and non-melanoma.

      The human Skin microbiome is a complex, interconnected web of microbes, living in a symbiotic
      relationship with their host. There are greater than ten times more bacteria on our bodies
      than there are human cells, all in a delicate and ever-changing balance to maintain a healthy
      skin microbiome. When this balance is disrupted, a condition known as dysbiosis, disease can
      occur. There is still a debate over whether dysbiosis is a cause of disease or a symptom of
      it. Naturally, since the microbiome has such a profound impact on human health, we want to
      study and learn as much about the microbiome as possible. By correlating this data with
      medical records for the patient's skin cancer, connections may begin to be drawn between
      organisms present in the microbiome of the skin microbiome, and skin cancer. Much like
      fingerprints, no microbiome is identical therefore the only chance we have at understanding
      disease is by looking at the skin microbiome and comparing the microorganisms on a patient
      with skin cancer biopsy and non-skin cancer biopsy.

    <description>Relative abundance of bacterial classes within taxonomic phyla and, more broadly, within their domain will be analyzed by sequencing the skin microbiome in both cancerous and non-cancerous areas. These data will then be compared to elucidate unique qualities of the microbiome in skin cancer.</description>
