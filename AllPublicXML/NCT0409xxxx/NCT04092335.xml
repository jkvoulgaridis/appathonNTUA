  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Scoliosis is a lateral curvature of the spine when the Cobb´s angle more than 10˚ on the
      frontal plane. Curve detection before skeletal maturation gives a good opportunity for early
      treatment or prevention of curve progression. Purpose of this study was to evaluate Adam's
      Forward Bend Test and Scoliometer HD in screening of Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis

  <detailed_description>

      The student was asked to stand erect, knees straight, feet at the same level and hands freely
      hanging.

      They was observed from the back for shoulders, pelvic, and knees level. Student was asked to
      bend forward with his knees straight, feet together and hands freely and loosely
      hanged(Forward Bend Test).

      Scoliosis was detected with rib cage rotation and hump appearance (positive test).

      Absence of hump appearance means negative test. After Forward Bend, the students were
      screened using the Scoliometer HD Application.

      The students were asked to bend forward with arms dangling and palms pressed together. The
      smart phone (Scoliometer HD) was placed on the student back with the central dark area in the
      application placed on the spinous processes of the lumber and thoracic regions to measure the
      angle of trunk rotation. Students with a scoliometer HD reading ≥7 degrees (≥20 ̊ Cobb's
      angle) were referred to orthopedic consultation and their parents were informed about the
      findings of the screening by the school manager and social worker.

      Then the data were collected for statistical analysis
