      Using CGMS to compare the blood sugar improvement and patient sensibility of insulin glargine
      injected with needle-free jet injector and conventional insulin pen
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Compared with conventional pen, needle-free jet injection of insulin has faster flow rate and
      larger area of local subcutaneous absorption. The aim of this study was to investigate the
      effects of subcutaneous insulin glargine injection with needle-free jet injection and
      conventional pen on blood glucose profile of CGMS and safety in type 2 diabetic patients.
