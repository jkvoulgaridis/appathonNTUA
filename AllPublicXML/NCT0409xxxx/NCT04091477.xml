  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Eating disorders are multifactorial disorders currently conceptualized in a biopsychosocial
      model, but pathophysiology remains relatively unknown, and robust etiological models to guide
      treatment are therefore lacking. Different endophenotypes and neurocognitive vulnerability
      factors have been found in eating disorders including decision making abnormalities. The
      investigators hypothesize that decision making abnormalities are associated with a lower
      level of functioning and quality of life which could lead to social and interpersonal
      difficulties. The investigators also hypothesize that these anomalies are associated with a
      particular clinical profile (more restrictive profile, more hyperactivity, less insight on
      the disease and desire for care ...).

      The investigators will recruit a total of 200 patients with an eating disorder in the
      university hospital of Montpellier.

      Participation consists of a one-day visit with a multidisciplinary assessment. No action is
      specific to research. This is the usual management of patients with eating disorders
      addressed to our department.

    <description>We aim to investigate the link between global functioning and decision making abnormalities of patients with eating disorder.
The Functioning Assessment Short Test (FAST) is composed of 24 items assessing various dimensions of daily functionning. Each item is ranged from 0 (no difficulty) to 3 (major difficulty) like a likert scale. The FAST is subdivided in 6 subscales : Autonomy (from 0 to 12), Professional activity (from 0 to 15), Cognitive functioning (from 0 to 15), Finances (from 0 to 6), interpersonal relationships (from 0 to 18) and Hobbies (from 0 to 6). The total score is the sum of the 6 subscales from 0 to 72. A hight score reveal hight difficulties in daily functionning</description>
