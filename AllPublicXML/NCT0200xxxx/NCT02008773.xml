  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of the study is to determine the efficacy of adjunctive valacyclovir, in
      comparison to placebo, to improve visual (Brief Visuospatial Memory Test) and working
      (composite score of the Spatial Span and Letter Number Span tests) memory in individuals who
      are HSV-1 positive and early in the course of schizophrenia.

      We hypothesize that individuals who are HSV-1 positive, but not those who are HSV-1 negative,
      will demonstrate significant valacyclovir efficacy for visual and working memory.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One hundred and seventy-five participants (N=70 HSV-1 seropositive and N=105 HSV-1
      seronegative) will be randomized 1:1 to receive adjunctive valacyclovir or adjunctive placebo
      for a 16 week period. The primary outcome that will be assessed is improvement in changes in
      visual and working memory scores in HSV-1 positive and negative participants over the course
      of the study. We will also measure the overall cognitive functioning and the severity of
      psychiatric symptoms over the course of the study and will evaluate the tolerability and
      safety of valacyclovir treatment in this population. In addition, we will explore the
      relationship between changes in the levels of inflammatory markers (HSV2, CMV, EBV, CRP, and
      Toxoplasmosis) and treatment response over the course of the study.

    <description>To determine the efficacy of adjunctive valacyclovir, in comparison to placebo, to improve visual memory (Brief Visuospatial Memory Test) in individuals who are HSV-1 positive and early in the course of schizophrenia. The Brief Visuospatial Memory Test is a subscale of the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) and was used to assess visual memory.
The BVMT consists of three trials in which participants must recall shapes by drawing figures on a blank page after being given the opportunity to memorize the figures for 10 seconds. Each page consists of six figures. Points are awarded based on the accuracy of the drawn figure and by correct placement on the page. A minimum of 0 to 12 points are awarded per trial, so a participant can score between 0 and 36 points for all three trials. The raw score is then converted to a t-score, normed by age and sex. The min and max t-scores are between 0-100, a higher t-score representing a better outcome.</description>

    <description>Determine the efficacy of adjunctive valacyclovir, in comparison to placebo, on working memory (composite score of the Wechsler Memory Scale-III: Spatial Span and Letter Number Span tests). WMS has 2 sections in which a subject recalls increasingly difficult sequences. The total raw score range for both sections is 0-32. The raw score is then converted to a tscore based on normative ranges by age and sex, ranging from 0-100. For both the raw and tscore a higher score reflects better performance.
LNS consists of 24 increasingly difficult sequences of letters and numbers that a subject is to recall and repeat back in Numeric-Alpha sequential order. The total raw score range is 0-24. The raw score is then converted to a tscore based on normative ranges by age and sex, ranging from 0-100. For both the raw and tscore a higher score reflects better performance. The Working Memory composite score is calculated by summing the WMS and LNS tscores, a higher tscore reflects better performance.</description>

    <measure>Cognitive Performance</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 Weeks, and 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the efficacy of adjunctive valacyclovir, in comparison to placebo, to improve general cognitive performance as measured by the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery composite score in HSV1 + and - participants. MCCB is comprised of 10 tests, Trail Making Test Part A; Brief Assessment in Cognition in Schizophrenia Symbol Coding; Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised; Wechsler Memory Scale-III Spatial Span; Letter Number Sequencing; Neuropsychological Assessment Battery Mazes; Brief Visuospatial Memory Test-Revised; Category Fluency Animal Naming; Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test Managing Emotions; and Continuous Performance Test-Identical Pairs. For each test, a score is derived based on the raw item values. Each of the individual item raw scores is standardized to age and gender corrected tscores which are then summed to convert into a composite score ranging from &lt;214-&gt;486 based on the MCCB scoring manual, with a higher score reflecting better performance.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional Performance</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 weeks, and 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the efficacy of adj. valacyclovir to improve functional performance and quality of life (QOL) as measured by the UCSD Performance-Based Skills Assessment, Version B (UPSA-B); QOL Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire Short Form (Q-LES); and Personal and Social Performance Scale (PSP). The UPSA-B is a performance-based assessment of improvement in functional capacity.Participants are asked to role-play communication and finance tasks. Scores are assigned for each of the 2 subscales and formula is used to calculate a total score (0-100). A higher score reflects better performance. The Q-LES, 16 item scale yields a raw total score, ranging from 14-70, with a higher score representing higher QOL. The PSP scale is a single item scale assessing 4 domains of functioning: personal&amp;social relationships, socially useful activities, self-care, and disturbing&amp;aggressive behaviors. An adjusted score from 0-100 is generated, a higher score reflects better functioning.</description>

    <measure>Psychosis Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks, and 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the efficacy of adj. valacyclovir for general and positive symptoms (sxs) as measured by the PANSS total and factor scores and negative sxs as measured by the NSA-16.The PANSS contains 30 items that assess sxs of psychotic d/os.Positive sxs are rated on 7 items, negative sxs on 7 items, and general psych. on 16 items.Scores for each item range from 1-7.Positive total scores ranging from 7-49, negative total scores ranging from 7-49, and general psych. scores ranging from 16-112.Total scores for all items range from 30-210.Additionally a factor score can be derived for Cognition/Disorganization by using scores from 7 items and ranges from 7-49.For factor and total scores a lower score reflects fewer sxs.The NSA-16 is used to rate behaviors commonly associated with negative sxs of schizophrenia.The scale rates subjects on 16 anchors from 1 to 6.The total score is the sum of the 16 specific items and ranges from 16 to 96; a higher score indicates greater severity of illness.</description>

        <title>Visual Memory</title>
        <description>To determine the efficacy of adjunctive valacyclovir, in comparison to placebo, to improve visual memory (Brief Visuospatial Memory Test) in individuals who are HSV-1 positive and early in the course of schizophrenia. The Brief Visuospatial Memory Test is a subscale of the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) and was used to assess visual memory.
The BVMT consists of three trials in which participants must recall shapes by drawing figures on a blank page after being given the opportunity to memorize the figures for 10 seconds. Each page consists of six figures. Points are awarded based on the accuracy of the drawn figure and by correct placement on the page. A minimum of 0 to 12 points are awarded per trial, so a participant can score between 0 and 36 points for all three trials. The raw score is then converted to a t-score, normed by age and sex. The min and max t-scores are between 0-100, a higher t-score representing a better outcome.</description>

        <description>Determine the efficacy of adjunctive valacyclovir, in comparison to placebo, on working memory (composite score of the Wechsler Memory Scale-III: Spatial Span and Letter Number Span tests). WMS has 2 sections in which a subject recalls increasingly difficult sequences. The total raw score range for both sections is 0-32. The raw score is then converted to a tscore based on normative ranges by age and sex, ranging from 0-100. For both the raw and tscore a higher score reflects better performance.
LNS consists of 24 increasingly difficult sequences of letters and numbers that a subject is to recall and repeat back in Numeric-Alpha sequential order. The total raw score range is 0-24. The raw score is then converted to a tscore based on normative ranges by age and sex, ranging from 0-100. For both the raw and tscore a higher score reflects better performance. The Working Memory composite score is calculated by summing the WMS and LNS tscores, a higher tscore reflects better performance.</description>

        <description>To evaluate the efficacy of adjunctive valacyclovir, in comparison to placebo, to improve general cognitive performance as measured by the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery composite score in HSV1 + and - participants. MCCB is comprised of 10 tests, Trail Making Test Part A; Brief Assessment in Cognition in Schizophrenia Symbol Coding; Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised; Wechsler Memory Scale-III Spatial Span; Letter Number Sequencing; Neuropsychological Assessment Battery Mazes; Brief Visuospatial Memory Test-Revised; Category Fluency Animal Naming; Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test Managing Emotions; and Continuous Performance Test-Identical Pairs. For each test, a score is derived based on the raw item values. Each of the individual item raw scores is standardized to age and gender corrected tscores which are then summed to convert into a composite score ranging from &lt;214-&gt;486 based on the MCCB scoring manual, with a higher score reflecting better performance.</description>

        <title>Functional Performance</title>
        <description>To evaluate the efficacy of adj. valacyclovir to improve functional performance and quality of life (QOL) as measured by the UCSD Performance-Based Skills Assessment, Version B (UPSA-B); QOL Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire Short Form (Q-LES); and Personal and Social Performance Scale (PSP). The UPSA-B is a performance-based assessment of improvement in functional capacity.Participants are asked to role-play communication and finance tasks. Scores are assigned for each of the 2 subscales and formula is used to calculate a total score (0-100). A higher score reflects better performance. The Q-LES, 16 item scale yields a raw total score, ranging from 14-70, with a higher score representing higher QOL. The PSP scale is a single item scale assessing 4 domains of functioning: personal&amp;social relationships, socially useful activities, self-care, and disturbing&amp;aggressive behaviors. An adjusted score from 0-100 is generated, a higher score reflects better functioning.</description>

        <description>To evaluate the efficacy of adj. valacyclovir for general and positive symptoms (sxs) as measured by the PANSS total and factor scores and negative sxs as measured by the NSA-16.The PANSS contains 30 items that assess sxs of psychotic d/os.Positive sxs are rated on 7 items, negative sxs on 7 items, and general psych. on 16 items.Scores for each item range from 1-7.Positive total scores ranging from 7-49, negative total scores ranging from 7-49, and general psych. scores ranging from 16-112.Total scores for all items range from 30-210.Additionally a factor score can be derived for Cognition/Disorganization by using scores from 7 items and ranges from 7-49.For factor and total scores a lower score reflects fewer sxs.The NSA-16 is used to rate behaviors commonly associated with negative sxs of schizophrenia.The scale rates subjects on 16 anchors from 1 to 6.The total score is the sum of the 16 specific items and ranges from 16 to 96; a higher score indicates greater severity of illness.</description>
