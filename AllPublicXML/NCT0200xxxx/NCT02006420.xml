  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Scleroderma and other rheumatologic conditions can affect the skin. Scleroderma in particular
      involves skin thickening and hardening.

      Currently, looking at the degree that the skin is affected by scleroderma is measured based
      on a combination of a physical exam and a skin biopsy.

      The researchers propose to measure skin hardness using ultrasound imaging of elasticity. They
      will use a technique using acoustic radiation force impulse/shear wave velocity imaging ,
      known as ARFI/SVI).

      The investigators hypothesize that ARFI/SVI may be able to distinguish between normal skin
      and skin affected by scleroderma.. This tool may also help to quantify the amount of fibrosis
      in the skin.

      This type of radiologic biomarker could be used to help confirm the diagnosis of scleroderma.

      Scleroderma as well as numerous other rheumatologic conditions can affect the skin.
      Scleroderma in particular causes skin thickening and hardening.

      Currently, evaluation of degree to which skin is affected by scleroderma is measured by a
      combination of a physical exam and skin biopsy results.

      The investigators propose to measure skin hardness using ultrasound elasticity imaging, in
      the form of acoustic radiation force impulse/shear wave velocity imaging (ARFI/SVI).

      The investigators hypothesize that ARFI/SVI may be able to distinguish normal skin from skin
      affected by scleroderma (and other rheumatologic conditions). And, this ultrasound technique
      might measure the amount of fibrosis in the dermis (skin).

      Such a radiologic biomarker could be used to help confirm the diagnosis of scleroderma. In
      addition, it may be usable for following patients over time and measuring their response to
      therapy and progression of disease.

    <description>MRSS scores exist on a scale from 0 to 51 based on scores of 0 to 3 measured in 17 locations on the body, where 0 represents overall healthy skin and 51 would be the worst outcome in all 17 locations.
MRSS measures are not taken on healthy participants.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Linear Relationship Between Ultrasound Skin Stiffness and MRSS</measure>
    <time_frame>Cross-sectional study, 1 visit, &lt;1 hr</time_frame>
    <description>Pearson correlation assesses the linear relationships between ultrasound skin stiffness and subjective skin scoring (MRSS) of skin stiffness. MRSS is the Modified Rodnan Score. Skin thickness is measured by clinical palpation using a 0-3 scale. 0 = normal skin; 1 = mild thickness; 2 = moderate thickness; 3 = severe thickness with inability to pinch the skin into a fold.
Because MRSS measurements were not taken for healthy participants, no correlations are provided for them. Therefore, the correlations are based on a skin stiffness and skin scoring solely for scleroderma participants.</description>

        <description>Pearson correlation assesses the linear relationships between ultrasound skin stiffness and subjective skin scoring (MRSS) of skin stiffness. MRSS is the Modified Rodnan Score. Skin thickness is measured by clinical palpation using a 0-3 scale. 0 = normal skin; 1 = mild thickness; 2 = moderate thickness; 3 = severe thickness with inability to pinch the skin into a fold.
Because MRSS measurements were not taken for healthy participants, no correlations are provided for them. Therefore, the correlations are based on a skin stiffness and skin scoring solely for scleroderma participants.</description>
