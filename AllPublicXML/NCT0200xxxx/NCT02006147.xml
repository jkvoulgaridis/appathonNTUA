    <textblock>
      To determine whether TLC399 (ProDex) provides an ideal, safe, long-acting, dexamethasone
      sodium phosphate (DSP) delivery system for the treatment of macular edema due to retinal vein
      occlusion (RVO).

      &lt;Part 1&gt; An open-label, sequential dose escalation part to determine the DLT of TLC399
      (ProDex) in patients with macular edema due to central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) or
      branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO). The safety results should be evaluated by Safety
      Monitor Committee regularly every 6 months and after last patient of each cohort completes
      DLT observation period. The SMC would advise or give permission for further dose escalation,
      de-escalation, or any study design adjustment. After the study drug administration, these
      patients will continue to be evaluated for efficacy and safety outcomes up to a period of 12
      months unless the patient is withdrawn or discontinues the study.

        -  Group R1: 0.24 mg DSP with 100 mM PL (20 µL)

        -  Group 1: 0.36 mg DSP with 100 mM PL (30 µL)

        -  Group 2: 0.6 mg DSP with 100 mM PL (50 µL)

        -  Group 3: 0.6 mg DSP with 50 mM PL (50 µL)

      &lt;Part 2&gt; An open-label, single-arm design to investigate the use of TLC399 (ProDex) in
      patients with macular edema due to CRVO or BRVO in one dose level selected from Part 1. The
      enrollment of subjects for analysis will include approximately 20 patients in total,
      inclusive of Part 1 and Part 2 for the selected dose group. The safety and efficacy outcomes
      will be assessed for up to 12 months.
