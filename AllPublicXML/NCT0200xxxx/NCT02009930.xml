      Hypothesis: Enlisted military members with 10 or more years of service and at least one
      cardiovascular risk factor will demonstrate a higher risk of future cardiac events as
      assessed by coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring than the risk calculated by the Framingham
      Risk Score.

    <textblock>
      While the military is making strides towards improving the health and habits of service
      members, there are many aspects of the military culture that negatively affect the
      cardiovascular health of military members. Smoking/tobacco use, poor eating habits with Meals
      Ready-to-eat (MRE) and ready access to fast food establishments on base, inconsistent
      exercise, the socioeconomic status of enlisted members and the stress of deployment are all
      factors that contribute to increased risk of cardiovascular disease during military service.
      Currently the calculation of a patient's Framingham risk score is the most commonly used
      method of calculating a patient's cardiovascular risk, and this calculation is based on age,
      smoking history, blood pressure, and lab values and compares it to a general population's
      risk. By the use of a cardiac computerized topography (CT) scan, a Coronary Artery Calcium
      (CAC) score can be calculated and used to estimate the degree of atherosclerosis already
      present in each patient's coronary arteries, and thus establishing their risk of future
      cardiovascular events. CAC scoring is a more patient-specific way of identifying
      cardiovascular risk. The purpose of this study is to assess the prevalence of atherosclerosis
      in enlisted military members with at least 10 years of service and one or more cardiovascular
      risk factor and to determine if their risk of a cardiovascular event is higher than predicted
      by the Framingham score. If CAC scoring is demonstrated to be more accurate, particularly if
      it is more likely to detect risk, it may be used in the future to better risk stratify this
      population of the military. The CAC results in patients could also be a motivating factor to
      create changes in the military culture to attempt to mitigate these risks and create a
      healthier fighting force.

    <description>Percent of active duty enlisted military members with 10 or more years of military service determined to have a prevalence of atherosclerosis based on CAC risk category. The CAC risk category (scale), is derived from the CAC score (i.e., an estimate of the degree of atherosclerosis present in each participant's coronary arteries, reported as a number), and percentage by age to establish risk of future CV events. There are 5 risk categories: Low risk = CAC of 0 and no cardiovascular (CV) risk factors, Low - Moderate risk = CAC of 0 with CV risk factors, Moderate - High risk: CAC 1-100 and percentile for age &lt;75%, High risk = CAC 100-399 or percentile for age &gt;75%, Very high risk = CAC &gt;100 and percentile for age &gt;90% or CAC &gt;400&quot;. Low risk is the best outcome, and very high risk is the worst.</description>

    <description>Percent/Number of subject that were reclassified from FRS to CAC risk category using CAC scores. The CAC risk category (scale) = CAC score (estimated degree of calcium in coronary arteries, a number) + percentage by age to establish risks of future CV events. There are 5 risk categories: low, low - moderate, moderate - high, very high. The Framingham risk category (scale) = FRS to estimate the risk of a CV event over the next 10 years.

          <title>Metabolic Syndrome - Compare FRS to CAC</title>
          <description>Compare FRS category and CAC risk category for those meeting and not meeting criteria for metabolic syndrome. Calculate Fisher's Exact test statistic and associated p values to look at the relationship between the presence/absence of metabolic syndrome and the FRS and CAC risk category. The CAC risk category (scale) = CAC score (estimated degree of calcium in coronary arteries, a number) + percentage by age to establish risks of future CV events. There are 5 risk categories: low, low - moderate, moderate - high, very high. The Framingham risk category (scale) = FRS to estimate the risk of a CV event over the next 10 years. The FRS uses age, systolic blood pressure, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level, total cholesterol level, and smoking status to create a score that is converted into a 10-year CV disease risk % that correlates into a risk category: low, moderate, moderate - high risk, very high. For both scales, low is the best and very high is the worst outcome</description>

        <title>Physical Fitness (PT) Failures - Compare FRS to CAC</title>
        <description>Compare FRS category to CAC risk category for those with and without PT failures. Calculate Fischer's Exact test statistic and associated p values to look at the relationship between those with and without PT failures and the FRS and CAC risk category. The CAC risk category (scale) = CAC score (estimated degree of calcium in coronary arteries, a number) + percentage by age to establish risks of future CV events. There are 5 risk categories: low, low - moderate, moderate - high, very high. The Framingham risk category (scale) = FRS to estimate the risk of a CV event over the next 10 years. The FRS uses age, systolic blood pressure, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level, total cholesterol level, and smoking status to create a score that is converted into a 10-year CV disease risk % that correlates into a risk category: low, moderate, moderate - high risk, very high. For both scales, low is the best and very high is the worst outcome</description>

        <title>Additional Cardiovascular Risk Factors - Compare FRS to CAC</title>
        <description>Compare FRS category to CAC risk category for those with 1 risk factor (RF), vs 2 RF, vs 3 RF, vs 4 RF, vs 5 CV risk factors. Calculate Fisher's Exact test statistic and associated p values to look at the relationship between those with 1 RF, vs 2 RF, vs 3 RF, vs 4 RF, vs 5 CV RF and the FRS &amp; CAC risk category. The CAC risk category (scale) = CAC score (estimated degree of calcium in coronary arteries, a number) + percentage by age to establish risks of future CV events. There are 5 risk categories: low, low - moderate, moderate - high, very high. The Framingham risk category (scale) = FRS to estimate the risk of a CV event over the next 10 years. The FRS uses age, systolic blood pressure, high-density lipoprotein and total cholesterol levels, and smoking status to create a score that is converted into a 10-year CV disease risk % that correlates into a risk category: low, moderate, moderate - high risk, very high. For both scales, low is the best and very high is the worst outcome</description>

        <population>No data collected for this analysis. Due to the relatively small sample size with positive CAC scores, sub-analyses for patients with 2 or more risk factors were not performed. This may be an area for investigation if a larger study population were enrolled</population>

          <description>Compare CAC risk category between two groups, those who lived in the dorm for &gt; 5 years and &lt; 5 years, to see if there is an association between the groups and CAC risk category. The number of participants in each risk category will be added. Then the total number for each group will be used to calculate the correlation using Fisher's Exact test and reported as a p value. The CAC risk category (scale) = CAC score (estimated degree of calcium in coronary arteries, a number) + percentage by age to establish risks of future CV events. There are 5 risk categories: low, low - moderate, moderate - high, high, very high. Low risk is the best outcome, and very high risk is the worst outcome</description>
          <population>The data is separated into two rows. Each row corresponds to a group. Participants were placed into one of the two groups based on certain criteria. Each group has a different number of participants analyzed. The total for both groups (rows) is equal to the overall number of participants analyzed</population>

        <description>Compare CAC risk category among groups, those with 1 risk factor (RF) vs. 2 RF, vs 3 RF, vs 4 RF, vs 5 RF (as listed in the inclusion criteria), to see if there is an association between the groups and CAC risk category. The number of participants in each risk category will be added. Then the total number for each group will be used to calculate the correlation using Fisher's Exact test and reported as a p value. The CAC risk category (scale) = CAC score (estimated degree of calcium in coronary arteries, a number) + percentage by age to establish risks of future CV events. There are 5 risk categories: low, low - moderate, moderate - high, very high. Low risk is the best outcome, and very high risk is the worst outcome</description>

        <population>No data collected for this analysis. Due to the relatively small sample size with positive CAC scores, sub-analyses for patients with 2 or more risk factors were not performed. This may be an area for investigation if a larger study population were enrolled</population>
