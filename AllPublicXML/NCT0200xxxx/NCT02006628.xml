    <textblock>
      This eight-week (six-week treatment period and two-week follow-up), multi-centre,
      double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group study aimed to determine the
      efficacy, safety and tolerability of GWP42003 in participants with schizophrenia or a related
      psychotic disorder.

      Eligible participants entered the study at a Screening and Randomization Visit (Day 1), where
      eligibility was established. Once all inclusion and exclusion criteria were reviewed,
      participants were randomized to receive either GWP42003 or placebo in conjunction with their
      prescribed anti-psychotic medications and began treatment on Day 1 as instructed. Assessments
      were performed on Days 8, 22, and 43. A safety follow-up visit was conducted on Day 57.

    <measure>Change From Baseline To End Of Treatment (Day 43) In Positive And Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 through Day 43</time_frame>
    <description>The PANSS was a 30-item medical scale completed by a trained rater that assessed the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia as well as symptoms of general psychopathology. The PANSS Total score was derived from the sum of the 30 items, which were rated on a 7-point scale, where 1 = absent and 7 = extreme. The total score is the summed total for each of the PANSS positive symptom ('P'), negative symptom ('N'), general psychopathology symptom ('G') scores and could range from 30 to 210 points, with lower scores equating to milder severity of symptoms, that is, closer to psychologically normal.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage Of PANSS Total Score Responders At End Of Treatment (Day 43)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 through Day 43</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of PANSS treatment responders, defined as participants with ≥20% improvement in PANSS Total score between baseline and End of Treatment, is presented. The percentage of participants was calculated by dividing the number of participants with a ≥20% improvement in PANSS Total score (yes) by the total number of participants.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline To The End Of Treatment (Day 43) In PANSS 'P' Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 through Day 43</time_frame>
    <description>The PANSS 'P' scale measured the severity of positive symptoms, including delusions, conceptual disorganization, hallucinations, hyperactivity, grandiosity, suspiciousness/persecution, and hostility. Individual items were rated on a 7-point scale, where 1 = absent and 7 = extreme. The total 'P' score could range from 7 to 49 points, with lower scores equating to milder severity of symptoms, that is, closer to psychologically normal.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline To The End Of Treatment (Day 43) In PANSS 'N' Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 through Day 43</time_frame>
    <description>The PANSS 'N' scale measured the severity of negative symptoms, including blunted affect, emotional withdrawal, poor rapport, passive/apathetic social withdrawal, difficulty in abstract thinking, lack of spontaneity and flow of conversation, and stereotyped thinking. Individual items were rated on a 7-point scale, where 1 = absent and 7 = extreme. The total 'N' score could range from 7 to 49 points, with lower scores equating to milder severity of symptoms, that is, closer to psychologically normal.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline To The End Of Treatment (Day 43) In PANSS 'G' Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 through Day 43</time_frame>
    <description>The PANSS 'G' scale measured the severity of general psychopathology symptoms, including somatic concern, anxiety, guilt feelings, tension, mannerisms and posturing, depression, motor retardation, uncooperativeness, unusual thought content, disorientation, poor attention, lack of judgement and insight, disturbance of violation, poor impulse control, preoccupation, and active social avoidance. Individual items were rated on a 7-point scale, where 1 = absent and 7 = extreme. The total 'G' score could range from 16 to 112 points, with lower scores equating to milder severity of symptoms, that is, closer to psychologically normal.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline To The End Of Treatment (Day 43) In The Scale For The Assessment Of Negative Symptoms (SANS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 through Day 43</time_frame>
    <description>The SANS assessed 5 symptom complexes to obtain clinical ratings of negative symptoms in participants with schizophrenia or related psychotic disorder. Symptom complexes were affective blunting, alogia (impoverished thinking), avolition/apathy, anhedonia/asociality, and disturbance of attention. Assessments were conducted on a 6-point scale (0 = not at all; 5 = severe). The total score could range from 0 to 125 points, with lower scores equating to milder severity of symptoms, that is, closer to psychologically normal.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline To The End Of Treatment (Day 43) In The Clinical Global Impression Severity Scale (CGI-S)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 through Day 43</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-S was a 7-point scale that required the clinician to rate the severity of a participant's illness at the time of assessment, relative to the clinician's past experience of participants who had the same diagnosis. Considering total clinical experience, participants were assessed on severity of mental illness at the time of rating on the following scale: 1 = normal, not at all ill; 2 = borderline mentally ill; 3 = mildly ill; 4 = moderately ill; 5 = markedly ill; 6 = severely ill; or 7 = extremely ill. Lower scores equated to milder severity of symptoms, that is, closer to psychologically normal.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impression Improvement Scale (CGI-I) Values At Day 8 And End Of Treatment (Day 43)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 8 through Day 43</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-I was a 7-point scale that required the clinician to assess how much a participant's illness had improved or worsened relative the first assessment at the beginning of the intervention. This was rated on the following scale: 1 = very much improved; 2 = much improved; 3 = minimally improved; 4 = no change; 5 = minimally worse; 6 = much worse; or 7 = very much worse. Lower scores equated to improvement of symptoms.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline To The End Of Treatment (Day 43) In Brief Assessment Of Cognition In Schizophrenia (BACS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 through Day 43</time_frame>
    <description>The BACS was an instrument used to assess the aspects of cognition found to be most impaired and most strongly correlated with outcome in participants with schizophrenia or related psychotic disorder. The BACS consisted of 6 domains: verbal memory (score range 0 to 75), working memory (score range 0 to 28), motor speed (score range 0 to 100), verbal fluency (score &gt; 0, with no set maximum value), attention and speed of information processing (score range 0 to 110), and executive functions (score range 0 to 22). A score was obtained for each of the 6 domains. A composite summary score was then calculated as the arithmetic mean of the unweighted scores from the 6 domains. While there was not an upper limit on the composite score, overall, an increase in score was indicative of an improvement in cognition.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline To End Of Treatment (Day 43) In Positive And Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Total Score</title>
        <description>The PANSS was a 30-item medical scale completed by a trained rater that assessed the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia as well as symptoms of general psychopathology. The PANSS Total score was derived from the sum of the 30 items, which were rated on a 7-point scale, where 1 = absent and 7 = extreme. The total score is the summed total for each of the PANSS positive symptom ('P'), negative symptom ('N'), general psychopathology symptom ('G') scores and could range from 30 to 210 points, with lower scores equating to milder severity of symptoms, that is, closer to psychologically normal.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline To The End Of Treatment (Day 43) In PANSS 'N' Score</title>
        <description>The PANSS 'N' scale measured the severity of negative symptoms, including blunted affect, emotional withdrawal, poor rapport, passive/apathetic social withdrawal, difficulty in abstract thinking, lack of spontaneity and flow of conversation, and stereotyped thinking. Individual items were rated on a 7-point scale, where 1 = absent and 7 = extreme. The total 'N' score could range from 7 to 49 points, with lower scores equating to milder severity of symptoms, that is, closer to psychologically normal.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline To The End Of Treatment (Day 43) In PANSS 'G' Score</title>
        <description>The PANSS 'G' scale measured the severity of general psychopathology symptoms, including somatic concern, anxiety, guilt feelings, tension, mannerisms and posturing, depression, motor retardation, uncooperativeness, unusual thought content, disorientation, poor attention, lack of judgement and insight, disturbance of violation, poor impulse control, preoccupation, and active social avoidance. Individual items were rated on a 7-point scale, where 1 = absent and 7 = extreme. The total 'G' score could range from 16 to 112 points, with lower scores equating to milder severity of symptoms, that is, closer to psychologically normal.</description>

        <description>The SANS assessed 5 symptom complexes to obtain clinical ratings of negative symptoms in participants with schizophrenia or related psychotic disorder. Symptom complexes were affective blunting, alogia (impoverished thinking), avolition/apathy, anhedonia/asociality, and disturbance of attention. Assessments were conducted on a 6-point scale (0 = not at all; 5 = severe). The total score could range from 0 to 125 points, with lower scores equating to milder severity of symptoms, that is, closer to psychologically normal.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline To The End Of Treatment (Day 43) In The Clinical Global Impression Severity Scale (CGI-S)</title>
        <description>The CGI-S was a 7-point scale that required the clinician to rate the severity of a participant's illness at the time of assessment, relative to the clinician's past experience of participants who had the same diagnosis. Considering total clinical experience, participants were assessed on severity of mental illness at the time of rating on the following scale: 1 = normal, not at all ill; 2 = borderline mentally ill; 3 = mildly ill; 4 = moderately ill; 5 = markedly ill; 6 = severely ill; or 7 = extremely ill. Lower scores equated to milder severity of symptoms, that is, closer to psychologically normal.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline To The End Of Treatment (Day 43) In Brief Assessment Of Cognition In Schizophrenia (BACS) Score</title>
        <description>The BACS was an instrument used to assess the aspects of cognition found to be most impaired and most strongly correlated with outcome in participants with schizophrenia or related psychotic disorder. The BACS consisted of 6 domains: verbal memory (score range 0 to 75), working memory (score range 0 to 28), motor speed (score range 0 to 100), verbal fluency (score &gt; 0, with no set maximum value), attention and speed of information processing (score range 0 to 110), and executive functions (score range 0 to 22). A score was obtained for each of the 6 domains. A composite summary score was then calculated as the arithmetic mean of the unweighted scores from the 6 domains. While there was not an upper limit on the composite score, overall, an increase in score was indicative of an improvement in cognition.</description>
