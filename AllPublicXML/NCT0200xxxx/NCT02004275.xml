      This randomized phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of pomalidomide and
      ixazomib when given together with dexamethasone and to see how well pomalidomide and
      dexamethasone with or without ixazomib works in treating patients with multiple myeloma that
      has come back. Biological therapies, such as pomalidomide and dexamethasone, may stimulate
      the immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing. Ixazomib may stop the
      growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It is not yet
      known whether pomalidomide and dexamethasone are more effective with or without ixazomib in
      treating multiple myeloma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for combination therapy
      pomalidomide/dexamethasone/ixazomib. (Phase I) II. To assess whether the combination of
      pomalidomide/dexamethasone/ixazomib improves progression-free survival (PFS) relative to
      pomalidomide/dexamethasone. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs). (Phase I) II. To analyze type and grade of
      all serious adverse events (SAEs). (Phase I) III. To analyze type and grade of all adverse
      events (AEs). (Phase I) IV. To analyze the reason for and incidence of dose
      modifications/omissions/delays. (Phase I) V. To assess preliminary evidence of clinical
      efficacy. (Phase I) VI. To assess whether the overall response rate (ORR), partial response
      (PR), very good partial response (VGPR), complete response (CR) or stringent CR (sCR) rate
      differ with respect to treatment regimen. (Phase II) VII. To assess the clinical benefit rate
      (CBR: minimal response [MR] + ORR) for pomalidomide/dexamethasone/ixazomib compared to
      pomalidomide/dexamethasone. (Phase II) VIII. To assess the disease control rate (DCR: stable
      disease [SD] + CBR) for pomalidomide/dexamethasone/ixazomib compared to
      pomalidomide/dexamethasone. (Phase II) IX. For those patients achieving a PR or better, we
      will assess whether the combination of pomalidomide/dexamethasone/ixazomib increases the
      duration of response (DOR) compared to pomalidomide/dexamethasone. (Phase II) X. To assess
      whether the combination of pomalidomide/dexamethasone/ixazomib improves overall survival (OS)
      compared to those taking pomalidomide/dexamethasone alone. (Phase II) XI. To assess time to
      next treatment (TNT) for patients taking pomalidomide/dexamethasone/ixazomib compared to
      those on pomalidomide/dexamethasone. (Phase II) XII. To evaluate the safety of
      pomalidomide/dexamethasone/ixazomib compared with pomalidomide/dexamethasone. (Phase II)
      XIII. For patients on the pomalidomide/dexamethasone arm who opt to cross-over to the
      pomalidomide/dexamethasone/ixazomib arm, assessment of response rate (ORR, CBR, DCR), DOR,
      TNT, PFS and OS will be evaluated from date of cross-over. (Phase II) XIV. To determine if
      baseline level of perceived fatigue and overall quality of life (QOL) is associated with OS.
      (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of pomalidomide and ixazomib followed by a
      phase II study.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 4 weeks until disease
      progression and then every 3 months for 3 years.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        -  Histologically confirmed diagnosis of symptomatic multiple myeloma; relapsed disease
             is myeloma that has previously responded to prior therapy (MR or better) and
             subsequently progressed

          -  Patient must have measurable disease or non-measurable disease, defined as one or more
             of the following holding true:

               -  Measurable disease:

                    -  Serum M-protein &gt;= 1.0 g/dL (&gt;= 0.5 g/dL for IgA or IgM myeloma) and/or

                    -  Urine M-protein &gt;= 200 mg/24 hours and/or

                    -  Involved serum free light chain level &gt;= 10 mg/dL AND an abnormal serum free
                       light chain ratio

               -  For non-measurable disease:

                    -  Baseline marrow burden of myeloma of at least 30%

          -  Progression on lenalidomide as part of first line therapy (lenalidomide-refractory
             disease)

             * Lenalidomide-refractory disease is defined as disease progression on or progression
             within 60 days of the last dose of a lenalidomide-based treatment; patients should
             have received at least 2 cycles of a lenalidomide-based regimen to be evaluable for
             refractoriness; examples: 1) progression on lenalidomide maintenance therapy after
             initial induction +/- consolidation; 2) initial response followed by progression on
             continuous lenalidomide-dexamethasone +/- elotuzumab or daratumumab

          -  Pomalidomide naive disease

          -  Proteasome inhibitor naive or sensitive disease; proteasome inhibitor sensitive
             disease is defined as a PR or better to prior proteasome inhibitor-based therapy that
             is maintained for &gt;= 60 days from the last dose of the proteasome inhibitor

             * A patient who receives induction therapy with lenalidomide, bortezomib and
             dexamethasone and achieves a PR or better but subsequently progresses on continued
             lenalidomide or lenalidomide-dexamethasone would be eligible provided the progression
             occurs 60 days or more after discontinuation of the bortezomib; similarly, ixazomib
             exposure is allowed provided they meet the definition of proteasome inhibitor
             sensitive disease

          -  1 prior line of systemic therapy for multiple myeloma, where a line of therapy for
             myeloma is defined as 1 or more planned cycles of single agent or combination therapy,
             as well as a planned series of treatment regimens administered in a sequential manner
             (e.g. lenalidomide, bortezomib and dexamethasone induction therapy for 4 cycles
             followed by autologous stem cell transplantation and then lenalidomide maintenance
             therapy would be considered 1 line of prior therapy); a new line of therapy begins
             when a planned therapy is modified to include other treatment agents (alone or in
             combination) as a result of disease progression, disease relapse or treatment-related
             toxicity (e.g. a patient is progressing in the face of lenalidomide maintenance
             therapy and has bortezomib and dexamethasone added into their regimen); a new line of
             therapy also begins when a planned treatment-free interval is interrupted by the need
             to start treatment due to disease relapse/progression (e.g. a patient with relapsed
             myeloma achieves a partial response after a planned 8 cycles of cyclophosphamide,
             bortezomib and dexamethasone, enjoys an 8-month period off therapy but then
             experiences disease progression requiring re-initiation of therapy)

          -  Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is allowed provided the patient is &gt;= 1 year from
             transplant at time of registration, is not on immunosuppressive therapy to
             treat/prevent graft-versus-host disease, has no evidence of active graft versus host
             disease, and no evidence of active infection

             undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or 2) has not been naturally
