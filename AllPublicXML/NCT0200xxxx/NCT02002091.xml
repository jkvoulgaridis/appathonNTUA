      -  It is a prospective,observational, cohort study

        -  The main purpose of the study is to assess the prevalence of diabetic chronic
           complications in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetics in suburban area of Algiers.

        -  The secondary purpose is to study the impact of diabetic renal complications as a risk
           factor on the atherothrombotic events.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To reach the two purposes, we need to conduct a cohort study:

        -  The cohort population is type 2 diabetes patients that have been recruited in a
           consecutive and exhaustive way. The first consultation is performed in hospital or in
           one of 12 primary care units of Ain-Taya's health sector in Est suburb of Algiers . When
           a glycemia is found at 1.26 g/litre or over, the patient is referred to principal
           investigator to confirm the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes ,to recruit him and proceed to
           complete screening for chronic complications

        -  For the main purpose, we evaluate the prevalence of micro and macrovascular
           complications, at the time of diagnosis, in type2 diabetes patients that have been
           recruited. For some complications as Diabetic Kidney Disease, we have to follow up the
           patient at least three months to confirm the chronic nature of the nephropathy.

        -  For the secondary purpose, the cohort population is followed up for one year, the
           patients are treated commonly. We'll check out all the cardiovascular events linked to
           atherothrombosis.Two groups of patients might be formed:

             -  The first group is composed of all diabetic patients, with chronic Kidney disease
                (CKD) and without atherothrombotic disease. CKD is defined by albuminuria (micro or
                macroalbuminuria) and/or renal failure, present for more than 3 months . All the
                patients with CKD are considered to be &quot;exposed&quot; to atherothrombotic disease.

             -  The second group is composed of all diabetic patients, without CKD and without
                atherothrombotic disease. This group is considered to be &quot;not exposed&quot; to the
                atherothrombotic disease.

      We will compare the two groups, on occurence of cardiovascular events, after adjustment of
      age and major cardiovascular risk factors, and after excluding patients 'not exposed' having
      had a prior treatment with conversion enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor antagonist .

        -  The size of the sample is calculated with statistical formula:

           n= E2 Po Qo / i2 n= size of the sample E= 1.96 with error risk : alpha= 5% Po= 30% Qo=
           1-Po &quot;n&quot; is at least egal to 323 patients

        -  Statistical analysis is performed with epi info 6.04b and all tests are performed with
           an error risk alpha= 5%

             -  Descriptive statistics of patients characteristics:

                  -  For quantitative variables,we will calculate means,standard deviations, median
                     and quantiles.

                  -  for qualitative variables, percentage will be calculated.

             -  Comparative statistics according to existence of renal disease or not

                  -  Khi-square test is performed for qualitative variables

                  -  Student test: for two means comparison

                  -  Anova test: to compare more than two means

             -  Multivariate analysis will be done on SPSS v: 21 software program, adjustment will
                be done for age, sexe and major cardiovascular risk factors.

        <description>All 327 patients had a neurological examination by the same physician to screen for Distal Diabetic Neuropathy:
Distal sensory testing: including 10 g monofilament test, vibration perception with 128 Hz tuning fork, temperature, touch , prickling and pain perception
Ankles and knees reflex testing
Muscle strength testing (quadriceps and tibialis anterior)
We use the Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument score. We consider the diagnosis of Distal Diabetic Neuropathy if the score is up of 2 in at least one food. The MNSI score is ranged from 0 to 5 for each food
Use of neuropathic pain score (DN4), if the DN4 is found up or egal to 4 we consider the diagnosis of neuropathic pain. The DN4 score is ranged from 0 to 10</description>

        <description>We screened for albuminuria or microalbuminuria in 24h urine collection with turbidimetry or immuno turbidimetry method ( performed 3 times in 4 or 6 months )
Measurement of albumine- to- creatinine ratio (ACR), Albuminuria was diagnosed if ACR &gt; or egal to 30 mg/g at least twice in 4 to 6 months. We ensure before performing ACR that there was no dysglycaemia, no urinary infection, no fever nor forced diuresis before we evaluate the urine sample.
Cyto bacteriological examination and urine culture
Serum creatinine repeated 2 to 3 time within 4 to 6 months
Glomerular filtration rate was assessed with the Modification of Diet in Renal disease study equation (MDRD)
Renal and urine tract echography to measure the kidneys and to screen for urine tract dilatation We made the diagnosis of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) if the glomerular filtration rate was &lt; 60 ml/min/1.73 m² and/or ACR &gt; or equal to 30 mg/g with a permanent character</description>

        <title>Number of Patients With Lower Limbs Atherothrombotic Accident</title>
        <description>During one year of follow-up :
We search for a recent history of intermittent claudication;
We perform a systematic clinical examination with palpation of lower limb pulses and an Ankle-Brachial Index measurement after one year or in the presence of an acute ischemic lower limb episod ;
Lower limb duplex sonography in the presence of an abnormal clinical vascular examination;
Angiography in the presence of a lower limbs vascular event.</description>
        <time_frame>One year after recruitment</time_frame>
        <population>300 patients (109 men and 191 women) were re-evaluated one year after recruitment. From 327 patients enrolled, we excluded 27 patients (13 men and 14 women) from the analysis because of a lack of data, 22 patients (10 men and 12 women) were lost from follow-up and 5 died too early during follow-up (three first months).</population>
