      Phase 1: To assess the safety, tolerability, and maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/ recommended
      dose of ganetespib when administered in combination with sirolimus in patients with
      refractory or relapsed sarcomas including unresectable or metastatic sporadic or
      neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) associated MPNST. Phase I enrollment has been closed.

      Phase 2: To determine the clinical benefit of ganetespib in combination with sirolimus for
      patients with unresectable or metastatic sporadic or NF1 associated MPNST.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previously, no targeted agents have been able to cause tumor regression in a genetically
      engineered MPNST mouse model or human MPNST. Recently published data from Dr. Cichowski's
      laboratory demonstrated using Hsp90 inhibitors to enhance endoplasmic reticulum stress
      coupled with the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor sirolimus led to dramatic
      tumor shrinkage in a transgenic MPNST mouse model, which correlated with profound damage to
      the endoplasmic reticulum and cell death. Ganetespib is a novel, injectable, small molecule
      inhibitor of Hsp90 and is currently being investigated in adults with a broad range of tumor
      types with a favorable safety profile and promising early results. Ganetespib has been
      studied in preclinical in vivo models with a variety of targeted agents with no marked
      apparent pharmacological interactions. Sirolimus is a commercially available orally
      administered mTOR inhibitor and is the active metabolite of temsirolimus, which is FDA
      approved agent for advanced metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Sirolimus has been studied and
      tolerated in combination with multiple cytotoxic and targeted agents in a variety of tumor
      types. Based on strong preclinical rationale, the investigators hypothesize that ganetespib
      in combination with sirolimus will cause tumor regression in patients with refractory MPNSTs.

      The investigators propose a multi-institutional open label phase I/II trial of ganetespib in
      combination with sirolimus in patients with refractory sarcoma including MPNST. Hsp90
      inhibitors and mTOR inhibitors have also both demonstrated benefit in a variety of
      preclinical bone and soft tissue sarcoma models. The investigators hypothesize that these
      agents that work on separate and potentially synergistic pathways will also be beneficial for
      other refractory bone and soft tissue sarcomas. Thus, the phase I component will be open to
      patients with refractory sarcomas, which will also expedite enrollment. Upon determination of
      the recommended dosing, a phase II study will be conducted. The phase II study population
      will be limited to patients with a diagnosis of MPNST.

    <time_frame>Toxicities will be evaluated over the first treatment cycle (each cycle=28 days)</time_frame>
    <description>To assess the safety, tolerability, and maximum tolerated/ recommended dose of ganetespib when administered in combination with sirolimus in patients with refractory sarcomas or unresectable or metastatic sporadic or neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) associated MPNST. Toxicities observed during the first cycle will be used to define the MTD/Recommended dose. Toxicity will be graded using the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. DLT will be defined as any of the following events that are possibly, probably, or definitely attributable to ganetespib or sirolimus. The DLT observation period for the purposes of dose escalation will be the first cycle of therapy.</description>

    <time_frame>Response evaluations will be performed after every 2 treatment cycles (each cycle=28 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed using the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. Tumor assessments will be obtained every 2 cycles. Clinical benefit is defined as stable disease, Partial Response (PR), Complete Response (CR). For patients who experience progression by WHO but in the opinion of the treating investigator are deriving benefit from therapy and have not otherwise met off treatment or off study criteria, may continue on treatment as long as patient has not met progression by RECIST 1.1.</description>

    <description>To explore changes in pharmacodynamic parameters in peripheral blood mononuclear cells performed on day 1 prior to ganetespib and sirolimus administration, and on day 15, 6 hours post drug administration. Hsp inhibition (Hsp70), mTOR inhibition (phospho-S6 and Akt Phosphorylation), UPR activation (EIF2alpha phosphorylation) will be explored. Western blot analyses were performed for phospho (p)-Akt, p-eIF2α, p-S6, and Hsp70. The absorbance of each phosphoprotein lane was recorded and protein levels were determined after normalizing for levels of corresponding total protein.</description>

    <measure>Patient-reported Pain Severity and the Impact of Pain on Daily Activities</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and prior to Cycle 3</time_frame>
    <description>To assess patient-reported pain severity and the impact of pain on daily activities before and during treatment with ganetespib and sirolimus. The Numerical Rating Scale-11 (NRS-11) will be used to assess pain severity. The NRS-11 is a self-report segmented 11-point numeric scale that assesses pain severity. It consists of a horizontal line with 0 representing &quot;no pain&quot; at the right end of the line and 10 representing &quot;worst pain you can imagine&quot; at the left end.The Brief Pain Inventory is a 7-item self-report questionnaire that measures the extent to which pain interferes with daily functioning. Patients are asked to indicate how much pain interfered with various activities in the past week, with scores ranging from 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (completely interferes). A total score is obtained by taking the mean of the scores for all 7 items; thus, the total pain interference score can range from 0 to 10.</description>

        <title>Number of Dose Limiting Toxicities of Ganetespib When Administered in Combination With Sirolimus.</title>
        <description>To assess the safety, tolerability, and maximum tolerated/ recommended dose of ganetespib when administered in combination with sirolimus in patients with refractory sarcomas or unresectable or metastatic sporadic or neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) associated MPNST. Toxicities observed during the first cycle will be used to define the MTD/Recommended dose. Toxicity will be graded using the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. DLT will be defined as any of the following events that are possibly, probably, or definitely attributable to ganetespib or sirolimus. The DLT observation period for the purposes of dose escalation will be the first cycle of therapy.</description>
        <time_frame>Toxicities will be evaluated over the first treatment cycle (each cycle=28 days)</time_frame>

Clinical benefit is defined as stable disease, Partial Response (PR), Complete Response (CR). For patients who experience progression by WHO but in the opinion of the treating investigator are deriving benefit from therapy and have not otherwise met off treatment or off study criteria, may continue on treatment as long as patient has not met progression by RECIST 1.1.</description>

        <title>Patient-reported Pain Severity and the Impact of Pain on Daily Activities</title>
        <description>To assess patient-reported pain severity and the impact of pain on daily activities before and during treatment with ganetespib and sirolimus. The Numerical Rating Scale-11 (NRS-11) will be used to assess pain severity. The NRS-11 is a self-report segmented 11-point numeric scale that assesses pain severity. It consists of a horizontal line with 0 representing &quot;no pain&quot; at the right end of the line and 10 representing &quot;worst pain you can imagine&quot; at the left end.The Brief Pain Inventory is a 7-item self-report questionnaire that measures the extent to which pain interferes with daily functioning. Patients are asked to indicate how much pain interfered with various activities in the past week, with scores ranging from 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (completely interferes). A total score is obtained by taking the mean of the scores for all 7 items; thus, the total pain interference score can range from 0 to 10.</description>
