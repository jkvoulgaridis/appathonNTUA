  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Employers are increasingly looking for opportunities to motivate sedentary employees to
      become more physically active. Workplace walking programs have had mixed success and
      typically show most improvement among participants that are already fairly active at a
      baseline. The goal of this study is to determine whether a financial incentive program can
      motivate sedentary employees to increase the number of steps they walk per day to meet a
      minimum threshold.

      Our primary outcome measure is the proportion of days a minimum activity of 7000 steps or
      more is achieved. We will assess outcomes each week for 3 months using incentives followed by
      3 months of follow-up without incentives. Secondary outcomes will include the average steps
      walked per day.

    <description>Our primary outcome measure is the proportion of days a minimum activity of 7000 steps or more is achieved. We will assess outcomes for 3 months (13 weeks) with the interventions and 3 months (13 weeks) without intervention during the follow-up period. We will use all available data and treat missing as true missing data points. Secondary outcomes will include the average steps walked per day.</description>

        <description>Our primary outcome measure is the proportion of days a minimum activity of 7000 steps or more is achieved. We will assess outcomes for 3 months (13 weeks) with the interventions and 3 months (13 weeks) without intervention during the follow-up period. We will use all available data and treat missing as true missing data points. Secondary outcomes will include the average steps walked per day.</description>

Each participant will also be notified as to how many of their teammates reached the goal the previous day. Every day one team from the arm will be chosen at random as the winning team. Each participant on the winning team receives $20 if the participant met the step goal during the prior day the participants met their own goal. Each participant will also receive an additional $10 for every one of the other three team members that also met the goal.
