    <textblock>
      Pediatric research in the management of nausea has been limited by the absence of a reliable
      method to quantify the intensity of this subjective symptom. In adults, the visual analog
      scale (VAS) is an accurate tool, but this has not been shown to be reliable in young
      children. A scale is a series of points made on a line that will be used for measurement; a
      mark on the far left of the line shows little pain and the mark on the far right means alot
      of pain.

      By default the most common objective outcome measure used in pediatric studies has been the
      incidence and number of emetic episodes. This measure, however, correlates poorly with the
      somatic subjective symptom of nausea. Apfel et al have shown that 30-40% of adult patients
      undergoing surgery have post discharge nausea and / or vomiting while 12% have vomiting.
      These data on nausea in adults were based on a visual analog scale for nausea. There are no
      data on the incidence of postoperative nausea in children since the severity of symptoms are
      difficult to measure as younger children are known to be unable to use the VAS reliably.
      Recently a pictorial scale for measuring nausea, the Baxter Animated Retching Faces (BARF)
      scale, has been developed and shown to have construct, content and convergent validity as an
      instrument to measure nausea in children. This was a two center study that was limited to
      children who could speak English. The clinical usefulness of this scale in determining the
      incidence of postoperative and post-discharge nausea in children has yet to be determined
      including the lowest age where it can be used reliably, the score associated with a patient's
      perception of a need for treatment, the minimum change in the scores of clinical relevance
      and the test-retest reliability when nausea is rated as not having changed. The score has
      also not been validated in children who speak Spanish. This study is designed to provide the
      missing information and will specifically look at the Spanish speaking population.
