    <measure>Change From Baseline in Disease Activity Score Based on 28-joints Count and Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (DAS28-ESR) at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The DAS28-ESR was derived from assessments of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), tender joint count (TJC), swollen joint count (SJC), and Patient Global Assessment of disease activity (PGA) according to 100-millimeter (mm) Visual Analog Scale (VAS). DAS28-ESR scores were calculated as [0.56 × square root of TJC] + [0.28 × square root of SJC] + [0.70 × natural log (ESR)] + [0.014 × VAS]. TJC was defined as the number of painful joints and SJC was defined as the number of swollen joints, each assessed on 28 joints. ESR was measured in millimeters per hour (mm/h). DAS28-ESR scores could range from 0 to 10, where higher scores represented higher disease activity. The change from Baseline to Week 24 was averaged among all participants, where negative changes indicated an improvement in disease activity.</description>

    <description>RAID assessed the impact of rheumatoid arthritis on participant's quality of life. It comprised 7 domains: pain, function, fatigue, physical and psychological well-being, sleep disturbance and coping. Each domain was a single question scored from 0 (best) to 10 (worst) on a continuous numerical rating scale (NRS). Each domain also had a specific weight assigned by a participant survey and RAID total score ranged from 0 (best) to 10 (worst). If only 1 domain was missing it was replaced by the mean of the others; otherwise, RAID score was not calculated. The changes from Baseline to any time point were averaged among all participants, where negative changes indicated better quality of life.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 24 and 52</time_frame>
    <description>BRAF-MDQ assessed the overall experience and impact of disease related fatigue, using four dimensions (physical fatigue [4 items], living with fatigue [7 items], cognitive fatigue [5 items], and emotional fatigue [4 items]). A total fatigue score (range 0 to 70) was obtained by summing the 20 item scores ranging from 0 to 3, except for item 1 (0-10), item 2 (0-7) and item 3 (0-2). Higher scores reflect greater fatigue. If only 1 domain was missing it was replaced by the mean of the others; otherwise, the total score was not calculated. The changes from Baseline to any time point were averaged among all participants, where negative changes indicated better quality of life.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 40, 52, and 64</time_frame>
    <description>FLARE is a 13-item questionnaire assessed disease flares between two medical consultations. Each item score ranged from 0 (completely untrue) to 10 (absolutely true) on a 6-step scale. The FLARE questionnaire global score (range = 0-10) is a mean score of 11 of the 13 items [items 6 ('doses of pain killers or anti-inflammatory medication') and 13 ('need for help') not taken into account], with the highest score corresponding to the highest disease activity. The global score was computed if at least the scores of 6 items were available. The changes from Baseline to any time point were averaged among all participants, where negative changes indicated better outcome.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Disease Activity Score Based on 28-joints Count and Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (DAS28-ESR) at Week 24</title>
        <description>The DAS28-ESR was derived from assessments of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), tender joint count (TJC), swollen joint count (SJC), and Patient Global Assessment of disease activity (PGA) according to 100-millimeter (mm) Visual Analog Scale (VAS). DAS28-ESR scores were calculated as [0.56 × square root of TJC] + [0.28 × square root of SJC] + [0.70 × natural log (ESR)] + [0.014 × VAS]. TJC was defined as the number of painful joints and SJC was defined as the number of swollen joints, each assessed on 28 joints. ESR was measured in millimeters per hour (mm/h). DAS28-ESR scores could range from 0 to 10, where higher scores represented higher disease activity. The change from Baseline to Week 24 was averaged among all participants, where negative changes indicated an improvement in disease activity.</description>

        <description>The DAS28-ESR was derived from assessments of ESR, TJC, SJC, and PGA according to 100-mm VAS. DAS28-ESR scores were calculated as [0.56 × square root of TJC] + [0.28 × square root of SJC] + [0.70 × natural log (ESR)] + [0.014 × VAS]. TJC was defined as the number of painful joints and SJC was defined as the number of swollen joints, each assessed on 28 joints. ESR was measured in mm/h. DAS28-ESR scores could range from 0 to 10, where higher scores represented higher disease activity. The change from Baseline to any time point was averaged among all participants, where negative changes indicated an improvement in disease activity.</description>

          <description>The DAS28-ESR was derived from assessments of ESR, TJC, SJC, and PGA according to 100-millimeter (mm) VAS. DAS28-ESR scores were calculated as [0.56 × square root of TJC] + [0.28 × square root of SJC] + [0.70 × natural log (ESR)] + [0.014 × VAS]. TJC was defined as the number of painful joints and SJC was defined as the number of swollen joints, each assessed on 28 joints. ESR was measured in mm/h. DAS28-ESR scores could range from 0 to 10, where higher scores represented higher disease activity. The change from Baseline to any time point was averaged among all participants, where negative changes indicated an improvement in disease activity.</description>
          <population>LTE population included all FAS participants who received at least one dose of SC TCZ after Week 24 visit. Here, 'Overall Number of Participants Analyzed' signifies number of participants evaluable for this outcome measure. In case of missing value at Week 24, LOCF method was applied.</population>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Response Based on DAS28-ESR at Week 24</title>
        <description>The DAS28-ESR-based EULAR response criteria were used to measure individual response as 'Good', 'Moderate', and 'No Response', depending upon DAS28-ESR absolute scores at Week 24 and the DAS28-ESR reduction from Baseline to Week 24. Good Response: change from baseline &gt;1.2 with DAS28-ESR score &lt;/=3.2; Moderate Response: change from baseline &gt;1.2 with DAS28-ESR score &gt;3.2 to &lt;/=5.1 or change from baseline &gt;0.6 to &lt;/=1.2 with DAS28-ESR score &lt;/=5.1; No Response: change from baseline &lt;/=0.6 or change from baseline &gt;0.6 and &lt;/=1.2 with DAS28-ESR score &gt;5.1. Percentage of participants with EULAR responses at Week 24 is reported. 95% CI was determined using Clopper-Pearson method.</description>

          <description>CDAI is a numerical sum of 4 outcome parameters: TJC and SJC based on a 28-joint assessment, PGA and Physician's global assessment of disease activity according to 100-mm VAS. Higher scores represent greater affection due to disease activity. CDAI total score = 0-76. CDAI score &lt;/=2.8 indicates disease remission, &lt;/=10 indicates LDA, &lt;/=22 indicates moderate disease activity, and &gt;22 indicates high disease activity. The change from Baseline to any time point was averaged among all participants, where negative changes indicated an improvement in disease activity.</description>

        <description>CDAI is a numerical sum of 4 outcome parameters: TJC and SJC based on a 28-joint assessment, PGA and Physician's global assessment of disease activity according to 100-mm VAS. Higher scores represent greater affection due to disease activity. CDAI total score = 0-76. CDAI score &lt;/=2.8 indicates disease remission, &lt;/=10 indicates LDA, &lt;/=22 indicates moderate disease activity, and &gt;22 indicates high disease activity. Percentage of participants with CDAI LDA and remission at Week 24 and at last assessment is reported.</description>

        <description>Physician-assessed disease activity was scored on a 100-mm VAS, where the distance from 0 mm represented the physician's evaluation of disease activity (0 mm=none; 100 mm=very severe). The change from Baseline to any time point was averaged among all participants, where negative change indicated a decrease in physician-assessed disease activity.</description>

        <description>FACIT-F is a 13-item questionnaire. Participants scored each item on a 5-point scale: 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). Larger the participant's response to the questions (with the exception of 2 negatively stated questions), greater was the participant's fatigue. For all questions, except for the 2 negatively stated ones, the code was reversed and a new score was calculated as (4 minus the participant's response). The sum of all responses resulted in the FACIT-Fatigue score for a total possible score of 0 (worse score) to 52 (better score). The changes from Baseline to any time point were averaged among all participants, where negative changes indicated an increase in fatigue.</description>

        <description>HAQ-DI assessed 20 items in 8 functional activity domains including dressing, rising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and usual activities. Each item was scored on a scale of 0 to 3, where 0 represented activities performed without difficulty and 3 represented inability to perform activities alone. The total score (range = 0-3) was calculated as an average of all item scores. Percentage of participants with HAQ-DI remission (HAQ-DI score &lt;0.5) at each time point is reported.</description>

        <description>HAQ-DI assessed 20 items in 8 functional activity domains including dressing, rising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and usual activities. Each item was scored on a scale of 0 to 3, where 0 represented activities performed without difficulty and 3 represented inability to perform activities alone. The total score (range = 0-3) was calculated as an average of all item scores. Percentage of participants with HAQ-DI clinically meaningful improvement (reduction in HAQ-DI score from baseline &gt;/=0.22) at each time point is reported.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Rheumatoid Arthritis Impact of Disease (RAID) Score at Weeks 12, 24, 28, 40, 52, and 64</title>
        <description>RAID assessed the impact of rheumatoid arthritis on participant's quality of life. It comprised 7 domains: pain, function, fatigue, physical and psychological well-being, sleep disturbance and coping. Each domain was a single question scored from 0 (best) to 10 (worst) on a continuous numerical rating scale (NRS). Each domain also had a specific weight assigned by a participant survey and RAID total score ranged from 0 (best) to 10 (worst). If only 1 domain was missing it was replaced by the mean of the others; otherwise, RAID score was not calculated. The changes from Baseline to any time point were averaged among all participants, where negative changes indicated better quality of life.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Bristol Rheumatoid Arthritis Fatigue Multidimensional Questionnaire (BRAF-MDQ) Total Score at Weeks 24 and 52</title>
        <description>BRAF-MDQ assessed the overall experience and impact of disease related fatigue, using four dimensions (physical fatigue [4 items], living with fatigue [7 items], cognitive fatigue [5 items], and emotional fatigue [4 items]). A total fatigue score (range 0 to 70) was obtained by summing the 20 item scores ranging from 0 to 3, except for item 1 (0-10), item 2 (0-7) and item 3 (0-2). Higher scores reflect greater fatigue. If only 1 domain was missing it was replaced by the mean of the others; otherwise, the total score was not calculated. The changes from Baseline to any time point were averaged among all participants, where negative changes indicated better quality of life.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Fluctuations of Disease Activity in Rheumatoid Arthritis (FLARE) Questionnaire Score at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 40, 52, and 64</title>
        <description>FLARE is a 13-item questionnaire assessed disease flares between two medical consultations. Each item score ranged from 0 (completely untrue) to 10 (absolutely true) on a 6-step scale. The FLARE questionnaire global score (range = 0-10) is a mean score of 11 of the 13 items [items 6 ('doses of pain killers or anti-inflammatory medication') and 13 ('need for help') not taken into account], with the highest score corresponding to the highest disease activity. The global score was computed if at least the scores of 6 items were available. The changes from Baseline to any time point were averaged among all participants, where negative changes indicated better outcome.</description>

Synovitis total score was calculated by adding the sum of scores for each joint for a total score ranging from 0 to 42. A score of 0 indicated no damage and a score of 42 indicated most severe damage. The changes from Baseline to any time point were averaged among all participants, where negative changes indicated better outcome.</description>
