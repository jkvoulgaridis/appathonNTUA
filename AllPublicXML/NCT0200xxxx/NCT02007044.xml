    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies ibrutinib with or without rituximab in treating
      patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia that has come back after treatment. Ibrutinib may
      stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.
      Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, may help the body's immune
      system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and
      spread. It is not yet known whether ibrutinib is more effective with or without rituximab in
      treating chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate in treated patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine safety and tolerability, the overall response rate (ORR), the estimated PFS,
      changes in immune parameters (lymphocyte subpopulations, immunoglobulin levels) and biomarker
      responses in relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients receiving ibrutinib (i)
      versus ibrutinib and rituximab (iR).

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive ibrutinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses repeat
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive ibrutinib as in Arm I beginning on day 1 or 2. Patients also receive
      rituximab intravenously (IV) over 3-8 hours on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of course 1 and day 1 of
      courses 2-6. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 60 days and then every 4
      months for 5 years.
