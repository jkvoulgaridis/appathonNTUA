  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this Phase I/IIa study is to identify a safe and tolerable dosage regimen of
      intravenously administered otelixizumab. In addition, the C-peptide decline in new onset type
      1 diabetes mellitus (NOT1DM) patients and possible immunological mechanisms will be
      investigated with a view to identifying trends and early immunological biomarkers which could
      predict response in halting/slowing Beta-cell destruction in this patient population.

      This exploratory study will explore the safety and tolerability between the well tolerated
      but non-efficacious cumulative dose of 3.1 mg and a cumulative dose of 48 mg at which
      efficacy based on C-peptide analysis was demonstrated, albeit with evidence of Epstein Barr
      Virus (EBV) reactivation and Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS). Exploration of the tolerability
      dose response is considered a necessary first step to determining the therapeutic index of
      otelixizumab.

             intravenous (i.v.) antibiotics to resolve; other infections, e.g., bronchitis,
             sinusitis, localized cellulitis, candidiasis, or urinary tract infections, must be
             assessed on a case-by-case basis by the investigator regarding whether they are

        <title>Change From Baseline in C-Peptide Weighted Mean (Area Under Curve From 0 to 120 Minutes [AUC0-120 Minutes]) From Mixed Meal Tolerance Test</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected at indicated time points to assess levels of C-peptide. Day -1 was considered as Baseline. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline value from the specified time point value. Mixed meal-stimulated C-peptide AUC was calculated from area under C-peptide/time curve from time 0 to 120 minutes, using trapezoidal rule. ITT treated population comprised of all randomized participants who received at least one dose of study treatment.</description>
