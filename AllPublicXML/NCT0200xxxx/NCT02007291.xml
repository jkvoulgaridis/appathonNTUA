  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Life expectancy in Brazil has increased markedly over the last 30 years. Hence, age-related
      disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), warrant special attention due to their high
      prevalence in the elderly. Pharmacologic treatment of AD is based on cholinesterase
      inhibitors (ChEI) and memantine, leading to modest clinical benefits both in the short and
      long-term.

      However, clinical response is heterogeneous and needs further investigation. Objective: To
      investigate the rate of response to ChEI in AD after three months of treatment. Methods:
      Patients with mild or moderate dementia due to probable AD or to AD associated with
      cerebrovascular disease were included in the study.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The subjects were assessed at baseline and again after three months of ChEI treatment.
      Subjects were submitted to the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Mattis Dementia Rating
      Scale, Katz Basic Activities of Daily Living, Pfeffer Functional Activities Questionnaire,
      Neuropsychiatric Inventory and Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia. Good response was
      defined by a gain of ≥2 points on the MMSE after three months of treatment in relation to
      baseline.

    <time_frame>three months</time_frame>
    <description>Patients presented mild or moderate dementia according to the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR). None of the individuals had been treated with Cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEI) or memantine before study entry. Donepezil, galantamine or rivastigmine were prescribed to the patients according to the clinicians' preferences. All participants were evaluated by one board certified geriatrician (LFJRM) at baseline and after 3 months of treatment, as part of an ongoing 12-month responder analysis study of ChEI in Alzheimer's Disease. The main domain examined and the evaluation tools was cognition and Mini-Mental State Examination- MMSE, respectively. MMSE scores range from 0 to 30, while the greater value is associated with a better cognition state. An increase of 2 or more points in MMSE was considered as response.</description>

      A blood sample was drawn from the patients on the first consultation for use in DNA
      extraction and Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotyping. For the patients who were taking
      donepezil, after three, six and twelve months of treatment another blood sample were also
      drawn, separated in plasma and kept into the freezer at - 70 Celsius degree for further
      analysis of serum level of donepezil.

Donepezil, rivastigmine or galantamine were prescribed to the patients according to the clinicians’ preferences. The target dosages considered for treatment effect evaluation were 5 to 10 mg for donepezil, 16 to 24 mg for galantamine and 6 to 12 mg for rivastigmine. The first investigator (LFJRM) did not have any influence on the prescription.</description>

          <title>Independence for Daily Activities Response After Three Months of Treatment With ChEI in Mild and Moderate Alzheimer's Disease</title>
          <description>Patients presented mild or moderate dementia according to the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR). None of the individuals had been treated with Cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEI) or memantine before study entry. Donepezil, galantamine or rivastigmine were prescribed to the patients according to the clinicians' preferences. All participants were evaluated by one board certified geriatrician (LFJRM) at baseline and after 3 months of treatment, as part of an ongoing 12-month responder analysis study of ChEI in AD. The secondary domain examined was independence for daily activities and the evaluation tools used was the brazilian version of the Pfeffer Functional Activities Questionnaire (PFAQ). PFAQ scale range from 0 to 30 points and the greater value is associated with a greater dependence in daily activities.</description>
