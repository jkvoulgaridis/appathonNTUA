  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dehydrated stomatocytosis is a genetic disorder characterized by chronic hemolysis, variable
      anemia and erythrocyte dehydration. Causative mutations have been identified in either the
      Gardos (KCNN4) channel or the mechanosensitive channel PIEZO1. Senicapoc is a selective
      blocker of the Gardos channel that has been extensively studied in sickle cell disease and
      shown to be safe with limited side-effects. However, senicapoc did not meet the designated
      clinical endpoints in a pivotal phase 3 trial. The present study is an explanatory,
      proof-of-concept study of Senicapoc administered once daily in patients with familial
      dehydrated stomatocytosis caused by the autosomal dominant V282M mutation in the Gardos
      (KCNN4) channel.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is an explanatory, proof-of-concept study of Senicapoc administered once
      daily in patients with familial dehydrated stomatocytosis caused by the autosomal dominant
      V282M mutation in the Gardos (KCNN4) channel. The study population will include up to 6
      members of the same family, all carrying the V282M mutation and meeting study criteria for
      inclusion and exclusion. Patients will begin the study with a loading dose of 20 mg/day for 4
      days followed by a dose of 10 mg once daily for the first 4 weeks of study.

      After 4 weeks at the initial dose, patients will be escalated to higher doses (in 3 steps of
      10 mg every 4 weeks) to a maximal dose of 40 mg once daily.

      Patients who demonstrate response in the primary endpoints at the end of the efficacy study,
      and who have not been permanently discontinued due to Senicapoc-attributed serious adverse
      events (SAE), will be eligible for a 12-month study extension at the dose determined to be
      effective in the treatment efficacy study.

      Patients who meet inclusion criteria will be enrolled at visit 0, and if available, will be
      provided with the appropriated instrument to record daily pain scores and other QOL
      indicators. Treatment will begin at Visit 1, which will follow visit 0 after 2-3 weeks. After
      an effective dose and tolerated has been established in the dose escalation period, patients
      will be seen every two weeks until they reach 24 weeks of treatment. Patients will be seen
      for a potential maximum of 19 visits in the treatment efficacy phase of the study, with
      additional phone contacts after the first week of treatment and within a week from each dose
      escalation.

      At the end of the efficacy portion of the study, patients will be eligible to participate in
      a one-year optional open-label extension, provided that they have not been permanently
      discontinued from the study.

Up to 6 members of the family are eligible to enroll in this study, which will assess effectiveness based on individual changes of primary endpoints over individually established baselines.</description>

    <description>This study is conducted as open label, with each patient's response determined with an adaptive Bayesian model based on historical and baseline values for the primary endpoints of the trial. 3 monthly dose escalation steps will assess the efficacy of senicapoc in a dose range (10-40 mg/day) which has been used in prior trials for other indications.</description>
