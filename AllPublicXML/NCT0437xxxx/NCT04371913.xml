  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to investigate the feasibility of enabling a second chance for
      breast conservation in patients with in-breast recurrences after a previous lumpectomy and
      RT, investigators propose to test partial breast irradiation with the target volume
      encompassing the entire surgical bed with 1.0-1.5 cm margins.

      Patients will be treated with the fractionation of 30 Gy in 5 fractions over 1-2 weeks, which
      is the accelerated fractionation scheme of choice for Radiation Therapy (RT) naïve patients
      at New York Presbyterian using EBRT.

      The main aim of the study is to evaluate the rate of early grade 3 toxicities with this
      approach.

    <description>The primary endpoint of the study is to test the feasibility in terms of acute toxicity of a protocol of partial breast re-irradiation for breast cancer treatment in a previously irradiated whole breast, as defined by the rate of grade ≥ 3 treatment-related skin, fibrosis, and breast pain AEs, as graded by CTCAE version 5.0.</description>

    <description>The Breast Cancer Treatment Outcomes Scale (BCTOS) will be used to evaluate patient-reported cosmetic outcome, functional status, and breast pain. Each BCTOS subscale (cosmetic, functional status, and breast pain) is calculated by computing the arithmetic mean of the answers to each item relevant to a given subscale. The score is a continuous variable ranging from 1 to 4, with 1 indicating no difference between the treated and untreated breast, 2 indicating a slight difference, 3 indicating a moderate difference, and 4 indicating a large difference.</description>
