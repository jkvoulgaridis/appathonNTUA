  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The long-term courses after bariatric surgery are not sufficiently known. Furthermore there
      is a heterogeneity in postoperative responses.

      The aim of this study is to investigate the glycemic course (prediabetes, development of
      diabetes) of patients with obesity (BMI&gt;=35 kg/m2) who had undergone bariatric surgery
      compared to patients with obesity who have not. A further aim is to investigate predictors of
      weight development, development of body composition and insulin sensitivity of patients who
      had undergone bariatric surgery compared to obesity patients who have not undergone bariatric
      surgery. The long-term courses after different surgical procedures (Roux-Y vs Sleeve) will be
      compared.

      In this study 300 patients with obesity who had been metabolically characterized in a
      previous study will be recruited.

      These patients are examined (medical history, physical examination including ECG, BIA,
      weight, height) and metabolically characterized.

      Participants without diabetes undergo a glucose tolerance test and fasting blood sampling
      will be performed in participants with diabetes. All patients complete questionnaires to
      activity, nutrition, life quality, impulsiveness, depression and eating behavior.

      Randomly selected participants will be offered an abdominal fat tissue biopsy. When consent
      is given, this will be performed at least two days after the glucose tolerance test.
