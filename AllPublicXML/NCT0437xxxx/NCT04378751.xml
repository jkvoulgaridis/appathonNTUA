  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Part of standard of care, the cancer genetic risk assessment (CGRA) is administered via
      tablet computer, providers are notified via EMR and CGRA printout if a patient is recommended
      for genetic evaluation. The provider decides to issue/ not issue an order for genetic
      counseling. As part of research, the Patient Navigator schedules genetic counseling
      appointments for those who receive an order and wish to attend. Patient Navigators contact
      the provider for the order if not already in the EMR, schedules genetic counseling
      appointments, addresses any barriers to attendance, monitors appointment attendance and
      confirms attendance in the EMR. The Patient Navigator will not mention the research study
      participation in any notes that are entered into the Electronic Medical Record nor any
      medical records.

      Participants will be recruited from the pool of African American women aged 25 years or older
      that were classified as high risk for developing breast cancer based on the results of the
      cancer genetic risk assessment (CGRA) completed as part of clinic intake. As part of standard
      of care, the CGRA is administered via tablet computers and results are uploaded to the EMR.
      The PCP will receive a hard copy of CGRA results and a written reminder to provide genetic
      counseling order for patient if clinically appropriate, discuss the results of CGRA with the
      patient, and determine whether to provide an order for genetic counseling. The intake
      receptionist will also notify Patient Navigators (trained on protocol and informed consent)
      of women recommended for genetic counseling based on CGRA by giving Patient Navigators a
      printout of patient CGRA results and Medical Record Number (MRN). The results of the CGRA,
      including the identifiers, will be used to determine eligibility and to locate the patient
      EMR.After patients complete their clinic appointments, Patient Navigators will invite
      patients to participate in the study using a recruitment script and a recruitment flyer. If
      the participant is interested in participating in the study, the Patient Navigator will
      screen for eligibility using a checklist and obtain informed consent.
