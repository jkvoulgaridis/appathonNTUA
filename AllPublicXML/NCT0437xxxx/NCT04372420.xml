  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study evaluated clinically and radiographically the regenerative potential of
      rhBMP-2 in absorbable sponge and PRF in Grade II furcation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      44 subjects were enrolled in the study. PPD, CAL, plaque index and gingival index were
      recorded and the evaluation of bone fill was performed after 6 months by using ImageJ®
      software. After 6 months, the bone fill obtained with rhBMP-2 was higher when compared to
      PRF. From this trial conducted over a period of 6 months, the unique properties associated
      with rhBMP-2 in absorbable sponge makes it a potential agent to be used as a graft material
      for Grade II furcation defects.

    <description>For preparation of PRF, patient's venous blood is collected into 10ml glass tube or glass-coated plastic tube and centrifuged at 2700 rpm for 12min which leads to two different layers in the test tube, the upper platelet rich fibrin and the lower RBC portion. The formed PRF clot could then be removed from the glass tube and used in grade II furcation</description>
