  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a postmarketing requirement jointly carried out by four NDA holders (Bayer AG,
      Bracco, GE Healthcare and Guerbet and the CRO IQVIA.

      The study aims to create detailed images of the organs and tissue of the human body during
      x-ray, CT-scan or MRI investigations, doctors are using contrast media (a kind of dye) which
      can be given to patients by injection into a blood vessel or by mouth.

      In this study researchers want to find out whether so called gadolinium-based contrast agents
      (GBCAs) have an effect on body movement and mental skills when given to participants multiple
      times within 5 years.

      The study plans to enroll about 2076 participants suffering from a condition for which they
      are likely to have at least annually a MRI or another imaging examinations. Only adults up to
      65 years will be considered to join this study. During the study duration of 5 years
      participants will receive annually a MRI or other imaging tests (such as CT-scan, x-ray) and
      will visit the study doctor at least 7 times for physical examinations, laboratory
      investigations and tests on body movement and mental skills.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to assess the potential effect of repeated exposure to
      either a linear or a macrocyclic gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA) on change from
      baseline to Year 5 in composite measure of motor and cognitive function among neurologically
      normal adults in comparison to a matched non-GBCA- exposed control group.

      The secondary objectives comprise the assessment of the following endpoints in GBCA-exposed
      participants as compared to controls a) changes from baseline in composite measure of motor
      and cognitive function post-baseline on yearly basis (Years 1 to 4); b) changes from baseline
      in each individual test of motor and cognitive function on yearly basis (Years 1 to 5). Total
      Gd concentrations in blood and urine samples on yearly basis (Years 1 to 5) and adverse
      events will be collected as secondary objectives.

      Of note : The study is considered interventional because of the addition of UE-MRI scans for
      all participants, as well as blood sampling and the administration of the motor and cognitive
      tests. The GBCA administered as part of the contrast-enhanced MR imaging in the experimental
      arms is not the intervention in this study. Neither the protocol nor the investigators assign
      patients to a specific GBCA as part of the study, making this part of the study observational
      rather than interventional. The participants were already scheduled, prior to study
      screening, to undergo CE-MRI as part of their clinical care. The choice of GBCA for the
      CE-MRI will be based on medical need and institutional usage of GBCA, independent of study
      participation.
