  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dementia, a part of geriatric syndrome, is characterized by the deterioration of multiple
      cognitive domains such as memory, language, orientation, learning and personality as a result
      of damage to the central nervous system and in terms prognosis persistent and often
      progressive clinical condition. In the epidemiological studies it is stated that the number
      of the dementia affected people approximately 2 times in every 20 years. In several studies,
      it has been mentioned that cognitive disorders affect individuals' motor function such as
      gait and postural responses. These effects lead to a vicious circle by causing immobilization
      of individuals due to a decrease in cognitive functions in addition to immobilization due to
      aging. The lack of pharmacological therapies to change the prognosis of dementia, emphasizes
      physical activity methods due to its neurological contributions. However, due to the fact
      that conventional exercise programs are seen as boring in terms of elderly individuals and
      the exercise attendance rates are low, the virtual reality (VR) training have been preferred
      recently. To the best of the investigator's knowledge, there is no study examining the effect
      of different virtual reality trainings on the spatio-temporal characteristics of the gait,
      posture and balance. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of different
      virtual reality trainings on these parameters.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>gait speed</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline at 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Gait speed was assessed by BTS G-Walk inertial sensor. The sensor, connected to the Lumbal 4-5 intervertebral space via a semi-elastic belt, transfers the spatiotemporal characteristics of the gait to the computer via Bluetooth® 3.0 (G-Studio® software). In our study, participants were asked to walk in a corridor of 8 meters.</description>

    <measure>Spatiotemporal Characteristics of Gait</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline at 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Spatiotemporal characteristics of gait was assessed by BTS G-Walk inertial sensor. The assessed characteristics were cadence, stride length, left and right step length, step length/height ratio, gait cycle time,stance phase %, swing phase%, double support %, single support %. The sensor, connected to the Lumbal 4-5 intervertebral space via a semi-elastic belt, transfers the spatiotemporal characteristics of the gait to the computer via Bluetooth® 3.0 (G-Studio® software). In our study, participants were asked to walk in a corridor of 8 meters.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Berg Balance Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline at 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Berg Balance Scale (BBS) was used to evaluate static balance ability.It is a widely used and validated scale for elderly people. Validity and reliability of BBS in Turkish was established by Sahin et al. The scale includes 14 functional activities such as transfers, turning, taking objects from the ground. Each activity scores between 0-4 and high scores indicate good balance ability.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Timed Up and Go Test</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline at 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Timed Up and Go Test (TUGT) was used to assessed dynamic balance ability. Participants were asked to stand up from the chair, walk 3 meters and go back and sit on the chair. Performance time recorded in seconds.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>New York Posture Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline at 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>New York Posture Scale was used to evaluate upright posture. It evaluates head, shoulders, spine, hip and foot alignment in the frontal plane. It evaluates head, thorax, shoulders, upper thoracic region, trunk, abdomen and lower lumbar region alignment in the sagittal plane. In total, 13 regions are evaluated. Each item on the scale gets 1, 3 or 5 points depending on the degree of deviation from the normal. High scores represent a good posture.</description>

    <description>Microsoft Xbox 360 Kinect The exercises were advanced from simple to complex. The program started with exercises in a sitting position. In the next stage, the games requiring weight transfer and use of upper limbs in standing position were continued. The program ended with games that require more complex movements such as lunge and mini squats.</description>
