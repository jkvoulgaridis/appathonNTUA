  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Threatened preterm labor (TPL) is defined by cervical changes and regular and painful uterine
      contractions occurring between 24 and 36 + 6 weeks of gestation that may or may not lead to
      premature labor and delivery. There is no reliable way to predict preterm delivery.

      The study's hypothesis is that the Premaquick® test can improve the prediction of preterm
      delivery.

      The investigators also want to compare this test with the Partosure® (Placental alpha
      microglobulin-1) test.

    <description>Vaginal secretions are collected prior to any vaginal or endovaginal ultrasound examination to avoid false positives, with the nylon swab provided with the test (placed in the posterior fornix of the vagina for 10 seconds).Then the samples are tested with the Premaquick test. Results are obtained in 10 minutes.</description>
