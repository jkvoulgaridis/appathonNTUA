  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      to evaluate effect of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) on mandibular condylar volume and
      position after treatment of Class II malocclusion with Twin Block (TB) functional therapy via
      cone beam computed tomography (CBCT).

      Materials and methods: Twenty eight growing patients, 14 boys and 14 girls ranged in age 9-12
      years, were randomly divided into control group (mean initial age 10.64±1.36 years) and laser
      group (mean initial age 10.55 1.45 years). All patients treated with TB appliance where
      Gallium aluminum arsenide diode laser applied in one group weekly around TMJ region for 12
      sessions in three months with set parameters: continuous 635 nm, 50 mW, 4.5J/cm2, 45 seconds/
      point, total dose per side 11.25J. CBCT were obtained before and immediately after TB
      therapy, in addition to routine orthodontic records. Changes in TMJ and skeletal variables
      were analyzed and compared within and between both groups.

    <description>12 patients treated with twin block functional appliance with low-level laser application with the following set parameters; 635 nm wavelength in continuous-wave mode, 50 mw power output, 4.5 J/cm2 energy density, 11.25 J total dose per side, 45 seconds/ point, and 8 mm fiber optic tip diameter. The laser was applied at five points located within TMJ region on both right and left sides in contact with skin as follows: lateral, superior, anterior, posterior, and posterior- inferior points. Laser application was repeated weekly for three months according to a standard protocol</description>

    <description>In the laser group, patients received LLLT from a semiconductor Gallium Aluminum Arsenide diode laser (SMARTMPRO, LASOTRONIX, Poland) with the following set parameters; 635 nm wavelength in continuous-wave mode, 50 mw power output, 4.5 J/cm2 energy density, 11.25 J total dose per side, 45 seconds/ point, and 8 mm fiber optic tip diameter. Laser was applied (Fig.2) at five points located within TMJ region on both right and left sides in contact with skin as follows: lateral, superior, anterior, posterior, and posterior- inferior points.</description>
