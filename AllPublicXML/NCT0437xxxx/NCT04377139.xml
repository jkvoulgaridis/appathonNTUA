  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Lung transplant recipients (LTR) have the highest risk of CMV infection. CMV
      pneumonitis, lymphocytic bronchitis, and detection of CMV DNA in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid
      are independent risk factors for the development of chronic lung allograft dysfunction
      (CLAD). However, to demonstrate the clinical impact of the indirect effects of CMV, it is
      necessary to conduct studies with a very large sample size.

      Hypothesis: The different current preventive strategies for CMV infection in LTR and their
      clinical application on a daily basis impact on the development of direct and indirect
      effects of CMV in this population.

      Objectives: To study the effect of CMV infection on LTR in relation to current preventive
      strategies in terms of:

        -  The incidence of acute and chronic rejection

        -  The incidence of other opportunistic infections

        -  The incidence of neoplastic disease, especially, post-transplant lymphoproliferative
           disease

        -  Patient and graft survival Methods: Multicenter, retrospective, cohort study.
           Consecutive inclusion of all adult lung transplant recipients from 2013 to 2017 with 2
           years of follow-up. The investigators will collect and analyze the main clinical and
           microbiological variables in order to respond to the objectives of the study.

      Relevance: Knowing in detail the current epidemiology of CMV infection in LTR and its
      subsequent influence on both mortality and the presence of different complications, could
      allow improving the management of these patients in the future.
