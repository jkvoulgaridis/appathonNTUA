  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Potential subjects with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) will be identified by
      gastroenterologists (study investigators). Twelve eligible subjects with NAFLD will be
      randomly assigned to receive either active fecal microbiota transplantation in orally
      administered capsules or Placebo capsules and dosed twice weekly for 12 weeks. .

    <measure>Microbiome Diversity in Fecal Samples as Indicated by the Shannon Diversity Index</measure>
    <time_frame>10 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Shannon diversity index is used to characterize species diversity in a community. Shannon's index accounts for both abundance and evenness of the species present. A high index value would represent a diverse and equally distributed community, and lower values represent a less diverse community. A value of 0 would represent a community with just one species. Typical values are generally between 1.5 and 3.5.</description>

    <description>The SF-36 will be administered at enrollment, follow-up clinic visits at Week 13 and 9 month, and early termination visit. Rapid Eating Assessment for Patients (REAP) is to help quickly assess diet and physical activity of individuals. In addition, subjects will be asked to maintain a paper diary recording number of BM per day and type of each BM after enrollment. Information such as hospitalizations or mortality from any cause will be collected as part of the health outcomes assessment throughout this study.</description>
