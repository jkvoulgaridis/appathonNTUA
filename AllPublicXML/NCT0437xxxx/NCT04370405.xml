  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral YY-20394 in patients
      with R/R follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who have failed at least two prior systemic
      therapies.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in China to provide safety and efficacy data from this region. A
      Safety Run-in will be conducted to confirm the safety of the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D),
      80 mg once daily, in a Asian population. PK samplings at Cycle 1, Day 1 will be taken.
