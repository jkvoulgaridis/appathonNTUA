  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Previous studies report that daily pecan consumption reduces cholesterol in
      healthy adults while promoting weight maintenance.

      Purpose: To examine the impact of daily pecan consumption with and without dietary
      substitution instructions for an 8-week period on markers of health in adults at risk for
      cardiovascular disease.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a single-blind, randomized controlled trial. The investigators recruited subjects
      with hypercholesterolemia (high blood cholesterol levels) or at higher risk for
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) (BMI &gt; 28 kg/m2). Subjects were randomized into one of three
      groups: (1) the no nut group (CON), (2) pecan ADD (no diet instructions), and (3) pecan SUB
      (instructions to substitute pecans with isocaloric foods in habitual diet).

      There was a screening visit and 3 testing visits: Baseline (visit 1), mid-visit at week 4
      (visit 2), and post-visit at week 8 (visit 3). Anthropometrics, questionnaires, and a fasting
      blood sample were collected at each visit. A subset of participants participated in a
      saturated fatty acid meal challenge in which additional blood and metabolism measurements
      were collected.

      Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesized that daily pecan consumption would result in
      significantly greater improvements in blood lipids, metabolism, and appetite compared to the
      control group. The investigators also hypothesized that pecan ADD group will result in a
      larger increase in body weight compared to the pecan SUB and control groups.
