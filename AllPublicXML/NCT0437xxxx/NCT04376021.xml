  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To test the hypothesis that increased mother-infant physical contact affects the likelihood
      of mothers exclusively breastfeeding their child for the first six months of life, the
      investigators will randomly assign half of the participating mothers to receive a baby
      carrier to use with their baby (to facilitate increased physical contact) while the other
      half of babies and mothers will receive standard care.

      One hundred mothers participating in the California Border Healthy Start (CBHS) program will
      be randomly assigned to the physical contact group or the control group. Mothers in the
      physical contact group will be provided with an infant carrier to use from birth to
      facilitate increased mother-infant physical contact. In the control group, mothers will be
      provided with an infant carrier, but will not receive the carrier until postpartum week 24,
      once study measures have been collected. This type of multiple-baseline design will allow the
      investigators to objectively assess the effect of physical contact during the first six
      months, but will also ensure that mothers in both groups have the opportunity to benefit from
      the potentially positive intervention of a high quality infant carrier to promote increased
      mother-infant physical contact. The two groups will be compared on: 1) likelihood of
      exclusive breastfeeding, 2) extent of breastfeeding exclusivity (proportion of feeds that are
      breastmilk versus formula or other), 3) likelihood of initiating feeding in response to
      hunger cues versus crying (i.e., maternal responsiveness during feeding), 4) maternal score
      on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), 5) prevalence of breastfeeding
      difficulties, 6) score on the Mother-Infant Bonding Scale, and 7) beliefs about breastfeeding
      and infant care.
