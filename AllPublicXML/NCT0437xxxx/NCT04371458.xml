  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate whether intraoperative pleural lavage with providone-iodine following complete
      resection and pleural reductive surgery for stage IVA thymoma reduces recurrent rates
      compared to surgery without providone-iodine lavage
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following the surgical portion of the procedure, assuming frozen section confirms the
      suspected diagnosis, pleural lavage using 10% povidone-iodine (warmed to normothermic 37Â°C)
      will begin. The 10% povidone-iodine is mixed with sterile water with a dilution of 1/10. A
      total of 6-14 liters of solution will be prepared in advance of the procedure, pending the
      size of the patient's chest cavity. The warmed PVP-I will be instilled into the chest cavity
      to a volume that fills involved thoracic cavity or cavities. Once filled, the solution will
      be allowed to dwell for 15 minutes. At the conclusion of the 15 minutes, the PVP-I solution
      will be suctioned out of the chest. This process will be repeated for a total of three dwell
      sessions.

      At the conclusion of the PVP-I lavage, chest tubes should be placed in the chest cavity to
      re-expand the lung adequately. Chest tube management will be at the discretion of the
      individual thoracic surgeons, including suction vs water seal and plan for removal.

      An honest attempt to maintain the management according to the study protocol will be made.
      However, if it deemed inappropriate for that patient due to clinical signs, symptoms, or
      anticipated problems, the surgical team can make whatever changes are deemed necessary. The
      reason for the deviation must be documented. This patient's data will continue to be
      collected and analyzed on an intent-to-treat basis for the primary, secondary and tertiary
      endpoints.

    <description>Pleural recurrence will be assessed with CT scans of the chest every 6 months starting 6 months after the index operation and continuing for 3 years. After 3 years, if no recurrence has been identified yet, patients will get CT scans of the chest on an annual basis.</description>

    <description>Overall survival will be assessed by regular patient evaluations, which will correspond with the CT scans of the chest. If a patient expires, date and cause of death will be recorded. Causes related to thymic malignancy will be differentiated from other causes of mortality to arrive at disease-specific survival and all-cause overall survival.</description>

    <description>Identification of patient and disease characteristics associated with improved responses to providone-iodine lavage.
Variables examined will include demographic data such as age, sex and comorbidities. Additional data evaluated will include specific aspects of the primary thymic tumor such as burden of thoracic disease (confined to mediastinum, extension into ipsilateral pleura, burden of disease in pleura), and pathology characteristics (WHO Type, level of differentiation).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group - PS 0 or 1

          -  Patients with a histologic diagnosis of thymic epithelial tumor (thymoma WHO type A,
             AB, B1, B2, B3; or thymic carcinoma) who in the opinion of the attending thoracic
             surgeon can technically receive a macroscopic complete resection of pleural nodules.
             This histologic diagnosis can be obtained either preoperatively, or based on frozen
             section intra-operatively.

          -  Signed informed consent form

          -  Completely resectable burden of disease

             nodules and intrathoracic lymph node metastasis as evidenced by CT chest, physical
             examination, and any other indicated studies

          -  Medically suitability for resection as determined by the operating surgeon

          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative urinary pregnancy test

             patient will be removed from protocol and the providone-iodine lavage will not be
             performed.

          -  Radiographic evidence of disease beyond the primary site and pleural space
