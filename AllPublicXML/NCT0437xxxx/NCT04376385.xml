    <textblock>
      Grief is an intense emotional reaction to the loss of a loved one. It produces feelings of
      regret and longing that usually decrease over time. However, some people have difficulty
      adapting to the loss and develop Prolonged Grief Disorder (PGD).

      A multiple-baseline case series study will be conducted to investigate the efficacy and
      effectiveness of an Internet delivered cognitive behavior treatments (ICBT) for adult people
      diagnosed with prolonged grief disorder (PGD). There will be at least 6 participants. Three
      baseline periods will be established (9,12 and 15 days). Participants will be randomly
      assigned to each of them (two for each condition). During this period, daily evaluations will
      be carried out using a mobile app. After the baseline, patients will perform the self-applied
      treatment protocol through the internet.
