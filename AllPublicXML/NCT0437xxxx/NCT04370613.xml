  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research has shown that mental imagery appears to carry emotion better than verbal
      communication. One way this can be noted is that emotional mental imagery trigger
      physiological arousal responses. These may be important for treatment techniques using mental
      imagery, such as imaginal exposure and imagery re-scripting. However, as the development of
      clinical applications increasingly considers the use of flashpoint imagery, i.e. mental
      imagery of short duration, it is of interest to examine whether also flashpoint imagery
      trigger arousal responses. This study examines the arousal response to flashpoint imagery of
      different valence (positive, negative, and neutral).

      Moreover, emerging evidence suggest that depressed individuals find it more difficult to
      produce mental imagery of positive future events (less accessible and vivid) than healthy
      controls. In addition, individuals with clinical anxiety appear to be able to produce imagery
      of negative future events more easily than healthy controls. This study explores whether
      these results can be noted also in sub-clinical symptoms of depression and anxiety, and if
      so, if they are accompanied with corresponding changes in arousal responses.

      This study takes part in a single session. Participants will produce flashpoint imagery of
      future events while skin conductance responses, imagery vividness ratings, valence and
      arousal ratings are collected. Participants will also fill in questionnaires on depression
      and anxiety symptoms, as well as a questionnaire measuring general propensity for mental
      imagery.
