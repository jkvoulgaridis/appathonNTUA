  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-arm phase II platform-basket screening study designed to test multiple
      experimental therapies simultaneously in patients with neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) with
      associated progressive tumors of vestibular schwannomas (VS), non-vestibular schwannomas
      (non-VS), meningiomas, and ependymomas.

      This Master Study is being conducted as a &quot;basket&quot; study that may allow people with multiple
      tumor types associated with NF2 to receive new drugs throughout this study. Embedded within
      the Master Study are individual drug substudies.

      - Investigational Drug Sub-study A: Brigatinib
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of investigational drugs to learn whether the drug(s) works in treating a
      specific disease.

      The Master study is intended to enroll participants who will be placed into different
      treatment arms (sub-studies) which will each have an additional consent and enrollment
      processes.

      -- The research study procedures include screening for eligibility, randomization to an
      experimental treatment sub-study, if qualified, and observation for up to 10 years.

        -  Participants who have tumors grow during a treatment sub-study will be permitted to
           enroll in a different experimental treatment sub-study if they are eligible.

        -  Participants who are not eligible for enrollment in a different treatment sub-study will
           be permitted to remain under observation on the Master Study to understand the growth
           pattern of these tumors (natural history)

             -  Participants will be eligible to remain on this Master study for up to 10 years.

             -  It is expected that about 80 people will take part in the Master Study

             -  The study will randomize a maximum of 40 patients to each of the experimental arms.
                The overall size of the trial is not fixed by design because it include
                arm-dropping rules for futility and allow for the possibility of arm addition by
                amendment.

      Drug Sub-study A will test the activity of brigatinib for treatment of NF2-related tumors.

        -  Brigatinib is approved for the treatment of people with anaplastic lymphoma kinase
           (ALK)- positive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have progressed or are
           intolerant to crizotinib. In preclinical models, brigatinib has shown evidence of
           activity against models of NF2-deficient tumors.

           - It is expected that 40 people will take part in the Brigatinib Sub-study.

        -  The sub-study with brigatinib will include two stages.

        -  In Stage 1, 20 subjects with any allowable tumor type will be accrued to each arm. A
           minimum of 2 subjects per tumor type (vestibular schwannoma, non-vestibular schwannoma,
           meningioma, and ependymoma) must be accrued in Stage 1. Interim analysis will be
           performed after Stage 1 to determine the radiographic response rate (RR) for each tumor
           types. Subsequently, in stage 2, another 20 subjects will be accrued into the 2 baskets
           with the most promising early results. If the results are equally promising for more
           than 2 baskets, subjects will be allocated to the appropriate number of baskets.

        registration defined as either:

          -  at least 20% increase in volume of enhancing tumor

          -  at least 2 mm increase in greatest linear dimension of enhancing tumor

        Participants must have measurable disease, defined as:

          -  VS, non-VS, or meningioma target lesions that can be accurately measured as at least 1
             ml by volumetric MRI scan or in at least one dimension as â‰¥10 mm with conventional MRI

        Participant must have a target NF2-related tumor with the following qualities:

          -  Not amenable to surgery due to patient refusal or due to high risk for surgical
             complications (e.g., damage to nerve function). Participant must be â‰¥ 12 years of age
             on Day 1 of treatment. Life expectancy of greater than 1 year Karnofsky performance

             Study registration (or a minimum of 5 half-lives and resolution to baseline of
             toxicities unless there are irreversible toxicities from prior drug that do not
             influence risk of next drug).

          -  Participants who have received radiation to the target tumor within the last 3 years
             prior to Master study registration.

          -  Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  Participants with target or non-target nervous system tumors that, in the opinion of
             the treating investigator, are likely to require active treatment (including surgery)
             within 6 months of registration to the Master Study.

          -  History of a different malignancy, unless (a) have been disease-free for at least 2
             years and are deemed by the treating investigator to be at low risk for recurrence of
             that malignancy.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac

             study requirements.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the experimental agents may have
             the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown
             but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the
             mother with these experimental agents, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the
             mother is treated.

        Eligibility Criteria Specific to the Brigatinib Arm (substudy A):

        Inclusion criteria

          -  Participants must meet all eligibility criteria outlined in the Master Study

          -  Participants must be willing and able to provide written informed consent/assent for
             the brigatinib arm of the INTUITT-NF2 trial.

          -  Participant is â‰¥ 12 years of age and has body weight at least 40 kg on Day 1 of
             treatment.

          -  Patient must be able to swallow pills.

          -  Clinical laboratory values as specified below within 28 days before the first dose of
             study drug, as described in the protocol document:

          -  Female patients participating in this study should avoid becoming pregnant, and male
             patients should avoid impregnating a female partner. Non-sterilized female patients of
             reproductive age group and male patients should use effective methods of contraception
             through defined periods during and after study treatment as specified below:

        Female patients must meet 1 of the following:

          -  Postmenopausal for at least 1 year before the screening visit, or

          -  Surgically sterile, or

          -  If they are of childbearing potential, agree to practice 2 effective methods of
             contraception from the time of signing of the informed consent form through 4 months
             after the last dose of study drug, or agree to completely abstain from heterosexual
             intercourse. Brigatinib may decrease effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives,
             therefore, women are recommended to use non-hormonal methods of contraception. Highly
             effective non-hormonal birth control for women of child bearing potential with male
             partners includes:

               -  Sexual abstinence (no sexual intercourse)

               -  Intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS)

               -  Bilateral tubal ligation (both tubes tied)

               -  Vasectomized partner

        Male patients, even if surgically sterilized (i.e., status post-vasectomy) must agree to 1
        of the following:

        - Practice effective barrier contraception during the entire study treatment period and
        through 4 months after the last dose of study drug, or completely abstain from heterosexual
        intercourse.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Female patients who are both lactating and breastfeeding or have a positive serum
             pregnancy test during the screening period or a positive urine pregnancy test on Day 1
             before first dose of study drug (if applicable)

          -  Any serious medical or psychiatric illness that could, in the investigator's opinion,
             potentially interfere with the completion of treatment according to this protocol

          -  Treatment with any investigational products within 1 month or 5 half-lives (whichever
             is longer) before the first dose of study drug

          -  Had major surgery within 30 days of the first dose of brigatinib. Minor surgical
             procedures such as catheter placement or minimally invasive biopsies are allowed.

          -  Have significant, uncontrolled, or active cardiovascular disease (as outlined in the
             protocol):

          -  Have uncontrolled hypertension (defined as an average systolic blood pressure &gt;160 or
             an average diastolic blood pressure &gt;100 for adults; for children: please refer to
