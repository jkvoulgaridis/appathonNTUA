      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of palliative &quot;QUAD SHOT&quot; radiotherapy
      combined with pembrolizumab and evaluate the effects of the combination treatment patients
      with recurrent cancer of head and neck.

      During this study, patients will receive infusions of pembrolizumab with radiotherapy
      (palliative QUADSHOT regimen). The patient will receive treatment of pembrolizumab once every
      3 weeks and palliative &quot;QUAD SHOT&quot; radiotherapy every 4 weeks. These 28 day period of time is
      called a cycle. The cycle will be repeated 3 times. Each cycle is numbered in order. The
      patient will be treated for up to 3 cycles followed by pembrolizumab single drug until
      unacceptable toxicity or tumor progression.

      The patient will also complete a survey.

      Total duration of the study is up to two years.

    <description>Combination Treatment
Pembrolizumab by IV once on day 1 of 21 day cycle, begin 7 days before the first round of QUAD SHOT radiotherapy.
QUAD SHOT radiotherapy twice a day for two days, begin 7 days after the first dose of pembrolizumab; repeat every 28 days for up to 3 rounds.
Maintenance Treatment
Pembrolizumab by IV once on day 1 of 21 day cycle
