      Observational cohort prospective study with following of 150 newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes
      patients who were in 3 groups, had been monitored in a private clinic, each group 50 patients
      number, with 30 females and 20 males after written consent from all patients. The ages of all
      patients were between 35 and 55 years.

      The aim of this study was to evaluate colchicine effect on A1C of newly diagnosed type2
      diabetes compared to the metformin and control group on diet only.

      The first group patients received colchicine 0.5twice daily for 6 months, the second group
      received metformin 1gm twice daily, the third group patients were on diet only. During the
      period of treatment, the investigators followed the patients if there were side effects of
      the drugs used. No side effects were monitored during the period of treatment except for
      gastric upset in some patients using metformin
