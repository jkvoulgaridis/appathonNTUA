  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose evaluating the feasibility of using the novel cone beam computed
      tomography (CBCT)-guided Ethos system to deliver expedited, adaptive Quad shot radiation for
      the purpose of palliative radiation of patients with advanced head and neck cancers. Quad
      shot radiation was selected as the palliative regimen of choice given its low toxicity
      profile, well published efficacy in palliation, frequent usage in the US for palliation of
      head and neck cancers, and safety in the setting of re-irradiation. The use of the Ethos
      platform to perform online adaptive radiation planning and delivery remains novel and
      untested. The Ethos system would be used to consolidate CT simulation, replanning, and
      treatment for Quad shot patients receiving treatment with the benefit of reduced patient
      travel and a reduction in the unwanted delay between Quad shot cycles. The goal of this pilot
      study will be to evaluate the feasibility of the Ethos system to eliminate the need for a CT
      simulation for cycles 2 and 3 of Quad shot radiation.

    <description>-Radiotherapy will consist of Quad shot radiation delivered on the Ethos ring gantry kV-CBCT combined with linear accelerator system to a dose of 14 Gy in four, twice-daily fractions of 3.5 Gy delivered at least 6 hours apart over two consecutive days for a possible total of 3 cycles delivered in 3 to 4 intervals for a cumulative dose of of 42 Gy in 12 fractions. Cycle 2 and 3 of treatment is not mandated per protocol but may be given at the discretion of the treating physician.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  History of a head and neck malignancy. Past history of radiotherapy is allowed for
             inclusion and brain metastases are allowed for inclusion.

          -  Deemed medically fit for Quad shot radiation by treating physician

          -  At least 18 years of age.

          -  Ability to understand and willingness to sign an IRB approved written informed consent
             document (or that of legally authorized representative, if applicable).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        -Pregnant and/or breastfeeding. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative
        pregnancy test within 14 days of study entry. If pregnancy test is not clinically indicated
        as determined by treating physician or protocol PI, documentation of this exception is
        sufficient in lieu of pregnancy test.
