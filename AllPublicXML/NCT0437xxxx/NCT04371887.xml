  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cervical cancer screening is an important component of women's health care. Most adult women
      are familiar with the conventional screening modality, Pap test, which has successfully
      reduced the burden of cervical cancer in industrialized countries. However, Pap test has
      limited accuracy and can miss a progressing disease. Advancement in knowledge and technology
      has led to changes in national recommendations to focus on the testing of high-risk human
      papillomavirus (HPV) infection, the cause of cervical cancer. Screening with primary HPV
      testing detects more diseases compared with Pap test alone or co-testing, and requires less
      number of tests. However, despite the advantages of primary HPV screening over conventional
      approaches, the switch to primary HPV screening is limited in the United States. The
      scientific literature reports barriers at both the provider and women level, which include
      lack of knowledge, resistance, and attachment to Pap test. We currently have insufficient
      guidance on how to select and deploy implementation strategies most likely to facilitate use
      of newly recommended cancer screening modality. This project seeks to generate evidence
      regarding effective strategies to achieve successful implementation of the primary HPV
      testing for routine cervical cancer screening in a large community-based health care system.
      A successful implementation will be defined by uptake of the primary HPV screening, adequate
      knowledge of the HPV test for both patients and providers, and patient/provider satisfaction
      during the transition. This project is important to most adult women, as a timely adoption of
      the best evidence-based cancer screening approach means better patient outcomes. Further, the
      proposed project will not only inform about cervical cancer screening, but other clinical
      conditions when a physician practice change is recommended by professional societies and/or
      national guideline body. By engaging patients, providers and other professional stakeholders
      in this project, we ensure that successful project outcomes are those most important for
      women and their doctors. Further, the stakeholder partners will help ensure generalizability
      of our findings to other health care systems, design strategies that maximize completeness in
      data collection, and lead the dissemination effort for wide application of the knowledge to
      be gained in this project.

      Definition: Extended description of the protocol, including more technical information (as
      compared to the Brief Summary), if desired. Do not include the entire protocol; do not
      duplicate information recorded in other data elements, such as Eligibility Criteria or
      outcome measures.

      Limit: 32,000 characters.

      Background and Significance: Strong evidence supports testing for the high risk human
      papillomavirus (HPV) infection, the etiology agent of cervical cancer, in routine cervical
      cancer screening. In 2014, the FDA approved the first test for primary HPV screening. Between
      2015 and 2017, professional societies and national guideline bodies released practice
      recommendation for primary HPV screening. However, none of the large health care systems in
      the U.S. have systematically adopted this new screening strategy. Kaiser Permanente Southern
      California (KPSC) is preparing to transition to primary HPV screening in 2019, with
      considerable expected impact and barriers at multiple levels. There is a critical gap of
      knowledge on effective strategies to guide implementation of uptake of new evidence-based
      practice, especially around cancer screening where changes to clinical practice guidelines
      often created confusion among clinicians and patients. The overarching goals of this
      application is to generate insights and evidence regarding barriers and facilitators and
      effective strategies to achieve clinical practice substitution. Study Aims: SA1) Compare a
      local-tailored vs. a centralized approach for facilitating adoption of primary HPV testing
      for cervical cancer screening on (a) implementation outcomes including uptake of primary HPV
      screening, acceptability, appropriateness and feasibility; and (b) stakeholder-centered
      outcomes including knowledge, experience, behavior and satisfaction; SA2) Explain variations
      in implementation strategy effectiveness on study outcomes by multi-level factors; and SA3)
      Develop guidance for use of the effective implementation strategies in additional settings
      and for additional implementation problems. Study Descriptions: We will conduct a
      prospective, cluster randomized programmatic trial to compare and evaluate a local-tailored
      versus a centralized implementation approach. The local tailoring strategy will be guided by
      a structured process, using a menu of core functions and forms with evidence-based barrier
      assessment and intervention options. The centralized implementation will be based on the
      prevalent KPSC regional approach to new practice implementation, involving the design of a
      multi-component approach that is delivered in a relatively consistent manner. Twelve of the
      14 KPSC medical centers will be randomized to receive one of the two implementation
      approaches, with two medical centers serving as pilot sites. The study subject will include
      screening age women, primary care and obstetrics &amp; gynecology physicians, as well as clinic
      staff, administrators and operational leaders. The primary outcome of interest is uptake of
      primary HPV screening at the provider level. The secondary outcomes include
      stakeholder-centered outcomes such as knowledge and satisfaction, and additional
      implementation and system outcomes as well as implementation process evaluation. Data
      collection will be via electronic medical record extraction, patient and provider surveys,
      and semi-structured key-informant interviews. Multi-level models and generalized estimating
      equations will be used to evaluate the effect of the local-tailored approach on each outcomes
      of interest. Effect heterogeneity by multi-level factors will be examined by interaction
      terms. Content analysis will be used to evaluate qualitative data collected for Aims 1 and 3.
      We will use the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and the Theoretical
      Domains Framework (TDF) to inform our overall study approach and provide rigor and structure
      to our analyses.

    <intervention_model_description>This prospective study will use a cluster randomization design to compare two system-level implementation strategies for primary HPV screening, with outcomes measured at multiple levels. KPSC has 13 service areas linked to over 200 ambulatory clinics. Randomization will be performed at the service area level, since these are system-level implementation strategies. Service areas will first be matched in pairs on key attributes that may be associated with implementation success prior to randomization, such as the size and the number of clinics, access, and current screening rates. Thus, the two service areas in a matched pair will be most like each other in those attributes. Within each pair, the two service areas will then be randomized to determine which receives the local-tailored vs. hybrid usual care approach. The intervention period for both arms will take place immediately after the roll out of primary HPV screening.</intervention_model_description>
