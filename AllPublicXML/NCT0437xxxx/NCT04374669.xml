      The aim of the present study is to find out the influence of sarcopenia on outcomes of
      neuroplasty in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Frailty is an aging-related syndrome of physiological decline and correlated with sarcopenia.
      Furthermore, lumbar spinal stenosis is a common disease in the old population and a
      neuroplasty is widely used to treat these patients. We postulate that the sarcopenia may be
      associated with the outcome of neuroplasty in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis, and there
      is no study about this topic as far as we know.

      To evaluate this association, we will use the criteria for sarcopenia which is made by Asian
      Working Group for Sarcopenia in 2019 in this study. We will compare the outcome of
      neuroplasty in patients with sarcopenia and without sarcopenia using several tools such as
      numeric rating scale (NRS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and global perceived effect
      (GPE) score up to 6 months after the procedure.

    <time_frame>3 months after the procedure</time_frame>
    <description>We are going to assess 4 variables above and then decide who is a successful responder or not at 3 months after the procedure.
We defined the successful responders as follows;
≥ 50% or 4-point reduction from baseline leg Numeric rating scale and no increase from baseline Oswestry disability index and medication quantification scale and 4 points on the global perceived scale,
≥ 30% or 2 points reduction from baseline numeric rating scale with any one of the following criteria: simultaneous ≥ 30% (or 10-point) reduction in Oswestry disability index from baseline, or ≥ 5 points on global perceived effects scale, or no increase from the baseline medication quantification scale.
NRS, ODI, and MQS will be evaluated before the procedure and become baseline values.
NRS, ODI, and MQS will be re-evaluated, and GPE score will be newly evaluated 3 months after the procedure.</description>

    <description>The patient is placed in the prone position with a pillow placed under the abdomen to correct the lumbar lordosis. After sterile preparation and draping, the epidural space via the sacral hiatus using a 16 gauge needle is accessed. Then, the Racz catheter is advanced to the site of adhesions under the fluoroscopic guidance. The target site is determined by the location of pathology on lumbar MRI, preprocedural epidurography, and clinical symptoms before the adhesiolysis. Adhesiolysis is performed through the high-volume administration of medications, which consist of a combination of a steroid, local anesthetics, hyaluronidase, and 5% hypertonic saline. As needed, the catheter remains in the epidural space for two days, with the additional injection on each of the days.</description>
