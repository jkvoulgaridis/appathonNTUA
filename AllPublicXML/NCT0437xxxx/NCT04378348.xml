  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to Identify intervention priorities using a corner-based needs
      assessment to document occupational and psychosocial risk and protective factors that
      increase Latino day laborers(LDL) risk for injury and to design a culturally responsive and
      context appropriate Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 10-based safety
      intervention that also addresses psychosocial risks to reduce LDL injuries and
      collaboratively pilot a corner-level intervention and conduct an evaluation to assess the
      safety program's feasibility and acceptability as determined by the extent to which we can
      recruit, retain and follow-up LDL over the course of the study.

    <measure>Exposure to dangers in the workplace as assessed by a questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The questionnaire asks how often the participant has worked with asbestos, lead paint, Clorox, oil paint, solvents (such as paint thinner), insecticides (such as Raid), glue or adhesive, equipment that creates dust, gasoline or diesel, and cleaning solutions. Each of 10 items on the questionnaire are rated as 1 Never, 2 Sometimes, 3 Many Times, or 4 All the Time, with a total score ranging from 10 to 40, with higher scores indicating greater exposure to dangers in the workplace.</description>

    <description>The MI dialogue will begin with an introduction where the LDL is asked about the type of work he does and his concerns regarding dangers in his workplace. This will be followed by a decisional balance exercise where the interviewer will engage the LDL in thinking about the pros and cons of taking jobs with many dangers and jobs with less dangers. Using a figure of a traffic light, the interviewer will proceed to measure how important it is for the LDL to reduce the dangers in his work place and identify his reasons for its importance. Next, the interviewer will measure the LDL's level of confidence in his ability to reduce the dangers in his workplace.Together, they will develop a plan to reduce the dangers in the workplace. Finally, the interviewer will summarize the safety plan to the LDL and will explain that the team will return to the corner in one month to see how the implementation of his plan went and to conduct a post-test survey</description>

    <description>Participants will view a figure of a pyramid representing the steps they can take to reduce the dangers in their workplace and the things that are in their control to reduce the dangers followed by pictures of dangerous work environments. They will be engaged in hazard identification and situational awareness by identifying and sharing out loud the dangers they see in the picture. Participants will also engage in problem solving by coming up with strategies they could use to reduce the dangers they identified in the picture and will measure their level of confidence in their ability to implement the strategies they have come up with, should they find themselves in a similar work situation. The group facilitator will summarize what the group has said and what they have learned during the group activity and will ask participants to voluntarily make a personal promise to take concrete steps to reduce the dangers at their work.</description>

    <description>At control corner sites, we will recruit another 35 Latino day laborer participants.Participants in the control group will receive OSHA pamphlets with standard workplace safety and health information. During our needs assessment survey, we collected information regarding workrelated injuries. Results from this survey indicate the following 4 categories are the highest cause of injury among surveyed Latino day laborers: 1) moving heavy objects, 2) falls, 3) being struck by falling or lying objects, and 4) serious cuts. The OSHA materials that will be distributed to participants will include safety and health information regarding these four topics. Furthermore, given that the LDL are continuously exposed to the sun (e.g., at the corner while waiting for work, at work, and on their way to and from work), heat exposure will also be included in the OSHA materials.</description>
