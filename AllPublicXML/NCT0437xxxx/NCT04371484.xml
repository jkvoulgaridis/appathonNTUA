  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The epidemiological data currently available on child abuse in France are very inadequate.
      They do not make it possible to know the number of child victims, nor the precise context and
      impact of this violence. Very often, the figures put forward are underestimated. Improving
      the knowledge of these situations would make it possible to develop targeted primary and
      secondary prevention programs. In this study, is proposed an innovative method of exploiting
      existing national databases, the PMSI and SNIIRAM, with the aim of 1) approaching an order of
      magnitude of the frequency of physical abuse in children and 2) evaluating its contexts and
      consequences. The PMSI is a high-quality database that has been used for many years for
      medical research purposes. It provides a large amount of epidemiological information and can
      be used to create cohorts large enough to detect rare events. The SNIIRAM/EGB data allows the
      recovery of all data on reimbursed consumption, such as drug treatments, biological
      examinations carried out or consultations (with general practitioners or specialists).

          -  All children aged 0 to 5 years hospitalized in France between 2007 and 2014.

               2. those with at least one code or &quot;combination of codes&quot; suspected of physical
                  abuse, and

               3. all other hospitalized children, control group.
