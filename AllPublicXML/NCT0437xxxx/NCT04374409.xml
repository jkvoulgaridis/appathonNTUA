  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study evaluates the impact of one acute dose of cocoa flavanols on brain oxygenation
      during a hypercapnia challenge, as well as impact on cognitive performance in young healthy
      males. It further assesses the impact of flavanols on peripheral vascular function, as
      measured by brachial Flow-mediated dilation (FMD). All participants received a high-flavanol
      cocoa intervention (185.5 mg of flavanols (-)-epicatechin and (+)- catechin) and a
      low-flavanol cocoa intervention (&lt; 4 mg of flavanols). It is hypothesized that the
      high-flavanol intervention increases cerebral oxygenation during hypercapnia and vascular
      function in comparison to the low-flavanol intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cocoa flavanols have been shown to be protective against vascular disease in humans, as
      evidenced by improvements in peripheral endothelial function (as measured by brachial
      Flow-mediated dilatation, FMD). There is also emerging evidence suggesting that flavanol-rich
      diets protect against cognitive aging, but mechanisms remain elusive. In this study the
      investigators suggest that such mechanisms might be associated with benefits within the brain
      vasculature. The aim of the present study was therefore to determine whether intake of
      flavanols enhances cerebral oxygenation in frontal cortical areas of the brain during a
      hypercapnia challenge (which is a well-established biomarker of vascular reactivity in the
      brain) to a greater extent than a low-flavanol intervention in young healthy adults.

    <description>The modified Stroop included task blocks (designated as Colour match; Word match; Stroop and Double Stroop) of increasing difficulty so that performance could be compared between simple and more demanding tasks. Reaction time and accuracy of choice were recorded to estimate inverse efficiency scores (in seconds). Higher 'inverse efficiency scores' reflect worse performance on the task, whilst lower scores reflects better performance.</description>
