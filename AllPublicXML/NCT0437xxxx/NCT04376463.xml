  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The frailty syndrome (FS) is characterized by a multifactorial clinical syndrome, which
      includes 5 items, 1 - Change in body composition, 2 - Holding force, 3 - Fatigue reported, 4
      - Reduction of walking speed, 5 - Low physical activity. The cumulative effect of deficits on
      the physiological functions caused by the syndrome results in early physical and cognitive
      loss. It is known that physical exercise, associated with protein supplementation are
      examples of non-pharmacological treatments that can promote functional and structural
      adaptive responses of the skeletal muscle system. One of the factors related to frailty is
      the reduction of body and muscle mass. Branched-chain amino acids, especially leucine, are
      nutrients that influence the adaptative response of muscle. It is intended through a physical
      exercise program (multicomponent = exercise of strength + aerobic exercise), to attenuate the
      effects of ageing and mainly of physical and cognitive frailty, evaluating the health
      parameters of frail elderly, alone or together with supplementation (BCAA), branched-chain
      amino acids, modulation of immune markers, markers of malnutrition and the skeletal muscle
      system in frail and pre-frail dwelling elderly people living in the city of Coimbra. To
      achieve that, the following parameters will be evaluated: biosocial indicators,
      anthropometric evaluation and body composition, indicators of global health and functional
      physical fitness, inflammatory biomarkers, neuroendocrine, signs of skeletal muscle function,
      evaluation of quality of life related to emotional state, cognitive profile and frailty-trait
      evaluation. The results obtained from the indicators, markers and questionnaires used are
      expected to contribute to the attenuation of frailty, improving the health and quality of
      life of the elderly.

      This investigation was conducted in accordance with the guidelines laid down in the
      Declaration of Helsinki. All procedures were approved by the University Faculty Research
      Ethics Committee and written informed consent was obtained from all participants. This PhD
      project is inserted in the thematic line of the (CIDAF) Research Centre in Physical Activity
      and Ageing; Ageing: Is It Ever Too Late to be Active and Healthy / Fit? This project will
      also be sent to the homes of all the participants in the study to sign a term so that they
      can sign a consent for the implementation of the study at their premises.

      During the period of the intervention of the exercise and after the experimental period, an
      interview will be done through questionnaires, biosocial and overall health status. The main
      results will be the cognitive, biosocial and overall health status. There will be a session
      to administer a test battery on the overall health status, cognitive status (screening of
      cognition), and screening for mobility. Secondary measures include psychological well-being,
      cognition, anthropometric, immunological, and neurological parameters.

      Experimental design (supplementation time)

      It is an experimental design, controlled with 6 months of supplementation combined with
      exercise. Participants will receive a code number according to the order of recruitment. The
      participants sample was non-randomization, sample was convenience, will be performed using
      the assignment list and code number after recruitment for the study. Initially the elderly
      will be divided into 4 groups: Multicomponent Exercise + BCAA (ME+BCAA) group 1,
      Multicomponent Exercise (ME) group 2, BCAA group 3, Control non-exercise (CONTROL) group 4.
      Data collection was performed at 4 moments,1-Initial time (baseline), 2-After 16 weeks
      training period, 3-After 8 weeks detraining period and 4-After 16 weeks period, totaling 4
      collections throughout the project and 40 weeks.

      The supplement was supplied through the company and has about 95% purity and trade
      certification in the EU. The subjects ingested 1 sachet (0,21g/kg/session) prepared after to
      finish exercise by mixing the contents of each sachet with 200mL water and consuming as
      follows: first beverage during the morning after breakfast and before lunch.

    <intervention_model_description>It was an experimental design, controlled, non-randomized, with a convenience sample of 16-week supplementation combined or not with exercise. All participants in the groups ME+BCAA and BCAA received at the beginning of the protocol a bottle with assigned codes with flavourless powder (BCAA), and a dosage of 0.21g/kg/session. They took the supplement with 200 ml of water immediate after exercise, in the ME+BCAA group, and at the same time in the BCAA group (Ispoglou et al., 2016). Throughout the intervention period, all tests and intervention were done after breakfast and before lunch (supplementation, physical exercise, data collection, questionnaires, physical tests), and 30-60 minutes before lunch. The ME group just folowed the exercice protocol, and CGne group did not alter their usual routine.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>up to 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Physical function and muscle strength Short physical performance battery (SPPB) was used to assess gait speed, chair stand, and balance tests. This SPPB test is composed of 3 subdimensions: i) static balance (composed of 3 tests), ii) muscular strength of the lower limb, which consist of get up and seat in a chair, 5 times, with arms crossed at the chest, and iii) 3-meter test, that marks the time to travels the 3-meter course, in the usual speed (Guralnik et al., 1994).</description>

The score result has 3 response modes 0 to 5 points indicates normal psychological condition, (no symptoms of depression), 6 to 10 points indicates (mild depressive symptoms), 11 to 15 indicates (symptoms of serious depression).

    <measure>Profile of Mood State short version (POMS-sv)</measure>

    <description>Profile of Mood State (McNair, 1971) is a test to evaluated individual's mood state. This tool, self-related and easy to use, is able to verify a transient profile. A short version (Raglin &amp; Morgan, 1989) was applied to facilitate use. POMS consist of 22 Likert-type question, divided in six dimensions with scales from 0 to 4. The final score consists of a sum of all negative dimensions subtracting the positive dimension of Vigour. Total Mood Disturbance (TMD) scores of Profile of Mood States (T+D+H+F+C)-V), (Tension-anxiety, depression-melancholia, Hostility-anger, Fatigue-inertia, Confusion, and Vigour), (Viana, Almeida, &amp; Santos, 2001).</description>

    <description>Mini Nutritional Assessment The Mini Nutritional Assessment is calculated with a maximum total score of 30 points, in which the result of 17 points and below is characterized as malnourished, between 17 to 23.5 points, indicates a risk of malnutrition, and a score above 23.5 is normal nutritional status. A normal nutritional status was used to evaluate the nutritional status and the participants were classified as: Total points in the MNA® evaluation section (maximum 16 points). The results found will be sent to a nutritionist, (Loureiro, 2008). All participants were provided with similar diets, in terms of caloric intake and nutrients, controlled by a local nutritionist during the intervention period.</description>
