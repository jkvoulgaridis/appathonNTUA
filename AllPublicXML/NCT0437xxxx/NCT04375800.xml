  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purposes of this single-group, open-label, multi-site study are to examine the
      pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and tolerability of doravirine (DOR) [MK-1439] given in
      combination with 2 nucleoside/nucleotide analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) in
      pediatric participants (4 weeks to &lt;12 years of age with body weight &lt;35 kg) who are
      treatment-naive (TN) or have been virologically suppressed (VS) on stable combination
      antiretroviral therapy (cART) for ≥3 months with no history of treatment failure.
