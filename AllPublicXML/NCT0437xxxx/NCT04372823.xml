      The CHEER study takes advantage of a natural experiment happening in South Carolina (SC). The
      South Carolina Department of Social Services implemented new healthy eating and physical
      activity standards through a state-wide policy for family child care homes that participate
      in the ABC Grow Healthy program. Thus, CHEER is a quasi-experimental, two-group,
      pre-test/post-test design study.

      The overall goal of the study is to evaluate new healthy eating and physical activity
      standards targeting family child care homes in South Carolina. To accomplish this goal, we
      are assessing the effects of the standards on the dietary intake and physical activity levels
      of racially diverse low-income children in family child care homes. The specific aims of the
      &quot;CHEER&quot; study are as follows:

      Aim 1. Evaluate the extent to which the new regulatory standards impact children's dietary
      intake assessed via direct observation in homes and 24-hour recalls with parents, and
      physical activity and sedentary behavior assessed via accelerometry.

      Aim 2. Evaluate the extent to which the new regulatory standards impact children's body mass
      index computed from researcher-measured height and weight.

      Secondary Aim. Evaluate the extent to which family child care homes in the SC ABC Child Care
      Program comply with the new healthy eating and physical activity regulatory standards,
      compared to family child care homes not participating in the program.

      We hypothesize that most homes will comply with the new standards, yielding improvements in
      children's healthy eating and physical activity levels. As an exploratory aim, we will
      examine the effects of the standards on children's weight status.

    <description>Healthy Eating Index score - The Healthy Eating Index is a calorie-adjusted comparison of individual or group-level dietary intake to current dietary guidelines. The Healthy Eating Index was last updated in 2015 and represents the sum of thirteen component scores. Higher scores are awarded for healthier intake within each component. Each component of the Healthy Eating Index has a standard for receiving the minimum or maximum points possible. The HEI components and maximum scores include: total fruit (5), whole fruit (5), total vegetables (5), greens and beans (5), whole grains (10), dairy (10), total proteins (5), seafood/plant (lean) proteins (5), fatty acids (10), refined grains (10), sodium (10), added sugars (10), and saturated fats (10).</description>
