  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The spread of cancer to the spine is referred to as spine metastasis. Spine metastases are a
      common complication of cancer and are frequently associated with significant back pain. This
      study is being done to help improve treatment for back pain caused by spinal metastases by
      comparing the effectiveness of two standard treatments. These two treatments include
      radiation therapy (RT) alone versus radiation therapy combined with radiofrequency ablation,
      with or without vertebral augmentation (PVA/RFA). In addition to RT or RT with PVA/RFA, will
      be continued with current pain medications.

      All supportive therapy for optimal medical care will be given during the study period at the
      discretion of the attending physician(s) within the parameters of the protocol and documented
      on each site's source documents as concomitant medication.

      The study will be adequately powered with 52 patients (35 in the RT plus PVA/RFA arm and 17
      in the RT arm). Assuming a 5% ineligibility rate, a death rate of 15%, and a patient
      non-compliance rate of 15%, the total sample size required would be 80 patients.

      Patients will be stratified according to the tumor type (radioresistant [soft tissue sarcoma,
      melanoma, and renal cell carcinoma] versus other types). The treatment allocation scheme
      described by Zelen (1974) will be used because it balances patient factors. Within each
      stratum, patients will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either image-guided RT plus RFA/PVA or
      external beam RT alone.

      The 2:1 randomization allocation will be used to accommodate increased demand for
      image-guided RT plus RFA/PVA.
