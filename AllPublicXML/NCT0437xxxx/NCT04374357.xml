  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is the first part of a two-tiered research project to propose a novel
      approach-forgiveness therapy-to corrections. This study is a non-intervention study and aims
      to demonstrate the need to introduce the concepts of forgiveness and Forgiveness Therapy
      within prisons. This study is focused on the extent to which men in a maximum-security prison
      experienced considerable injustice against them (such as in a family context as he was
      growing up) prior to committing serious crimes. Variables associated with this prior unjust
      treatment included the level of forgiveness and variables of current psychological
      well-being. Since this study provided the rationale and participants' matching data
      (eligibility) for the subsequent interventional study (Study 2, &quot;Proposing Forgiveness
      Therapy in Prison&quot;) in which psychological treatments applied to the inmates, investigator
      refer to this study as Study 1.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current study (Study 1) consisted of 103 men in a maximum-security prison in the Midwestern
      United States. The research aimed to demonstrate the necessity of introducing forgiveness
      concepts and Forgiveness Therapy within the prison. This study collected percentage and
      correlational data regarding the presence of hurtful unfair treatments and psychological
      compromises, recognizing the style of the story-recalling (e.g. repetitive angry retelling;
      focus on damage; focus on fear; focus on despair, and so forth), rating of the injury types,
      and severity and age of occurrence. Inmates' stories were coded and analyzed by up to five
      researchers. The first wave of data examined a) whether participants have been treated deeply
      unfairly prior to their crime and imprisonment and the degree of severity; b) the degree to
      which the participants' show both excessive anger and unforgiveness toward those who acted
      unjustly as well as their expressions in crimesâ€”direct contribution to their choice of
      harming the innocent; and c) the relationship among the excessive anger, forgiveness, and
      related emotional sufferings and psychological distresses such as anxiety and depression.
      Case studies were also conducted. Reliability and validation of 30-Item Enright forgiveness
      inventory (EFI-30) in the prison context were also tested. In general, we tested the
      following hypotheses:

        1. Do most inmates in this maximum-security prison experience severe unfair treatment
           against them before their criminal perpetrations?

        2. Do most inmates in this maximum-security prison have low forgiveness towards the person
           who deeply hurt them?

        3. Do disproportional number of inmates in this maximum-security prison have clinical
           compromises (e.g. excessive anger, anxiety, and depression) related to their past
           injustice?

        4. Does higher degree of anger/anxiety in inmates correlates to the less forgiving behavior
           towards those who hurt them in the past, prior to their crime?

      Study 1 also provided participant matching data (criteria for eligible participants) for the
      Forgiveness Therapy experiments of subsequent interevtional study

    <measure>Score on Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Measures of Anger</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>National Institutes of Health PROMIS Measures of Anger (five items) was used. Items are statements about the frequency of feeling angry in the past seven days. An example is &quot;In the past 7 days, I felt like I was ready to explode.&quot; Participants need to respond to each item on a 5-point scale from &quot;Never&quot; to &quot;Always.&quot; The total scores for the anger scale range from 5 to 25. The higher scores a participant rated in one scale, the angrier participant was, in contrast with those who scored lower.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Score on Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Measures of Anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>National Institutes of Health PROMIS Measures of Anxiety (seven items) was used. Items are statements about the frequency of feeling anxious in the past seven days. An example is &quot;In the past seven days, I found it hard to focus on anything other than my anxiety.&quot; Participants need to respond to each item on a 5-point scale from &quot;Never&quot; to &quot;Always.&quot; The total scores for the anxiety scale range from 5 to 35. The higher scores a participant rated in one scale, the more anxious participant was, in contrast with those who scored lower.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Score on Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Measures of Depression</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>National Institutes of Health PROMIS Measures of Depression (eight items) was used. Items are statements about the frequency of feeling depressed in the past seven days. An example is &quot;In the past seven days, I felt like a failure.&quot; Participants need to respond to each item on a 5-point scale from &quot;Never&quot; to &quot;Always.&quot; The total scores for the anxiety scale range from 5 to 40. The higher scores a participant rated in one scale, the more depressed participant was, in contrast with those who scored lower.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Score on Herth Hope Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Herth Hope Index was used as an instrument. It has 12 items and assesses optimism toward the future with questions, such as &quot;I have a positive outlook on life&quot;; &quot;I believe that each day has potential&quot;. These questions assess connectedness to positive expectations for the future, inter-connectedness with other people, and inner positive expectancy. Participants responded on a 4-point scale ranging from &quot;strongly disagree&quot; to &quot;strongly agree.&quot; Two items need to be reversely coded, and the total hope score ranges from 12 to 48. A higher score means more hopefulness toward the future.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Score on Enright Forgiveness Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Enright Forgiveness Inventory Short Form (30 items) was used as a measurement of forgiveness. It includes three subscales: affect, behavior, and cognition, with 10 items in each subscale. The introductory material at the beginning asks participants to focus on the worst injustice they experienced before their first imprisonment, and to indicate the person who unfairly treated them, time to event, degree of hurt and a brief description of the experience. Then participants were asked to think about the person who hurt them and rate the 30 items on a 6-point Likert scale ranging from &quot;strongly disagree&quot; to &quot;strongly agree.&quot; Half of the items are negative statements, and reverse coding is done in the data analysis. An example of the positive items is &quot;I feel warm toward him/her,&quot; and a negative one is &quot;Regarding this person, I disapprove of him/her.&quot; The total forgiveness scores range from 30 to 180, with each subscale scores in the range of 10 to 60. A higher score means more forgiving.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Score on Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale (20-item short version) was used here to measure if a participant is &quot;faking good&quot; to meet the social desirability in psychological tests. It also assesses the degree to which each participant is taking this set of questionnaires seriously or not. This 20-item short version of the Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale was developed by Strahan and Gerbasi, with 20 statements using a true/false response format. An example is &quot;I never hesitate to go out of my way to help someone in trouble.&quot; A participant gets 1 point for each &quot;True&quot; response and 0 point for each &quot;False&quot; response to 10 socially desired statements, and the reverse points to 10 not socially desired statements. Scores range from 0 to 20. A higher score represents a higher tendency of &quot;faking good&quot; in the test.</description>

    <measure>Score on Maltreatment and Abuse Chronology of Exposure (MACE) Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The MACE scale includes 52 items and measures retrospectively ten types of maltreatment during each year of childhood from 1 to 18 years old. The ten subscales or types of maltreatment measured include: emotional neglect, non-verbal emotional abuse, parental physical maltreatment, parental verbal abuse, peer emotional abuse, peer physical bullying, physical neglect, sexual abuse, witnessing interparental violence, and witnessing violence to siblings.</description>
