  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Philadelphia chromosome (BCR-ABL1, Ph) is the most common genetic abnormality in acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and an independent prognostic risk factor. With the increase of
      age, the incidence of patients over 60 years old can reach 50%, whose 5-year overall survival
      rate was less than 20%.

      With the application of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), the prognosis of Ph positive ALL
      patients is greatly improved. At present, TKI combined with chemotherapy has become the
      first-line treatment recommended in the guideline of Ph positive ALL patients.

      However, with the use of imatinib, more and more patients develop drug resistant to imatinib.
      In addition, the clinical data showed that the MRD negative rate in patients treated with
      imatinib combined with hyper CVAD was only 22% three months later, which was far lower than
      31% of the second generation TKI and 52% of the third generation TKI.

      Second generation TKI dasatinib and nilotinib can overcome most imatinib resistant kinase
      region mutations. However, patients with severe hemocytopenia, infection or other
      complications are often unable to tolerate the standard chemotherapy. In addition, due to the
      high cost, some patients can't afford the long-term use.

      Flumatinib is the first approved second generation TKI in China and a derivative of imatinib.
      Compared with imatinib, it introduced trifluoromethyl, substituted pyridine ring for benzene
      ring, and kept the direction of amide bond, which made the inhibitory effect of flumatinib on
      common kinase mutations significantly better than that of imatinib. In addition, compared
      with the second-generation TKI recommended in the first line of current guidelines, the
      incidence of quality of life related adverse reactions of flumatinib is lower, and no
      specific adverse reactions of the second-generation TKI have been reported.

      We plan to enroll 28 patients with Ph positive ALL. All patients are diagnosed by morphology,
      immunology, cytogenetics and molecular biology (MICM). According to subjects' age, we will
      divide them into two groups. Subjects aged 60 years or older are received flumatinib and
      dose-adjusted VDCP or prednisone regimen. Subjects younger than 60 years are received
      flumatinib and hyper-CVAD regimen. MRD are examined on the 8th, 15th and 29th day after
      chemotherapy. Then, MRD will be monitored in the third, 6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, 18th, 21th and
      24th months after chemotherapy to evaluate the effect.

      days 1-3; a continuous daily infusion of sodium mercaptoethanesulfonate (Mesna) at 600 mg/m²
      per day for 24h starting 1h before CTX and completed approximately 12h after the final CTX
      dose; doxorubicin 50 mg/m² is given intravenously over 24 h on day 4; vincristine (VCR) 1.4
      mg/m² (Maximum daily dose 2 mg) is intravenously on days 4 and 11; dexamethasone (Dex) 40 mg
      is given intravenously or orally on days 1-4 and days 11-14. For cycles 2, 4, 6, and 8:

      22 h on day 1; cytarabine (Ara-C) 3 g/m² is given intravenously over 3 h every 12 h for four
      doses on days 2-3; citrovorum 50 mg is given intravenously, followed by 15 mg every 6 h for
      eight doses beginning 12 h after MTX completion. Prophylactic intrathecal therapy will be
      given after complete remission.

      Maintenance therapy (given for 2 years): intravenous VCR 1.4 mg/m² on day 1 (Maximum daily
      dose 2 mg), every three months; oral dexamethasone 8mg/m² on days 1-7, every three months;

      flumatinib at 600 mg. Months 6 and 13 of maintenance were intensification courses of
      hyper-CVAD and flumatinib.

      (DNR) 30mg/m2/d is given intravenously on day 1, 8, 15, 22 (if blasts of day 15 lower than
      20%, DNR is not needed on day 15 and 22); cyclophosphamide (CTX) 400mg/m2/d is given
      intravenously on day 1,8,15 and 22; Prednisone 60mg/m2/d is given orally every other day for
      day 1-22. Prophylactic intrathecal therapy will be given after complete remission.

      (CR) on day 28, a consolidation chemotherapy will be given on day 35; if not, we will give it
      as salvage therapy; And if CR is achieved after salvage therapy, another consolidation
      chemotherapy will be given.

      Maintenance therapy (given for 2 years): intravenous VCR 1.4 mg/m² on day 1 (Maximum daily
      dose 2 mg), every three months; oral dexamethasone 8mg/m² on days 1-7, every three months;
