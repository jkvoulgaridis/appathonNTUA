      to record pulpal blood flow (PBF) changes associated with using 0.018-inch Nickel Titanium
      (NiTi) as the first alignment archwire during fixed orthodontic treatment.

      Forty healthy patients with lower arch mild crowding with less than 2mm contact point
      displacement at any teeth were included. A split mouth study design was applied. Where each
      patient received 2 archwire sizes at one time joined in the midline by crimpable hook and
      applied in the lower arch.

      Patients were assigned into one of 2 groups based on archwire sizes used. Group (1);
      0.014-inch and 0.018-inch NiTi and Group (2); 0.016-inch and 0.018-inch NiTi. A Laser Doppler
      Flowmeter was used to measure PBF at different time intervals (T0-T5).
