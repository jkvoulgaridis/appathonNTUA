  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter study that includes a main study for all participants
      enrolled and an optional cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sub-study. Self-identified African
      American (AA) and Hispanic or Latin American (HA) participants with a diagnosis of relapsing
      multiple sclerosis (RMS) will be enrolled. The treating neurologist must make an independent
      medical assessment and decision to initiate ocrelizumab treatment per label (USPI) as the
      most appropriate standard of care treatment for the participant. 150 participants will be
      enrolled in the main study (75 AA and 75 HA) and 50 participants will be enrolled in the CSF
      sub-study (25 AA and 25 HA). Participants will be assessed for disease activity and
      biomarkers of neuronal damage at baseline and during treatment with ocrelizumab.
