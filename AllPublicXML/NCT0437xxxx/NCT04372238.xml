  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the efficacy of a novel drug-checking intervention to prevent fatal and
      non-fatal overdose among people who use drugs (PWUD), who are 18-65 years old at the time of
      enrollment. The investigators will evaluate whether the incorporation of rapid fentanyl
      testing into a theory-driven overdose education and prevention intervention reduces rates of
      overdose compared to standard overdose education and naloxone distribution. Results from this
      study will significantly improve public health efforts to address the fentanyl overdose
      epidemic and reduce harms associated with exposure to drugs contaminated with fentanyl. This
      is a full clinical trial, building on the previously approved fentanyl-test-strip pilot study
      (2016-2017), the results of which have recently been published.(Krieger et al., 2018)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will assess the efficacy of the RAPIDS intervention on preventing overdose
      among PWUD. Participants will be randomized 1:1 to receive the RAPIDS intervention or the
      attention-matched control condition. Experimental arm participants will receive the RAPIDS
      intervention, which includes education about the dangers of illicitly manufactured fentanyl
      (IMF), motivational interviewing to increase willingness to use fentanyl test strips and
      engage in overdose risk reduction behaviors, hands-on training to use the test strips, and
      opportunities to plan and role- play how to implement overdose risk reduction behaviors upon
      receipt of a positive or negative test result. In the attention-matched control arm,
      participants will receive standardized overdose education and naloxone distribution (OEND)
      training. All participants will attend additional study visits at months 1,2,3,6, and 12. The
      primary endpoint will be the rate of self-reported overdose over the follow-up period.
      Secondary endpoints (e.g., overdose death) will be ascertained by data linkage to statewide
      overdose surveillance databases.

      The primary aims of this study are to: 1) Assess the efficacy of the RAPIDS intervention in
      reducing rates of overdose among people who use drugs; 2) Examine the degree to which
      reductions in rates of overdose are mediated by increases in information, motivation,
      behavioral skills, and self-efficacy regarding fentanyl, rapid fentanyl testing, and harm
      reduction practices; and 3) Explore whether there is heterogeneity of treatment effect
      related to key participant characteristics.
