  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cutaneous mastocytosis can be isolated or associated with systemic involvement. Urticaria
      pigmentosa affects around 80 to 85% of adult patients with cutaneous mastocytosis. It is also
      frequently present in patients with mastocytosis associated with systemic involvement (80% of
      patients in our experience).

      This skin damage is one of the causes of deterioration in quality of life in patients with
      mastocytosis, through the loss of self-esteem, due to the appearance of lesions. However
      there are not treatment for urticaria pigmentosa.

      Skin involvement in mastocytosis is linked to the accumulation of abnormal mast cells in the
      dermis. However, the mast cells are not pigmented and the brown-brown color characteristic of
      Urticaria pigmentosa is explained by melanin pigmentation of the epidermal basal layer.

      Cutaneous mastocytosis can be isolated or associated with systemic involvement. Urticaria
      pigmentosa affects around 80 to 85% of adult patients with cutaneous mastocytosis. It is also
      very frequently present in patients with mastocytosis associated with systemic involvement
      (80% of patients in our experience).

      This skin damage is one of the causes of deterioration in quality of life in patients with
      mastocytosis, through the loss of self-esteem, due to the appearance of lesions. However
      ,there is not a treatment for urticaria pigmentosa.

      Skin involvement in mastocytosis is linked to the accumulation of abnormal mast cells in the
      dermis. However, the mast cells are not pigmented and the brown-brown color characteristic of
      pigmentary urticaria is explained by melanin pigmentation of the epidermal basal layer. This
      characteristic is often described on skin biopsies of pigmentary urticaria analyzed in
      hematoxilin-eosin.

      The 532 nm Q-Switched laser is known to improve lesions characterized by the presence of
      melanin pigment in the basal layer of the epidermis, with very little risks. This later is
      explained by the reduced penetration of light at 532 nm into the skin and the emission time
      of the laser light which is very low (of the order of a few nanoseconds) for Q-Switched
      lasers. In the literature, 2 case reports report an efficiency of the laser at 532 nm in this
      indication in adults.

      The hypothesis of this study is that 2 sessions of Q-switched laser could improve the skin
      lesions of urticaria pigmentosa, leading to an improvement in self-esteem.
