  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the effect of reverse Trendelenburg position versus
      semi-recumbent position on ventilation and oxygenation parameters of obese critically ill
      patients

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obese critically ill patients' position significantly impacts on their ventilation and
      oxygenation status. It is also associated with mechanical ventilation success or failure and
      may be a main determinant of the obese patients' outcome. Reverse Trendelenburg position is
      recommended for obese patients but in critical illness with mechanical ventilation little is
      known about its effect on respiratory therapeutic targets. This trial was conducted in four
      general intensive care unit of Alexandria Main University hospital in Alexandria, Egypt. One
      hundred and ten adult mechanically ventilated patients with body mass index ≥ 30 were
      randomly assigned by a computer program to either reverse Trendelenburg position group (n=55)
      which is the intervention group or semi-recumbent position group (n=55) which is the routine
      unit position. Patients were positioned in the study positions 4 times per day. Patients were
      maintained in the study positions for 2 hours each time. Baseline ventilation and oxygenation
      parameters were assessed immediately before positioning then it was reassessed every 10
      minutes after positioning for 30 minutes.

    <masking_description>Computer generated randomization (www.randomizer.org) was used to randomly assign patients to one of both groups. Information of allocation was available to the principal researcher only. Patients were assigned a sequential number that was placed in an opaque, sealed envelope by the researcher. When the patients were scheduled to be positioning, the envelope was opened by the researcher who then performed the positioning. The nurses could not be blinded to the allocation because of the nature of the intervention. However, the outcome assessment of the patients was blinded.</masking_description>

    <measure>Respiratory dynamic compliance</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minute form positioning time</time_frame>
    <description>Respiratory dynamic compliance (Cdyn) in ml/cm H2O is the change in lung volume per unit change in pressure in the presence of flow. It is calculated through the equation of tidal volume/ (peak inspiratory pressure - positive end expiatory pressure). All the previous equation variables are assessed from the patient's mechanical ventilator data.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Respiratory minute volume</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minute form positioning time</time_frame>
    <description>Respiratory minute volume (VE) in mL/min is the total volume of air that is expired over one minute. It is calculated directly by the mechanical ventilator and presented on patient's mechanical ventilator data.</description>
