  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single site, open-label, randomized, cross-over study designed to evaluate elements
      of abuse liability (AL) including subjective effects and physiological measures
      (pharmacodynamics [PD]) and plasma nicotine uptake (pharmacokinetics [PK]) during and
      following ad libitum use of the study investigational products (IPs) by generally healthy
      subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cigarette smokers (SMK) and smokers who also use smokeless tobacco (SST) [e.g., snus, moist
      snuff] will be recruited into the study. An attempt will be made to have approximately one
      third of the study population made up of SST.

      Potential subjects may complete a pre-Screening telephone interview and will complete a
      Screening Visit to assess their eligibility within 45 days prior to check-in and
      enrollment/randomization.

      Starting on Day -1, eligible subjects will begin confinement at the clinical site for 6 days.
      Subjects will be randomized to evaluate one investigational product (IP) in each of five
      separate Test Sessions, such that each subject will evaluate five IPs, including three
      strengths of the nicotine pouches, and both a high- and a low-AL comparator.

      Each Test Session will last for approximately 4 hours during and following IP use and will
      include collection of both PD measures (subjective and physiological) and PK measures.

      On Day -1, subjects will participate in an IP acclimation period where they will be
      instructed on how to use the nicotine pouch IP and the nicotine gum (low-AL comparator IP).
      At the end of the acclimation period, subjects will have access to their usual brand (UB)
      cigarettes for ad libitum use until the 12-hour tobacco abstinence begins prior to the Day 1
      Test Session.

             hepatic, endocrine, gastrointestinal, psychiatric, hematological, neurological
             disease, or any other concurrent disease or medical condition that, in the opinion of
             the PI, makes the study subject unsuitable to participate in this clinical study.

         15. Participation in another clinical trial within (≤) 30 days prior to the signing of
             informed consent. The 30-day window for each subject will be derived from the date of
             the last study event in the previous study to the time of signing the informed consent
             form (ICF) in the current study.

         16. Females who have a positive pregnancy test, are pregnant, breastfeeding, or intend to

             medication(s) at Screening or Day -1.

         19. Postpones a decision to quit using tobacco- or nicotine-containing products in order
             to participate in this study or a previous attempt within (≤) 30 days prior to signing
