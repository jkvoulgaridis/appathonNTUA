    <textblock>
      Currently, there is no robust evidence about how women with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)
      perceive pregnancy risk. The aims of this research are to understand women with CKD's
      perception of risk in pregnancy. In order to provide appropriate pre-pregnancy and antenatal
      counselling including accurate presentation of risk of pregnancy outcomes, it is important to
      establish how do women with CKD perceive their risk in pregnancy. In addition, to facilitate
      discussion about pregnancy for women with CKD, it is critical to understand key psychosocial
      factors influencing their risk perceptions.

      This study will be conducted in two phases. In phase one, risk perceptions in women with CKD
      who are contemplating pregnancy will be quantitatively measured with potential influencing
      psychosocial factors including their illness perceptions, quality of life, anxiety,
      depression and perceived social support. Demographic, pregnancy-intentions, medical and
      pregnancy histories will also be collected. Phase one findings will establish to what extent
      do women with CKD perceive their pregnancy risk.

      In phase two, perception of risk, pregnancy intention and behaviour, will be qualitatively
      explored in women with CKD who perceive high and low degrees of risk. This sub-study will
      facilitate understanding about which factors and experiences impact risk perception and their
      relationship with pregnancy intentions and behaviour.

      The objectives for this research are:

        1. To understand how women with CKD perceive their pregnancy risk.

        2. To examine the associations between biopsychosocial factors (demographics, psychosocial
           factors, renal and pregnancy history) and women with CKD's perception of risk in
           pregnancy.

        3. To examine the relationship between pregnancy-related intention and perception of
           pregnancy risk in women with CKD.

        4. To gain an in-depth understanding of the biopsychosocial factors which influence risk
           perception and pregnancy-related behaviour, in women with CKD who perceive high and low
           risk perceptions.

      To achieve these objectives this study is divided into two phases:

      Phase 1: Quantitative assessment of risk perception and biopsychosocial factors in women with
      CKD Phase 2: Qualitative exploration of risk perception in women with CKD with high and low
      risk perception scores
