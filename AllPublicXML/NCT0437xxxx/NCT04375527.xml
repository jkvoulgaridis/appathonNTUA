  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well binimetinib and nivolumab work in treating patients with
      BRAF V600 wildtype melanoma that has spread to nearby tissues or lymph nodes and cannot be
      removed by surgery (locally advanced unresectable) or has spread to other places in the body
      (metastatic). Binimetinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help
      the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells
      to grow and spread. Giving binimetinib and nivolumab together may work better in treating
      patients with melanoma compared to nivolumab alone.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Objective response rate (ORR), which is defined as the proportion of response-evaluable
      participants either with a confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1, as determined by the investigator
      assessment, at best overall response.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Progression-free survival (PFS), clinical benefit rate (CR + PR + stable disease [SD]
      among response-evaluable participants, per RECIST 1.1), overall survival (OS) and duration of
      response (DOR).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Evaluation of histologic evidence of response (p-ERK reduction in residual tumor cells and
      CD8 T cell or tumor infiltrating lymphocytes or tumor infiltrating lymphocyte [TIL]
      infiltration induced by combination treatment) using pretreatment and early on-treatment
      tumor biopsies.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive binimetinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28 and nivolumab
      intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 12
      cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 1
      year, then annually thereafter.
