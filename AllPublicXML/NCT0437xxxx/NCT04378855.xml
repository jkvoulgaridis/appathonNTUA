  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will ultimately aim at developing a GIMEMA platform for collecting HRQoL and
      symptom burden information on Italian patients with Philadelphia chromosome negative MPN. The
      main objective of the protocol is to improve our understanding of the impact of the disease
      and various treatments on patients-wellbeing, symptom burden and daily functioning.
