    <textblock>
      26 Tae Kwon Do athletes performed a vigorous exercise program on the isokinetic dynamometer
      twice in a period of 10 days, each time on a different extremity. In this way two groups of
      26 individuals each were created, with the same individuals alternating. In the massage group
      (MG) a sport massage was applied between the sets while in the control group (NMG) the break
      was passive.

      Objective: Τo investigate the effects of massage in athletic performance when applied during
      intervals of an intense isokinetic exercise protocol for knee extensor muscles.

      Design: Randomized Controlled Trial. Participants: 26 Tae Kwon Do athletes performed a
      vigorous exercise program on the isokinetic dynamometer twice in a period of 10 days, each
      time on a different extremity. In this way two groups of 26 individuals each were created,
      with the same individuals alternating. In the massage group (MG) a sport massage was applied
      between the sets while in the control group (CG) the break was passive.

      Main Outcome Measures: knee flexion and extension ROM, thigh circumference, and creatine
      kinase (CK) levels in blood plasma were measured before and after each test while L-DOMS was
      measured 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours after the exercise.

    <intervention_model_description>26 Tae Kwon Do athletes performed a vigorous exercise program on the isokinetic dynamometer twice in a period of 10 days, each time on a different extremity. In this way two groups of 26 individuals each were created, with the same individuals alternating. In the massage group (ME) a sport massage was applied between the sets while in the control group (NME) the break was passive. knee flexion and extension ROM, thigh circumference, and creatine kinase (CK) levels in blood plasma were measured before and after each test while L-DOMS was measured 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours after the exercise.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Changes in Active Knee Range of Motion (ROM)</measure>
    <time_frame>day 1: pre-treatment, after- treatment, day: 10 pre-treatment, after- treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The ROM of knee flexion and extension was measured before and after the exercise program application in both trials. In particular, the active knee extension was measured in the supine position and the active flexion in the prone position using a universal type goniometer.</description>

    <time_frame>day 1: pre-treatment, after- treatment, day: 10 pre-treatment, after- treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples were taken before and 24 hours after the isokinetic protocol to determine whether the exercise program caused fatigue and muscle damage. The blood sample was analyzed to determine CK activity levels in blood plasma using an in-vitro quantitative assay followed by a photometer</description>

    <measure>Changes in thigh circumference</measure>
    <time_frame>day 1: pre-treatment, after- treatment, day: 10 pre-treatment, after- treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The circumference of the thigh was measured with a tape measure before the test and after the exercise program at fixed spots at a distance of 10 and 20 cm from the center of the patella</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness (DOMS)</measure>
    <time_frame>day 1: 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours after-exercise, day 10: 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours after-exercise</time_frame>
    <description>The DOMS measurement for the lower extremities (L-DOMS) was performed with the VAS scale 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours after the completion of the program. The VAS scale was tentative where 1 corresponded to &quot;no soreness&quot; and 10 to &quot;very, very sore&quot;. The L-DOMS was assessed according to Doma et al1,22 and according to Jakeman et al, through questioning after they completed a body weight squat until their knees were flexed to approximately 90°</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in concentric and eccentric torque</measure>
    <time_frame>day 1: pre-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>During the baseline testing session, the maximum concentric and eccentric torque of knee extensors at 60 °/s was measured with the Cybex Norm.The participant then sat in the armchair of the isokinetic dynamometer with his arms crossed in the chest. Two crossed straps held the torso firmly on the back of the armchair and a belt with an additional strap held the pelvis still. Each participant performed 3 maximal efforts with each leg and the best of the 3 efforts was recorded.</description>
