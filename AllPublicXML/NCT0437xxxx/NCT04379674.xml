  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study was conducted to investigate the effects of different Kinesio taping directions on
      dynamic muscle endurance. This randomized, double-blind, crossover study was implemented on
      27 healthy male subjects. Before the study, personal and demographic information of the
      volunteers were recorded and muscle strength was evaluated in the biceps curl position with 1
      maximum repetition technique. One week after this first evaluation muscle endurance was
      evaluated by counting the accurate elbow flexions completed in biceps curl position with 80%
      weight of 1 maximum repetition recorded in the first evaluation. Following this second
      evaluation facilitation, inhibition, and placebo tapings were applied to all the 27 subjects
      who were randomly assigned into 3 groups sequentially with an interval of two days. The
      sequence of taping technique to be used for the groups were also randomly determined and
      applied to the M. Biceps Brachii and muscle endurance was evaluated with the same method
      half-hour after the tape was applied. All the evaluations were performed by the same
      evaluator who was blind to the taping technique.

    <textblock>
      Facilitation taping was applied from the origins of the muscle to the insertion. Inhibition
      taping was applied from the insertio of the muscle to the origin. Facilitation taping and
      inhibition taping was applied on the target tissue with 25% tension. Y-band was used during
      facilitation taping and inhibition taping. It was applied to individuals with shoulder mild
      abduction, external rotation, elbow extension and supination position. Placebo taping was
      applied while in a resting position. In placebo taping, it was applied using two I bands in
      horizontal direction. In placebo taping, no tension was applied to the tapes. Evaluations
      were made while the subjects were standing. The biceps curl exercise position starts with the
      palms facing the trunk. Elbow flexion is completed by making full range of motion. The cases
      were randomized into 3 groups: group-1 facilitation taping, group-2 inhibition taping and
      group-3 placebo taping.The treatment sequence to be applied to the patients was determined by
      randomization. Facilitation, inhibition and placebo banding were applied to the patients,
      respectively. Accordingly, inhibition and placebo taping was applied to the cases that
      started with the facilitation taping. Placebo and facilitation banding were applied to the
      patients that started with inhibition banding, respectively. Facilitation and inhibition
      banding was applied to the cases that started with placebo banding, respectively. During the
      evaluation, banding application was kept by wearing plenty of clothes. Evaluators and
      subjects participating in the study did not have knowledge and experience about the taping
      method.

    <description>Muscle endurance was found by recording the number of elbow flexions performed within 1 minute in the biceps curl exercise position against moderate violence at the rate of 80% of 1 maximum repetition. Facilitation taping, inhibition taping and placebo taping were applied to 27 subjects randomized to 3 groups at two consecutive day intervals. The order of taping was also determined by randomization method and performed on the biceps braki muscle in the dominant limb of the subjects, and muscle endurance was evaluated half an hour after taping.</description>

    <measure>Maximum of 1 Repetition (1-MT)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Muscle strength was found with a maximum of 1 repetition (1-MT) in the biceps curl exercise position. The subjects were asked to perform the movement against resistance with the greatest weight predicted during this evaluation position. When he was able to repeat the movement a second time or more, we continued by adding 5 kg, 3 kg, 2 kg or 1 kg weights, respectively. 1-MT was found by giving 1 minute rest intervals between repeated trials.</description>
