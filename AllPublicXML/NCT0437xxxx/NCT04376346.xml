  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Disorders (FASD) result in lifelong disability and are a leading cause
      of preventable birth defects in the US. Urban American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) young
      women are at high risk for alcohol exposed pregnancies (AEPs) which can cause FASD. In this
      project, the inverstigators will test the effectiveness of a culturally adapted mobile health
      intervention to prevent AEP, using social media to recruit AIAN young women from urban
      centers across the nation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed project builds on a prior NIAAA-funded project which used intensive
      community-based participatory research (CBPR) methods to adapt CHOICES, an evidence-based
      brief alcohol-exposed pregnancy (AEP) prevention intervention supported by the CDC, to
      American Indian Youth CHOICES (AIY-C). AIY-C contains features that make it highly amenable
      to mHealth approaches, including a framework for integrating diverse cultural teachings, few
      modules of short duration, and concrete opportunities for goal-setting and achievement.
      Innovative for this population is the plan to recruit young AIAN women from major urban areas
      in the US through social mediaâ€”and to deliver AIY-C via mobile devices, increasingly
      ubiquitous among AIAN young adults. While social media recruitment and mHealth interventions
      are not new, only very recently have they been used with AIAN populations. The investigators
      will partner with urban AIAN organizations to guide us through social media recruitment
      strategies, mHealth intervention translation and implementation, and evaluation in urban AIAN
      settings. The investigators propose 3 specific aims: (1) Develop and pilot social-media-based
      recruitment strategies for urban AIAN young women; (2) translate AIY-C for mHealth delivery
      through an iterative and theoretically driven process and pilot the developed translated
      mHealth AIY-C intervention; and (3) recruit 700 (final N=525) urban AIAN young women using
      identified social media strategies, and conduct an RCT to rigorously evaluate the
      effectiveness of the mHealth translation of AIY-C for preventing AEP and FASD.
