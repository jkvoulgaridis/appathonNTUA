  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is a randomized, double-blinded, single-dose, 3-arm parallel, comparative study to
      evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety and immunogenicity of BAT2206 Injection vs Stelara®
      (EU-licensed and US-licensed) in healthy Chinese male subjects. A total of 270 healthy male
      subjects are planned to be included and randomized at a ratio of 1:1:1 to receive single
      45mg/0.5ml BAT2206 Injection or Stelara® (EU-licensed and US-licensed).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study has a screening period of 14 days. PK blood samples will be collected from subjects
      to determine the serum concentration of Ustekinumab, thus to evaluate the similarity of the
      pharmacokinetics of the three study drugs.

      The investigator will perform safety evaluation for vital signs, physical examinations,
      injection site reaction, ECG, clinical laboratory tests and adverse events throughout the
      study. Immunogenicity evaluation (ADA, ADA titration and nAb) will also be evaluated.
