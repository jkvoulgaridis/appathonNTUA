  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is integrated Phase 1, Single centre, Randomized study will be conducted in 3 parts,
      each with a specific primary objective:

      Part A: To characterise the safety and tolerability of TTYP01 in healthy adult subjects; Part
      B: To evaluate the bioavailability of TTYP01 tablets in healthy adult subjects; Part C: To
      characterise the food effect of TTYP01 tablets in healthy adult subjects under the fasted or
      fed condition.

      The secondary objectives of the study are to evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of
      TTYP01 tablets in healthy adult subjects, and the effects of gender on the PK of TTYP01
      tablets in healthy adults. In Part A of the study, a total of 32 healthy adult subjects will
      be enrolled over four consecutive cohorts (8 per cohort), with participants receiving a
      single dose of TTYP01 at one of four levels (60, 120, 10 or 240 mg), to assess the PK and
      safety of TTYP01. In Part B, 16 healthy adults will be randomized into 2 groups, and the
      comparison of the PK of edaravone (TTYP01 and intravenous (IV) edaravone) will be evaluated
      using a randomized, open-label, four-period crossover design under fasted conditions. In the
      first crossover period, subjects will receive a single fixed dose of TTYP01 followed by the
      alternate IV dose after completion of the washout phase, and in the second crossover period,
      subjects will receive a higher fixed dose of TTYP01 followed by the alternate IV dose after
      completion of the washout phase. In Part C, 12 healthy subjects will be enrolled to evaluate
      the effect of food on the PK of TTYP01 using a randomized, open-label, two-period cross-over
      design. Participants will be randomized into two groups and administered a fixed dose of
      TTYP01 on Day 1 (Period 1) under the fed conditions and the second dosing day (Period 2)
      under the fasted conditions, while the other group being administered a fixed dose of TTYP01
      on Day 1 (Period 1) under the fasted conditions and the second dosing day (Period 2) under
      the fed conditions.

             of the investigator.

          -  Male subjects with partners currently pregnant; male subjects able to father children
             who are unwilling or unable to use a highly effective method of contraception as

          -  Female subjects currently pregnant or lactating; female subjects able to bear children
             or of child bearing potential who are unwilling or unable to use a highly effective
             method of contraception as outlined in this protocol for the duration of the study and

             conduct of the studies.

          -  Evidence of any severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or
             investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of
             study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the subject
             inappropriate for entry into this trial.

          -  Subjects who have participated in another clinical trial less than 3 months before or
             donated his/her blood in a quantity greater than 200 milliliters (mL) within 1 month
