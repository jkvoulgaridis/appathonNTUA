  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At present, the standard treatment for platinum-resistant ovarian cancer patients is
      platinum-free chemotherapy, with poor efficacy and tolerance. The combination of
      anti-angiogenic drugs and PARPi can play a synergistic anti-tumor role and achieve good
      efficacy in platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer. This study intends to explore the
      safety and effectiveness of anlotinib and niraparib dual therapy in patients with
      platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer, and primary peritoneal
      cancer (ovarian cancer).

      The present study is an open, single-center, prospective, single-arm phase II study to
      investigate the efficacy and safety of nilapalil combined with anrotidine in the treatment of
      platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer. In this study, 40 histopathologically diagnosed
      patients with high-grade serous ovarian, fallopian tube and primary peritoneal cancer were
      treated with neelapalil plus anrotinib in patients who underwent first-line chemotherapy or
      above and had a recurrence of platinum-resistant chemotherapy (the time of tumor progression
      of the last platinum-containing chemotherapy &lt; 6 months). The study will be divided into two
      phases. The first phase will include six patients on a 21-day cycle (nierapalil 200mg QD*21;
      Anrotidine 12mg qd d1-14, d15-21 suspension), all subsequent patients were enrolled if no
      more than dose-restricted toxic event occurred within a cycle, and the combination treatment
      was continued until the disease progressed or the toxicity was intolerable.
