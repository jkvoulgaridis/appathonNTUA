  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ultimate objective is to improve the efficacy of prehospital procedures for patients
      suffering an acute stroke. Increased precision in prehospital selection and a more efficient
      transport chain will lead to an even more rapid start of treatment and thus benefit patients.
      The research project has two parts: one part collecting data from medical reports and one
      study with qualitative in-depth interviews. The project will gather data from various parts
      of Norway and from a University hospital in Switzerland for comparison between regions and
      countries. Data will be retrieved through intrahospital and prehospital medical records from
      various parts of Norway (Nordland Hospital, Akershus University Hospital and Helgeland
      Hospital) and from Basel University hospital in Switzerland. Knowledge of factors associated
      with delays will be compared for regions in the north and south of Norway, as well as abroad.
      The information obtained will be analysed to identify components in the chain that may be
      improved as concerns time saving.
