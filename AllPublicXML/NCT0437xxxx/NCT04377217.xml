  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The clinical diagnosis of Facio-Scapulo-Humeral Muscular Dystrophy (FSHMD) requires the
      movement of patients to a medical centre and a lengthy examination involving medical
      personnel, and may be underestimated in the most moderate cases. Thus, it requires costly and
      burdensome logistics both for patients living in remote areas and having to undertake long
      and expensive travel, and for clinical staff. This is an obstacle to large-scale diagnosis.
      We plan to alleviate these limitations through the use of digital facial analysis technology
      that would enable large-scale diagnosis of patients through telemedicine.

      Motivated by the reasons described above and by our preliminary results, the goal of this
      project is to develop methods to automatically detect and monitor the progression of this
      disease using computer vision algorithms. In order to do this, we will first build up a bank
      of images and videos of patients with moderate to severe FSHMD, patients with other muscular
      dystrophies causing facial muscle asymmetry, as well as control subjects without facial
      involvement. Each of these subjects will be characterized clinically and genetically.

      We will then develop computer tools using video and audio sensors capable of detecting facial
      muscle damage in patients with FSHMD and differentiating them from control subjects on the
      one hand and patients with other muscular dystrophies on the other hand. We wish to use the
      most recent advances in terms of &quot;deep-learning&quot; and improve their architecture in order to
      achieve our objectives.

      In addition to this holistic approach, we will study facial recognition approaches capable of
      accurately identifying different facial areas on images, as well as the relevance of
      different statistical properties of facial dynamics (duration and intensity). These
      algorithms will also be useful for monitoring the evolution of facial damage in order to
      develop a specific measurement tool that could be used in patient follow-up and in clinical
      trials on early stages of the disease.
