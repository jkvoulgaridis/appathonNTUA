  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immunisation policies have strong influences on the epidemiology of hepatitis A and B
      infection. In Hong Kong, vaccines against both viruses have been available through different
      channels and programmes in the past 3 decades. To evaluate the changes in the prevalence of
      hepatitis A and B in the general population, a seroepidemiology study is conducted involving
      a prospective cross-sectional survey followed for serology testing. Eligible members of 1327
      spatially random households would be invited to join the study by completing a questionnaire
      and providing blood samples, either by dried blood spots or venesection, for determining the
      presence of antigen and/or antibody against hepatitis B, as well as antibody against
      hepatitis A. The main measures comprise a set of metrics on the prevalence of hepatitis A and
      B. Analysis would be conducted to examine the association of risk factors with the tested
      markers and describe the attitudes towards viral hepatitis vaccination. The results would
      allow us to understand the transmission potential of hepatitis A and B in the community would
      be influenced by the changing disease epidemiology and coverage of vaccination, which inform
      the development of new vaccination strategies in Hong Kong

        Residents of Building Groups from diverse geographical locations in Hong Kong selected
        through cluster sampling are targeted. With the building information available, three
        households would be randomly selected from each Building Group.
