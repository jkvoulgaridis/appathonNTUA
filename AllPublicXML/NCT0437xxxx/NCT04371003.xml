    <textblock>
      The investigator hypothesizes that oxidative stress responses to West Nile virus infection in
      the central nervous system determine the severity of infection and the long-term
      neurological, neuropsychological and functional sequelae of West Nile Neuroinvasive Disease.

    <measure>Analysis of laboratory performance characteristics (e.g. sensitivity) of WNV-specific RT-PCR and viral isolation in clinical samples, compared to composite diagnosis of WNV infection</measure>
    <time_frame>20 days</time_frame>
    <description>Confirmed WNV infection is defined as one or more of following criteria:
Seroconversion of anti-WNV IgG antibodies (Indirect immunofluorescence testing (IIFT) Flavivirus 2, Euroimmun®, Lübeck, Germany) in convalescent serum (20 days after symptom onset) (all participants)
4-fold increase of anti-WNV IgG antibodies in convalescent serum, compared to the screening sample (IIFT).
Anti-WNV IgM antibody detection (ELISA) in CSF* (at VBH) (*CSF sampled only when clinically indicated).
Positive WNV-specific RT-PCR result in serum, urine or CSF in samples obtained at screening.
Virus isolation by outgrowth assay in samples obtained at screening</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Description of molecular epidemiology of infecting WNV strain(s) and viral outgrowth diagnostic performance.</measure>
    <time_frame>20 days</time_frame>
    <description>The time frame for WNV detection after symptom onset by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or virus isolation by outgrowth from blood or CSF is limited by the fast decline of circulating virus. Because the WNV RNA detection window in urine can be longer (up to 14 days), RT-PCR will be performed on all clinical samples at recruitment. The target sequences are a conserved region in the 5`UTR region and part of the capsid gene of WNV and detects both lineage 1 and 2 WNV. WNV has been successfully isolated from urine, in approx. 40% of samples obtained within 8 days of symptom onset. WNV isolation will be attempted in low-passage Vero E6 cells and BHK21 cells from urine samples with a high WNV RNA load (Cycle threshold (Ct)- values &lt;30).</description>

    <measure>Identification of potential genetic signatures that correlate with virulence (neuro-invasion and morbidity) in our cohort.</measure>
    <time_frame>20 days</time_frame>
    <description>Whole genome sequencing (WGS) will be performed on a subset of RT-PCR positive serum, urine and CSF samples. This will allow us to investigate the temporal and spatial compartmentalization of the West Nile lineages in Romania as well as expand our understanding of genetic compartmentalization within hosts (urine, serum, CSF). In addition, the obtained isolates will be sequenced (from the viral outgrowth assay) to assess potential adaptations the virus undergoes during isolation. Finally, in a genome wide association study, the obtained viral sequences will be compared with the prospectively collected clinical data, to identify potential genetic signatures that correlate with virulence, neuroinvasion and morbidity. Our data will be compared to existing data on genetic determinants of virulence such as the presence of a glycosylation site in the E protein, substitutions in non-structural proteins 3, 4B or 5, or variation in the 3' noncoding region.</description>

        The study population will be recruited from VBH emergency and outpatient departments in
        Bucharest, Romania, from the onset of the WNV transmission season in 2020 until November
        2023. The incidence of WNV and WNND in South-Eastern Romania was 0.5 per 100,000
        inhabitants in 2016, and has been increasing steadily 35. Romania reported 277 WNND cases
        with 43 deaths in 2018, and 66 WNND cases with 8 deaths in 2019 3. VBH is a tertiary care
        facility that serves a population of 3 million people (15% of Romania's population). Its
        catchment area covers more than 80% of the territories in Romania that reported WNV
        transmission and has in recent years been the largest single medical center to care for WNV
        infected patients.

          -  for active cases: positive anti-WNV IGM antibodies in serum (or IgG in CSF if
             applicable)

          -  for active cases: presentation within (maximum) 7days of symptom onset

          -  for healthy controls: anti-WNV antibody naive (IgM and IgG in serum). The group of
             healthy controls will be selected to have an age similar distribution to the cases.
