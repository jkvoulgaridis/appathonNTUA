      Study NTRX-07-C101 will be conducted with a modified parallel design, incorporating sentinel
      subjects and a staggered-dosing-days approach.

      Up to 6 cohorts, A-F, are planned for a total of 48 completing subjects. Each dose cohort
      will be randomized with 6 subjects receiving active drug and 2 placebo.
