      This study will be a single center, open label, fixed-sequence crossover, 2-period study
      conducted with 14 healthy male or female subjects. Subjects will be administered surufatinib
      alone in Period 1 and in combination with itraconazole in Period 2. PK samples will be
      collected through out both study periods.Subjects will be confined in the clinic from
      check-in on Day -1 through the end-of study visit on Day 15.
