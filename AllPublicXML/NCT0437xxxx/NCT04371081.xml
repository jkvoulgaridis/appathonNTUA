      The purpose of this post-marketing clinical use database surveillance is to observe the
      frequency, type, and degree of adverse device effects and adverse events in order to assure
      the safety of the medical device, and to collect safety and efficacy information for
      evaluating the results of its clinical use.

    <textblock>
      The Surveillance will be conducted per the standards required by the Ministry of Health,
      Labour and Welfare (MHLW) and in the standards for post-marketing surveillances and studies
      [except for those defined in the Ministerial Ordinance on Good Clinical Practice for Medical
      Devices (MHLW Ordinance No. 36, 2005)] based on Paragraph 4, Article 23-2-9 (including
      application mutatis mutandis per Article 23-2-19 of Revised PAL) of the Law on Securing
      Quality, Efficacy and Safety of Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices, etc. (Law No. 145, 1960,
      hereinafter referred to as &quot;Revised PAL&quot;) by the Marketing Authorization Holder or accredited
      foreign manufacturer of a medical device defined in Paragraph 1, Article 23-2-5 of Revised
      PAL.
