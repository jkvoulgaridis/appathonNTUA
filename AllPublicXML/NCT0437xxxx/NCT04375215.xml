      The aim of this clinical study is to compare and evaluate the Success of Selective Caries vs
      Stepwise Caries Removal Techniques in treatment of dental caries.

      The patient will be selected as per the pre-defined eligibility criteria. Written informed
      consent will be taken from each consenting participant. Initial caries excavation will be
      done under rubber dam isolation. The patient will then be randomly allocated to two groups:
      selective removal to soft dentin or stepwise caries removal. Composite restoration with glass
      ionomer liner will be then placed in both groups. Additional complete caries excavation will
      be done in the stepwise caries removal group after six months.

    <description>Clinical success will be judged by following criteria
Positive response on vitality test.
Absence of pain on percussion and any other signs and/or symptoms of irreversible pulpitis and pulp necrosis
Criteria for failure will be
Negative response on pulp vitality test.
Tenderness to percussion and teeth exhibiting any clinical signs and/or symptoms of irreversible pulpitis and pulp necrosis.</description>

    <description>In selective caries removal to soft dentine, after caries excavation application of liner will be done on pulpal floor. Teeth will then be filled with composite resin material.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Stepwise caries removal (two step)</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>The stepwise caries removal is a two step procedure. The first step is similar to selective caries removal to soft dentin group. In the second step, after 6 months lesion will be re-entered to remove remaining carious tissue till firm dentin is encountered. Once all the caries is removed from floor of cavity a liner followed by final restoration with composite will be performed.</description>
