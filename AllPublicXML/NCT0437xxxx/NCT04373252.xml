  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many patients that are treated with anorectal malformations are fecally incontinent for life.
      A Bowel Management Program has been developed to help these patients by creating a daily
      enema regimen to keep them artificially clean of stool in the underwear. Due to the high
      success rate of the program, many patients who suffer from fecal incontinence due to other
      reasons such as, spina bifida, sacrococcygeal teratoma and sacral agenesis are referred to
      the program. A new issue is emerging with a group of patients that no longer obtain effective
      results from their daily enemas, even though they have worked successfully for years. These
      same patients are presenting with a narrow, spastic left colon and remarkably dilated right
      colon. Our hypothesis is that prolonged enema administration negatively impacts the
      microbiota of the colon causing the lack of response from enema administration. The purpose
      of this study is to restore the normal flora of the colon by fecal microbiota transplant
      (FMT) which we believe will improve responsiveness to enemas. By restoring colonic flora,
      patients will again become responsive to daily enemas and regain successful bowel management.

    <description>The primary outcome measure for this study will be the results reported in the daily journals which will identify if patients become responsive to enema treatments again (administration and complete evacuation within a one-hour period) and are able to remain clean in the underwear for 24 hours.</description>

    <description>A secondary outcome measure will come from the microbiota analysis done on the collected stool samples. By comparing the microbiota before and after FMT we will be able to determine if, and how much, the fecal microbiota transplant altered the flora of the colon.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The study population to be enrolled in this study will include patients 18 years of
             age and older, with a Malone (appendicostomy) or with a cecostomy, that have received
             daily enemas for the treatment of fecal incontinence with prior good results for
             months to years. However, now these patients report not having an acceptable enema
             response (up to 4 hours for evacuation) despite numerous attempts to adjust the enema
             additives. The patients typically display a narrow, spastic left colon and a dilated
             right colon on contrast enema. A minimum of 10 adult subjects will be enrolled first
             and followed for safety and efficacy outcomes for at least one month. After the
             initial 10 adult subjects, there will be a pause in enrollment to allow for a formal
             review of the adult safety and efficacy data by the primary investigator. At this time
             a request will be made to open enrollment of this study up to the pediatric population
             as well as adults.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any patient who does not meet the above criteria will be excluded from this study.
             Also excluded: pregnant women, women of child-bearing potential who are unwilling to
             use an effective form of contraception for 30 days after FMT, women who are
             breastfeeding, subjects with end stage liver disease or cirrhosis, subjects with a
             life expectancy of less than 6 months, subjects with an absolute neutrophil count &lt;500
             cells/µL and those with severe food allergies.
