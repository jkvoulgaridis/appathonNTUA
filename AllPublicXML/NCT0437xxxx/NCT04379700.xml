  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Single-arm, single-center, no sham or placebo, prospective pilot trial designed to evaluate
      the feasibility and safety of transcatheter arterial embolization in patients with mild to
      moderate radiographic knee OA. Eligible participants will receive geniculate artery
      embolization using Embozene™ Color-Advanced Microspheres. Patients will be followed up for a
      total of 12 months.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current study seeks to determine whether transcatheter arterial embolization of abnormal
      neovasculature arising from the genicular arterial branches is safe and effective in the
      treatment of mild-to-moderate knee OA.

    <measure>Change in Knee pain using Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis index (WOMAC) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 month, 3 month and 12 month follow up visits</time_frame>
    <description>Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis index (WOMAC) questionnaire has 24 questions on daily activities. WOMAC pain score includes five questions regarding pain (pain during walking, stair climbing, nocturnal, rest, weight bearing); each question will be scored suing the following points: 0 for no pain, 1 for mild, 2 for moderate, 3 for severe, and 4 for extreme pain. possible score ranges for pain are 0-20. WOMAC Score will be calculated from the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) score which was developed as an extension of the WOMAC score with the purpose of evaluating short-term and long-term symptoms and function in subjects with knee injury and osteoarthritis.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Knee pain using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 month, 3 month and 12 month follow up visits</time_frame>
    <description>The change in knee pain will be assessed by the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scale which is a validated, subjective measure for acute and chronic pain. The electronic VAS is a horizontal line with no markings on the scale except &quot;No pain&quot; on the left (score: 0 mm) and &quot;worst possible pain&quot; on the right end of the scale (score: 100 mm). Subjects mark the VAS to indicate their current pain level, with 0 mm representing &quot;No pain&quot; and 100 mm representing &quot;worst possible pain&quot;.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Knee Stiffness</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 month, 3 month and 12 month follow up visits</time_frame>
    <description>Knee stiffness will be measured through the KOOS questionnaire to obtain the WOMAC score. The Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) was developed as an extension of the WOMAC Osteoarthritis Index with the purpose of evaluating short-term and long-term symptoms and function in subjects with knee injury and osteoarthritis. The KOOS holds five separately scored subscales: Pain, other Symptoms, Function in daily living (ADL), Function in Sport and Recreation (Sport/Rec), and knee-related Quality of Life (QOL).</description>

    <measure>Change in Physical Functioning</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 month, 3 month and 12 month follow up visits</time_frame>
    <description>Physical functioning will be measured through the KOOS questionnaire to obtain the WOMAC score. The Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) was developed as an extension of the WOMAC Osteoarthritis Index with the purpose of evaluating short-term and long-term symptoms and function in subjects with knee injury and osteoarthritis. The KOOS holds five separately scored subscales: Pain, other Symptoms, Function in daily living (ADL), Function in Sport and Recreation (Sport/Rec), and knee-related Quality of Life (QOL).</description>

    <measure>Change in Quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 month, 3 month and 12 month follow up visits</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L is a self-assessed, health related, quality of life questionnaire. The scale measures quality of life on a 5-component scale including mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. This tool also has an overall health scale where the rater selects a number between 1-100 to describe the condition of their health, 100 being the best imaginable.</description>

    <description>Embozene™ Microspheres are spherical, tightly calibrated, biocompatible, nonresorbable, hydrogel microspheres coated with an inorganic perfluorinated polymer (Polyzene™-F). The microspheres intended to occlude vasculature for the purpose of blocking blood flow to a target tissue. They are available in prefilled syringes in a range of sizes suitable for embolic therapy. The microspheres are compressible to enable smooth delivery through the indicated delivery catheter and color-coded by size to allow for easy identification. 250 μm microsphere will be used and are supplied in prefilled yellow syringes.</description>
