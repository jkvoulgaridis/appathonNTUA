  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is being done to monitor common symptoms and behavior, and to provide
      supportive care information and peer support, as well as research opportunities for young
      women ages of 18-39 years old who have been diagnosed with stage 0-IV stage breast cancer
      using a web-based portal (YES), built for smartphones, tablets, and computers.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, interventional cohort study with an embedded Phase II randomized
      controlled clinical trial with a parallel design.

        -  The research study procedures include screening for eligibility, consent, enrolled,
           randomization into 1 of 4 groups.

        -  The study interventions including the (web-based portal ) YES portal use including
           regular assessments, serial outcome surveys, medical record review, and tumor/blood
           collection.

        -  The YES portal is a web-based portal designed for access by smartphone, tablet, or
           laptop/desktop. The portal is designed to help monitor cancer related issues and to
           share self-management information and resources to those interested in particular issues
           or who score high enough on the symptom measures designed to assess and track noticeable
           symptoms (and thus might benefit from such), as well as to share potential research
           opportunities when available. The portal is also designed to create a community among
           participants through the yeschat.org discussion board

        -  Participants will be in this research study for up to 5 years with the option to opt out
           of portal assessment component follow-up after only 1 year.

        -  It is expected that about 400 people will take part in this research study

    <measure>Vaginal dryness</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>One item regarding vaginal dryness on the BCPT will be used and grouped by moderate, quite a bit, extreme responses to define the vaginal dryness rate at 1 year. Based on historical data (from our ongoing Young Women's Breast Cancer Study), the 1-year vaginal dryness rate for the control group is assumed to be 27%. For the Phase II randomized controlled trial component of the study,it will have 85% power to detect a 10% difference in the primary endpoint with 367 patients, and would plan to recruit 408 to account for dropout (last row of the table).</description>

    <measure>Socio-demographics</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Women will be asked about their race, education, employment and financial status using items selected from the Alliance Patient Questionnaire that is currently being piloted (Alliance A191401), adapted to include an item on employment status that has been tested previously in a breast cancer population and is going to be added to the next version of the Alliance Patient Questionnaire.</description>

    <measure>Financial burden</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Items adapted from the National Health Interview Survey29 and the Cancer Outcomes Research and Surveillance (CanCORS) Caregiver Study30 will be used to assess financial burden and to estimate out of pocket expenses attributed to their breast cancer diagnosis.</description>

    <measure>Smoking and alcohol use</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical Activity</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Physical activity will be assessed using a modified version of the Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ).This self-reported measure is used to estimate weekly frequencies of strenuous, moderate, and light activities. It has been modified to include average duration of activities. Weekly minutes of moderate and vigorous activity (MVPA) will be the main measure of physical activity; however weekly minutes of vigorous activity (MVA) and the average weekly frequency of mild, moderate and strenuous intensity exercise based on the Leisure Score Index (LSI) will also be examined to evaluate change in physical activity behaviors. The Godin measure will be administered at multiple timepoints and will be used to evaluate change in physical activity over time.</description>

    <measure>Mobility</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L33, 34 is a summary measure of health status for use in evaluating health and healthcare and includes five functional dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression) plus a visual analog scale (EQ-VAS) that asks participants to assess how good or bad their health is today on a 0 (worst health imaginable) -100 (best health imaginable) scale. The EQ-5D-5L will be used to generate and evaluate QALYs.</description>

    <description>The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)35, 36 will be used to evaluate for clinically significant depression.

    <measure>Overall Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient-Reported Outcomes Version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE) is a patient-centered, standardized self-report measure that enables patients to report symptoms and AEs. The PRO-CTCAE has demonstrated favorable validity, reliability, and responsiveness in a large heterogeneous United States sample of cancer patients undergoing treatment.37 40 PRO-CTCAE items that are salient to young women with breast cancer will be collected. The PRO-CTCAE items use conditional branching for AEs that contain multiple attributes. A modified 19-item version of the Breast Cancer Prevention Trial (BCPT) Symptom Checklist will evaluate common symptoms, including hot flashes, fatigue, sexual problems, and musculoskeletal complaints. The PROMIS 8-item Fatigue Scale will be used to assess fatigue.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Emotional Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>

Participants with early stage breast cancer will respond to baseline (at enrollment) and follow-up outcome surveys via. Participants will then create a personal YES portal account and automatically receive information on sexual health and vaginal dryness. Participants will also complete serial monitoring assessments in the portal.
YES portal assessments will be sent once a week for the first 12 weeks (each assessment will take approximately 10-15 minutes). After 12 weeks of weekly assessments in YES portal, the frequency of assessments will be changed to once every month.
Surveys will be sent once every 6 months for the first 3 years, then annually.
Participants will be asked to allow for medical record review, two blood samples (baseline and 3-6 months), and a sample of any tissue available to bank.</description>
