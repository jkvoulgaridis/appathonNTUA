  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this extension study is to assess the maintenance of efficacy of
      linzagolix administered orally once daily for up to an additional 6 months (for up to 12
      months of treatment in total) in women who have already completed 6 months of linzagolix
      treatment at a dose of 75 mg alone or of 200 mg in combination with ABT (E2 1 mg / NETA 0.5
      mg), in the management of moderate to severe endometriosis-associated pain (EAP) in women
      with surgically confirmed endometriosis.

      This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind study. Subjects who have completed the
      6-month Treatment Period in 18-OBE2109-002 - Edelweiss 2 study (herein referred to as main
      study) will be invited to enter the present extension study. Month 6 visit of the main study
      is a decision point for Subjects to either end treatment and enter a post-treatment follow up
      (part of the main study), or to opt for a 6-month treatment extension. All subjects will
      receive once daily either linzagolix 75 mg alone (with ABT placebo) or 200 mg combined with
      ABT for 6 months. Subjects who received placebo during the main study will be randomized to
      either linzagolix 75 mg alone (with ABT placebo) or linzagolix 200 mg with ABT. Subjects who
      received active treatment during the main study will continue with the same treatment.
      Double-dummy design will be used in order to maintain the blinding of the study.

      After end of treatment in the extension study (6-month treatment period: from Month 6 to
      Month 12), subjects will enter a post-treatment Follow-Up Period of 6 months with no
      investigational medicinal product (IMP) or - for subjects willing to continue treatment - a
      second extension study will be proposed.
