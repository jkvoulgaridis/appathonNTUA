  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A total of 105 (AF) patients with atrial fibrillation are scheduled to undergo surgery and
      will be divided into three groups. Left atrial appendage occlusion ((LAAC)), radiofrequency
      ablation guided by three-dimensional mapping and LAAC combined with radiofrequency ablation
      were performed respectively (allocation ratio 1:1:1). All patients were examined by real-time
      three-dimensional and two-dimensional ultrasound before operation and 3, 6 and 12 months
      after operation, and the (LA) function of left atrium was measured. All ultrasound data will
      be stored and the professional director of the ultrasound room will be invited to conduct
      quantitative analysis. Ultrasonic examination indexes include: anterior and posterior
      diameter of left atrium, left atrial ejection fraction and so on. All patients underwent
      transesophageal echocardiography before and 3 months after operation. The results were
      interpreted by 2 experienced ultrasound doctors to measure the presence of left atrial
      thrombus, residual shunt and device-related thrombus. Blood samples were taken to detect
      B-type natriuretic peptide before operation, 1 day, 3-6 months and 12 months after operation.
      All patients underwent 6-minute walking test and quality of life score before operation and
      3, 6 and 12 months after operation. At the same time, the thickness of crest in all patients
      was measured during operation. This study will clarify the changes of left atrial function
      and quality of life in patients with atrial fibrillation after LAAC. In addition, this study
      also observed the effect of radiofrequency ablation combined with LAAC on left atrial
      function and evaluated whether one-stop surgery was superior to simple occlusion or ablation,
      and the above results were analyzed. The patients were followed up for an average of one
      year, and the changes of left atrial function, quality of life and embolic events were
      analyzed.

These patients will receive left atrial appendage closure, radiofrequency ablation under the guidance of 3D mapping and left atrial appendage closure combined with radiofrequency ablation, respectively (allocation ratio, 1:1:1)</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>The researchers will participate in the operation to record operative parameters such as LA pressure. Other researchers including follow-up personnel and the ultrasonic data analyst are uninformed about the random situation of the patients (patient information is recorded according to the random number. Random numbers corresponding to the random allocation list are stored in the research center. After follow-up of the last patient is completed, the random allocation list is published by the random number designer; and the designer does not participate in the data collection and statistics.)</masking_description>
