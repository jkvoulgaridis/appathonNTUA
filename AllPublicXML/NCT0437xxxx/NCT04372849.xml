  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity and especially type 2 diabetes (T2D) increases the risk of neurocognitive
      dysfunctions including adverse effects on brain structure and function. Recent evidence from
      clinical studies have shown that T2D almost doubles the risk for dementia. As the population
      gets older, age-related chronic diseases, as T2D, become more prevalent. Scientific evidence
      is emerging that there are several links between metabolic and neurocognitive functions.
      Impaired insulin action (i.e. insulin resistance), the main hallmark of T2D, has been
      suggested as a likely shared common pathophysiological mechanism. However, the neural
      processes that determine how insulin resistance is are connected to the onset and progression
      of T2D and dementia remain unclear. In this context, the overall aim is to study brain
      insulin resistance to disentangle age-related and obesity related brain insulin resistance in
      healthy normal and overweight/obese persons at the age of 20 to 70 years . To this end, the
      investigators will assess brain insulin action using intranasal insulin/placebo during
      functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). Additionally, structural changes and cognitive
      processes will be assessed as secondary variables.

    <time_frame>30 minutes after administration of nasal insulin</time_frame>
    <description>fMRI measurement will be performed before and after administration of 160 U of human insulin or placebo as nasal spray. Changes in regional brain activity will be quantified by cerebral blood flow and blood oxygenation dependent (BOLD) signal to assess regional brain insulin sensitivity. Brain insulin sensitivity will be compared between eight groups (young normal weight men and women, young overweight/obese men and women, old normal weight men and women, old overweight/obese men and women). Persons are categorized into normal weight and overweight/obese based on the Body Mass Index (BMI). Age groups are build based on a median split.</description>

    <measure>Whole-body insulin sensitivity</measure>
    <time_frame>2 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Insulin sensitivity will be estimated from a frequent-sampling 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (oGTT) using the Matsuda formula. Correlation of regional brain insulin sensitivity by intranasal insulin will be performed with whole-body insulin sensitivity based on oGTT. Changes in regional cerebral blood flow from before to after intranasal insulin administration will be assessed by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).</description>
