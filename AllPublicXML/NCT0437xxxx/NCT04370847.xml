  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preeclampsia is a multifocal syndrome reported in 2-8 % of pregnancies. It is diagnosed in
      the second half of pregnancy by two separate measurements of systolic blood pressure ≥140
      mmHg and/or a diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg in the same arm and proteinuria &gt;300 mg in
      24 h urine collection. The risk for serious complications such as pulmonary edema,
      cerebrovascular accidents, coagulopathy, and hemorrhage is 10 to 30 fold higher among
      parturients with severe preeclampsia.

      Severe preeclampsia is defined by one or more of the following clinical features: severe
      hypertension (systolic arterial pressure 160 mmHg and/or diastolic arterial pressure 110 mmHg
      on more than one occasion at least 4 h apart while the patient is on bed rest, renal
      dysfunction (serum creatinine &gt;1.1mg/dl or doubling of serum creatinine in the absence of
      another renal disease, platelet count less than &lt;100,000 mm3, acute pulmonary edema,
      epigastric pain not responding to medical treatment, new-onset cerebral and visual
      manifestation, hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelet count syndrome (HELLP
      syndrome)

      Fluid resuscitation is a key determinant in the management of these parturients. Hypovolemia
      exacerbates organ failure, whereas volume overload results in pulmonary edema. In this
      setting, the use of noninvasive hemodynamic monitoring is associated with reduced mortality.

      Point-of-care lung ultrasonography is used in many critical care settings as the initial
      diagnostic imaging study for patients with respiratory symptoms. It is highly sensitive for
      the diagnosis of pulmonary edema which may occur even without cardiomyopathy or heart
      failure.

      The IVC is a highly compliant vessel that changes its diam¬eter in parallel with changes in
      blood volume and central venous pressure. Measurement of IVC diameter and col¬lapsibility
      index using ultrasound through a subcostal approach has been investigated in patients of
      various settings. The IVC-CI imaging technique may be used to assess the volume status in
      healthy parturients undergoing routine cesarean delivery as well as in high-risk parturients
      as preeclampsia.

      Cerebral edema is predominantly vasogenic and may be related to the failure of cerebral
      autoregulation with subsequent hyperperfusion, blood-brain barrier disruption, and
      endothelial cell dysfunction. Ultrasonographic measurements of the optic nerve sheath
      diameter (ONSD) correlate with signs of raised ICP.

    <description>lung ultrasound scans will be performed while the patient is in the supine position with left lateral tilt by 30 degrees using a 2-5 MHz curved array transducer. The echo comet score (ECS) which corresponds to the amount of EVLW will be obtained by the 28-rib interspaces technique. An increased amount of (EVLW) is diagnosed by multiple B-lines or 'comet tails' which are defined as discrete laser-like vertical hyperechoic reverberation artifacts that arise from the pleural line and extend to the bottom of the screen without fading and move synchronously with lung sliding. The sum of the B-lines found on each of the 28 chest-wall areas yields the ECS.</description>

        and 80 % power, using the following formula:

        N= (Z1-α/2+Z1-β) ² σ1* σ2 / δ ² *2 Z1-α/2 = 1.96 Z1-β= 0.842 σ = SD (8, 9) δ = Expected

        β = Level of acceptability of a false negative result (0.20).

        1- β= power (0.80).The sample size will be increased to 100 parturients to compensate for
        protocol failures with incomplete data and to increase the power of the study.
