  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot trial studies how well leflunomide works for the treatment of patients with
      high-risk smoldering plasma cell myeloma, for the delay of disease progression.
      Anti-inflammatory drugs, such as leflunomide lower the body's immune response and are used
      with other drugs in the treatment of some types of cancer. The information learned from this
      study will help researchers to learn more about the anti-myeloma activity of leflunomide, and
      whether it may delay the onset of symptomatic multiple myeloma in patients with high-risk
      smoldering multiple myeloma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To estimate the anti-myeloma activity of leflunomide, when given as a single agent, as
      assessed by 6-month progression-free response rate based on International Myeloma Working
      Group (IMWG) criteria.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of single agent leflunomide. II. To summarize and
      assess toxicities by type, frequency, severity, attribution, time course and duration.

      III. To estimate overall and progression-free survival probabilities. IV. To estimate
      response rate and duration of response. V. To describe the impact of treatment on quality of
      life, as assessed by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality
      of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ‚ÄêC30) Score version (v)3.0.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize the molecular evolution of the tumor cells. II. To evaluate whether
      specific genetic subtypes respond differently to leflunomide.

      III. To evaluate the role of immune cells in the progression of smoldering multiple myeloma
      (SMM).

      IV. To evaluate the role of leflunomide in modulating the immune system. V. To examine the
      relationship between immunological changes and disease progression.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive leflunomide orally (PO) once daily (QD). Cycles repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After the completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 28 days
      until an alternative myeloma therapy has commenced or until disease progression, and then up
      to 6 months.

          -  Pregnant women and women who are lactating. Leflunomide has potential for teratogenic
