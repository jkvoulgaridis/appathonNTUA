  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Using a double-blind, randomized controlled design to investigate the therapeutic effects of
      interactive attention training for children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder who
      are receiving conventional rehabilitation programs due to developmental delay.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 30 children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder conducting conventional
      rehabilitation programs well be enrolled.

      The children are randomized into two groups, including study group with conventional
      rehabilitation programs and interactive attention training: 2 times per week, 15 min per
      session, with a total of 24 sessions in 3 months; and control group with conventional
      rehabilitation programs without interactive attention training.

      Therapeutic effects, including working memory, attention, functional performance, physical
      function, health-related quality of life will be evaluated at baseline, and 3 months and 6
      months after the intervention.

      The evaluator and children will be blinded to the group's allocation during the whole course
      of the intervention.
