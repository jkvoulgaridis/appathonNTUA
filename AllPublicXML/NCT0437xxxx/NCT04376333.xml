    <textblock>
      Temporomandibular/orofacial pain disorders (TMD) are a group of painful conditions with
      multiple determinants.This proposal has two main goals: 1) to test a highly individualized,
      adaptive treatment for TMD that has potential to be more effective than other psychosocial
      treatments; and 2) to discover the mechanisms by which psychosocial treatments work in
      chronic pain. TMD patients (N=160) will be randomized to receive standard care (STD) + an
      individualized assessment and treatment program (IATP) or to standard care + conventional
      cognitive-behavioral treatment (STD+CBT). It is expected that the STD+IATP treatment will
      yield lower pain, depression and interference scores over time than STD+CBT, and that changes
      in coping ability will mediate the treatment effects on outcomes.

    <textblock>
      Temporomandibular/orofacial pain disorders (TMD) are a group of painful conditions with
      multiple determinants. A number of psychosocial treatments for TMD have been developed, but
      overall effectiveness has been limited, and the mechanisms of treatment are unknown. This
      proposal has two main goals: 1) to test a highly individualized, adaptive treatment for TMD
      that has potential to be more effective than other psychosocial treatments; and 2) to
      discover the mechanisms by which psychosocial treatments work in chronic pain. Patients with
      TMD-related pain of at least 3 months duration (N=160) will be randomly assigned to either a
      Standard Conservative Treatment +Cognitive Behavioral coping skills treatment (STD+CBT), or
      to an Individualized Assessment and cognitive-behavioral Treatment Program (IATP) for
      patients with TMD pain. Treatment in IATP will be based on a very detailed functional
      analysis of the patient's pain experience, in context, as derived from Experience Sampling
      (ES). The ES procedure will be conducted via smartphone app at a rate of 4 records per day,
      and will be used to gather information on patients' pain, momentary cognitions, affects, and
      coping behaviors, for a 2-week monitoring period prior to the beginning of treatment.
      Therapists will use this information to develop an individual functional analysis of pain and
      non-pain episodes, and determine what thoughts, feelings and actions are effective for that
      patient at managing pain and which are not. The information will be used to help develop
      adaptive coping tactics in a 6-session treatment program, offering skills training tailored
      to specific patient needs. During-treatment ES will allow adjustment of the treatment goals
      and procedures, making the treatment adaptive and able to change with changing circumstances
      and patient needs. This experimental treatment (IATP) will be added to a standard
      conservative splint-based treatment for TMD pain (STD). The combination (STD+IATP) will be
      compared to a STD treatment supplemented with a 6 session conventional cognitive-behavioral
      program not based on in-vivo assessment of pain and coping. In the STD+CBT condition ES data
      will be collected but will not be used to inform treatment, but will control for measurement
      reactivity. ES data collected prior to, during, and following both treatments (out to 12
      months) will allow very precise measurement of cognitions, affects, and coping skills, as
      they occur in patients' home environments, and how they change over time. Outcomes will
      include measures of pain, interference, and depressive symptoms. It is expected that the
      STD+IATP treatment will yield lower pain, depression and interference scores over time than
      STD+CBT, and that changes in coping ability will mediate the treatment effects on outcomes.
      The study will be able to tailor treatment based on patient experiences measured in near-real
      time at pain episodes, allow for adaptation of treatment as it progresses, and measure the
      impact on outcomes of coping changes over the long-term. The results will shed light on
      active mechanisms of treatment for TMD and may have implications for the management of other
      chronic pain conditions.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in pain from baseline as measured by the 11-point Characteristic Pain Intensity Index at each follow-up point</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at the follow-up points 7 weeks (posttreatment), 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Characteristic Pain Intensity will be calculated by averaging the ratings of current pain, average pain, and worst pain in the past week from the Graded Chronic Pain Scale (GCPS; Von Korff et al., 1992). Each item is scored from 0 -10.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in interference with activities from Baseline as measured at all follow-up points by the 10-item Interference scale from the Multidimensional Pain Inventory (MPI; Kerns, Turk, &amp; Rudy, 1985).</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at the follow-up points: 7 weeks (posttreatment), 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The MPI is a widely used, validated self-report inventory assessing various areas of impact by chronic pain. The Interference scale iconsists of 10 itmes assessing various areas of life that may have been affected or changed by chronic pain. Each item is scored from 0 to 6 (No change to Extreme Change).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Depressive Symptoms from baseline as measured by the 20-item Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale Revised (CESD-R) at each follow-up point</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at the follow-up points 7 weeks (posttreatment), 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>CESD-R is a 20-item scale assessing depressive symptoms. It was developed by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies (Radlof, 1977), and has shown high reliability and validity. The 20 items describe behaviors or feelings characteristic of depression that people may have. Respondents are instructed to indicate the extent they experience each item on a scale from Rarely to Most of the Time. The total score ranges from 0 to 80, with higher scores indicting mroe severe depressive symptomatology.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in pain coping ability from baseline will be measured at each follow-up point using the Brief Pain Coping Inventory (BCPI; McCracken et al., 2005).</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at the follow-up points 7 weeks (posttreatment), 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Brief Pain Coping Inventory is a well-validated scale to assess the use of coping strategist to manage chronic pain. The scale consists of 29 strategies and asks respondents to indicate on how many days of the past 7 each of those strategies was used. The total score from 0 - 203 indicates the total coping ability, with higher scores indicating greater use of coping strategies.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in pain self-efficacy from baseline as measured using the Facial Pain Self-Efficacy Scale (Brister, Turner, Aaron, &amp; Mancl, 2006) at each follow-up point.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at the follow-up points: 7 weeks (posttreatment), 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Facial Pain Self-Efficacy scale consists of 8 items asking the respondent to indicate on a scale from 0 (very uncertain) to 10 (very certain) the extent to which he or she is confident about being able to manage various aspects of chronic pain, including emotional effects, and physical limitations. The total score from 0-80 is calculated by summing the total of all the items. The scale has shown to be reliable and valid.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in pain catastrophizing from baseline using the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS; Sullivan et al., 1995) at each follow-up point</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at the follow-up points: 7 weeks (posttreatment), 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Pain Catastrophizing Scale is a well-validated measure of pain catastrophizing. The scale consists of 13 items scored from 0 to 4 that asks the respondent to indicate how often he or she has thoughts about pain that reflect exaggeration of the impact and loss of control of chronic pain. The scale is widely used and well-validated.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Participant rating of improvement as measured at each follow-up by the Patient Global Impression of Change scale (PGIC; Hurst &amp; Bolton, 2004).</measure>
    <time_frame>Follow-up points: 7 weeks (posttreatment), 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PGIC consists of two questions in two different formats asking for a global assessment of &quot;change if any, in activity limitations, symptoms, emotions and overall quality of life.&quot; A 2-point change on the rating scale has been calculated to be clinically significant.</description>
