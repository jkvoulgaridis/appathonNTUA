  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to show that the performance of the new digital signal
      processing system is better than the system used in the currently CE marked devices. Speech
      in narrowband noise and acceptable levels of noise should be improved with the new system,
      and speech understanding overall should not be negatively affected. There should be no
      artefacts or unwanted noises caused by the new system.

      This is a controlled, double-blinded, comparative clinical evaluation conducted monocentric
      at the premised of Bernafon AG in Bern, Switzerland.

      For this study, Bernafon AG will carry out testing with participants with hearing loss to
      validate the performance of a new digital signal processing (DSP). System testing of the DSP
      shows an improved signal, yet it must be tested with humans to be sure of an improvement in
      real-life situations. The current study will compare the new DSP to the one that is used in
      the Bernafon hearing aids that are CE- marked and currently available on the market. The goal
      is to determine whether the new DSP is better in real-life situations than the current
      system.

      Primary Endpoint: The primary objective is to assess the new DSP system with various hearing
      losses and levels of amplification. Speech testing will be used to analyse the speech
      perception of participants.

      Secondary Endpoint: The secondary objective is to verify the overall performance of the new
      device. Acceptable noise levels will be measured as well as further speech testing.
      Questionnaires will be used to measure subjective responses to the performance.

      Other Endpoints: The subjective performance of an optimized fitting versus a standard fitting
      and the acceptance of new domes will be measured with questionnaires.

      Safety Endpoint: The study aims to identify any new risk factors and to ensure the safety of
      the device with the newly implemented DSP system before releasing it to the market.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Speech perception with narrowband noise</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1</time_frame>
    <description>Speech perception is tested using a standardized speech test that requires subjects to repeat sentences presented among narrowband background noise. The test is adaptive with the background noise getting louder or softer so that the subject answers 50% correct. The scores are measured in dB SNR (signal-to-noise ratio) and a lower score is better. The lowest possible score is -15 dB SNR and the highest is +20 dB SNR. It is measured in the unaided condition.</description>

    <description>The Hearing aids will be programmed with a standard or default Fitting from the software and with an optimized Fitting based on questions answered by the subjects. At the end of a field test using both Fittings they will answer a questionnaire asking them to choose a preferred Fitting. They will have a scale from 1 to 10 to say how sure they are about their choice (1 being unsure and 10 being completely sure). They will also choose from a list of options reasons for giving their choice (i.e., speech intelligibility, Sound Quality, feedback).</description>
