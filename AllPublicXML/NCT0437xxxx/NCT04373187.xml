  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomized, parallel design study to evaluate the PK comparability,
      safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of a single SC dose of 360 mg CC 93538 using two
      different drug concentrations, 180 mg/mL and 150 mg/mL, in healthy adult subjects.

      A total of approximately 52 subjects will be enrolled and randomized 1:1 to receive a single
      360 mg SC dose of CC-93538 using either 180 mg/mL (1 injection of 2 mL) or 150 mg/mL (2
      injections of 1.2 mL each) drug concentrations.

    <description>An AE is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence that may appear or worsen in a subject during the course of a study. It may be a new intercurrent illness, a worsening concomitant illness, an injury, or any concomitant impairment of the subject's health, including laboratory test values, regardless of etiology. Any worsening (ie, any clinically significant adverse change in the frequency or intensity of a preexisting condition) should be considered an AE.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects must satisfy the following criteria to be enrolled in the study:

          1. Subject must be male or non-pregnant female, aged ≥ 18 and ≤ 55 years of age at the
             time of signing the ICF.

          2. Subject must have a body weight of at least 40 kg; a BMI ≥ 18 and ≤ 30 kg/m2 at
             screening and Day -1.

          3. Subject must be in good health, as determined by the Investigator on the basis of
             medical history, clinical laboratory safety test results, vital signs, 12-lead ECG,
             and PE at Screening.

          4. Female subjects not of childbearing potential must:

               1. Have been surgically sterilized (hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; proper
                  documentation required) at least 6 months before Screening, or

               2. Postmenopausal (defined as 24 consecutive months without menses before Screening,
                  with a follicle stimulating hormone [FSH] level in the postmenopausal range
                  according to the laboratory used at Screening); FSH to be performed at the
                  discretion of the Investigator in consultation with the Medical Monitor.

             Females of child-bearing potential (FCBP) must agree to practice a highly effective
             method of contraception throughout the study and for 5 months after the last dose of
             investigational product (IP). FCBP is a female who 1) has achieved menarche at some
             point; 2) has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or 3) has not
             been naturally postmenopausal (amenorrhea following cancer therapy does not rule out
             childbearing potential) for at least 24 consecutive months (ie, has had menses at any
             time in the preceding 24 consecutive months).

             Acceptable methods of birth control in this study are the following:

               -  Combined hormonal (containing oestrogen and progestogen) contraception, which may
                  be oral, intravaginal, or transdermal

               -  Progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation,
                  which may be oral, injectable or implantable

               -  Placement of an intrauterine device or intrauterine hormone-releasing system

               -  Bilateral tubal occlusion

               -  Vasectomised partner

               -  Sexual abstinence

          5. Subjects must understand and voluntarily sign an ICF prior to any study-related
             assessments/procedures being conducted, and must be able to comply with the
             requirements of the study, including the study visit schedule and other protocol
             requirements. Must be able to communicate with the Investigator and to understand and
             adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The presence of any of the following will exclude a subject from enrollment:

          1. Subject has any significant medical history/condition, laboratory abnormality, or
             psychiatric illness that would prevent the subject from participating in the study.

          2. Subject has any condition (acute or chronic) including the presence of laboratory
             abnormalities, which places the subject at unacceptable risk if he/she were to
             participate in the study.

          3. Subject has any condition that confounds the ability to interpret data from the study.

          4. Subject was exposed to an investigational drug (new chemical entity) within 30 days
             preceding the first dose administration, or 5 half-lives of that investigational drug,
             ifkn own (whichever was longer).

          5. Subject has previously received CC-93538 treatment (formerly known as RPC4046 and
             ABT-308).

          6. Subject has a history of infection within 30 days of dosing on Day 1.

          7. Subject has a history of drug or alcohol abuse (as defined by the investigator), or
             addiction within 6 months prior to Screening.

          8. Subject has a positive urine drug test, or positive alcohol urine or breath test at
             Screening or on Day -1.

             anaphylactoid reaction, or serum sickness) to any IgG-containing agent.

         13. Subject fails or is unwilling to abstain from strenuous physical activities for at
             least 24 hours prior to dosing (Day 1) and throughout the study

         14. Subject has tattoos (&gt; 25% of their body) or other skin markings (eg, scars) that, in
             the opinion of the investigator, would prevent visualization of dermatologic changes
             due to study treatment

         15. Subject has an active parasitic/helminthic infection or suspected parasitic helminthic
             infection. Subjects with suspected infections may participate if clinical and
             laboratory

         16. Subject has been diagnosed with or is being treated for a clinical schistosomiasis.

         17. Subject has a history of tuberculosis, or listeriosis.

         18. Subject has a history of hereditary fructose intolerance.

         19. Subject is, for any reason, deemed by the Investigator to be inappropriate for this
             study.

         20. Subject has received any drug by injection within 30 days of Day 1.

         21. Subject has poor peripheral venous access.
