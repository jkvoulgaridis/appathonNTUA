  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the increasingly common use of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator
      (CFTR) modulator therapies in treating CF, it is still largely unknown whether or not other
      chronic therapies can be safely stopped. The SIMPLIFY study is being done to test whether or
      not it is safe to stop taking inhaled hypertonic saline or Pulmozyme® (dornase alfa) in those
      people that are also taking Trikafta™.

      Trikafta (elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor) is a combination CFTR modulator therapy that was
      approved by the Food and Drug Administration for people with CF who have at least one F508del
      mutation. The three drugs that make up Trikafta work together to allow many more chloride
      ions to move into and out of the cells, improving the balance of salt and water in the lungs.
      These changes result in better clearance of mucus from the lungs and improvements in lung
      function.

      Inhaled hypertonic saline and Pulmozyme (dornase alfa) also improve clearance of mucus from
      the lungs to support lung function and have been available to people with CF for many years.
      Both therapies are considered to be relatively burdensome and it is not known whether either
      therapy can improve or maintain lung function above what is already gained through Trikafta
      use.

      The goal of the SIMPLIFY study is to get information about whether or not it is safe to stop
      either inhaled hypertonic saline or Pulmozyme (dornase alfa) by testing if there is a change
      in lung function in subjects with cystic fibrosis (CF) who are assigned to stop their chronic
      medication (either hypertonic saline or Pulmozyme) as compared to those who are assigned to
      keep taking their medication while continuing to take Trikafta.

      This master protocol is designed to evaluate the independent effects of discontinuing
      hypertonic saline (Study A) and dornase alfa (Study B) in people with cystic fibrosis (CF)
      age 12 and older currently taking the highly effective modulator
      elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI). Study A and Study B are identical open label two-arm
      randomized non-inferiority trials consisting of a 2-week screening period, randomization to
      continue or discontinue hypertonic saline (Study A) or dornase alfa (Study B), followed by a
      6-week study period. Subjects taking only hypertonic saline (HS) or dornase alfa at trial
      entry will be randomized 1:1 to either continue or discontinue the applicable therapy (i.e.
      HS or dornase alfa). Subjects taking both hypertonic saline and dornase alfa at study entry
      will be randomized to participate in either Study A or Study B and will be randomized (1:1)
      to continue or discontinue the applicable therapy (i.e. HS or dornase alfa). After completion
      of the first study, eligible subjects may subsequently enroll in the alternative study.

      Clinical outcomes (forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1], antibiotic use, pulmonary
      exacerbations, and patient reported outcomes), safety (adverse events) and the subject's
      perception of how stopping HS or dornase alfa (or both) would impact their daily life will be
      evaluated in all subjects. Additional outcome measurements will be conducted in a subset of
      subjects at selected study sites:

        -  Multiple Breath Washout (MBW) to evaluate changes in lung clearance index (LCI)

        -  Mucociliary Clearance (MCC) using inhaled radio-labeled particles to evaluate changes in
           mucociliary clearance

    <description>Difference between hypertonic saline (HS) therapy arms (HS-discontinue - HS-continue) in the absolute change in respiratory symptoms, as measured by the the CF Respiratory Symptoms Diary-Chronic Respiratory Infection Symptom Severity Score (CRISS) from Week 0 to Week 6. The Cystic Fibrosis Respiratory Symptoms Daily Diary asks a participant to state the extent of their 8 respiratory symptoms: difficulty breathing, feverishness, tiredness, chills or sweats, coughing, coughing up mucus, tightness in the chest and wheezing. Each respiratory symptom is assigned a score from 0-4 based on the response, with zero corresponding to the absence of the symptom and four corresponding to symptom being present 'a great deal' or 'extremely'. A summed score (range from 0-24) is calculated for each participant and converted to a final score with a range of 0 to 100, where the lowest scores indicate improvement of symptoms.</description>
