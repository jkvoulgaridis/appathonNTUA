  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of this study is to support the development of an oral formulation of
      TBPM-PI-HBr by assessing the potential ecological effects of tebipenem on the normal
      intestinal microbiota as compared to the effects of oral amoxicillin-clavulanate.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, open-label, randomized, parallel-group, active-control, phase 1
      study consisting of 10-day treatment period using TBPM-PI-HBr (600mg) (2× 300mg film coated
      tablets) or amoxicillin-clavulanate (500mg/125mg) orally every 8 hours (PO q8h [±1 hour]) in
      healthy volunteers. Participants will be randomized by gender to 1:1 ratio on Day 1. A
      maximum of 30 participants will be randomly assigned to the study treatment groups (15 in
      each arm) such that approximately 24 evaluable participants complete the study. Due to the
      multidimensional nature of data of the study, a power statement on a single endpoint is not
      appropriate. The main aim of the study is to estimate the effects of treatment on the
      intestinal microbiota, and to assess the pattern of susceptibility to specific pathogens.
      Based upon previous studies, a sample size of 12 participants in each group is considered
      sufficient to demonstrate a clinically significant impact of antibiotics on the microbiota.
      Total duration of study participation for each participant will be approximately 7
      months.Screening visit will be performed between Day -28 to Day -1. Randomization will be
      performed on Day 1 and with treatment being administered from Day 1 to Day 10. Follow-up of
      participants will occur on Day 14, 21, 90 and 180 with appropriate visit windows. Adverse
      events and concomitant medications will be recorded until the end of the study (Day 180).

             the ICF, throughout the study duration and until 30 days after the last dose of study
             drug. Men with a partner who is (are) not of childbearing potential are exempt from
             these requirements;

          8. Male volunteers must not donate sperm for time of signing the ICF until at least 30
