  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of the primary goals of spine surgery is to reduce pain and increase mobility to improve
      patients' quality of life. Currently, there is no established method for surgeons to
      objectively track their patients' mobilization postoperatively. This study is the first
      prospective trial utilizing the Apple Watch to objectively track patients before and after
      elective spine surgery. The investigators hypothesize that the ability of patients to track
      their own activity and discuss with their surgeon objective mobilization goals will not only
      help patients achieve empowerment in their own care but also improve their overall
      satisfaction and self-reported outcomes after spine surgery.
