      To investigate and compare vertical gingival display (VGD) changes associated with upper
      premolars extraction during orthodontic treatment.

      Seventy-six subjects who met the inclusion criteria were divided into one of 3 groups
      according to their treatment modalities as follows: group 1: upper first premolars extraction
      (24 patients, aged 21.56±3.19 years); group 2: upper second premolars extraction (26
      patients, aged 22.16±3.59 years) and group 3: no orthodontic intervention was performed
      (happy with their teeth) (26 subjects, aged 20.45±3.29 years).

      Initial records (radiographs, study casts and clinical photographs) were taken for all
      subjects. The same records were taken post treatment for treated subjects only. The Pre- and
      post- treatment VGD and lip length in static and dynamic positions and the amount of upper
      teeth retractions were recorded.

      The paired t-test and ANOVA test were used to detect treatment changes and differences
      between studied groups, respectively. Factors affecting VGD were investigated using backward
      stepwise linear regression analysis.
