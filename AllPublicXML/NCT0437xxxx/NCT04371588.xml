  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Muscle relaxant is usually needed for surgery. However, the optimal depth of neuro-muscular
      blockade is still on debate. Deep neuro-muscular blockade may benefit the patients during
      surgery, but may increase the risk of residual blockade after surgery. Residual blockade has
      been reported to increase risk of morbidity. In this study, we tend to observe the
      postoperative outcomes in patients undergoing abdominal surgery under general anesthesia. And
      to compare the outcomes in patients received different depth of neuro-muscular blockade.
