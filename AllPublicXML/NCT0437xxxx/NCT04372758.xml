  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute spontaneous Spinal Cord Infarctions (SCI) are an uncommon cause of myelopathy (5%), but
      their prognostic is heterogeneous and frequently severe. Positive diagnosis is difficult, one
      quarter of initial MRIs are normal. Differential diagnosis with other transverse myelopathy
      causes is a common issue. As in cerebral stroke, there are multiple causes and mechanisms in
      spontaneous SCI, often difficult to clearly establish. There are also clinical and
      radiological patterns, sometimes misleading, according to vascular territory and its expanse.

      Due to its scarcity and heterogeneity, improving knowledge and medical care remains
      difficult. Medical care is still badly codified in medical literature. Recently, diagnostic
      criteria have been proposed to better identify SCI, provide earlier care and homogenize
      future research. External validity and reproduction of these new criteria among acute
      myelopathies are still to be validated.

      While there is no established medical treatment in the initial care of spontaneous SCI, some
      case reports show successful treatment with IV thrombolysis. Given the severe prognosis,
      conventional treatment of strokes (thrombolysis, anticoagulant and antiplatelet), could be
      considered on an individual scale, in a specific protocol. A better knowledge of
      radio-clinical and security factors are necessary to support this approach.

      In order to respond to these difficulties, a retrospective cohort will allow us to better
      define epidemiological, clinico-radiological and prognostic features of spontaneous SCI. It
      lays the foundation of a possible prospective multicentric cohort, necessary for specific
      therapeutic studies.
