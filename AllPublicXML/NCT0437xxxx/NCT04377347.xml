  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For patients with spontaneous subarachnoid haemorrhage, it remains to be investigated if
      there is an association between the time from patients call the Emergence Medical
      Coordination Center to neurosurgical admission and long-term outcome.

      This is a retrospective cohort study with four-year followup. The primary aim is to determine
      if the time to neurosurgical admission is associated to labour marked affiliation and
      mortality after four years.

      <textblock>
        Patients that are retired or on social transfer payments the last three months before the
        sSAH are excluded from analyses on retirement and labour marked affiliation. However, they
        are included in mortality analyses. Also, patients aged 60 years or older are excluded in
        analyses of early retirement as reduced work capacity may to a higher degree result in
        early voluntary retirement.
