    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lyophilized PRIM-DJ2727
      capsules given orally in subjects with ulcerative colitis at remission stage. This study will
      also include longitudinal analyses of recipient's gut microbiota taxonomy and metagenomics to
      determine potential associations with clinical outcomes in context of active FMT or placebo
      administration.
