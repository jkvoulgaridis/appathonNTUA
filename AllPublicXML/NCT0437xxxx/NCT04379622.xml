  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is objective need to evaluate the differences in dietary intake (DI), body composition
      (BC), lifestyle (LS) and cardiovascular diseases (CVD) risk factors between healthy and
      active omnivores (O), vegetarians (V), and vegans (VG) and references (according to gender).

      The aim of this cross-sectional study for investigators is to document the potential
      differences in DI (non adjusted and adjusted), BC, LS and CVD risk factors between healthy
      and active O, V, and VG, aged from 18 to 80 years, and to evaluated correlation between DI
      variables and CVD risk factors.

      The study during the COVID-19 pandemic period will be self-reported. As variables the
      investigators will include the dietary intake, BC (body height, body weight, body mass index
      (BMI), body fat percentage (BF %)), lifestyle status (physical activity, daily seating,
      hygiene of sleep, socio-economic status, and motive for practicing chosen diet). The
      investigators will also record their maximum (lifetime) body weight, lipids
      (total-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides) and blood pressure
      (BP) status.

      The investigators hypothesis are:

      (H1): There are differences in DI and quality of the diet (compared with references).

      (H2): There are differences in BC between the O, V, and VG (according to gender).

      (H3): The are no differences between in CVD risk factors between the O, V, and VG (according
      to gender).

      (H4): The are no differences in the effect of two intervals of time restricted feeding (i.e.,
      8-12 hours vs. 12-16 hours) within dietary pattern (according to gender).

  <detailed_description>

      In the study investigators will voluntarily enroll health and active 200-400 participants
      within inclusion/exclusion criteria that are willing to participate in the study.
      Investigators anticipate that for this number of adults (aged 18-80 years) will require
      approx. 10-20.000 invited candidates, of both sexes.

      The methods to be used are standardized food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) that is sensible
      for different dietary patterns (to analyzed the daily dietary intake, for conventional
      component the investigators will use Dietplan7 Pro dietary assessment software (Forestield
      Software Limited, Horsham, UK), while for dietary supplements the investigators will use Res
      Pons d.o.o. servises, company that professionally manages a database with all dietary
      supplements and medicine products available on the Slovenian market.

      BC status the investigators will use self-reported data from bioimpedance body composition
      monitor (Tanita, Tokyo, Japan), for basic anthropometric status the investigators will use
      medically approved body weight scale and body gauge (in the medical centers; body height,
      body weight, and BMI), and for lifestyle status the investigators will use three standardized
      questionnaires for: (1) habitual and organized physical activity, and the frequency of
      sitting (IPAQ-long), (2) quality of sleep (PSQI), and (3) socio-demographic, economic status
      adopted by Slovenian NIH.

      Additionally, with added questionnaire the investigators will assessed the motives for O, V,
      and VG dietary pattern. Investigators will record the participants maximum (lifetime) body
      weight (and therefore maximum BMI), and used self-reported CVD biochemistry results, measured
      in a standard and comparable method (plasma lipids, BP) in national medical centers.
