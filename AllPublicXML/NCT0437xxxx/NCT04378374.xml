  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulse flours represent a fast-growing segment on the functional food market; however, their
      health effects are not well understood. The observational studies and acute trials have
      established the link between frequent consumption of cooked whole pulses (beans, peas,
      lentils and chickpeas) and healthier body weight and improved blood glucose control. However,
      it is not clear whether these effects still remain after the processing of pulses into
      flours. The investigators hypothesized that the baked food products formulated with lentil
      flour of the same particle size as all-purpose wheat flour may reduce postprandial glycaemia
      and elicit a stronger suppression of subjective appetite due to its higher content of protein
      and resistant carbohydrate compared to all-purpose wheat flour. The treatments will be
      formulated either with lentil flour or with all-purpose wheat flour of similar particle size
      or with their combination. The objective of the project is to test the effect of foods
      formulated with lentil flour and/or wheat flour on blood glucose, short-term food intake and
      subjective appetite.
