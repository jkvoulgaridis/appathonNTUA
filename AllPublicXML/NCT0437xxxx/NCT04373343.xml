  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this current study is to establish the feasibility of, and preliminary support
      for, a clinical treatment program utilizing interventions from various empirically supported
      treatments for obesity-related eating disorders and substance use disorders
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To establish the feasibility of recruiting, enrolling, and treating individuals who meet
      criteria for FA in a group behavioral intervention for 16 weeks. Data from the current study
      will be used for the purposes of further exploration of the FACT program in a larger
      randomized controlled trial. We hypothesize the study will demonstrate the feasibility of
      evaluating this treatment in future studies

    <description>a self-report questionnaire assessing the personality trait of impulsiveness. The 45-item scale measures premediation, urgency, sensation-seeking, and perseverance; only the urgency subscale will be used for the purpose of the study - The Scale is not considered a measure of trait impulsivity, rather, the scales reflect distinct personality traits that lead to impulsive-type behavior. Participants are asked to consider acts/incidents during the last 6 months when rating their behavior and attitudes on a 4-point scale, in which 1-Agree strongly, 2-Agree some, 3-Disagree some, 4-Disagree strongly.The UPPS-P Negative Urgency scale (this is the only subscale on the UPPS we will be using) is a 12-item Likert-type scale to measure one's tendency to act rashly in response to intense negative mood states. It is a continuous scale, with higher scores meaning more negative urgency.</description>

Gathering this data for descriptive purposes, there is no &quot;outcome,&quot; form of scoring, or analysis that will take place with this information.</description>
