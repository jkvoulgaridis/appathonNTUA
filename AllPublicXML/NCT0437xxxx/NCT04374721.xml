    <textblock>
      This is a monocentric, prospective, intervention study on circadian genes expression in
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells as biomarkers of circadian rhythm derangement in patients
      affected by alterations of endogenous glucocorticoids secretion (Cushing's Syndrome during
      active phase and under remission and newly or on established glucocorticoid replacement
      therapy adrenal insufficiency)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an intervention, prospective, monocentric study.

      Enrolled patients will undergo 3 visits:

        -  Adrenal insufficiency (AI) patients: patients affected by primary or secondary adrenal
           insufficiency, whether newly diagnosed or on established glucocorticoid therapy, will be
           evaluated at baseline and after three and six months.

        -  Cushing's Syndrome (CS) patients: patients affected by Cushing's Syndrome will be
           evaluated at baseline during active phase of the disease and three and six months after
           remission. Patients affected by Cushing's Syndrome who will require glucocorticoid
           replacement therapy after remission will be evaluated three and six months after
           remission and then three and six months after the eventual glucocorticoid replacement
           therapy withdrawal.

      Age-, sex- and BMI- matched healthy controls will be enrolled. Patients and controls will
      undergo the same procedures at baseline and after 3 and 6 months.

      The primary outcome measure will be the evaluation of circadian genes CLOCK and Aryl
      Hydrocarbon Receptor Nuclear Translocator Like (ARNTL) expression in peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells (PBMC) compared to healthy controls.

      Secondary Outcomes measures will be:

        -  Circadian genes expression assessment compared to healthy controls at 7:00-8:00 Ante
           Meridiem (AM) (before breakfast), 12:00 AM (before lunch), 3:00-4:00 Post Meridiem (PM)
           (after lunch), 7:00 PM (before dinner), 12:00 PM;

        -  Immune profiling compared to healthy controls by the quantification of peripheral blood
           mononuclear cells (PBMC) subpopulations assessed by flow cytometry at 7:00-8:00 AM
           (before breakfast), 12:00 AM (before lunch), 3:00-4:00 PM (after lunch), 7:00 PM (before
           dinner), 12:00 PM;

        -  Evaluation of inflammatory cytokines and adipokines production compared to healthy
           controls at 7:00-8:00 AM (before breakfast), 12:00 AM (before lunch), 3:00-4:00 PM
           (after lunch), 7:00 PM (before dinner), 12:00 PM;

        -  Circadian cortisol rhythm by serum and salivary dosage at 7:00-8:00 AM (before
           breakfast), 12:00 AM (before lunch), 3:00-4:00 PM (after lunch), 7:00 PM (before
           dinner), 12:00 PM;

        -  Sleep disturbances evaluation by The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) self reported
           questionnaire

        -  Evaluation of infectious diseases frequencies and severity compared to healthy controls.
           Infectious diseases will be evaluated by an adaptation of Infectious Diseases
           Questionnaire (GNC).

    <description>Sleep disturbances will be evaluated by The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). This questionnaire contains 19 self-related questions which are combined to create 7 component scores with a range of 0-3 points (0:no difficulty, 3: severe difficulty).

    <description>Frequencies and severity of infectious diseases will be evaluated by modified Infectious Diseases Questionnaire (GNC).
This questionnaire includes questions on infectious diseases of upper and lower respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, skin and urogenital tract contracted during the previous 12 months. Questions investigate on the number and duration of infections, necessity of antibiotic or antifungal therapy, hospital stay and days of absence from work. Final score represents the frequency of infections. Moreover, some questions investigate possible susceptible or protective factors for infectious diseases: vaccinations, use of corticosteroids, concomitant diseases, previous appendectomy, tonsillectomy, adenoidectomy, splenectomy or thymectomy.</description>
