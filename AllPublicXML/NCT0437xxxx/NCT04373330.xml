  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study, modeled upon the successful and empirically validated HELP Prevent Diabetes
      Intervention, incorporates a migraine education component describing the links between
      lifestyle behaviors and migraine activity (e.g., frequency, impairment) into an existing
      lifestyle intervention used previously for Veterans at risk for developing Type II diabetes.
      The principal objectives of this research are to assess the feasibility, acceptability
      (recruitment), engagement (retention, adherence), and promise of implementing the HELP-VM at
      the Salisbury. To achieve our objectives, the investigators propose to assess the
      acceptability of HELP-VM by determining our ability to recruit Veterans to participate in the
      HELP-VM intervention as administered through the existing structure of the Salisbury VAMC's
      Whole Health Program, to evaluate the feasibility of implementing HELP-VM by assessing
      Veterans' adherence to HELP-VM and our capacity to retain them in a clinical trial, and to
      evaluate the promise of HELP-VM by obtaining preliminary data to estimate variances of
      primary (headache frequency, headache-related impairment) and secondary/exploratory outcome
      measures (e.g., emotional distress, use of analgesics/opiates, headache self-efficacy, pain
      catastrophizing) to inform a future, large-scale trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Headache disorders such as migraine occur commonly among Veterans and contribute to
      disability and reduced quality of life. Veterans with migraine are more likely than those
      without headache to experience medically related discharge/retirement, post-traumatic stress
      disorder, sleep disturbances, and difficulty reintegrating back into civilian life.

      Despite advances in our understanding of migraine, it remains poorly understood and often
      proves refractory to validated drug and non-drug interventions. Therefore, there is
      tremendous potential value in pursuing alternate intervention pathways for migraine
      management. Although empirical support remains limited, engagement in regular exercise
      routinely is recommended for managing and preventing migraine.

      This innovative approach, if successful, could be disseminated rapidly to the VAMC in the
      United States, thereby making a substantial impact on the public health burden of migraine
      and other lifestyle related chronic diseases amongst our nation's Veterans. Consistent with
      the VA's Whole Health Initiative, this HELP-VM approach facilitates and supports Veterans'
      capacity to take charge of their own health and well-being, and recognizes the many health
      benefits of reducing sedentary activity for migraine and beyond.

    <description>The intensive lifestyle intervention used in HELP PD and that will be used in HELP-VM was a modification of the successful Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) core curriculum adapted for use in groups. The 16-session core curriculum used in DPP, covering key concepts related to energy balance, nutrition, and physical activity, was expanded to include regular sessions focused on group problem-solving of barriers and issues specific to the members and to incorporate presentations from local community groups on topics relevant to healthy living (exercise resources, etc.) The same intervention will be used in HELP-VM and will target moderate intensity physical activity (goal ≥180 min/wk). A DVD series was developed in HELP PD to standardize this core content, improve fidelity of intervention delivery, and to allow the CHWs to focus on group facilitation and problem-solving. This DVD series will also be used in HELP-VM.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Demographics: Community dwelling men and women Veterans (21 years of age and older) of
             all races/ethnicities seen as patients at the Kernersville Health Care Center.

          -  Headache Diagnosis, frequency, and chronicity: All participants will be required to
             have a diagnosis of chronic migraine as per ICHD-IIIβ criteria24. Those with headache
             frequency ≥ 15 headache days per month for more than three months will be eligible to
             participate.

          -  Willingness to Accept Randomization: Prospective participants must be willing to
             accept randomization to either the intensive lifestyle intervention or the comparison
             intervention condition.

          -  Baseline Physician Activity Level: At the time of enrollment, prospective participants
             must not be participating in a regular physical activity or exercise regimen, and
             should meet the criteria for &quot;sedentary&quot; (i.e., does not report current engagement in
             vigorous or moderate activity) on the International Physical Activity Questionnaire
             Short form (IPAQ-SF).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Other painful conditions: A diagnosis of headache disorder other than chronic migraine
             (eg, cluster headache or medication overuse headache as per ICHD-IIIβ criteria24) or
             characterizes a pain disorder other than migraine as their primary presenting problem.

          -  Non-stable headache treatment regimen: Reports a change in physician prescribed
             preventive or acute headache pharmacotherapy within three weeks prior to enrollment or
             anticipates a change in preventive headache pharmacotherapy during the study period.

          -  Recent history of cardiovascular disease: Clinical history of cardiovascular disease
             (CVD) occurring within the past 6 months, including myocardial infarction, angina,
             coronary revascularization, stroke, TIA, carotid revascularization, peripheral
             arterial disease, and congestive heart failure. All persons with recent CVD should be
             participating in cardiac rehabilitation (with appropriate supervision as indicated) to
             reduce their risk of recurrence; hence, randomization might raise ethical concerns.

          -  Hypertension: Uncontrolled high blood pressure: BP &gt; 160/100 mmHg. Potential
             participants can be re-screened after controlled.

        Pregnancy, planning pregnancy and breast feeding (self-report) during screening: Pregnancy,
        breast feeding, or planning pregnancy within the next year.

          -  Physical preparedness for exercise: Those screening positive on the Physical Activity
             Readiness Questionnaire (PAR-Q)25 those must obtain physician clearance prior to
             participation, and will be excluded unless the clearance is obtained and documented.

          -  Other Medical and Psychiatric Conditions: Candidates will be screened for other
             co-morbid conditions that could make physical activity unsafe or limit participation.
             This includes other chronic disease likely to limit lifespan to less than 2-3 years
             (eg, any cancer requiring treatment in past 5 years except non-melanoma skin cancer),
             elevated depressive symptoms and/or suicidal ideation (Patient Health Questionnaire
             (PHQ-9)28,29), anxiety levels that could interfere with participation in this trial
             (PROMIS-29 Anxiety Subscale30-32, and evidence of opioid use disorder (Current Opioid
             Misuse Measure (COMM)33).

          -  Other: Conditions/criteria likely to interfere with participation and acceptance of
             randomized assignment, including the following: inability/unwillingness to give
             informed consent, another household member already randomized to HELP-VM, evidence of
             major psychiatric or cognitive problems (schizophrenia, dementia, self-reported active
             illegal substance or alcohol abuse), participation in another research study that
             would interfere with HELP-VM.
