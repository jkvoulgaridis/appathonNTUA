  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to estimate the efficacy of experimental treatment with the
      anti-PD-1 antibody cemiplimab (REGN2810) in combination with simultaneous or subsequent
      radiotherapy (RT) in early-stage favorable classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL).

      Secondary objectives are to assess the safety and feasibility of the 2 experimental
      strategies.
