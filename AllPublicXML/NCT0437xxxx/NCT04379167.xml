    <description>YY-20394 is a selective inhibitor of the delta isoform of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K-δ) which differs structurally from idelalisib, a PI3K-δ inhibitor approved for patients with relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia and indolent lymphoma. PI3K-δ signaling pathways are frequently hyperactive in B-cell cancers, making inhibition of PI3K-δ a promising target for B-cell malignancies. YY 20394 has high potency against PI3K-δ, but with markedly improved selectivity in in vitro assays compared to idelalisib. This higher selectivity for PI3K-δ may decrease the risk of serious infection seen with idelalisib and duvelisib (a PI3K-γ/δ dual inhibitor) due to strong immune suppression.</description>
