    <textblock>
      This study assumes that to achieve significant therapeutic efficacy in advanced pancreatic
      cancer with immunotherapy, the immune system must remain relatively intact. Therefore, early
      use, low tumor load, adequate organ function, and slow growth of the tumor are the key
      points. Stage IV pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients with limited metastatic lesions and
      adequate organ function will be enrolled. Gemcitabine plus S-1 (GS) will be administered
      initially, and then CA 19-9 will be evaluated. Those fulfilling pre-defined criteria of CA
      19-9 will receive nivolumab add-on therapy.

    <description>Part-1: GS Induction
Patients will receive GS for 1 cycle.
S-1: 60/80/100 mg per day (based on body surface area, BSA); D1-12; 3 weeks per cycle
BSA &lt; 1.25 m2: 60 mg/day; 1.25 m2 ≤ BSA &lt; 1.5 m2: 80 mg/day; BSA ≥ 1.5 m2: 100 mg/day
Gemcitabine: 850 mg/m2; D1, 8; 3 weeks per cycle
After GS, patients fulfilling the pre-defined CA 19-9 criteria will enter the Add-On part.
Part-2: Nivolumab Add-On
Nivolumab: 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks, 6 weeks per cycle
S-1: according to the individualized dose on D8 of cycle 1 in Part-1, 6 weeks per cycle
