  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical removal of impacted third molars is one of the most frequent procedures carried out
      in the oral and maxillofacial surgery clinics. There are a varying range of postoperative
      complications including pain, edema and swelling. Antibiotics, analgesics and mouthwashes are
      usually prescribed for the treatment of these complications. Patients undergoing impacted
      third molar surgery are frequently prescribed chlorhexidine mouthwashes with/without
      benzydamine hydrochloride. However, to preclude the adverse effects of these chemical agents,
      there has been a search for plant-derived alternatives with anti-inflammatory, antibacterial
      and analgesic properties as part of the oral care routine following surgical removal of
      impacted third molars. However, there is no study investigating the comparison of different
      essential oils in the literature. Thus, this multicenter study was aimed to evaluate the
      effects of St. John's wort oil and virgin olive oil on the postoperative complications and
      compared with chlorhexidine gluconate plus benzydamine hydrochloride mouthwash after the
      removal of impacted wisdom teeth.This study was aimed to evaluate the effects of St. John's
      wort oil, virgin olive oil, and chlorhexidine gluconate plus benzydamine hydrochloride on the
      postoperative complications after the removal of impacted wisdom teeth.

    <description>Chlorhexidine is one of the most commonly used medications after tooth extraction. It exhibits a wide spectrum of antiseptic, bactericidal and bacteriostatic effects. The most common side effect of chlorhexidine is oral discoloration, taste changes and allergic responses. Furthermore, it has been reported that chlorhexidine has cytotoxic effect on gingival fibroblasts, epithelial cells, neutrophils and red blood cells; also shows incremental trend in genotoxicity as the duration of usage is increased. Benzydamine hydrochloride is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug that elicits anti-inflammatory, analgesic, anesthetic and antimicrobial effects. It is often used in addition to the topical application of chlorhexidine.. However, side effects such as urticaria, erythema, pruritus, photosensitivity, bronchospasm and renal problems can be observed associated with the use of benzydamine.</description>

    <description>St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum) is a European medicinal plant with a history of more than 2000 years which possessing a variety of important constituents including phloroglucinols (hyperforin and adhyperforin), naphthodianthrones (hypericin and pseudohypericin), xanthones, essential oil, biflavones (biapigenin and amentoflavone), flavonol derivatives and phenolic compounds. The important components of St. John's Wort such as hypericin and hyperforin exert anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, anticancer effects as well as stimulating tissue growth and differentiation. Hypericin exhibits anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting the production of interleukin-12; whereas hyperforin reveals this effect by inhibiting the mechanisms of cyclooxygenase 1, 5-lipoxygenase and prostaglandin E2. St. John's Wort oil is extracted by maceration of the hypericum herb in carrier oil, such as virgin olive oil.</description>

    <description>After anesthesia, the horizontal incision was made with no. 15 scalpel blade and a full thickness mucoperiosteal flap was raised. In all surgical procedures, bone removal and/or tooth sectioning were performed under abundant irrigation. Following the extraction, granulation tissues were removed, and post extraction cavity was irrigated with sterile 0.9% saline solution. After the bleeding was controlled, the mucoperiosteal flap was repositioned by 3.0 silk sutures. The patients were postoperatively prescribed paracetamol (Parol® 500 mg, Atabay Chemical Industry, Istanbul, Turkey) to use when required with a maximum of 4 doses per day. Patients were instructed to maintain a soft diet, and refrain from mouth washing, brushing and flossing during the first 24 hour. They were also instructed to rinse their mouth with 15 ml of mouthwash for 30 seconds, 3 times a day, and continue until the 7th postoperative day.</description>
