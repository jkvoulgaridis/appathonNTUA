  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In order to improve the quality of care we provide to patients, medical trainees need to
      experience low incident, high mortality events in a safe learning environment. There is a
      selection bias for predisposing characteristics of health care providers, as most people who
      have pursued a career in medicine are motivated to learn how to manage medical emergencies.
      We have traditionally enabled resources with conventional simulation centers or mobile
      simulation units. However, these are costly and difficult to access. The purpose of this
      study is to evaluate a mixed reality alternative to conventional simulation. The need for
      this is inherent in becoming a medical provider and use of these resources will improve
      health practices and health services.
