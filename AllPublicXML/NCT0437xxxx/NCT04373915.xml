  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The admission of a newborn child to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) is among the most
      distressing situations that parents can face. There are many sources of parental stress
      including loss of control and competing demands outside of the NICU involving work and other
      children. During a prolonged admission it is often difficult for families to be present at
      bedside rounds on a daily basis and thus more difficult to discuss and collaborate with
      families in the care of their child. Healthcare has been slower than many other fields to
      adapt to the availability of new technology. This study hypothesizes that the use of wireless
      technology to allow parents to remotely participate on rounds would improve parental stress
      and satisfaction, in addition to improving engagement and attachment to their infant.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Every year 10 to 15 percent of infants born in the United States, totaling roughly half a
      million babies, are admitted to a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). Although survival
      rates are generally high, as many as half of these infants require a prolonged hospital stay.
      For parents, the admission of a newborn to the NICU is among the most emotionally distressing
      situations that they can face. A prolonged hospital stay can further impact the mother and
      family physically, psychologically, and financially.

      During admission in the NICU it is often difficult for families to be present at bedside
      rounds on a daily basis due to transportation challenges or competing demands of work and
      care for siblings. Conflicting schedules between families and doctors make it more difficult
      to discuss and collaborate with families in the care of their child. The investigators
      hypothesize that this deficiency of communication and perceived loss of control can have
      significant impacts on maternal stress, satisfaction, engagement, and attachment.

      Outside of the medical field, technology continues to advance as rapidly as ever. The medical
      field continues to struggle with adapting and using new technology and continue to lag behind
      many other fields. In recent years telemedicine has been used to facilitate patient care
      delivery, improve accessibility of health care services, and reduce healthcare costs however
      this use remains largely in the outpatient sector.

      In the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, Telemedicine has been used by one group to improve
      parent satisfaction in a variety of areas. A pilot study of the concept of remote or virtual
      rounding in a Pediatric Intensive Care Unit has been recently published in the literature.
      This project seeks to expand upon this knowledge to define and measure the impact on several
      aspects of neonatal care.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a single site prospective cohort study. Participants will be block randomized to standard rounding or availability of remote rounding based on their medical care team in the NICU. Parents using remote rounding will be compared to those who do not utilize remote rounding.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Calendars will be placed at each infant's bedside to record engagement events consisting of participation in rounds, phone calls, visits, and kangaroo care. Each parental interaction recorded on the calendar will be counted. The mean and standard deviation of interactions over the study period will be calculated for each arm.</description>

    <measure>Parent Satisfaction: survey</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 6-10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A short investigator created satisfaction survey will be used to measure parent satisfaction. Each question on the parent satisfaction survey will be analyzed separately and compared between the two groups. A Mann-Whitney U test will be used for each of the 8 likert questions.</description>

    <measure>Parent Stress</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 6-10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Parental Stressor Scale: Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (PSS:NICU) will be used to measure parent stress. The instrument is a 46-item scale with 3 sub scales: infant behavior and appearance, parental role alteration, and sights and sounds. Each item is scored 1-5 on a likert scale (total sore range 46-230) with higher scores relating to higher stress. A standard t-test will be used.</description>

    <measure>Parent Attachment survey</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 6-10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Maternal Attachment Inventory will be used to measure parent-infant attachment. This is a 26 item scale with each item scoring 1-4, for a total possible score of 26-104 with a higher score showing better attachment. Differences in attachment between the two arms will be assessed using a Wilcoxon rank sum test.</description>
