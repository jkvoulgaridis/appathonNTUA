  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We will compare differences in sexually transmitted infection (STI) detection rates between
      sexual health survey (SHS)-derived electronic clinical decision support (CDS) versus usual
      care (e.g. no provision of CDS) using an interrupted time series design. We hypothesize that
      population-based STI detection rates will be higher when SHS-derived electronic CDS is
      provided compared to usual care. Secondary analysis will include a comparison of STI
      detection rates by sexual risk strata (high risk vs. at risk) and race/ethnicity.
