    <textblock>
      Introduction: Previous studies confirm that teledermatology allows the generation of a quick
      response from the specialist's consultation, reduction of unnecessary travels, early
      diagnosis and priority in the attention to the most urgent cases. Despite these advantages
      and that teledermatology has experienced exponential growth since its introduction
      approximately 16 years ago in Spain, in Andalusia, its use is still very limited. The
      objective of this project will be to carry out an analysis of the quality of life related to
      health, costs, cost-utility and informal care of teledermatology services in Primary Care
      compared to conventional monitoring carried out at the Hospital de Poniente.

      Methodology: A randomized, controlled, unmasked, inter-level clinical trial (Primary
      Care-Hospital de Poniente) and multicentre (all health centers attached to the Poniente
      Health District of Almer√≠a) will be carried out with a 6-month follow-up. Patients will be
      assigned to the teledermatology group (experimental) or the conventional monitoring group in
      the hospital (control). The patients included in the experimental group will be monitored
      asynchronously. Baseline characteristics, number of visits to the hospital, health-related
      quality of life, costs, informal care and satisfaction from the perspective of the Andalusian
      Public Health System and patients and their caregivers will be analyzed. The generic
      EuroQol-5D questionnaire (EQ-5D) will be administered to assess health-related quality of
      life and the SKINDEX-29 quality of life dermatological questionnaire. A cost-utility analysis
      will be performed to assess whether tele-dermatology is cost-effective in terms of additional
      cost for additional quality-adjusted life years (QALYs).
