  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a parallel-arm, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with a screening phase that
      includes a 28-day run-in phase to establish baseline seizure frequency, followed by a
      24-week, randomized, placebo-controlled phase. After completion of the randomized,
      placebo-controlled phase, participants may enter a 48-week, long-term, extension phase during
      which they will receive open-label treatment with vatiquinone.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Signed informed consent form.

          -  Participant or parent/legal guardian is able and willing to complete seizure diaries
             for the duration of the study.

          -  Genetic confirmation of inherited mitochondrial disease with associated epilepsy
             phenotype (Alpers/polymerase subunit gamma [POLG], Leigh syndrome, mitochondrial
             encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes [MELAS], or other
             genetically confirmed mitochondrial disease secondary to mitochondrial mutation).

          -  Despite ongoing treatment with at least 2 antiepileptic drugs:

               -  have ≥6 observed motor seizures occurring during the 28 days prior to the
                  baseline visit (Day 0).

               -  have ≥2 observed motor seizures in the first 14 days and ≥2 in the second 14 days
                  of the Run-in period (Day -14).

               -  do not have a consecutive 20-day seizure free period.

               -  have at least 80% of seizure diary data.

          -  Documented medical history of epilepsy associated with mitochondrial disease for at
             least 6 months prior to screening.

          -  Consent to abstain from non-approved therapies for 30 days prior to the baseline visit
             (Day 0) and for the duration of the study.

          -  Stable dose regimen of antiepileptic therapies 60 days prior to the baseline visit
             (Day 0).

          -  Stable regimen of dietary supplements 30 days prior and, if on a ketogenic diet,
             stable ketogenic diet 90 days prior to the baseline visit (Day 0) and for duration of
             the study.

          -  Electroencephalogram (EEG) at screening or historical EEG for diagnostic confirmation
             of seizures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Allergy to vatiquinone or sesame oil.

          -  Aspartate transaminase (AST) or alanine transaminase (ALT) ≥2 × upper level of normal
             (ULN) at time of screening.

          -  International normalized ratio (INR) ≥1.5 × ULN at time of screening.

          -  Serum creatinine ≥1.5 × ULN at time of screening.

          -  Participation in another interventional clinical trial 60 days prior to randomization
             or for the duration of this clinical trial

          -  Previously received vatiquinone.

          -  Concomitant treatment with drug(s) that have not received regulatory agency approval
             for the treatment of mitochondrial diseases.

          -  Concomitant treatment with idebenone.

          -  Ongoing treatment with cytochrome P450 (CYP) inhibitors such as itraconazole or CYP
             inducers such as rifampin. Treatment with these agents must be completed at least 4
             weeks prior to enrollment.During the study, participants should not use grapefruit
             juice or St John's wort extract.

          -  Pregnant or lactating participants or those sexually active participants who are
             unwilling to comply with proper birth control methods. Females of childbearing
