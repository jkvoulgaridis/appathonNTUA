  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of co-administration
      of tranexamic acid (TXA) with hyaluronic acid (HA) in reducing swelling, bruising and pain
      after facial injection. This will be done by comparing HA to HA+TXA in participants
      undergoing facial filler injections. Patients undergoing facial filler injections almost
      always have the same type of injection performed bilaterally in order to maintain symmetry.
      This provides a unique opportunity where participants can serve as their own controls.
      Participants will be injected with HA on half of their face and the other half of the face
      will be injected with HA+TXA. Swelling, bruising, pain, and overall satisfaction will be
      assessed using participant self-reported surveys, physician surveys, and review of medical
      records.
