  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study was to perform a 3-year retrospective analysis from a cohort of patients
      with type 2 diabetes that were treated by a pump device and were uncontrolled despite high
      U-100 insulin requirements. The study reports outcomes after the switch from U-100 U/ml
      Rapid-Acting Analog to U-500 U/ml Regular Insulin, both administered by Continuous
      Subcutaneous Infusion.

      This study is a retrospective evaluation of a cohort of patients with Type 2 Diabetes from
      six French centers, who were previously treated by insulin pump therapy, and then switched
      from U-100 Rapid Acting Insulin analog to 500 U/mL Regular Insulin (Eli Lilly Inc, France)
      between June 2011 and September 2017. All participants had been previously treated by
      Multiple Daily Insulin injections and then had been treated by Continuous Subcutaneous
      Insulin Infusion with U-100 Rapid Acting Insulin analog administered by an insulin pump.
      Patient's selection criteria included an insulin-resistant state defined by a Total Daily
      insulin Dose greater than 100 U per day, and a switch from U-100 Rapid Acting Insulin analog
      to 500 U/mL Regular Insulin during the study period. Data collection from patient medical
      records included HbA1c, lipid levels, weight, Total Daily insulin Dose, and the recordings of
      hypoglycemia episodes. Outcomes were recorded at different timelines including baseline and
      6, 12, 24 and 36-months after the switch from U-100 to U-500 insulin. Blinded continuous
      glucose monitoring (CGM) (ipro2, Medtronic Inc., USA) was analyzed in a subgroup of patients
      having CGM data available at baseline on U-100 insulin and after 6-months on U-500 insulin.
