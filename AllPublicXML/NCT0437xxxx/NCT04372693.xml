      Online Distance Learning (ODL) is an educational delivery system that helps students to join
      in an educational opportunity without physically existing in the same setting as the teacher.
      Online learning is known as the education that takes place over the Internet, often referred
      to as e-Learning, web-based training (WBT), distance learning, or asynchronous learning. When
      learners participate in an online learning course at different times, it is known as
      asynchronous learning. online learning involves the umbrella term for any learning that takes
      place across distance and not in a traditional classroom. WHO recommends Implement social
      distancing practices that may include; Staggering the beginning and end of the school day and

      the globe are educated. new shifts in education approaches could widen equality gaps. As of
      March 13, the Organization for Economic Co-operation estimated that over 421 million students
      are affected due to school closures announced or implemented in 39 countries. Most faculties
      in affected areas are finding stop-gap solutions to continue teaching, but the quality of
      learning is heavily dependent on the level and quality of digital access.

    <textblock>
      Online Distance Learning (ODL) is an educational delivery system that helps students to join
      in an educational opportunity without physically existing in the same setting as the teacher.
      Online learning is known as the education that takes place over the Internet, often referred
      to as e-Learning, web-based training (WBT), distance learning, or asynchronous learning. When
      learners participate in an online learning course at different times, it is known as
      asynchronous learning. online learning involves the umbrella term for any learning that takes
      place across distance and not in a traditional classroom.

      The reason for much of the growth in distance education programs in recent years is the
      development of the Internet and the improvement of technologies that support online learning
      environments. Despite the rapid growth in its use, there is considerable concern about
      accurately assess the quality and effectiveness of (ODL). Numerous studies comparing
      traditional classroom-based instruction with technology-supported instruction have found no
      significant differences in critical educational variables such as learning outcomes and
      student satisfaction.

      Students prefer certain methods of learning more than others. These traits, referred to as
      learning styles, form a student's unique learning preference, and aid teachers in the
      planning of small-group and individualized instruction. If optimal student learning is
      dependent on learning styles, and these styles vary between distance and equivalent on-campus
      students, then faculty should be aware of these differences and alter their preparation and
      instructional methods accordingly. Knowledge of student learning preferences can aid faculty
      in-class preparation, designing class delivery methods, choosing appropriate technologies,
      and developing sensitivity to differing student learning preferences within the distance
      education environment. Many communication skills required of the (ODL) instructor are similar
      to those needed for effective classroom teaching. On the other hand, the online instructor's
      role does require a paradigm shift regarding instructional time and space, virtual management
      techniques, and the ability to engage students through virtual communication.

      WHO recommends Implement social distancing practices that may include; Staggering the
      beginning and end of the school day and Use of online/e-learning strategies? The coronavirus
      pandemic has changed how millions around the globe are educated. new shifts in education
      approaches could widen equality gaps. As of March 13, the Organization for Economic
      Co-operation estimated that over 421 million students are affected due to school closures
      announced or implemented in 39 countries. Besides, another 22 countries have announced
      partial &quot;localized&quot; closures. These risk-control decisions have led millions of students into
      temporary 'home-schooling' situations, these changes have certainly caused a degree of
      inconvenience, but they have also prompted new examples of educational innovation. To help
      slow the virus' spread, Academic 2.7 Million students in Egypt started to learning at home,
      in February 2020, via interactive apps, and other faculties got further simpler asynchronous
      online learning tools (such as reading material via Google Classroom, ZOOM, sending lessons
      and assignments via the official website, WhatsApp or email) augmented with synchronous
      face-to-face video instruction, to help preempt school closures.

      Most faculties in affected areas are finding stop-gap solutions to continue teaching, but the
      quality of learning is heavily dependent on the level and quality of digital access.
      Moreover, the less affluent, digitally understanding, and low socioeconomic are factors
      affecting the student's achievement. For anyone who has taught face-to-face classes, making
      the transition to fully online may feel completely overwhelming. Course writers and
      instructors alike might find themselves asking questions such as, &quot;How will I translate my
      classroom materials—activities or laboratory experiences—in a way that will benefit the
      online student? How will I generate discussion and engagement between students? Assessment of
      students' perception toward provided learning methods was growing in recent years because the
      best way of confirming quality in academic education is obtaining feedback from
      undergraduates. Many studies were examined students' perception as a solo dimensional scale,
      such as self efﬁcacy, behavioral response, or affective response. While, in the current study
      the researcher prefers to utilize a comprehensive, widely used, valid, reliable, and
      multi-dimensional tool additionally avoid too-much items to prevent responds fatigue. And can
      approach either by Face to face interview or by online method. Students' learning perception
      questionnaire (SLPQ), will be utilized in the current study to measure the dependent
      variable, (SLPQ) was adopted inventory and metric instrument to assess the effectiveness of
      provided learning methods as perceived by the students. It has been developed over several
      years based on wide statistical analysis in addition to student and expert interviews in
      different countries. It covers two inventories; students' perceptions of the
      teaching-learning environment (TLE) (22 items) and students' approaches to learning (SAL) (12
      items).

      Although the implementation of Online Distance Learning will be established as a result of
      (COVID-19) social distancing measures suddenly without any plan of action, one question
      remains a need for the answer; how prepared students are for successful Online Distance
      Learning? whatever the answer may be, the new method of e-learning will be administrated for
      the student. The researcher believes that address the preparedness and rate the important
      competencies required by students for effective Distance Learning performance of the student
      is the first and important step. Although a number of the online learning readiness scales
      have been developed to assess the readiness of students to be online learners, very few of
      these scales provide an assessment concerning the knowledge, skills, and attitudes students
      might require as online learners. In many of the preparedness scales, there is the tendency
      to describe what students have to be (e.g., self-directed, self-aware) rather than what
      students need to do. In 2000, McVay developed a Readiness for Online Learning questionnaire
      that used attitudes and behaviors as predictors of online student learning readiness. McVay's
      Readiness for Online Learning questionnaire remains a popular instrument for measuring
      student readiness for e-learning environments. Several subsequent studies have since explored
      the utility and reliability of this instrument across a range of different contexts. A
      modified previous e-learning readiness scale developed by Watkins (2003). This earlier scale
      originally had 40 items which, based upon the results of Confirmatory Factor Analysis,
      Watkins et al. (2004) were able to reduce to a 27 items scale. Six dimensions were
      identified: Technology Access, Online Skills, and Relationships, Motivation, Online
      Audio/Video, Internet Discussions, and Importance to your success.

      Therefore, the current study aimed to assess Nursing students' perception and achievement
      regarding unplanned shifting the Traditional Classroom-Based to Online Distance Learning as a
      result of (COVID-19) social distancing measures:

      Theoretical framework Teachers must examine students' traditional perspectives and adopt a
      comprehensive perspective framework of learning environments that is appropriate for online
      teaching. Specific aspects of adult learning theory guided the development of the pedagogical
      model that was used to develop the online learning environment. Johnson, 1997 suggests a
      combination philosophy of learning theories rather than be confined to one preferred
      perspective such as; behavioral, Cognitive, and social learning theories. Quality online
      learning environments should be made up of elements of behavioral learning theory e.g. using
      positive reinforcement and repetition. Cognitive learning theory (for example, addressing
      Multiple senses, presenting new information in motivating ways, limiting the amount of
      information presented, and connecting new information to prior knowledge), and social
      learning theory (for example, encouraging group interaction, peer assessment, and personal
      feedback). These three theories were synthesized into integrated seven general principles
      that appear to be crucial for online learning environments. The current study adopting that
      the powerful online learning environments need to contain a combination of these principles:
      (1) address individual difference, (2) motivate the student, (3) avoid information overload,
      (4) create A real-life context, (5) encourage social interaction, (6) provide hands-on
      activities, and (7) encourage student reflection. These principles for online instruction
      will be attempted to apply all as a framework while facing the challenge of dramatical,
      situational, and unplanned application.

      An Instructional Strategy Framework for Online Learning Environments

      Research Hypothesis H1: Learning perception is lower for nursing students who learned by
      unplanned Online Distance Learning (μ1) than for those who learned by Traditional
      Classroom-Based learning (μ2), (H1: μ1 &lt; μ2).

      H1: Scholar achievement is grater for nursing students who learned by Traditional
      Classroom-Based learning (μ1) than for those who learned by unplanned Online Distance
      Learning (μ2), (H1: μ1 &gt; μ2).

      Subjects and Methods

      Research Design:

      A quasi-experimental research design will be utilized in the current study with a comparative
      approach. The study will conduct a prospective unplanned Online Distance Learning for nursing
      students as a result of (COVID-19) social distancing measures as compared to the students who
      learned the same courses in the last finished semester by the Traditional Classroom-Based
      learning. Both study and control groups will be tested for students' perception and scholar
      achievement as a dependent effect. However, subjects of the current study will not randomly
      be assigned to either the experimental or the comparison group.

      Participant:

      A convenience sample of adult male and female bachelor's students of nursing will be asked to
      participate in the current study. the participant students will be divided into study and
      control groups. Students who are currently studying Spring Semester (Official started in 2020
      February 1 to May 30) will be selected as a study group. While the control group was
      retrospectively selected, the students who studied the same courses in the autumn semester
      (started in 2019 September 21 to 2020 January 9). 1200 full-time students are enrolled in the
      college of nursing. Full-time status for each semester must have a minimum of 12 credit
      hours. Each credit hour corresponds to a minimum of 2 hours of student engagement per week
      for a traditional 15-week course. The college encompasses four levels covered by nine
      departments, around 300 students at each level. The five encompasses courses are (Nursing
      Research, Nursing Informatics, Clinical Pediatric Nursing, Pharmacology, and health
      assessment). The sample size should be not less than 180 participant, estimated by (G Power
      analysis) (independent t-tests - One tail, Effect size = 0.5, α = 0.05, Power (1-β) = 0.95,
      balanced allocation ratio 1:1). All students should have corresponded to the following
      inclusion criteria:

        -  Willing to participate in this study.

        -  None of the participants had previously taken the online-based course.

        -  The same educational background.

        -  Passed all pre-request courses.

        -  Full-time enrolment

        -  The age of 18 years old or more.

      Instruments of Data Collection:

      Three tools will be framed to collect data relevant to the current study.

        1. A brief demographic self-administrated questionnaire was constructed to collect
           information on aspects such as the participant's gender, age group and enrollment level
           in addition to students' GPA, it will be collected from the student affairs of the
           college to measure the students' scholar achievement as a dependent variable.

        2. Students' Learning Perception Questionnaire (SLPQ), will be utilized in the current
           study to measure the dependent variable, (SLPQ) was adopted, self-administrated,
           inventory and metric instrument to assess the effectiveness of provided learning methods
           as perceived by the students. It covers two inventories; students' perceptions of the
           teaching-learning environment (TLE) (22 items) and students' approaches to learning
           (SAL) (12 items). Six factors emerged from the 22 items measuring different aspects of
           the teaching-learning environment (TLE): (Teaching for understanding, Alignment, Staff
           enthusiasm, and support, Interest and relevance, Constructive feedback, and Support from
           other students). While, students' approaches to learning (SAL) measure three broad
           approaches to learning: deep approach to learning, surface approach to learning, and
           organized studying, each with four items. (SLPQ) Items will be scored on a five-point
           Likert scale (&quot;Totally disagree (1)&quot; to &quot;Totally agree (5)&quot;). The utilized instrument
           will be tested for reliability and internal validity. The instrument will be provided as
           its original language of English because the students learned and examined all courses
           in the English language. Arabic translation will be available to students if they faced
           difﬁculty in understanding any statement. Data will be collected from participants
           through an electronic questionnaire online using email (for control and experimental
           group).

        3. Modified McVay's Readiness for Online Learning Questionnaire. Watkins et al. (2004)
           developed a 27 items scale that used attitudes and behaviors of the participants as
           predictors of students' preparedness for online learning and e-learning environments.
           This self-administrated instrument was identified six dimensions: Technology Access (3
           items), Online Skills and Relationships (9 items), Motivation (3 items), Online
           Audio/Video (3 items), Internet Discussions (4 items) and Importance to your success (5
           items). The instrument consisted of a 5-point Likert-type scale response format (1-
           Completely Disagree, 2-Strongly Disagree, 3- Not Sure, 4-Strongly Agree, 5-Completely
           Agree).

      Ethical Consideration:

      Participation in the study is voluntary; each participant has the right to withdraw from the
      study when he or she wants. Informed consent will be obtained from the participants.
      Confidentiality and anonymity of the subjects are assured through coding of all data.
      Collected data will be used for the research purpose only and will not be reused in another
      research. All information taken will be protected and will not affect students' annual
      appraisal by any means. The formulated database and the result of the current study will be
      incorporating into the plan of education in the college.

      Procedure:

      Once the official permission and ethical approval are granted to proceed to the proposed
      study, the implementation will be applied in two parts:

        1. st Part will be initiated by reviewing all students' files who are studying the selected
           courses in currently Spring Semester, and the recently completed autumn semester. The
           contact information of the students who will correspond to the inclusion criteria will
           be obtained. Then, they will be invited by sent phone messages to participating in the
           current study. The student who willing to participate in this study will be divided into
           paired study and control groups. the students who are currently studying in the Spring
           Semester will be operated as a study group, also the students who are previously
           completed autumn semester will be manipulated retrospectively as a control group. The
           excepted number of participants not less than 180 students. The purpose, nature, and
           benefits of the study will be explained to the participants. A pilot study will be
           conducted on 10% = 18 students to estimate the needed time for data collection, and to
           test the feasibility, objectivity, and clarity of the study instruments. All queries of
           students regarding the meaning of the statements and how to ﬁll in the answers will be
           discussed via WhatsApp and addressed before the actual study will start.

        2. nd Part will be started by sending (instrument 1, 2) to the control group (students who
           were learned by Traditional Classroom-Based Learning) via emails to fill out. These
           collected data will be considered as baseline data pertinent to the current study. About
           the study group (students who are currently learning by online distance way) they will
           be asked at the beginning of the current semester to fill out (instrument 1, 3) that
           will be as soon when the unplanned online distance learning was started (1st week of
           February) to assess the students' demographic data and preparedness for online learning.
           Then, the following actions will be implemented while online learning is processing; (1)
           Address and consider the students' differences in online learning application as a new
           experience. Provide Content in Multiple Formats. use of various communication
           technologies. Apply lectures are audio streamed and synchronized with the applicable
           PowerPoint presentation. lectures are also transcribed and posted on the course Web
           site. Utilize links to outside Web sites that provide supplemental material on the
           current topic.

      (2) Allow for Individual Locus of Control. Access the content through links or a graphical
      organizer. access to organize the course material as students need. students may even move
      through the course topics in random order.

        -  Encourage active and collaborative interaction. In light of the idea that the whole is
           greater than the sum of its parts, each course is designed with activities that are both
           individual- and group-based.

           (3) Motivate the student:

        -  Maintain students' attention by providing an environment that is engaging and
           participative. Make the students feel that the course material is relevant. Incorporate
           Games into the Online Environment. Use Multimedia When Appropriate.

           (4) Avoid information overload,

        -  Limit the Amount of Content and Number of Activities. Organize Instruction Around
           Learning Cycles. Provide a Graphic Organizer for the Course.

           (5) Create A real-life context,

        -  Create Virtual Learning Teams. Simulate Reality Using Appropriate Case Studies. Require
           Collaborative Projects (6) Encourage social interaction,

        -  Create a Personal Connection with Students. Peer Review and Feedback. Facilitate
           Interaction (7) Provide hands-on activities,

        -  Organize Online Courses Around Projects. Think-Pair-Share in a Virtual Environment. Use
           Small-Group Discussions During Synchronous Sessions.

           (8) Encourage student reflection.

        -  Provide Extensive and Timely Feedback and encourage online Diaries or Reflective
           Journals.

      At the end of the current semester, the students of the study group will be asked to complete
      an electronic questionnaire online (instrument 2). Also, the GPA of all participants in the
      study and control group will be collected from the student affairs. Finally, the researcher
      will compare the data of the study dependent variables to the collected baseline data
      (control group).

      Data Analysis Upon completion of data collection, descriptive and inferential statistics will
      be utilized to test for differences among the study and control group subjects, using the
      SPSS program.
