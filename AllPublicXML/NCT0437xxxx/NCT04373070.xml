  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to investigate the effects of a telemonitoring and chatbot-based
      application of &quot;Living well with COPD&quot; (CAir) on health-related quality-of-life in patients
      with COPD.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The disease management programme &quot;Living well with COPD&quot; was developed to relieve symptoms
      and prevent exacerbations. It covers a disease self-management approach, educational topics,
      lifestyle coaching and physical activity advice.

      Future implications should aim to make the intervention easily accessible for a broad
      spectrum of patients at scalable costs. Patients need an engaging communication platform
      which can inform, coach and even listen in between medical visits. The inclusion of a chatbot
      agent may provide this tailored feedback. The investogator's aim is to investigate the
      effects of a telemonitoring and chatbot-based application of &quot;Living well with COPD&quot; on
      health-related quality-of-life in patients with COPD.

    <description>Participants randomised to the intervention group will receive a CAir desk and a chatbot-based intervention programme for a period of 12 weeks. The CAir desk is supplied to assess HrQoL, physical activity, and spirometry data. The first week is equal to the procedure in the control group (for details see paragraph below) and serves for baseline measurements of daily physical activity. Starting in week 2 of the study duration, participants receive feedback on their daily physical activity through the CAir chatbot application and aim to increase their daily step count by 15% from baseline. Furthermore, the CAir chatbot provides several components of the &quot;Living well with COPD&quot; programme (e.g. educational content, information on exercise training) to the patient.</description>

    <description>Participants randomised to the control group receive usual care and a CAir desk for a period of 12 weeks. The CAir desk is supplied to assess daily symptom burden, physical activity, and spirometry data. In contrast to the intervention group, participants do not receive feedback or scores of the daily reported CAT and daily physical activity.</description>

    <description>The CAir desk is a custom-built home disease monitoring device. The device consists of a smartphone (A320 [2017], Samsung Group, Seoul, Korea), home spirometer (Air Next Spirometer, NuvoAir, Stockholm, Sweden), physical activity tracker (Charge 3, Fitbit Inc., San Francisco CA, USA), and an air-quality monitor (Foobot, Airboxlab, Esch sur Alzette, Luxembourg). The components of the CAir desk are CE-certified.</description>
