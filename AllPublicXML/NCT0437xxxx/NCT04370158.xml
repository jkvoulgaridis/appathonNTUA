  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this project, the clinical diagnosis of interstitial lung diseases was carried out for the
      population with suspected interstitial lung diseases selected from the community cohort, and
      the confirmed patients were included into the existing clinical cohort of interstitial lung
      diseases, forming an interstitial lung diseases special disease cohort consisting of 3,000
      patients and corresponding matched control groups. According to characteristics of
      interstitial lung disease and the needs of National Key R&amp;D Program of China, this study will
      formulate unified clinical follow-up strategy to do long-term standardized clinical follow-up
      in patients with interstitial lung disease. The detailed information for clinical diagnosis
      and treatment as well as biological samples were collected to identify disease phenotype and
      build the database and biological sample library for interstitial lung disease cohort study.
      This study aims to provide evidence for molecular classification, screening and validation of
      biomarkers as well as precise diagnosis and prevention in patients with interstitial lung
      disease.
