      The CONFORM-TAD post-market clinical follow-up study is undertakento evaluate the prevention
      of death related to the treatment of a complicated acute, subacute or chronic type B aortic
      dissection with the E-nya Thoracic Stent Graft System. The secondary objective is to evaluate
      safety and clinical performance of the device.

    <textblock>
      In this study, patients who receive an E-nya Thoracic Stent Graft for the treatment of a
      complicated acute, subacute or chronic type B aortic dissection will be observed. The E-nya
      Thoracic Stent Graft will be implanted in accordance with the instructions for use of the
      E-nya Thoracic Stent Graft System and at the discretion of the treating physician.

      Participating physicians will be asked to provide their observations collected during routine
      standard of care for patients he/she had decided to treat with the E-nya Thoracic Stent Graft
      System. Informed consent of the patients will be obtained to allow the use of their clinical
      records for the purpose of this observational study before data are being collected.

      The period of data collection for each patient will be approximately 60 months from the
      intervention. Source document verification will be performed on 100% of patients; data from
      all visits will be reviewed and verified against existing source documents. Complete DICOM
      image files of the CT scans will be sent to the CoreLab for independent evaluation.
