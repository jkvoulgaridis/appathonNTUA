  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, there has been significant interest in dietary flavonoids (biologically
      active plant-derived compounds) as potential therapeutics. This is due to the capacity of
      flavonoids to enhance processes related to energy metabolism and cardiovascular health. We
      are interested in implementing a short-term supplementation regime (daily cocoa-flavanoid
      ingestion), in order to explore the possible beneficial effects of flavonoid-based
      interventions on responses to exercise. Hence, the objective of our study is to examine the
      impact of short term cocoa-flavanoid supplementation on processes related to energy use
      (oxygen utilisation). Our aim is to develop a novel intervention which improves
      cardiovascular health and enhances exercise tolerance.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Oxygen uptake kinetics</measure>
    <time_frame>Over 3 week period (After 7 days of each intervention). Oxygen uptake measured for 9 minutes continuously during exercise bouts (3 min warm up period and 6 minutes of exercise transition)</time_frame>
    <description>Oxygen uptake kinetics (including time constant, time delay and amplitude of the fundamental oxygen uptake response) will be determined by modelling oxygen uptake during exercise using a mono exponential function. The oxygen uptake data is measured on a breath-by-breath basis during exercise (on a cycle ergometer) using a gas analysis system and face mask. Oxygen kinetics will be measured during three moderate-intensity step exercise tests (at 80% of the gas exchange threshold) and during one severe-intensity (60%∆) step exercise test that is completed to failure.</description>

    <measure>Exercise tolerance</measure>
    <time_frame>Over 3 week period (After 7 days of each intervention).</time_frame>
    <description>Participants capacity to exercise to the limit of tolerance, measured to the nearest second. Participants are instructed to exercise at a severe-intensity exercise load (representative of 60% ∆), on a cycle ergometer until volitional exhaustion.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Heart rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Over 3 week period (After 7 days of each intervention). Measured during the length of each exercise transition (9 minutes for each moderate intensity bout).</time_frame>
    <description>Heart rate will be measured during moderate and severe-intensity exercise bouts, by short-range telemetry.</description>

    <measure>Blood pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>Over 3 week period (After 7 days of each intervention). Measured over 5 minutes before any exercise testing.</time_frame>
    <description>Systolic and diastolic blood pressure will be assessed following 10 min of seated rest using an automated sphygmomanometer</description>

    <measure>Blood lactate</measure>
    <time_frame>Over 3 week period (After 7 days of each intervention). Measured immediately before and after exercise</time_frame>
    <description>A finger prick blood sample will be taken to measure blood lactate pre- and post-exercise of each transition using a hand-held automated blood lactate analyser</description>

    <measure>Physical activity and sedentary behaviour</measure>
    <time_frame>Over 3 week period (In the 6 days preceding experimental testing)</time_frame>
    <description>Physical activity levels will be assessed in the 6 days prior to visiting the laboratory by an accelerometer, worn on the hip during waking hours.</description>

    <measure>Perceived workload</measure>
    <time_frame>Over 3 week period (After 7 days of each intervention). Measured immediately before and after exercise</time_frame>
