  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most of the studies assessing Cannabis Use Disorder (CUD) and neurocognitive functions are
      cross-sectional without examining the longitudinal changes in neurocognitive function at a
      within-subject level with respect to the continuum of cannabis use behavior, or mainly
      studying on the acute cannabis effect. As for the Genome-wide Association studies, the
      population analyzed for addressing the underlying genetic susceptibility between
      neurocognitive functions and/or cannabis use or CUD were almost exclusively based on African-
      or European- American samples or other Caucasian subjects, and thus generalizability to
      Chinese or to the non-Caucasian population definitely demands more studies.

      With the upsweeping statistical figures of cannabis use in Hong Kong and Asia, and the
      substantial falls in the perceived risk and personal disapproval from using cannabis amongst
      young abusers, coinciding the global advocacy of de-criminalizing cannabis and the increased
      availability of recreational cannabis worldwide, it is reasonable to predict that there will
      be a further upsurge in numbers of all aged cannabis users in Hong Kong as in the other part
      of the world. Therefore, the SToP-C—PeCoG study proposed here as a prospective study in
      assessing the longer term changes in neurocognitive functions and the associated genetic
      risks for those repeated and active cannabis users without psychiatric co-morbidity is
      definitely warranted. The PeCoG study will not only provide the scientific evidence to
      further unveil the harmful effects on neurocognitive functions for those self-perceived
      &quot;healthy&quot; users, but also help to raise the public awareness and to improve the
      understandings to the long-term detrimental effects of cannabis amongst users and non-users.
      Furthermore, it will provide a chance to study the associated genetic risks for cannabis
      abusers, in particular in the Asian minority and Chinese, on CUD and poorer neurocognitive
      outcomes, with genetic vulnerability being generalizable to the local population in Asia.

      The current study hypothesises that cannabis abusers have neurocognitive function decline
      over time, and genetic vulnerability is associated with cannabis abusers who have poorer
      neurocognitive outcomes or with the severity of CUD.
