    <textblock>
      This study is a single blind semi-experimental study.

      Aim: To investigate the effect of standardized care on peristomal skin complications and
      quality of life in colorectal cancer patients undergoing ostomy surgery.

      H1: Standard stoma care which is established evidence-based guides and complication
      algorithm, reduces peristomal skin complications in patients with colorectal cancer and an
      ostomy.

      H2: Standard stoma care which is established evidence-based guides and complication
      algorithm, increases the quality of life in patients with colorectal cancer and an ostomy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In order to ensure blindness in the study design, patients were not informed about which
      group they belonged to.

      Patient with ostomy in the study group were trained in accordance with the Standard Stoma
      Care.

      Patient with ostomy in the control group only skill and discharge training has been provided
      in accordance with the hospital procedure.

      All patients were followed up at 2, 6, and 12 weeks. Peristomal complications were evaluated
      by the researcher with the Peristomal Skin Tool at the 2nd, 6th and 12th weeks. The patients
      were asked to fill the Stoma Quality of Life Scale in the 2nd, 6th and 12th weeks.
