  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, open label study in healthy participants to assess the pharmacokinetics of
      cabotegravir and rilpivirine in plasma following the administration of a single 600 milligram
      (mg) and a 900 mg intramuscular (IM) injection respectively, to separate vastus lateralis
      muscles on each leg. Cabotegravir is an integrase inhibitor being developed in combination
      with rilpivirine, a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, for the treatment of
      human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The objective is to evaluate pharmacokinetics,
      tolerability, and safety of cabotegravir long acting plus rilpivirine long acting
      administered concomitantly as two separate IM injections in the vastus lateralis muscle of
      adult healthy participants. The screening phase will be of 30 days, oral lead-in (OLI) phase
      of 28 days, there will be washout period of 10-14 days, followed by an injection phase and
      follow-up period will be up to 52-weeks. Approximately 15 adult healthy participants will be
      enrolled.

             regulations regarding the methods of contraception for those participating in clinical
             studies. Male participants: Male participants are eligible to participate if they
             agree to the following during the intervention period and for at least 52 weeks after

             condom when having sexual intercourse with a woman of childbearing potential who is
             not currently pregnant, agree to use male condom when engaging in any activity that
             allows for passage of ejaculate to another person. Female participants: a female
             participant is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant or breastfeeding, and at
             least one of the following conditions applies; is not a woman of childbearing
             potential (WOCBP) or is a WOCBP and using a contraceptive method that is highly
             effective, with a failure rate of less than 1 percent (%,) during the intervention
             period and for atleast 52 weeks after the last dose of study intervention; the

             confirmed as negative (e.g., an ambiguous result), a serum pregnancy test is required.
             In such cases, the participant must be excluded from participation if the serum
             pregnancy result is positive; the investigator is responsible for review of medical
             history, menstrual history, and recent sexual activity to decrease the risk for
             inclusion of a woman with an early undetected pregnancy.
