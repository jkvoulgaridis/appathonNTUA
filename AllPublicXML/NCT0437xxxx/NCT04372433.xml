             interventions are allowed.

         23. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or
             investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of
             study results and, in the judgment of the Investigator, would make the patient
             inappropriate for entry into this study.

         24. Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia patients or patients with known Philadelphia chromosome
             (Ph+) positive AML or chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) blast crisis.
