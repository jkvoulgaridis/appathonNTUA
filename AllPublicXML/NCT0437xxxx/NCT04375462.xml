  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with cancer causing an intestinal or stomach obstruction often require gastric
      drainage to prevent symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and to prevent aspiration. This is often
      achieved by a nasogastric (NG) tube, although prolonged NG tube use can lead to unwanted side
      effects like ulcers, bleeding, and they are generally uncomfortable. Gastric drainage through
      the use of a percutaneously placed endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube has been used in people
      with cancer since the 1980s. This allows relief of symptoms of malignant bowel obstruction
      though venting of stomach contents. Decompressive PEG tubes are routinely used in individuals
      with malignant obstruction, although these tubes tend to get clogged from food blocking the
      tube.

      The AspireAssist is a weight loss device that allows participants to remove a large amount of
      the food in their stomachs after each meal to help them to lose weight via an aspiration
      device attached to the abdominal portion of the tube which allows instillation of water into
      the stomach, followed by aspiration of the gastric contents into a receptacle or the toilet.
      The device is placed endoscopically in an identical fashion to a standard PEG tube. Although
      most commonly used for weight loss, the device is FDA cleared to be used as a venting tube as
      well.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if the AspireAssist provides an improved quality of
      life when compared with a standard venting gastrostomy tube for participants with malignant
      bowel obstructions.

      This multicentered study will enroll participants into two cohorts of (study and control
      groups). The study group will undergo AspireAssist gastrostomy tube placement and the control
      group will undergo standard decompressive percutaneous gastrostomy tube placement.
      Individuals who present for venting gastrostomy placement in clinic or as consults will be
      approached for inclusion. Gastrostomy tubes will be placed 1-2 days after enrollment to allow
      for thoroughly consideration of inclusion by potential participants. Gastrostomy tube
      placement will be completed endoscopically in the standard &quot;pull&quot; method in both the
      AspireAssist and PEG groups. Questionnaires will be completed at 7 and 30 days.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate to compare healthcare utilization,
      including major and minor tube related complications between the two groups. Secondary
      objectives of this study are to compare changes in the ability to eat and drink after
      placement of the gastrostomy tube and to evaluate changes in quality of life before and after
      gastrostomy tube placement.
