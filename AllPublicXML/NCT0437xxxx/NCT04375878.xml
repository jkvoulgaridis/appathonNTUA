  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study are to assess the safety and efficacy of MS1819 in
      enteric capsules vs porcine pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) in patients with
      exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) due to cystic fibrosis (CF).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, open-label, multicenter, 2, 2x2 crossover study assessing the safety and
      efficacy of MS1819, 2240 mg/day vs porcine PERT, and 4480 mg/day vs porcine PERT given at the
      same dose and dosing regimen that was being administered during the pre-study period. MS1819
      will be administered in enteric capsules.

      MS1819 will be assessed in a 2x2 crossover including approximately 30 patients completing
      both periods. Fifteen patients will be randomized to the MS1819 2240 mg/day vs PERT arm, and
      15 patients will be randomized to the MS1819 4480 mg/day vs PERT arm. Patients in each arm
      will further be randomized to receive either the sequence consisting of MS1819 for 3 weeks
      followed by PERT for another 3 weeks or the opposite sequence of treatments, PERT for 3 weeks
      followed by MS1819 for another 3 weeks.The coefficient of fat absorption (CFA) will be
      measured at the end of each 3 week study period.
