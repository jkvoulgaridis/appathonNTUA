      BACKGROUND:

      Postburn changes in glucose and protein metabolism are at their peak during the acute phase
      of severe burns. The resulting metabolic derangements lead to substantial muscle wasting,
      insulin resistance, which ultimately hampers full recovery and reintegration into society.

      PURPOSE:

      This randomized controlled trial was initiated to investigate the effects of exercise-based
      rehabilitation on muscle wasting, insulin resistance, and quality of life during the acute
      phase of severe adult burns.

      METHODS:

      Severly burned adults (40-80%TBSA) will be recruited from one of China's largest burn
      centres.

      Subjects allocated to the intervention group will undergo a 6-12 week long exercise program
      in addition to standard care rehabilitation. As part of the exercise program, participants
      will carry out progressive resistance and aerobic training, initiated as soon as medical
      safety and patient cooperation allow. Exercise type and dosage will be chosen according to
      patient status in terms of grafts, mobility, and strength.

      The control group will receive standard care rehabilitation only, including passive,
      assisted, active range of motion exercise, functional exercise, and scar treatment.

      The results of this translational research will provide insight into the effects and
      mechanisms of exercise on both a fundamental and clinical spectrum.

      The added exercise intervention is initiated in line with the following readiness criteria,
      which were checked prior to each training session:

      Criteria:

        -  Cardiorespiratory stability:

        -  Mean arterial pressure (MAP) 60 - 110 mmHg

        -  fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) &lt;60%

        -  partial pressure of oxygen / fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) &gt;200

        -  Respiratory rate &lt;40 bpm

        -  Positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) &lt;10 cmH2O

        -  no high inotropic doses (Dopamine &gt;10 mcg/kg/min or Nor/adrenaline &lt;0,1 mcg/kg/min)

        -  Temp. 36 - 38,5°C

        -  Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS) -2 - +2

        -  Medical Doctor clearance

        -  Medical research council (MRC) score lower limbs ≥3

      Accordingly, the post burn starting time differs per enrolled subject.

      Exercises are administered as in-bed exercises or out-of-bed exercises, depending on whether
      subjects are able and allowed to engage in out-of-bed mobility.

      Exercise intensity for resistance training is set at 60% peak force based on a weekly peak
      force measurement by hand-held dynamometry, or on a 3 RM in case of out of bed exercises.
      Aerobic exercise intensity is set at 50-75% peak Watts determined by a weekly cycle ergometer
      or treadmill ramp protocol.
