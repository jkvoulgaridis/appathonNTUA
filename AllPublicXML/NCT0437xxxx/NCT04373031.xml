      This is a Phase II, randomized, open-label trial to evaluate the clinical and immunologic
      activity of pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy when combined with various immunotherapy
      induction regimens as neoadjuvant therapy for triple negative breast cancer (TNBC).

      A commonly used standard neoadjuvant regimen for TNBC is a weekly taxane (e.g., paclitaxel
      80mg/m2) for 12 weeks followed by an anthracycline (e.g., doxorubicin 60 mg/m2 plus
      cyclophosphamide at 600 mg/m2 [AC]) every 3 weeks (Q3W) for 4 cycles.

      The chemotherapy regimen included in this study is built upon the aforementioned regimen.
      Pembrolizumab in combination with this regimen will be studied as part of a multi-arm study
      that randomizes subjects to receive:

        -  Control Arm: (Pembro + ACT): Pembrolizumab induction (single-dose 200mg IV), followed by
           pembrolizumab Q3W + paclitaxel (T) weekly x 4 cycles, followed by pembrolizumab +
           doxorubicin + cyclophosphamide (AC) Q3W x 4 cycles as neoadjuvant therapy prior to
           surgery.

        -  Arm A: (Pembro + IRX-2 + ACT): Pembrolizumab (single-dose 200mg IV) + cyclophosphamide
           (single-dose 300 mg/m2 IV) + IRX-2 induction (1mL SQ x 2 daily, x 10 days), followed by
           pembrolizumab Q3W + paclitaxel (T) weekly x 4 cycles, followed by IRX-2 re-induction
           (1mL SQ x 2 daily, x 10 days), followed by pembrolizumab + doxorubicin +
           cyclophosphamide (AC) Q3W x 4 cycles as neoadjuvant therapy prior to surgery.

        -  Subsequent induction therapy arms are to be included in protocol amendments. Note: 1
           cycle = 21 days

          6. Have Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 assessed
             within 14 days of treatment initiation.

             days of treatment initiation.

          8. Have left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of ≥50% or ≥ institution lower limit of
             normal (LLN) as assessed by echocardiogram (ECHO) or multigated acquisition (MUGA)

             must be willing to use an adequate method of contraception as outlined in Section
             5.7.2 - Contraception, for the course of the study through 12 months after the last
             dose of study medication for subjects who have received cyclophosphamide, and 6 months
             after the last dose of study medication for subjects who did not.

             Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the usual lifestyle and preferred
             contraception for the subject.

         10. (Female subject of childbearing potential) Have a negative urine or serum pregnancy
             test within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. If the

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Has a history of invasive malignancy ≤5 years prior to signing informed consent except
             for adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer or in situ cervical
             cancer.

          2. Has received prior chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and radiation therapy within the
             past 12 months.
