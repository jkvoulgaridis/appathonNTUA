  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, non-randomised study examining the safety of treating high risk non-small
      cell lung cancer (NSCLC) located in a central location using radiation therapy (RT) for
      patients whose disease is inoperable. The method of delivering the RT in this study is image
      guided stereotactic ablative radiation therapy (IG-SABR). This method involves using imaging
      to ensure the radiation is being delivered to the correct location within the body and using
      higher than normal doses per treatment (fraction) to treat the lung cancer. This study aims
      to determine its safety by looking at the number and severity of side effects. This study
      will deliver 8 treatments/fractions of RT with 7.5 Gy delivered in each fraction. To be
      eligible for this study the initial treatment plan for the patient must be shown to not
      fulfil certain criteria relating to doses to the tumour and surrounding normal tissue. This
      study has its own study specific criteria which must be adhered to.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a phase II non-randomised, multi-centre, single arm trial of image-guided
      (IG)-SABR for high-risk centrally located T1, T2 and selected T3 lung tumours. Treatment will
      consist of IG-SABR using a total of 8 fractions of 7.5 Gy per fraction adhering to organ at
      risk dose-volume histogram constraints allowing a minimum dose coverage of 77% to 95% of the
      planning target volume (PTV) coverage, and a minimum dose of 87% to 99% of the gross tumour
      volume (GTV), using dose intensity modulation.

      The primary aim of the study is to determine the safety of the 8 x 7.5 Gy treatment regimen
      on the basis of the rate of ≥ Grade 3 treatment related toxicity using NCI CTCAE V5, in
      patients with medically inoperable early stage,ultracentrally located NSCLC. This is defined
      by tumours abutting or immediately adjacent to central mediastinal structures who are not
      fulfilling the conservative hybrid DVCs of the LungTech (Adebahr et al., 2015) and RTOG 0813
      (Bezjak et al., 2015) studies with full dose coverage. Toxicities occurring between start of
      treatment and one-year from the end of treatment, which are possibly, probably or definitely
      related to radiotherapy will be assessed.

      The study is planned to be carried out in 2 stages with 91 patients evaluable patients
      required for stage 1 and 87 evaluable patients required for stage 2. In the first stage, (91
      evaluable patients), if there are 35 or fewer ≥ Grade 3 treatment related adverse events
      (TxR-AEs) in these 91 evaluable patients, the study will be stopped, and it will be concluded
      that the regime is not unsafe. If there are 43 or more ≥ Grade 3 TxR-AEs in 91 evaluable
      patients, the study will be stopped, and the conclusion will be made that the regime is not
      safe. Otherwise, 87 additional evaluable patients will be accrued for a total of 178
      evaluable patients. The conclusion will be made that the regime is not safe if 78 or more
      TxR-AEs are observed in 178 evaluable patients.

      The enrolment period is expected to be 5 years which allows for a 1-year hold on accrual
      during the analysis of stage 1.

      Toxicity assessments will be carried out weekly during radiotherapy (RT), at 2, 4 and 8-weeks
      post-treatment and at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 months post treatment and annually thereafter to 5
      years post treatment.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a phase II non-randomised, multi-centre, single arm trial assessing the safety of patients receiving image guided SABR in 8 fractions of 7.5Gy. The treatment will adhere to organ at risk dose-volume histogram constraints allowing a minimum dose coverage of 77% to 95% of the planning target volume (PTV) coverage, and a minimum dose of 87% to 99% of the gross tumour volume (GTV), using dose intensity modulation. These minimums are chosen to represent at least an equivalent BED to the RT standard fractionation of 60 Gy in 30 fractions based on actual treatment dose of 7.5 Gy in 8 fractions. The study is planned to take place over two stages, with the continuation to stage two pending the results of stage one. The safety of the regimen will be based on the rate of ≥ Grade 3 treatment related toxicities per CTCAE V5 occurring between start of treatment and one-year from the end of treatment, which are possibly, probably or definitely related to radiotherapy.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>From start of treatment to 1 year post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The rates of ≥ Grade 3 treatment-related adverse events (TxR-AEs) will be calculated as the proportion of evaluable patients (along with the 95% CI) who have any &gt;= Grade 3 treatment-related adverse event occurring between the start of RT and one year post-RT, among the total evaluable patients. These rates will be reported by T stage (T1 versus T2 versus T3 or combined T stages). The NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE Version 5.0) for scoring the treatment-related adverse events will be used.
The following will be reported at the time of primary endpoint analysis
Tabulation of all cases entered, and any patients excluded from the analysis with reasons for exclusion;
Distribution of important prognostic baseline and other pre-treatment variables;
Frequency and severity of adverse events;
Compliance rates of treatment delivery with respect to the protocol prescription</description>

    <description>The Kaplan-Meier method will be used to estimate freedom from local failure, local failure free survival, disease-free survival, metastasis-free survival and overall survival at 1- year, 3-years and 5-years. These efficacy endpoints will be expressed as median survival with 95% CI. The failure event for overall survival is a death due to any cause. The failure event for disease free survival is defined as death due to any cause, local failure, marginal failure, involved node failure, regional failure, distant metastasis, or second primary. Subgroup analyses may be undertaken if the sample sizes involved in each subgroup are adequate to support such analyses.</description>

The peak standard uptake value (SUV), normalised SUV (peak SUV of regions of interest/mean SUV of the aortic arch), and the change of SUV and normalised SUV (subtracting SUV and normalised SUV at reassessment from baseline data respectively) will be used as PET scan data. The distribution of the peak SUV and normalised SUV will be reported for each time point, respectively. The distribution of change of SUV and normalised SUV will be reported.</description>
