  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Renal cell cancer (RCC) is one of the most important urogenital tumors because of it's high
      mortality and increasing incidence. RCC, which accounts about 3% of all malignant tumors in
      the adults, is the most lethal urogenital cancer. The high mortality rate stimulate
      investigator groups to study RCC pathogenesis including immunological part. It is interesting
      that immunotherapy was firstly started in patients with metastatic RCC using IL-2 and
      interferon gamma. The first results were promising but the exact mechanism of acting was not
      found. In the RCC, as in the others tumors, immune cells (T lymphocytes, NK and NKT cells)
      are responsible for main antitumor effect. Their effect was caused by cytotoxic activity on
      the tumor cells. In the investigation investigators will determine patterns of aggregation of
      tumor infiltrating immune cells in the blood, healthy kidney and carcinomatous tissue. But,
      presence of this cells not implicated that this cells are active. Their activity will be
      determined by proofing cytotoxicity of different subgroup of immune cells. In that way
      investigators will present different patterns of aggregation of tumor infiltrating immune
      cells and their cytotoxicity which will direct that this cells are active with antitumor
      effect. Correlation of collected data with classical prognostic factors in the patients with
      RCC as tumor staging, tumor grading (Fuhrman) and histological subtype will help to determine
      some immunological factors as possible new prognostic factors. For conclusion, the results of
      this study will allow better understanding of RCC pathogenesis, specially their immunological
      part and become a foundation for the future investigations.

      Cellular immunity will be investigated in the two group of patients: operated patients with
      RCC and healthy volunteers.

      In the study investigators will determine patterns of aggregation of tumor infiltrating
      immune cells in the blood (RCC patients and volunteers), healthy kidney and carcinomatous
      tissue as their cytotoxicity (only RCC patients).

      Investigators will determine:

        1. presence of different immune cells in the blood and kidney tissue (T lymphocytes, NK
           cells, NKT cells, T regulatory cells),

        2. presence and distribution of cytolytic molecule perforin and granulysin in immune cells
           (T lymphocytes, NK cells, NKT cells) in the blood, kidney tissue and urine

        3. NK cytotoxicity

        4. possible correlation between presence of immune cells and clinical prognostic factors
