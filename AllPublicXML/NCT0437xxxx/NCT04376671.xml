  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epileptic patients are plighted with limited daily activities, social dysfunction, family
      conflicts and cognitive impairment. Most of the studies had showed that cognitive disorders
      were frequent in patients with epilepsy.The cognitive impairment has been reported in around
      25% of epileptic patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive consequences in epilepsy are often described in the following domains: verbal
      memory, language, executive functions, and attention. However, most of the studies focus on
      one or two domains in a relatively small sample.

      Few studies have investigated the influential factors for the epilepsy-related cognitive
      impairment . However, most of these studies merely focused on one or a few potential factors
      and failed to consider possible distractions from other influential factors. Therefore, it is
      crucial to include more potential factors in the analysis and to rule out possible
      confounding interactions between factors.

    <description>This is a rapid screening tool to estimate the cognitive functions that evaluates orientation, basic attention, working memory, learning, naming, construction, comprehension, and repetition. The maximum score is 30 and scores below 24 indicating cognitive impairment.</description>

    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Montreal cognitive assessment is a rapid sensitive screening tool for assessment of impaired cognitive function (Nasreddine et al., 2005). The main domains of MoCA scale include attention, executive functions, memory, language, attention, naming, orientation, and visual-spatial ability. The total score is 30 points. A score of 25 points or less indicated impaired cognitive function. For patients with less than12 years of education, one point was added to the total score.</description>

    <description>The patients underwent EEG recordings according to previously published methods (Bonanni et al., 2008). . EEG recordings were analyzed with methods described in our previous work (Bonanni et al., 2008) by 2 experimenters unaware of the clinical conditions of the subjects. Briefly, quantitative EEGs (QEEGs) were recorded from 21 scalp derivations. Ag/AgCl disk scalp electrodes (19) were placed according to the international 10-20 system, EEG was recorded from Fp1, Fp2, Fz, F3, F4, F7, F8, Cz, C3, C4, Pz, P3, P4, T3, T 4, T5, T6, O1, and O2. Two additional electrodes were placed on A1 and A2. EEG activity was analyzed from single or multiple leads grouped to define the following scalp regions: anterior (Fz, Fp2, F7, Fp1, F3, F4, and F8), central (Cz, C3, and C4), posterior (Pz, P3, P4, O1, and O2), and temporal (T3, T4, T5, and T6).</description>
