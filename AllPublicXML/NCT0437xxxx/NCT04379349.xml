  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Engagement with clinical services for youth with early psychosis represents a significant
      challenge, with up to 40% of patients dropping out of treatment in the first year. This has
      been linked to worse illness outcomes and represents a significant barrier to recovery for
      these patients. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of short message service (SMS) as a
      means of improving clinical engagement in early-episode psychosis populations by bridging
      contact between appointments with weekly check-ins/reminders. These weekly check-ins during
      the first year of treatment will serve as an additional opportunity to reach out to patients
      and give them a chance to do the same with their care teams, with patient responses
      triggering clinician follow-up if necessary.
