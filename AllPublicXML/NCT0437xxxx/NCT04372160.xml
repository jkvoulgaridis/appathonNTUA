  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypothesis: The online 24 hour dietary recall will be comparable to interviewer-administered
      24 hour dietary recall considering the limits of agreement in the reporting of energy and
      macronutrient intake. If the two methods of dietary assessment are comparable (i.e., if
      greater than 95% of the data plots will lie within the limits of agreement), the online
      dietary assessment tool could be used in future studies to collect dietary intake data and
      health data in larger sets of Russian populations, in order to investigate the potential
      differences in anthropometric risk factors of non-communicable diseases (cancers, diabetes,
      obesity, hypertension, mortality, etc.) in people with different diet.

  <detailed_description>

      Baseline assessments include a demographic questionnaire, including anthropometrics (height,
      weight), a heath status questionnaire, supplement intake, eating habits, and a food frequency
      questionnaire, and cardiovascular assessment (blood pressure and heart rate).
