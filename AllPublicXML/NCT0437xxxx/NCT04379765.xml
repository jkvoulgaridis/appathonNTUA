      Total of 60 patients with a diagnosis of spinal stenosis is planned for 30 patients, with
      physical therapy modeling and exercise, and 30 patients with surgical treatment. Patients
      will be evaluated by the same physician 5 times, before early primary treatment, 1st month,
      3rd month, 6th month and 12th month after treatment.

      Patients between 40-85 years old who are hospitalized and treated with the diagnosis of LSS
      in Physical Medicine and rehabilitation, Orthopedics and Neurosurgery Clinics will be
      included in the study. The diagnosis of LSS will be made by MR and / or CT and neurogenic
      claudication history.

      Total of 60 patients with a diagnosis of spinal stenosis is planned for 30 patients, with
      physical therapy modeling and exercise, and 30 patients with surgical treatment, and the
      duration of the study is considered to be 24 months. Patients will be evaluated by the same
      physician 5 times, before early primary treatment, 1st month, 3rd month, 6th month and 12th
      month after treatment.

      Clinical evaluation will be done by the same physician. In patients with spinal stenosis,
      pain (movement, rest, night) VAS, functional status walking distance and ILBDI (Istanbul
      waist pain disability index) inquiry form, Nottingham Extended Life Profile will be used.
