  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Single-lead electrocardiography (ECG) technologies and photoplethysmography (PPG) deriving
      smartphone apps are gaining interest in the heart rhythm detection space since these apps
      have the potential to capture and assess heart rhythms. Proprietary arrhythmia detection
      algorithms are proven to be reliable and accurate. However, insights into the readability of
      PPG waveforms by human reviewers remain limited. To the investigators' knowledge, there are
      no publications available regarding the readability of PPG waveforms by human reviewers. The
      objective of the study was to assess the readability of PPG and single-lead ECG analysis by
      medical professionals, with respect to the gold-standard 12-lead ECG diagnosis, and
      investigate whether additional information positively impacts PPG analysis.

      During the study, the readability of PPG and single-lead ECG waveform analysis will be
      investigated. The objective of the study is to determine the readability of PPG and
      single-lead ECG measurements, with respect to the gold-standard 12-lead ECG, and investigate
      whether additional information positively impacts the readability of PPG. Medical
      professionals (cardiologists, electrophysiologists, cardiac nurses, and general
      practitioners), blinded for the patients' characteristics and history, are instructed to
      separately analyse the following signals, obtained from 30 patients.

        -  30 outputs with PPG waveforms

        -  30 outputs with PPG waveforms with tachogram and Poincaré

        -  30 outputs with PPG waveforms with tachogram, Poincaré, and algorithm interpretation

        -  30 outputs with single-lead ECG waveforms

        -  30 outputs with 12-lead ECG waveforms

      Participants report the results of the qualitative analysis via a digital questionnaire with
      multiple-choice questions. Medical professionals classify each rhythm trace as regular
      rhythm, one or more ectopic/missed heartbeats, atrial flutter, atrial fibrillation,
      unreadable, or other. The tachogram, Poincaré, and the algorithm interpretation are
      subsequently added to investigate whether the additional information improves the readability
      of PPG. Based on the provided answers, the study team will determine the readability of PPG
      and single-lead ECG analysis interpretation, with respect to the gold-standard 12-lead ECG
      diagnosis.
