  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury increases the risk for chronic kidney disease, length of stay,
      readmissions and mortality. Currently the only way to diagnose acute kidney injury is with a
      serum creatinine or drop in urine output. Biomarkers for acute kidney injury are well
      elevated before rise in creatinine. Hypothesis is that by implementing an electronic alert
      system with an algorithm followed by remote ischemic preconditioning will prevent acute
      kidney injury.

      The propose study is to incorporate an alert system in current medical health system and an
      algorithm will be used to activate clinicians and Nephrologist to confirm if patient is at
      high risk. Once identified as high risk the clinician and/or nephrologist will intervene and
      change current management if needed. First phase of study will look at an alert system and
      algorithm was enough to lower incidence of acute kidney injury. Phase 2 will also use alert
      system and algorithm that will be further randomized those that are identified as high risk
      for acute kidney injury to remote ischemic preconditioning.

    <intervention_model_description>Two part study: all patients will be triaged by alert system whether they are high risk for acute kidney injury and those patients that are identified as high risk for AKI have standard of care implemented by following kidney disease improving global outcomes guidelines in preventing AKI and part 2 will perform procedure called remote ischemic preconditioning in addition to standard of care in part1 in those patients that are identified as high risk for acute kidney injury.</intervention_model_description>
