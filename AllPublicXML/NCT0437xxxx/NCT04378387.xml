  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adrenal vein sampling (AVS) is currently considered the gold standard for subtype diagnosis
      of primary aldosteronism (PA). However, the percentage of unsuitable procedures due to the
      unsuccessful cannulation of one of the two adrenal veins is still considerable, and there is
      no general consensus on the criteria that should be used for the interpretation of the
      results of an AVS study in these specific cases.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The differentiation between subtypes of primary aldosteronism (PA) is fundamental to refer
      each patient to the most appropriate therapeutic approach (surgical in case of unilateral
      disease and medical in case of bilateral disease). Adrenal vein sampling (AVS) is currently
      considered the gold standard for such differentiation between subtypes.

      However, despite significant progress in optimizing the AVS procedure, the percentage of
      unsuitable procedures due to the unsuccessful cannulation of one of the two adrenal veins is
      still considerable, especially in less experienced centers.

      It would therefore be important to identify criteria for the interpretation of the results of
      a suboptimal AVS study (i.e. with sampling of only one of the two adrenal veins). This
      problem has recently been addressed by some groups; however, there is still no general
      consensus on these criteria and all existing studies must be considered exploratory in this
      field.

      In this study, therefore, all patients with PA followed by our center and who underwent a
      successful (i.e. with correct cannulation and sampling from both adrenal veins) unstimulated
      (i.e. without cosyntropin stimulation) AVS procedure will be retrospectively evaluated.

      If a reliable unilateral index could be identified for subtype diagnosis, this tool could be
      used for the interpretation of suboptimal AVS data, thus preventing a certain percentage of
      patients from the necessity to repeat the procedure and allowing to refer each one, also on
      the basis of an incomplete dataset, to the most appropriate therapeutic approach.

    <description>For each adrenal gland, monolateral index will be computed by dividing the ratio of aldosterone/cortisol in its adrenal vein by the ratio of aldosterone/cortisol in a peripheral vein. By definition, this will be a unitless index. The index will be compared between three main groups of interest (i.e. adrenal glands with a final diagnosis of ipsilateral Conn adenoma, adrenal glands with a final diagnosis of contralateral Conn adenoma, adrenal glands with a final diagnosis of bilateral adrenal hyperplasia).</description>

    <description>For each adrenal gland, aldosterone/cortisol index represents the ratio of aldosterone/cortisol in its adrenal vein. Aldosterone will be measured in pg/ml, cortisol will be measured in mcg/l. The index will be compared between three main groups of interest (i.e. adrenal glands with a final diagnosis of ipsilateral Conn adenoma, adrenal glands with a final diagnosis of contralateral Conn adenoma, adrenal glands with a final diagnosis of bilateral adrenal hyperplasia).</description>
