  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spinal cord injury (SCI) is associated with severe neuropathic pain that is often refractory
      to all pharmacological intervention. Preliminary data suggest brivarecetum is a
      mechanism-based pharmacological intervention for neuropathic pain in SCI. This randomized,
      placebo-controlled pilot clinical trial will assess feasibility of a 3-month treatment course
      with brivarecetum.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigations will assess changes in pain intensity and periaqueductal gray
      hyperactivity. Baseline periaqueductal gray hyperactivity and microRNA levels will be
      measured as potential biomarkers of response to treatment. These preliminary findings will be
      used to design larger clinical trials to establish efficacy of brivarecetum to treat
      neuropathic pain in SCI.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Brief Pain Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) contains 11 numeric rating scales that measure pain intensity and the effect of the pain on a participant's ability to function during various activities of daily living. Each of the 11 scales is rated from 0 (no pain/does not interfere) to 10 (severe pain/completely interferes). Total scores range from 0-110, with higher scores indicating greater pain and interference on daily activities.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The satisfaction with life scale contains 5 items designed to measure global cognitive judgments of life satisfaction. Each of the 5 items is rated on a 7-point Likert scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). Total scores range from 5 to 35, with higher scores indicating greater satisfaction with life.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Periaqueductal Gray Activity</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Periaqueductal gray activity is measured by fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging). Outcome is reported as the change in bold signal (a unitless measure) in the targeted area.</description>
