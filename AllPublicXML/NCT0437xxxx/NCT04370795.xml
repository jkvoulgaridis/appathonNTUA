  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Severe combined immune deficiency (SCID) is a group of conditions where the immune system
      does not work properly. The only cure for most SCIDs is a stem cell transplant (getting cells
      from a donor). These transplants can have serious complications. Before the transplant,
      people often get high doses of drugs and radiation to prepare the body to accept the cells
      from the donor. Researchers want to see if low doses of drugs alone without radiation work
      just as well as low doses of drugs with radiation for SCID patients getting stem cell
      transplants.

      Objective:

      To test a set of drugs with or without radiation given before a stem cell transplant.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 3-40 who have SCID and who have a stem cell donor - either related or unrelated.

      Design:

      Participants will be admitted to the hospital 10 days before transplant. They will undergo:

      medical history

      medication review

      physical exam

      blood and urine tests (may include a 24-hour urine collection)

      heart, lung, and breathing tests

      imaging scans

      bone marrow sample

      nutrition assessment

      dental exam

      eye exam

      meeting with a social worker.

      Participants will get a plastic port called a central line. It is a hollow tube that is
      placed in the upper chest. It will be used to give medicines and take blood.

      All participants will take chemotherapy drugs. Some will get radiation.

      Participants will have a stem cell transplant. They will get the cells as an infusion through
      their central line. They will stay in the hospital for 30 days after transplant.

      Participants must stay within 1 hour of NIH for 3 months after transplant. During this time,
      they will have follow-up visits at NIH at least once a week. Then they will have follow-up
      visits once or twice a year for 5-6 years.

    <textblock>
      This is an open-label pilot study of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched related and
      unrelated donor hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplant (also referred to as peripheral
      blood stem cell [PBSC] transplant or bone marrow transplant [BMT]) for up to 20 patients with
      severe combined immune deficiency (SCID). SCID is most commonly caused by mutations in the
      IL2RG gene encoding the interleukin (IL) receptor signaling gamma chain (gamma c); however,
      patients with JAK-3 mutations have the same phenotypes and are similarly affected. The study
      population is older children (greater than or equal to 3 years of age) and adults (less than
      or equal to 40 years of age) who are experiencing deteriorating and/or dysfunctional immunity
      and/or any of a constellation of severe or chronic medical problems warranting
      transplantation. The study is designed to evaluate whether the use of uniquely designed
      transplant conditioning either containing total body irradiation (TBI) or not, along with a
      graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) prevention regimen achieves sufficient engraftment of donor
      HSCs to facilitate robust restoration of cellular immunity (T cell/natural killer [NK] cell
      number and function) including thymic function, and humoral immunity (B cell number and
      function), while at the same time enhancing tolerance of the donor graft in a fashion that
      reduces the occurrence of GvHD but not significantly enhancing the risk of post-transplant
      viral infection. One target population is SCID patients who received matched sibling or
      haploidentical lymphocyte-depleted transplants as infants with little or no myeloid
      conditioning, resulting in variable restoration of T cell immunity, but little or no
      restoration of NK or B cell immunity. Another target population is SCID patients with partial
      production or function of gamma c or JAK3 or SCID patients with clonal somatic reversion of
      the mutation in the IL2RG or JAK-3 gene, who have less severe immune deficiency in childhood.
      A subset of patients from all of these target SCID populations may experience progressive
      deterioration of immune function leading to acute and chronic medical problems that warrant
      consideration of allogeneic transplant to restore immunity.

      The conditioning and GvHD prevention regimens for this HSC transplant protocol are designed
      to use mobilized PBSCs or bone marrow (if mobilization is not possible) from either an
      HLA-matched related donor (MRD) as first choice or from an HLA-matched unrelated donor (MUD)
      for those without an appropriate HLA-MRD. If there is no appropriate MRD nor MUD adult donor
      available, then an appropriate cord blood from the cord blood registries may be used for
      small children SCID recipients. We propose using a busulfan-based, nonmyeloablative
      conditioning regimen plus or minus TBI combined with horse anti-thymocyte globulin (h-ATG)
      immune suppression conditioning plus post-transplant sirolimus as a tolerance-inducing
      immunosuppressant to prevent GvHD.

        INCLUSION OF VULNERABLE PARTICIPANTS

        Children: Children 3 years of age and older may enroll on this study because the condition
        under study affects children and the study holds the prospect for direct benefit.

        Pregnant and Lactating Women: Pregnant women are excluded from this study due to risks
        associated with the study intervention and the effects of the combination of conditioning
        medications (h-ATG, busulfan) and total body irradiation on the developing human fetus,
        including potential teratogenic or abortifacient effects.

        If a study participant or partner of a male subject becomes pregnant or suspects she is
        pregnant, the participant should notify the study staff immediately. A female participant
        who becomes pregnant will be withdrawn from the study as outlined below. If a female
        participant or a partner of a male participant becomes pregnant, the participant will have
        contact follow-up with the study team to document the outcome of the pregnancy.

        Because there is an unknown but potential risk for AEs in nursing infants secondary to the
        mother undergoing the study intervention, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the
        mother will undergo the study intervention.

        Decisionally Impaired Adults: Adults who are unable to consent are eligible for enrollment
        in this protocol because they still benefit clinically from the study. However, the
        participant must have a DPA that can give consent. Similarly, enrolled participants who
        lose the ability to provide ongoing consent during study participation may continue in the
        study. The risks and benefits of participation for adults unable to consent should be
        identical to those described for less vulnerable patients.
