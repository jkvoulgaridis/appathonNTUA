  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I study of 177Lu-DOTA-TATE in combination with the PARP-inhibitor olaparib
      for treatment of patients with somatostatin receptor positive tumours detected by
      68Ga-DOTA-TATE/TOC PET. The combination of a PARP inhibitor that will specifically target the
      repair mechanism, with ionising radiation causing SSB's might overcome the repair dependent
      survival of the tumour cells, making them more sensitive to β-emission and increase the
      probability of tumour cell death.

          -  GEPNETs grade 3 or aggressive grade 2 tumours with a poor prognosis and a Ki67 &gt; 15%
             OR neuroendocrine tumours NOS after standard therapy OR thymomas/tumours of other
             origin after standard therapy OR meningiomas after standard therapy not suitable for
             surgery or radiotherapy

          -  Evidence of regional or distant metastases or localised disease not accessible for
             complete resection

          -  Measurable disease according to RECIST 1.1

          -  Evidence of somatostatin receptor positive disease detected by 68Ga-DOTA-TATE/TOC PET

          -  Progressive disease during the last 14 months based on CT or new lesions detected by
             68Ga-DOTA-TATE PET.

          -  Performance status ECOG 0 - 1

          -  Life expectancy &gt; 6 months

          -  Age &gt;18 years, no upper age limit.

          -  Neutrophil count &gt;1,5 x 109/L

          -  Platelet count &gt;100 x 109/L

          -  Normal liver function regarding transaminases, PK and albumin. A raised bilirubin
             which can be considered an isolated effect of liver metastases is not a
             contraindication as long as the levels remain &lt;1.5 x ULN.

          -  GFR &gt; 50 ml/min

             been amenorrheic for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. The following
             age-specific requirements apply:

               -  Women &lt;50 years of age would be considered post-menopausal if they have been
