    <textblock>
      There are limited data about the role of regulatory B cells in Behcet Disease. In this study
      we aimed to identify the proportions of total B lymphocytes and their regulatory subset in
      different Behcet Disease phenotype and therapies concentrating on the cardiovascular system
      attempting to unravel their function in Behcet Disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Behçet's disease is a chronic multi-organ vasculitis characterized by recurrent oral and
      genital aphthae, skin lesions, widespread thrombosis and aneurysmal formation, and serious
      involvement of the eyes and central nervous system.

      The innate and adaptive immune cells integrate in the pathogenesis of Behçet's disease.
      Interestingly, the gene expression analysis of Behçet's disease patients and healthy controls
      revealed the modulation of a range of genes involved in biological processes in Behçet's
      disease such as inflammation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, blood coagulation, vascular damage,
      signalling pathways, and immune responses, particularly, in innate immune cells, Th17 cells
      and B cells. Yet, the regulatory role of B cells in Behçet's disease has not been thoroughly
      investigated. Therefore, the aim of the current study is to identify the proportions of total
      B lymphocytes and their regulatory subset in different Behçet's disease phenotypes and
      therapies attempting to unravel their function in Behcet Disease. The role of B cells and
      regulatory B cells in the cardiovascular system affection in Behcet Disease was studied in
      more details.
