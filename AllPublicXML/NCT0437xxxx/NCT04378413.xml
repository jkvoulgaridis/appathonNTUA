    <measure>pain in low back pain after aqua and land exercises</measure>
    <time_frame>4 week</time_frame>
    <description>It is asked to mark pain on a 10 cm scale.Pain was assessed at rest and at movement by using a 10-cm-long visual (0 cm means no pain while 10 cm means worst pain</description>

    <measure>quality of life after aqua and land exercises</measure>
    <time_frame>4 week</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life was assessed by Short-Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36) High scores indicate good quality of life and low scores represent poor quality of life.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>disability in low back paitients after aqua and land exercise</measure>
    <time_frame>4 week</time_frame>
    <description>.For disability assessment, the Modified Oswestry Disability İndex was used . According to the sum of scale; 0-4 points were considered as no disability, 5-14 points were mild, 15-24 points were moderate, 25-34 points were serious, and 35-50 points were fully functional inadequacy.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>kinesiophobia in low back paitients after aqua and land exercise</measure>
    <time_frame>4 week</time_frame>
    <description>The assessment of kinesiophobia was made with the Tampa Scale The fact that the individual got a high score from the questionnaire shows that she has more fear of movement.</description>

    <description>Water-based exercise program was conducted in the second group of 15 patients in an indoor swimming pool. Temperature of mineral water was 36 °C. The program included warming up by walking forwards, sideways and backwards through the water in the pool; active range of motion of the joints of the lower extremities; stretching lower extremities; strengthening exercises for hips, knees, arms, elbows and wrists; and cooling down (slow walking, squatting and standing).</description>
