  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates mental health mobile apps, to understand their efficacy in reducing
      mild levels of psychological distress amongst adolescents. All participants will be provided
      with an app which is already available in the public domain, and will be asked to use the app
      for guided self-help. Half of participants will receive a weekly telephone call, whilst the
      other half will not.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The subscription version of the app &quot;Sanvello&quot; has several self-help exercises based on
      Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (to identify and challenge their thinking styles) and
      Mindfulness practices (to connect them with the present moment). Participants will be asked
      to complete these exercises on a daily basis for five weeks.

      Telephone calls will be provided weekly to half of participants to provide information about
      the app, or a rationale for its use. This phone call will not serve to provide any extra
      intervention or therapy to the participants.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Kessler 10</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 18 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>10 item self-report measure of psychological distress with five response categories (none of the time, a little of the time, some of the time, most of the time, all of the time). Scores range from 10 to 50; a higher score indicates more psychological distress.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire-Short</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 18 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>18 item self-report process measure of cognitive strategies to regulate emotions with five response categories (almost never, rarely, occasionally, frequently, almost always). This measure has nine subscales, with two items each (self-blame, acceptance, rumination, positive refocusing, refocus on planning, positive reappraisal, putting into perspective, catastrophising, other-blame). Scores per subscale range from 2 to 10; higher scores indicate greater use of specific cognitive strategies, some of which are favourable and others indicate negative thinking styles.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 18 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>14 item self-report measure of wellbeing with five response categories (none of the time, rarely, some of the time, often, all of the time). Scores range from 14 to 70; a higher score indicates better mental wellbeing and scores below a cut point of 40 indicate low wellbeing.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>CompACT-8</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 18 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>8 item self-report measure of psychological flexibility with six response categories (strongly disagree, moderately disagree, slightly disagree, neither agree nor disagree, slightly agree, moderately agree, strongly agree). Total scores range from 0 to 48, with higher scores indicating greater psychological flexibility. This measure has three subscales: openness to experience (range of scores: 0 to 18), behavioural awareness (range of scores: 0 to 12), and valued action (range of scores: 0 to 18); as with the overall score, higher subscale scores indicate favourable outcomes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Personal Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 18 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participant-generated goals, established by asking each participant which difficulties the individual would like to work on. Ten items are established with each participant (e.g. with a focus on symptoms, mood, specific activities, relationships, or self-esteem). Each of the ten items is rated according to seven response categories (this has bothered me: not at all, very little, little, moderately, considerably, very considerably, maximum possible). Scores range between 10 and 70, with higher scores indicating greater difficulties.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Be aged 13-18 years, as the proposed research aims to investigate &quot;adolescents&quot;.

          -  Have capacity to give informed consent, to ensure the integrity of participants and
             prioritise their best interests.

          -  Be awaiting input from the Healthy Minds Lincolnshire service, given the method of
             recruitment, prospective participants will be on a waiting list for the named service.

          -  Be experiencing psychological distress, to fulfil the research aims.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Accessing crisis support, to ensure that necessary support is not being withheld due
             to research participation.

          -  They do not speak and understand English, to ensure the app-intervention and measures
             (which are in English) may be completed, and so interviews may be conducted without a
             translator.

          -  They are unable to access or use a smart device, the internet, and the app, as they
             must be able to access a device daily and be technology literate to utilise the
             intervention.

          -  For 13-15 year olds: parental consent must also be provided to take part. If this is
             not provided, they will be unable to participate. Those aged 16-18 years can provide
