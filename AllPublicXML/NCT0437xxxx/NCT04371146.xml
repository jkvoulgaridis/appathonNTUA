  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approach versus avoidance decisions are at the centre of adaptive behaviour and survival.
      These decisions are thought to be guided by the value of the choice options, which are a
      function of the magnitude of predicted rewards and punishments. Moreover, the allocation of
      attention to choice options is thought to be driven by salience, i.e. the overall importance
      of the predicted outcomes. While salience increases with the magnitude of both predicted
      rewards and predicted punishments, value increases with reward but decreases with punishment.
      In previous research, value and salience have often remained confounded during value-based
      decision making. Rodent research suggests that value is associated with dopamine and salience
      with norepinephrine. The present study aims at disentangling value from salience processing
      during decision-making tasks in healthy subjects by administering dopamine or noradrenaline
      reuptake inhibitors. This is done by using a single dose challenge in a randomized
      placebo-controlled between subject's design, administering either methylphenidate (35 mg),
      reboxetine (8 mg), or placebo to healthy young participants before they perform tasks tapping
      into various aspects of value and salience.

    <description>The investigators record responses and specifically reaction times during 5 different decision-making tasks.
In a value vs salience task, value and salience processing is disentangled during value-based decision-making. Participants either accept or reject compound stimuli that were before associated with monetary outcomes.
In a face in the crowd task, participants detect a target face (angry vs happy) in a crowd of opposite face type.
During a task on risk and ambiguity decision-making, participants have to decide between safe and lottery options associated with either monetary risk or ambiguity.
In an adaptive risk-taking task, participants have to choose between two risky monetary options.
In an effort task, participants decide whether they are willing to exert physical effort for monetary reward.
Response times are measured in milliseconds from the tasks. The investigators calculate how long participants take to make decisions in each trial.</description>
