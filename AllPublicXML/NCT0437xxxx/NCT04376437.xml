  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is the most common neurological cancer
      treatment complication. Medical cannabis is indicated in Israel for the treatment of chronic
      pain, spasticity and for the control of pain and other symptoms in patients with cancer.

      The proposed study aims are to study about the changes in level of endocannabinoids following
      continuous exposure to phytocannabinoids and about the long-term effect of medical cannabis
      on CIPN.

    <textblock>
      This will be a self-titrated, open-label design study. Subjects who begin taxanes or
      oxaliplatine therapy and were diagnosed with CIPN will be recruited to the study.

      After providing their written informed consent, the study physician obtained a medical
      history, demographic details and conducted a physical examination. During the current study,
      baseline period for CIPN evaluation will be 2 weeks, while patients will fill several
      questionnaires. Baseline CIPN will be evaluating by DN4 and BPI questionnaires. EQ-5D and
      PSQI will be filled for baseline Quality of life (QOL) and sleepiness status, accordingly.

    <description>All patients will start with 250mcg cannabis flos BID and will follow the titration plan of dose modification according to CIPN relief and adverse events. Maximum dose of 2,000mcg per day is prescribed at the end of titration period, which is continuous for 15 days (about 2 weeks).On 10 weeks visit all patients will be discontinued from the treatment. In case of worsening of neuropathy at any point during the 4 weeks of FU, patients might be able to restart with inhaled MC treatment for no more than 4 weeks. Total treatment in this study will be for no more than 14 weeks.</description>
