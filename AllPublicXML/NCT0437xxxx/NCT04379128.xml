  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epilepsy is one of the most common chronic neurological conditions.It leads to cognitive
      impairment in 20-50% of patients with a structural form.

      In comparison with seizures, these cognitive disorders are a major additional factor in
      occupational, social and family disability. They are particularly frequent (50%) in temporal
      epilepsies and preferably concern memory and language skills.

      The cognitive consequences of epilepsy are therefore well described in the following areas:
      episodic memory, language, executive functions.

      Concerning attentional abilities, a recent review has highlighted the lack of work in this
      specific field in order to properly measure the prevalence and nature of attentional
      disorders in epileptic patients. Indeed, attentional abilities are often mentioned in
      studies, but attention is a complex domain defined by four modalities: alertness, selective
      attention, divided attention and sustained attention. No study systematically assesses all of
      these modalities.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the prevalence and nature of attentional disorders
      in epileptic patients compared to control subjects.
