  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We will examine trends in ART use in BC specifically. The use of ART has drastically changed
      the management of infertility, with worldwide estimates exceeding 1.8 million ART cycles in
      2010 alone. Moreover, an excess of six million children have been conceived using ART.
      Although various countries have published their live birth rates associated with common ART
      treatment strategies, British Columbia has yet report on its rates. With varying differences
      in ART practices, whether clinical or laboratory, one would expect live birth rates due to
      ART to vary depending on region analyzed. Analyzing the live birth rate in BC would not only
      allow for a benchmark for assessing future improvement, and trends in infertility diagnosis
      and management, but also allow for comparison to other provinces and countries. The aim of
      this part of the study is to describe ART cycle contribution to live birth rate in BC from
      April 2008 to March 2018, which has not been addressed in the literature as of yet. Not only
      will it give healthcare providers and patients information about this emerging approach to
      infertility but also provide a impetus for healthy policy makers to adopt a model for
      partially or fully publicly funded ART, as seen in Ontario and soon Quebec.

      Perinatal Services BC maintains a current database on live births, antepartum, intrapartum
      and postpartum outcomes; including details of ART if used to conceive. Live birth rate, for
      the purposes of this study, will be defined as the birth of at least one live born baby, with
      the birth of twins or higher order multiples considered as one live birth. The birth rate for
      ART will be taken as a proportion for birth rate from ART over total birth rate for given
      calendar year and the overall period of analysis. Data from April 1 2008 to Marcch 31 2018 on
      autologous ART treatment cycles and outcomes will be extracted from this database, with
      approval. Overall proportion of ART contributing to live birth rate will be analyzed as well
      as sub categorical analysis based on age (younger than 30, 30-34 years, 35-39 years, 40-44
      years, and 45 years and older). Only nulliparous women will be included in this study. All
      Moreover, data will be analyzed by calendar year in which baby from ART delivered to evaluate
      overall trends in ART outcomes. The total live birth rate for all of BC will serve as the
      denominator.

      Although the data will be reviewed and rules interpreted by the principal investigator of
      this study, a biostatistician will be hired to carry out the necessary statistical analysis.
