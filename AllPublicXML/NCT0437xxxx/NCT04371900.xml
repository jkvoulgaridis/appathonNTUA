    <textblock>
      This project builds on the Michigan Contraceptive Access Research and Evaluation Study
      (M-CARES) to evaluate the long-term effects of mothers' access to free contraceptives and
      reductions in unintended pregnancies on their children's well-being.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      M-CARES uses a randomized control trial design to assess the effects of providing free
      contraception to mothers on their children born before the intervention. The population
      subject to intervention is fecund women age 18-35 years at risk of pregnancy and who are
      clients at Planned Parenthood clinics of Michigan (PPMI), who meet income eligibility
      criteria, and who would otherwise pay out-of-pocket for services on the day of recruitment
      (i.e., lacking insurance coverage for received service). The experimental (treatment)
      condition is a mother's receipt of a voucher providing access to no-cost contraception (up to
      the price of a name-brand intrauterine device) for 100 days. The control group of mothers
      receives no voucher. All enrolled women complete a two-part baseline survey and consent to be
      re-contacted for two follow-up interviews in outgoing years. They also complete a two-part
      baseline survey and consent to be re-contacted for two follow up interviews in outgoing
      years. In addition, mothers consent to linkages to their own and their children's
      administrative data from records held by state and federal health, education, criminal
      justice, and tax records. Consent covers children already born to women at the time of
      intervention and children born after intervention. Survey and administrative data provide
      outcome measures to assess children's well-being and development up to age 18. The study will
      compare children of mothers who receive the intervention to those who did not.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        The proposed project will analyze the outcomes of children ages 0 to 17 years old whose
        mothers enrolled in the Michigan Contraceptive Access, Research and Evaluation Study
        (M-CARES). M-CARES participation requires that mothers are:

          -  18-35 years old

          -  physically capable (biologically female and fecund) and at risk of having a pregnancy,

          -  not pregnant at the time of enrollment

          -  not wishing to become pregnant in the 12 months after enrollment,

          -  are seeking care at Planned Parenthood of Michigan, and

          -  face out-of-pocket costs for contraceptives at Planned Parenthood of Michigan.
