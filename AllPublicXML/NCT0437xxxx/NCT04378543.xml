  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ankasa Regenerative Therapeutics, Inc. (Ankasa) is developing ART352-L, a liposomal
      formulation of recombinant human Wnt3A protein, that is applied ex vivo, to harvested
      autologous bone grafts (autograft) to enhance the osteogenic properties of the autograft
      prior to reimplantation in orthopedic surgeries.

      This is a phase 1/2 open label safety evaluation of ART352-L treated autologous bone grafts
      in patients undergoing posterolateral lumbar spinal fusion to treat single level degenerative
      spondylolisthesis. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of ART352-L treated local bone autografts in patients being treated for this
      condition, with the secondary objective to evaluate the rates of early and overall spinal
      fusion. Additionally, changes in patient mobility and quality of life measures from baseline
      following treatment with ART352-L will be evaluated.

         16. Male subjects, if not infertile or surgically sterilized, who will not agree to use
             highly-effective contraception or to not donate sperm from screening until at least 90
             days after receiving IP

         17. Active malignancy ≤5 years prior to providing informed consent. EXCEPTIONS:
             Non-melanotic skin cancer, carcinoma-in-situ of the cervix. NOTE: If there is a
             history of prior malignancy, the subject must not be receiving other specific
             treatment for their cancer.

         18. Concurrent participation in another investigational drug, biologic or device study
             that could confound study data

         19. Involvement in or plans to engage in litigation or receiving Worker's Compensation
             related to neck, back, or leg pain
