  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to see the benefits of Family Strength Oriented Therapeutic
      Conversation for parents of adolescent with ADHD at the children's and adolescent psychiatric
      outpatient national unit.

      In the study, 13-17 year olds adolescents diagnosed with ADHD. From this group, 10 adolescent
      are chosen by hand and their parents are divided. The intervention consists of three groups
      with 4-10 parents in group and two parents interviews.

      Method of quasi experimental study are used. Parents and adolescents respond to the
      questionnaire initially for the intervention and in the end of the intervention. Used
      questionnaires will be used, all of which have good legitimacy and confidentiality. The
      intervention will be tested by a repeat analysis of variance, ANOVA and with a paired t-test
      The ideology of the study, on the one hand, is based on the evidence-based guidance of
      adolescents with ADHD. On the other hand, the Calgary family initiative and treatment model,
      in addition to the weakness of the attitude model, is based on a systematic and communicative
      approach. The benefit study is evaluated by parents and adolescents themselves.

      The result can provide clues as to whether / what benefits from the intervention. An
      important finding for continued development of family-oriented nursing care based on critical
      knowledge with the aim of improving adolescent quality of life with ADHD
