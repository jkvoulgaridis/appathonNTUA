    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to estimate and compare the incidence of overall malignancy,
      serious infection, and opportunistic infections between new users of ustekinumab and new
      users of other biologic therapies among adult participants with Crohn's disease (CD).

        The study population will include participants with Crohn's Disease (CD) who are new users
        of ustekinumab and new users of the comparator drugs which will be identified from the
        Department of Defense (DoD) Electronic Health Records (EHR) database.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult men and women with CD who are new users of ustekinumab or the comparator drugs
             during the study period

          -  Participants must have at least 1 year of enrollment history with the DoD EHR database
             immediately prior to new use (that is, exposure index date) of ustekinumab or the
             comparator drugs

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants below 18 years of age on the exposure index date

          -  Participants who do not meet the definition for CD prior to or on the exposure index
             date

          -  Participants with any records of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) diagnosis, organ
             or tissue transplant, or malignancy (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer [NMSC]) at any
             time prior to or on the exposure index date

          -  Participants with a physician diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing
             spondylitis, or psoriatic arthritis within 12 months prior to or on the exposure index
             date

          -  In the analysis of infection outcomes, participants diagnosed with the same infection
             of interest both within 60 days prior to or on the exposure index date and within 60
             days after the exposure index date will be excluded
