  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a 2-period study conducted with 26 healthy male or female subjects.
      Subjects will be randomly assigned to either receive a single dose of surufatinib with food
      in period 1, then without food in period 2, or vice-versa.

      This study will be a single center, open label, randomized crossover, 2-period study
      conducted with 26 healthy male or female subjects. Subjects will be randomly assigned to 1 of
      the 2 possible treatment sequences as follows:

        -  Fed/Fasted: surufatinib with food on Day 1 and surufatinib without food on Day 8

        -  Fasting/Fed: surufatinib without food on Day 1 and surufatinib with food on Day 8
