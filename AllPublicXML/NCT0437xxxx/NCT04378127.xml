  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease is multidimensional disorders characterized by motor and non-motor
      symptoms such as behavioral and psychological symptoms, autonomic disturbances and other
      non-motor symptoms. These can contribute to the burden of the disease on patients and their
      caregivers, and often remain unrecognized and untreated.

      This was a single-blind,multicentric, prospective, randomized study comparing two arms: an
      intervention group undergoing a structured educational program associated to standard care
      and a control group who solely continued with traditional medical care.

      Parkinson's disease is multidimensional disorders characterized by motor and non-motor
      symptoms such as behavioral and psychological symptoms, autonomic disturbances and other
      non-motor symptoms. A multidisciplinary and comprehensive approach, based on the chronic care
      model, is considered the best way to manage motor and non-motor symptoms of the disease,
      although this model of care is still not standardized and previous trials showed conflicting
      results.

      The study planned to enrol 40 advanced PD patients and related caregivers for each
      investigational site. This was a single-blind,multicentric, prospective, randomized study
      comparing two arms: an intervention group undergoing a structured educational program
      associated to standard care and a control group who solely continued with traditional medical
      care.

      The educational program consisted of six thematic meetings of 3 hours each, which a 15-minute
      interval every hour. Each meeting had a key topic and was divided in a teaching session and
      in a practical session with individual training of both, subject and caregiver. Every lecture
      was held by a movement disorders specialist with particular expertise in each field of
      discussion and the content of each lessons (slides, flyers, questionnaires) was adapted to
      fit the audience.
