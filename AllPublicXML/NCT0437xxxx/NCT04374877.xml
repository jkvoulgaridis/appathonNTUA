      This is a Phase 1, open-label, first-in-human (FIH), dose-escalation monotherapy, safety, and
      expansion study of SRF388, a monoclonal antibody targeting IL-27, that will be conducted in 3
      parts:

        -  Part A: SRF388 monotherapy dose-escalation cohort in patients with advanced solid
           tumors.

        -  Part B: SRF388 monotherapy clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) expansion cohort is a
           safety, efficacy, and tumor biopsy expansion portion of the study in patients with
           advanced or metastatic ccRCC to further examine the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK),
           pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of SRF388 as a monotherapy.

        -  Part C: SRF388 monotherapy hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) safety expansion cohort is a
           safety expansion portion of the study in patients with advanced or metastatic HCC to
           further examine the safety, PK, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary efficacy of SRF388 as
           a monotherapy.

    <intervention_name>SRF388</intervention_name>
    <description>SRF388 is a fully human IgG1 antibody against IL-27. Inhibition of IL-27 with SRF388 reduces STAT1 phosphorylation leading to increased pro-inflammatory (anti-tumor) cytokine secretion (e.g., IFN-g, TNF-a) and decreased expression of inhibitory immune checkpoint receptors (e.g., PD-L1, TIGIT, LAG3) on immune cells that may result in anticancer therapeutic activity.</description>
