      Purpose The aim of this study is to adapt the Western Ontario Osteoarthritis of the Shoulder
      Index (WOOS) specific to shoulder osteoarthritis, to Turkish and evaluate its validity and
      reliability.

      Methods WOOS index was translated and culturally adapted to Turkish, systematically. It was
      applied to 68 patients with osteoarthritis of shoulder treated conservatively. The
      reliability of the scale was checked through internal consistency and test-retest methods.
      Internal consistency was analyzed with Cronbach's alpha value. Test-retest reliability was
      assessed using an intraclass correlation coefficient with 25 patients. The Western Ontario
      Rotator Cuff (WORC), The Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI), and The Society of
      American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Standardized Shoulder Assessment (ASES) score were used
      to conduct concurrent validity.

      Shoulder osteoarthritis occurs as a result of progressive wear in the glenohumeral joint
      cartilage. It causes pain, stiffness, inflammation in surrounding soft tissues, and muscle
      weakness in the shoulder joint. The range of motion (ROM) of the shoulder joint is greater
      than the hip and knee joints, where osteoarthritis is more common, and a decrease in ROM as a
      result of osteoarthritis affects patients' psychological state more. These symptoms also
      affect negatively the functional level and quality of life of the patient. As the number of
      patients with shoulder osteoarthritis increases in the elderly population, it becomes more
      important to use disease-specific patient-related outcomes to compare treatment modalities
      and patient satisfaction.

      Various clinical scales are available to investigate shoulder diseases. The Oxford Shoulder
      Score, ASES score, Long Head of Biceps (LHB) score, and Constant-Murley score, which are used
      in various pathologies of the shoulder, have been developed and tested in different
      languages. Furthermore, Turkish validations were made and culturally adapted in the Turkish
      population. However, none of them are specific for osteoarthritis of the shoulder.

      Therefore; Lo et al. developed the WOOS index, which is specific for shoulder osteoarthritis.
      This scale is based on clinical functions of the shoulder joint as well as
      sports/recreation/work, lifestyle, and emotions. Although the WOOS index has been used as a
      valid and reliable tool in native English-speaking countries for the last two decades, its
      Turkish adaptation has not been done yet.

      Thus, the aim of this study was to translate the WOOS index into the Turkish language and
      investigate the validity and reliability of the scale in the Turkish population.

      At first, study permission was received via mail from the author who developed the WOOS
      index. Later, ethical approval was obtained from the clinical researches ethics committee
      (Number: 91610558-604.01.02-05.12.2019/12). Finally, the WOOS index was adapted into Turkish
      according to systematic translation rules, and then the validity and reliability of the
      translated scale were evaluated.

      Translation and Cross-Cultural Adaptation Process The translation and cultural adaptation of
      the scale were performed according to the procedure of Beaton et al. In the first stage of
      adaptation, two native Turkish speakers, one from the medical sector and the other from
      outside the field, translated the original scale into Turkish. Two translation outputs were
      synthesized. Synthesized Turkish scale was translated back to English by two independent
      professional bilingual translators via a translation company. The working committee compared
      the translated document and the original scale in terms of meaning and usage of language and
      decided on the new version of the scale. The comprehensibility of the new version was
      pretested on 15 clinicians. They did not report any ambiguity or confusing meaning in the
      Turkish version. Therefore, the latest Turkish version of the WOOS index was created
      successfully.

      Sixty-eight adult patients whose native language is Turkish and diagnosed with shoulder
      osteoarthritis by orthopaedists were included in the study. Patients with illiteracy,
      cognitive impairment, and shoulder circumference fractures were excluded.

      Patients diagnosed at the hospital were oriented to Gazi University, Faculty of Health
      Sciences Department. There, patients were asked to complete the determined questionnaires
      under the supervision of a physical therapist. The demographics of the patients were
      recorded. After the examination, in addition to the medical treatment given by the
      physicians, an individual home treatment program was created by the Physiotherapist for each
      patient. In 25 patients, the WOOS index was repeated two days later.

      Literature research was conducted to determine the correct evaluation criteria. The scales
      which were used in the development of the original WOOS index and in the other adaptation
      studies were analyzed. Scales have higher consistency with the WOOS index and also adapted in
      Turkish previously, were preferred. Thus; it was decided to use WORC, SPADI, and ASES
      questionnaires to evaluate the concurrent validity of the WOOS index.

      The WOOS index is a self-administrated, disease-specific questionnaire for the measurement of
      the quality of life for patients with osteoarthritis of the shoulder. This scale consists of
      four sub-sections and nineteen items as SECTION A: Physical Symptoms (6 items), SECTION B:
      Sports/Recreation/Work (5 items), SECTION C: Lifestyle (5 items) and SECTION D: Emotions (3
      items). All items are rating with a 10 cm-visual analog scale (VAS). &quot;0&quot; point indicates that
      the symptom is not experienced and &quot;10&quot; points indicate that it is experiencing severely. So;
      the sum of points is in the range of &quot;0-1900&quot; points. The percentage value of the total score
      can also be used as an outcome score.

      WORC index is a self-assessment instrument that has been developed to measure the quality of
      life of patients with rotator cuff disease. It has five sub-sections (physical symptoms,
      sports, and recreation, work, lifestyle, emotions) and twenty-one items. Each question is
      rating with a 10cm-VAS. Total score changes between 0 and 2100 points. A score of 0 implies
      no symptoms, and a score of 2100 is the worst score possible.

      SPADI was developed to measure current shoulder pain and disability. We preferred the
      numerical rating scale (NRS) version of SPADI. Each question is rating in the range of 0-10
      points. The percentage of the total point is recorded for each domain. The total score was
      calculated in the same way.

      The ASES score consists of two sections. One of them is the 10-item functional section
      (Likert type) rated by a physician and the other one 1-item pain section (VAS type) rated by
      the patient. A patient gets a minimum of 0, a maximum of 100 points. Higher points implicate
      better medical conditions for the patient.

      All statistical analyses in this study were carried out with the Statistical Package for
      Social Sciences (SPSS), Windows (version 22.0 SPSS for Windows; SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). The
      analyses were presented as mean (SD). The reliability of the scale was evaluated with
      internal consistency and test-retest methods. Test-retest studies are generally conducted in
      two or fourteen days' interval. This time is sufficient both to minimize the bias associated
      with the recollection of previous responses and to ensure to keep stable the clinical state
      of the patient. In order to stay stable the patients' clinical conditions, we preferred to
      apply retest before starting the treatment. So as not to delay the treatment, we preferred
      the two-day interval. Internal consistency was calculated with Cronbach Alpha value.
      Test-retest reliability was assessed using an intraclass correlation coefficient. The
      validity of the scale was evaluated in terms of concurrent validity. To assess the concurrent
      validity, total WOOS scores were compared with total scores of WORC, SPADI, and ASES;
      subsections of the WOOS index were also compared with subsections of WORC. All variables were
      analyzed in terms of normality. As all variables were nonparametric, the Spearman correlation
      coefficient method was used. For all calculations; p&lt;.05 were considered significant.
