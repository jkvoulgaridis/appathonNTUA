  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of transcranial Direct Current Stimulation
      (tDCS) applied in conjunction with Transcranial Ultrasound (TUS) for the treatment of
      addiction in opiate use disorder with chronic pain. The investigators hypothesize that there
      will be a decrease in drug use and improved psychosocial assessments with active stimulation,
      when compared to sham stimulation.
