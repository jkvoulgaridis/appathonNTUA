  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The efficacy of an innovative rehabilitation treatment for deficit in time processing is
      tested in right brain damaged patients.

      Patients with a focal lesion following a stroke and without general cognitive impairment will
      be submitted to computerized tests assessing the ability to estimate time duration (intervals
      around 7500 ms) and to mental travel in time. Moreover, the impact of the deficit in time
      processing in everyday life will be evaluated by using ad hoc questionnaires.

      Patients will perform tasks before and after two weeks of a new rehabilitation treatment,
      combining a training for one week with prismatic googles inducing prismatic adaptation (PA)
      plus Virtual Reality (VR) and a training for one week with neutral googles inducing
      no-adaptation (NA) plus Virtual Reality. Participants will be randomized into two groups.
      Each group will be submitted to both treatments in a different order, accordingly with a
      crossover design.

      A greater amelioration in time processing after PA+VR than NA+VR training should be found.
      Moreover, an improvement in everyday life activities is expected accordingly with the
      amelioration in time processing.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Time processing involves different abilities - i.e. estimating the duration of an event and
      moving in past and future time - and it is a fundamental ability in everyday life. However,
      in neuropsychology, time processing is routinely neglected in the assessment of cognitive
      deficits in brain-damaged patients. This is surprising since time is an important function
      that permeates our activities: we perceive mismatches in lip reading (milliseconds), we
      estimate how long it takes to be ready for work (minutes), and we plan how long it will take
      a manuscript to be accepted (usually months). Thus, impairment in processing time has
      important consequences in daily life.

      For instance, it is known that right brain damaged (RBD) patients with spatial attentional
      deficit (neglect) are impaired in estimate the duration of a time interval as well as in the
      ability of mentally moving in time (Mental Time Travelling).

      Previous studies have demonstrated an improvement of time estimation and mental time travel
      after a leftward shift of spatial attention induced by a single session of prismatic
      adaptation (PA). Moreover, a recent study investigated the long-term duration of the benefits
      induced by 10 daily sessions of PA treatment on mental time travel and functional abilities
      in neglect patients. Results suggest that the PA treatment induces a long-lasting and stable
      ameliorations of mental time travel and functional competences.

      To generalize the effects of PA treatment to everyday life, here we propose to combine PA
      with a virtual reality training (VR). VR has recently been used as an effective tool both for
      the assessment and rehabilitation of cognitive deficits, because it allows post-stroke
      patients to interact with ecological environments similar to the real ones, but in a safe and
      controlled condition.

      Aim of this study is to set up a rehabilitation procedure for temporal deficits, combining a
      well-established PA procedure with an innovative, more engaging and ecological VR approach.

      Patients will perform tasks before and after two weeks of a new rehabilitation treatment,
      combining a training for one week with prismatic googles inducing prismatic adaptation (PA)
      plus Virtual Reality (VR) and a training for one week with neutral googles inducing
      no-adaptation (NA) plus Virtual Reality. Participants will be randomized into two groups.
      Each group will be submitted to both treatments in a different order, accordingly with a
      crossover design.

      A greater amelioration in time processing after PA+VR than NA+VR training should be found.
      Moreover, an improvement in everyday life activities is expected accordingly with the
      amelioration in time processing.

    <measure>Change in Mental Time Travel Ability on the Mental Time Travel (MTT) Task</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, after one week treatment (T1), after two weeks treatment (T2), one week after the end of treatment (follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>In the MTT task participants are listened to auditory stimuli consisting of brief descriptions of personal and non-personal events. They are required to project themselves in the past (10 years ago), present or future (10 years from now) and to verbally determine whether each event has already happened (relative past event) or is yet to happen (relative future event) with respect to the specific self-location in time (past, present and future).
Error rates and reaction times will be recorded and analyzed. The improvement will be defined as changes in the Inverse Efficiency (IE) ability: reaction times/accuracy.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Time Estimation Ability on the Time Estimation Task</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, after one week treatment (T1), after two weeks treatment (T2), one week after the end of treatment (follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>The Time Estimation task consists of a red square that is displayed for different durations (3500, 5500, 7500, 9500, 11500 ms) on the computer screen. Participants are instructed to verbally judge whether the duration of each stimulus is &quot;short&quot; or &quot;long&quot; with respect to previously acquired pair of reference durations (3500 and 11500 ms).
A psychophysical response function will be created for each participant by calculating the proportion of &quot;long&quot; responses: the Point of Subjective Equality (PSE) is the duration at which a participant is equally likely to classify the stimuli as short or long. An increase of &quot;long&quot; response after treatment, as compared to baseline performance, induces a decreased PSE, reflecting a relative shift towards overestimation of temporal midpoint. Conversely, an increase of &quot;short&quot; responses after treatment, as compared to baseline performance, induces an increased PSE, reflecting a relative shift towards underestimation of temporal midpoint.</description>

    <measure>Change in Time Reproduction Ability on the Time Reproduction Task</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, after one week treatment (T1), after two weeks treatment (T2), one week after the end of treatment (follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>In the Time Reproduction task a blue square is presented for a variable time interval (3500, 5500, 7500, 9500, 11500 ms) on the computer screen. Next, a red square appears on the screen and participants are instructed to reproduce the entire duration of the preceding blue square by pressing the space bar on the keyboard.
For each subject, the reproduced time intervals before PA will be subtracted from the reproduced time intervals after PA. Thus, this difference will be positive when reproduced time will be longer after than before treatment (underestimation of time duration) and negative when reproduced time will be shorter after than before treatment (overestimation of time duration).</description>

    <measure>Assessment of Frontal Functions on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>In the WCST, people have to classify cards according to different criteria. There are four different ways to classify each card, and the only feedback is whether the classification is correct or not. The classification rule changes every 10 cards. Three scores will be calculated: global score, perseveration errors and non-perseveration errors. The global score is computed by subtracting from the total number of administered trials the number of categories completed multiplied by ten = [n° of trials - (n° of achieved categories x 10)].
The score ranges from 128 to 0, i.e. the lower the score, the better the performance.</description>

    <measure>Assessment of Memory on the Rey's 15 Words Auditory Learning Test</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The test is designed as a list-learning paradigm in which the participant hears a list of 15 nouns and is asked to recall as many words from the list as possible (five repetitions of free-recall). After a 15 min delay, the participant is asked to again recall the words from the list. It provides two scores: immediate (range 0-75) and delayed recall (range 0-15), i.e. the higher the score, the better the performance.</description>

    <measure>Change in Unilateral Spatial Neglect on the Bells Cancellation Test</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, after two weeks treatment (T2), one week after the end of treatment (follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>The subject is required to cross out the bells that are scattered among several different shapes on a sheet of paper. Two indices of neglect will be calculated: total number of omissions (cut-off &lt; 5) and number of left omissions (cut-off &lt; 5), i.e. the difference between the number of targets crossed out on the right side and the number of targets crossed out on the left side (asymmetry score).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Unilateral Spatial Neglect on the Apples Cancellation Test</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, after two weeks treatment (T2), one week after the end of treatment (follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>This is a cancellation task in which outline drawings of 150 apples are shown pseudorandomly scattered over a sheet of A4 paper presented in a landscape orientation. All of the apples are presented in an upright position. One-third of the apples are full (targets) and two-thirds are open on either the left or the right side (distractors). Participants are asked to cross out all the full apples and to ignore the distractors. Three scores will be calculated: full apples barrage (cut-off = 45), full apples asymmetry (cut-off = 2), and incomplete apples asymmetry (cut-off = 1).
The full apples asymmetry (the difference between the number of targets selected on the right side and the number of targets selected on the left side) represents the score for egocentric neglect. The incomplete apples asymmetry (total left openings minus total right openings) represents the score for allocentric neglect.</description>
