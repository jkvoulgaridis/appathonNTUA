      The study is a multi-center, prospective, single-arm study without controls. The purpose of
      this study is to characterize the impact of acetaminophen ingestion on the performance of the
      Guardian™ Sensor (3) (i.e., C algorithm and Zeus algorithm) in subjects age 18 - 80 years.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Individual is 18 - 80 years of age at time of enrollment.

          2. Subject has a clinical diagnosis of type 1 or type 2 diabetes for a minimum of 6
             months duration as determined via medical record/ source documentation by an
             individual qualified to make a medical diagnosis.

          3. Subject has adequate venous access as assessed by investigator or appropriate staff.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has history of allergy to acetaminophen or has been told by a health care
             provider they may not ingest acetaminophen

          2. Subject reports history of liver cirrhosis or liver problems that a health care
             provider told them they should not use acetaminophen because of liver disorder.

          3. Subject will not tolerate tape adhesive in the area of Guardian™ Sensor (3) placement
             as assessed by a qualified individual.

          4. Subject has any unresolved adverse skin condition in the area of sensor or device
             placement (e.g., psoriasis, rash, Staphylococcus infection).

          5. Subject is actively participating in an investigational study (e.g., drug or device)
             wherein he/she has received treatment from an investigational study (drug or device)
             in the last 2 weeks prior to Visit 1. (Please note participation in an observational
             study is acceptable.)

          6. Subject is female of child-bearing potential and has a pregnancy screening test that
             is positive.

          7. Subject is female of child-bearing potential and who is sexually active should be
             excluded if she is not using a form of contraception deemed reliable by investigator.

          8. Subject is female and plans to become pregnant during the course of the study.

         10. Subject has a chronic heavy alcohol use as determined by investigator.

         11. Subject has a history of a seizure disorder.

         12. Subject has a hematocrit (Hct) more than 10% below the lower limit of normal reference
             range (please note that patients may use prior blood draw from routine care as long as
             done within 6 months of screening and report of lab placed with subject source
             documents).

         13. Subject has a history of adrenal insufficiency.

         14. Subject is a member of the research staff involved with the study.
