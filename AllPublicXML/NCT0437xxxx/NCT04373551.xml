  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this application is to increase PrEP uptake among AA women at-risk for
      HIV-infection in the rural South, specifically those seeking care at Federally Qualified
      Healthcare Centers (FQHC) in rural Alabama.

      The investigators will use a mixed-methods approach to adapt and pilot test a
      patient-provider communication tool from the CDC PrEP toolkit that focuses on the first three
      steps of the PrEP cascade (e.g., recognizing HIV risk, identifying as a PrEP candidate, and
      interested in PrEP) to increase PrEP uptake via referrals to local PrEP clinics.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose: (1) to explore the HIV risk perceptions of AA women with recent
      PrEP use, AA women who are candidates for PrEP, and providers and identify preferences around
      patient-provider communication about HIV risk and PrEP services that address the needs of AA
      women.

      (2A) To systematically adapt a patient-provider communication tool to increase PrEP uptake at
      two FQHCs in rural Alabama, using an iterative implementation process; and (2B). To assess
      the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary impact of the patient-provider communication
      intervention on PrEP uptake among AA women and their providers in a pilot
      pre-/post-intervention design.

      As part of aim 2B), the investigators will also systematically document and evaluate reasons
      for declining a PrEP referral, reasons for incomplete referrals, reasons for failing to
      initiate PrEP after a successful referral, and ongoing PrEP use at 3/6 months post PrEP
      initiation among our sample.

    <measure>PrEP uptake changes</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 3 months, and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>To examine changes in PrEP uptake rates in the participating clinics comparing 3 years before and the year after the implementation of the protocol. Uptake will be calculated by the ratio of patients initiating PrEP to the number of eligible patients screened.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Intervention feasibility changes</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 3 months, and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The following variable will be analyzed to determine feasibility: Number of participants screened, enrolled, and number who agreed to use PrEP and adhered to their prescribed regimen; reasons for declining enrollment, prematurely leaving the study, refusing a referral, failing to attend a PrEP clinic visit, and/or discontinuing PrEP. Recruitment and scheduling strategies, participant contact, and feasibility of administering instruments (e.g. assessment duration), will be documented and analyzed at each time frame.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Intervention acceptability</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>All participants will be asked to consent to an in-depth, qualitative phone interview exploring their perceptions of the study, as well as an evaluation of the PrEP uptake intervention.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>PrEP adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) Adherence Questionnaire (i.e. Visual Analog Scale only) will be used to assess PrEP adherence, as is currently practice in the participating clinics. ACTG 's scores range from 0-4 with 4 indicating more adherence with 0 least adherent.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinic visit adherence changes</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The following variable will be analyzed to determine adherence: PrEP visits adhered to, divided by visits scheduled. The change in retention to clinic care visits will be assessed at each assessment over 6-month intervals, which is in line with the 6 months post-intervention interval.</description>
