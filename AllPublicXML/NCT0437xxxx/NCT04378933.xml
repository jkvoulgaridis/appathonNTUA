  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if evening amber glasses combined with stable wake
      times will show an increase in total sleep time (TST) and an advance in sleep onset times
      (shift earlier) compared to the control group.

      We propose a 3‐week field study that examines the efficacy, acceptance, and compliance of
      using evening amber glasses to block evening light combined with a stable wake time in
      adolescents (14‐17 years) with DSWPD (International Classification of Sleep Disorders
      [ICSD‐3] criteria).3 After 1 week of baseline measurements, subjects will be instructed to
      wear glasses (which allow 14% entry of ambient light exposure) starting 7 h before
      individually calculated midsleep time measured during the preceding week. This corresponds to
      the time when adolescents are most sensitive to phase delaying light according to Co‐I
      Crowley's recently published phase response curve (PRC) to light in adolescents (Figure 1).22
      This &quot;amber glasses + stable wake time&quot; group will be compared to a control group: adolescent
      DSWPD patients who will wear clear‐lensed glasses (which allow 100% of ambient light to reach
      the eyes, otherwise identical in appearance) in the evening at the same times as the
      alternate group, but without scheduled wake times. Outcome measures will include TST and
      sleep onset time derived from wrist actigraphy, daytime subjective sleepiness, salivary DLMO,
      and assessments of acceptance and compliance.

    <measure>Total Sleep Time</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The total amount of sleep the teen receives overnight. REDCap wake logs will be used to determine when the participant goes to bed and when they wake up. The participants will also wear an actigraphy that will detect when they are active and when they are sleeping.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Sleep Onset Time</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The time the teen feels sleepy. Participants will wear an actigraphy that will detect when they are active and when they are sleeping. During the lab night visits, participants will complete the Mood and Sleepiness questionnaire which notes the time they were becoming sleepy.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjective Daytime Sleepiness</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The time during the day when the teen feels sleepy. The participants will wear an actigraphy that will track their activity. During the participants lab night visits, they will complete the Paediatric Daytime Sleepiness questionnaire which references how tired they feel during the day, if they fall asleep during class, etc.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Dim Light Melatonin Onset (DLMO)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 lab nights</time_frame>
    <description>During the lab nights, the room has limited lighting. There will be no more than 5 lux of light. This is determined by using a light lux meter. The participants will complete the Mood and Sleepiness questionnaire which notes when they were becoming sleepy.</description>

    <description>Participants will wear glasses with amber lenses beginning 7 hours before average baseline mid-sleep time until the time of intended sleep onset or until a duration of 7 hours of use is reached. Participants will also be required to wake up at the same time (±30 mins).</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Regular school attendance in the setting of a fixed start time.

          -  Adherence to ICSD‐3 DSWPD diagnostic criteria.

          -  Average spontaneous weekend wake time ≥1 hour than school day wake time.

          -  Initiation of school‐night sleep at 12 a.m. or later, ≥50% of the time, during a
             14‐day period (items 3‐4 to be determined by sleep logs and actigraphy). As there are
             no discrete clock times associated with the ICSD‐3 DSWPD description, this cutoff is
             based on data obtained from the 2006 Sleep in America Poll and experiences gleaned
             from prior recruitment.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  A positive urine drug abuse screen will disqualify the individual from further
             participation.

          -  Subjects will be withdrawn from the study if the sleep log and wrist monitor activity
             does not correspond with the sleep schedule identified with the pre-study sleep log.

          -  Alcohol and nicotine use will also be screened to qualify for the study. We will also
             screen for alcohol immediately before each DLMO assessment because alcohol acutely
             suppresses melatonin.

          -  Patients receiving medications that might contribute to sleep disturbances and/or
             affect treatment responses will be considered ineligible (e.g., hypnotics,
             antidepressants, stimulants, non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), beta
             blockers).

          -  All subjects will be asked to refrain from caffeine use on the days of phase
             assessments, and to cease ingestion at least 6 hours prior to nightly bedtime.

          -  The Ishihara Color Blindness Test will be done and patients who are color
             blind/deficient will be disqualified from participating in the study.
