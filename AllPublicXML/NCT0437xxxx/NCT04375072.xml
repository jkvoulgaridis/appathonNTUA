    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of active transcranial direct current
      stimulation (tDCS) paired with active mindfulness-based meditation (MBM) on clinical
      pain,osteo arthritis (OA)-related clinical symptoms, physiopsychological pain processing and
      participant satisfaction with treatment in patients with knee OA.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in clinical pain as assessed by the numeric rating scale (NRS) for pain</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, week 2</time_frame>
    <description>The NRS total score ranges from 0 (no pain) to 100 (most intense pain imaginable).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in osteo arthritis symptoms as measured by the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index(WOMAC)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, week 2</time_frame>
    <description>This is a 5 item questionnaire each with a score ranging from none to extreme</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in pain related cortical response using a continuous wave, multichannel Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) imaging system</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, week 2</time_frame>
    <description>Pain-related cortical response will be measured using a continuous-wave, multichannel fNIRS imaging system (LIGHTNIRS, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) with three semiconductor lasers at 780, 805, and 830 nm. Optical recordings will be collected during thermal pain stimulation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Descending pain modulation (CPM) as measured by the quantitative sensory testing</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, week 2</time_frame>
    <description>Descending pain modulation will be determined by the change in pressure pain threshold on the trapezius immediately after the immersion of the contralateral hand up to the wrist in a cold water bath at 12°C for one minute, with higher CPM scores indicating better descending pain modulation. Descending pain modulation will be reflected by an increase in pressure pain threshold after cold water immersion.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in mindfulness as measured by the Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory (FMI)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, week 2</time_frame>
    <description>This is a 14 item questionnaire,each scored from 1-4,higher number showing better outcome</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient satisfaction as measured by the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8) scale</measure>
    <time_frame>week 2</time_frame>
    <description>This scale has 8 questions,each scored from 1-4,higher number indicating more satisfaction</description>
