    <textblock>
      Patients who visited our family planning clinic and opted for IUD application for
      contraception purposes were also offered NT/TLA treatments simultaneously. 40 patients who
      matched the inclusion criteria and received IUDs and NT/TLA treatments were included in the
      study group and 41 patients who only received IUDs were included in the control group. All
      patients received copper IUDs and none of them were on additional hormonal treatment. Before
      the insertion of IUD, women in the therapy group received NT treatment with 6ml of 1%
      procaine injected transvaginal into the cervix at 5 and 7 o'clock localizations. Following
      IUD insertion, another 6ml of 1% procaine was injected into the Frankenhauser ganglia
      bilaterally. A final dose of 8ml of 1% procaine was injected into the abdominal trigger
      points and intracutaneously into the L4-S4 dermatomes as quaddles.

    <description>The VAS scores of patients in both groups reported one month after the application of IUDs (Patients mark their pain intensity from 1 to 10 in vas scoring. In scoring, 1 point is the lowest score and shows that the patient has low pain, 10 is the highest score and shows severe pain.)</description>

        Women with underlying chronic diseases which could cause chronic pelvic pain such as
        endometriosis and which makes them prone to infections such as diabetes mellitus were
        excluded from the study. Furthermore, women by whom a complication had arised during the
        IUD insertion, such as uterine perforation, were also excluded from the study.
