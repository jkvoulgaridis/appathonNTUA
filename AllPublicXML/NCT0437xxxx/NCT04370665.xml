  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial focus on the delivery of Cerezyme® in Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients
      using MR-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) induced opening of the blood-brain barrier (BBB).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Leveraging the preclinical evidence and clinical experience with MRgFUS BBB opening in human
      subjects, the investigators propose a phase I open-label study to determine the safety and
      feasibility of three biweekly delivery of Cerezyme® (an analogue of the human enzyme
      beta-glucocerebrosidase) via MRgFUS induced BBB opening to unilateral putamen in PD. The
      putamen contains terminals of dopaminergic neurons from the substantia nigra, and is a
      critically affected brain region in PD. The primary objective is to determine the feasibility
      of repeated MRgFUS BBB opening for Cerezyme delivery in unilateral putamen. The secondary
      objective is to describe the safety and tolerability of the procedure. Another objective is
      to measure changes in PD relevant clinical scores and Cerezyme relevant biomarkers in the
      study.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a prospective, single-center, single-arm, open-labelled study to enroll six (6) patients with Parkinson's disease for three biweekly deliveries of Cerezyme® to the unilateral putamen corresponding to the most affected side using Exablate and Definity®-induced BBB opening. This is a dose escalation study. Each subject will be followed for three months after the final procedure.</intervention_model_description>
