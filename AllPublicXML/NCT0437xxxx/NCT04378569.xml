    <description>HECSI is an instrument used in clinical trials to rate the severity of 6 clinical signs of hand eczema and the extent of the lesions on each of 5 hand areas by use of standard scales. The total HECSI score is based on a 4-point severity scale ranging from 0 (none/absent) to 3 (severe) and a 5-point scale rating the affected area(s) ranging from 0 (0% affected area) to 4 (76% to 100% affected area).</description>

    <time_frame>Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 13</time_frame>
    <description>The QOLHEQ is an instrument to assess disease specific Health Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) in patients suffering from hand eczema. The QOLHEQ is a disease specific instrument, thereby only assessing impairments caused by hand eczema. It consists out of 30 items which can be summarized according to four domains of HRQOL: Impairments because of (1) symptoms, (2) emotions, (3) limitations in functioning or (4) because of treatment and prevention.</description>
