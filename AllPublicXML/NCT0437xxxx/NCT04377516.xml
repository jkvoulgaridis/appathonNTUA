  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postpartum women with PPGP receiving specific pelvic stabilization exercise training with
      transabdominal sonography-guided Biofeedback would have better improvements on muscle
      functions, physical functions, pain, and disability compared to the regular pelvic
      stabilization exercise group

    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>pelvic girdle questionnaire(PGQ) is a self-reported instrument assessing pelvic girdle pain intensity in currently. Questionnaire consisting of 20 activity items and 5 symptom items on a 4-point response scale. Possible score range from 0 (no pain) to 100 (worst possible pain).</description>

    <measure>pain intensity measure of Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire(ODI)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire(ODI) is a self-reported instrument assessing patient's permanent functional disability in currently. For each section the total possible score is 5: if the first statement is marked the section score = 0; if the last statement is marked, it = 5. The higher the score, the greater the degree of disability.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>functional performance of ASLR fatigue task</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants lifted the heel of the test leg to 20 cm for as long as possible. Participants were required to maintain pressure in the cuff beneath their back as close to 40 mm Hg as possible. Visual feedback of cuff pressure was provided throughout the task, but no instruction was given on how to affect cuff pressure. Task failure was defi ned as an inability to maintain heel height 10 cm or more off the plinth and/or a change in cuff pressure of 20 mm Hg or more.</description>

    <measure>functional performance of timed up and go test</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Test instructions were given in Norwegian. Translated into English, the instructions were as follows: 'After &quot;ready, set, go&quot; stand up, walk as fast as you can until you cross the white line, turn around, and walk back to the chair and sit down again'. The white line was positioned 3m from the patient's starting position.

    <measure>functional performance of 6m timed walk test(fast walking)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects commenced the test in standing with their toes up against the tape marker. Test instructions translated into English were as follows: 'After &quot;ready, set, go&quot;, walk as fast as you can up to the last white line without stopping or speaking along the way'. Performances were timed (to the nearest 100th of a second) between the 2m and 8m markers and later converted into speed in metres per second.</description>
