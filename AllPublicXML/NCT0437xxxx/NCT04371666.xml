  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a global, randomized, double-blind trial of pamrevlumab or placebo in combination
      with systemic corticosteroids in subjects with non-ambulatory Duchenne muscular dystrophy,
      aged 12 years and older. Approximately 90 male subjects will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio to
      Arm A (pamrevlumab + systemic corticosteroid) or Arm B (placebo+ systemic corticosteroid),
      respectively.

      Subjects must be fully informed of the potential benefits of approved products and make an
      informed decision that they prefer to participate in a clinical trial in which they could be
      randomized to placebo.

      Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the two study treatment arms;
      pamrevlumab or placebo in combination with systemic steroids.

      This trial has three study periods:

        -  Screening period: Up to 4 weeks

        -  Treatment period: 52 weeks

        -  Safety Follow-up period/final assessment: 4 weeks (Week 56 (+/-3 days))

      In the screening period, subjects will be evaluated per the protocol inclusion/exclusion
      criteria to determine eligibility for participation in this trial.

      During the treatment period, each subject will receive pamrevlumab or placebo at 35 mg/kg
      every 2 weeks for up to 52 weeks.

      Subjects who complete the 52-week study (either arm) may be eligible for rollover into an
      open-label extension treatment (OLE) with pamrevlumab + systemic corticosteroids.

      Subjects who discontinue study treatment for any reason should be encouraged to return to the
      investigative site to complete final safety and efficacy assessments.

          1. Males at least 12 years of age, non-ambulatory at screening initiation

             IRB/IEC requirements

          3. Male subjects with partners of childbearing potential must use contraception during
             the conduct of the study, and for 3 months after the last dose of study drug.

          4. Medical history includes diagnosis of DMD and confirmed Duchenne mutation using a
