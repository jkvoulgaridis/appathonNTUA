  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Failure of closure of the processus vaginalis during intrauterine life will result in
      congenital inguinal hernia [CIH]. Exact incidence of CIH in children is not known but it has
      been reported between 1-5 %. In premature babies, the incidence may reach up to 15-30%.
      Congenital inguinal hernia is more common in boys than girls, ranging from 4:1 to 10:1 [1].

      Although the open inguinal herniotomy and high ligation of the sac is the gold standard line
      of the treatment, Laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair become a good option. The laparoscopy
      has many advantages that it is simple, feasible, and safe with detection of the contralateral
      hernia and other hernias. In addition to laparoscopy results in excellent cosmetic results
      low wound infection, less pain, and short hospital stay.

      The non-division of the hernia sac in during laparoscopic hernia repair may be the cause of
      recurrence and postoperative hydrocele [5]. Division of hernia sac and suturing of proximal
      part at IIR; is modification of the laparoscopic technique which mimic what happen during
      open herniotomy. Some authors resected the processus vaginalis and closed the inguinal ring
      for the repair of CIH. They claimed that they have excellent results with low recurrence.One
      author described a technique based on the theory that CIH is due to a patent processus
      vaginalis, and therefore, the procedure should be to entirely resect it, with or without
      closure of the internal ring. This allows the peritoneal scar tissue to close the area of the
      ring. Also, this scarring occurs in the extent of the inguinal canal where the dissection
      took place, therefore causing the same peritoneal scarring and sealing of the inguinal ﬂoor
      with complete resolution of the problem.

      However, a few studies address the superiority of technique over the other and to date there
      is no controlled randomized study to compare needlescopic disconnection of the hernia sac and
      closure of the peritoneum at IIR versus disconnection without closure of the peritoneum.

      Description of the Procedure:

      Instruments: 5-mm trocar and 5-mm 30° telescope, single 2-mm reusable port, two 14-G (1.6-mm)
      suture grasper devices [SGD] [Mediflex Company, Islandia, New York, USA], Home made isolated
      diathermy probe and an endoscopic polypectomy snare [SN]. SN is modified by shortening from
      2-m to 70-cm. It fits directly in 2-mm port.

      Operative details: Patient lies in supine position at upper part of OR table towards right
      edge. OR table tilted to opposite side of hernia with 30- degree Trendelenburg position.
      Operator stands on patient's right side during either uni-or bi-lateral hernia. Camera man
      stands at table head and monitor facing patient's feet.

      Povidone Iodine solution was applied from nipple to mid-thigh and child is then draped.
      Vertical trans umbilical 5-mm incision is made and 5mm trocar passed under vision using open
      technique. Pneumoperitoneum is then established with CO2 flow of 1.5-2.5 L/min keeping
      intraabdominal pressure between 8-12 mmHg according to age and weight. Two-mm incision at
      point (A) located at junction of upper 1/3 and lower 2/3 of line extending between umbilicus
      and symphysis pubis for 2mm port passed under direct vision. A 1.6-mm 11-blade scalpel
      puncture 2- cm. above the corresponding Mc-Burney's Point (B) for SGD. Abdomen is explored to
      confirm the diagnosis and detect bilateral hernia if present.

      One SGD was introduced through point A (SGD-A) and another] one through point B (SGD-B). Both
      SGDs were used to invert the hernia sac by gradual sustained alternating traction on the
      round ligament. Each SGD hands to the other one till complete inversion occurs, this is known
      by the sac hanging from internal ring without retracting-back inside the inguinal canal. At
      this point, snare (SN) is passed from the trocar at point A in the place of SGD-A and opened
      inside the abdomen. SGD-B passes inside the loop of SN and re-catches the hernia sac, which
      is then twisted around its neck several time. SN is closed tightly and diathermy current is
      applied to it leading to separation of hernia sac at the proper neck. [2-4]Detached sac
      (grasped by SGD-B) is then pushed antigradely out through the umbilical port. Deflation of
      the abdomen is done and umbilical fascial incision was closed using 2/0 or 3/0 Vicryl and
      umbilical skin layers were closed using 4/0 Vicryl.

      Group B; The above operative details will be applied but the inverted twisted sac will be
      ligated by a home made 3/0 Vicry suture endoloop befor excision and extraction [5].
