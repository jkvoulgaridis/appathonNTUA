  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of the proposed research among this population are: 1) to define clinically
      meaningful change (i.e. differentiating states of health and illness) with respect to urinary
      symptoms, urine inflammation, cultivable bacteria, and the urine ecosystem; and 2) to
      determine the optimal intravesical Lactobacillus RhamnosusGG (LGG®) dose to be used to reduce
      urinary symptoms in a future clinical trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most common outpatient infection world-wide, and for
      people with spinal cord injury (SCI) and neurogenic bladder (NB), it is the most common
      infection, secondary condition, cause for emergency room visits, and infectious cause of
      hospitalization. Despite its prevalence, attempts to ameliorate UTI among people with SCI are
      stymied by long-standing diagnostic challenges which arise from evidence gaps around &quot;gold
      standard&quot; diagnostic tests (urinalysis and urine culture) that have lower sensitivity and
      specificity for UTI in this population. A high prevalence of chronic inflammation leading to
      persistence of white blood cells (WBC) in the urine confounds the utility of WBC count,
      pyuria, and leukocyte esterase as biomarkers for UTI; nitrites in urine indicate the presence
      of only specific (but not all) organisms, many of which are present to a greater extent in
      the urine of people with SCI; and people with SCI have a high prevalence of asymptomatic
      bacteriuria. These physiologic changes render the gold standard diagnostic tests less useful
      for identifying UTI in persons with SCI.

      SPECIFIC AIM 1

      2 urine samples (sampling at least 2 weeks apart) for urinalysis, urine culture, uNGAL, and
      NGS (16S rRNA and shotgun) under the same conditions. In addition to completing the USQNB-IC
      prior to urine collection, participants will complete the USQNB-IC 3 days after urine
      collection

      SPECIFIC AIM 2 Intravesical LGG dose (group: high or low) will be obtained, USQNB-IC, urine
      collection for urinalysis, culture, NGAL and next generation sequencing as described above.
      And patient satisfaction questions.

    <description>For the LGG® instillation, participants will be instructed to mix the contents of 1 LGG capsule into 45 cc sterile 0.9% saline. After mixing, participants will draw up the 45cc liquid LGG mixture into a 60cc syringe and instill via the intermitent catheter. Participants will receive 2 LGG capsules and will repeat this process the following day (&quot;Low&quot; dose). Subjects will remain in the study for up to 29 months, with participation ending after one completed intervention (2 doses) and post-intervention assessments are complete. If urinary symptoms do not occur warranting instillation during the ensuing 29 months, participants will be asked to return any remaining kits (including LGG®). Participants will be instructed to complete the USQNB-IDC weekly until study completion.</description>
