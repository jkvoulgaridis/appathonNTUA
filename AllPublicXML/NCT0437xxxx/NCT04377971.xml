  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine a different way to educate patients about taking care
      of their wound and see how this method affects patient satisfaction, compliance to the wound
      care regimen, and patient experience.

      The teach-back method is delivered using the ask-tell-ask method. Investigators will ask the
      patient about their knowledge of wound care healing, provide the patient educational
      component, then ask the patient to repeat what was said. If the answer is wrong or
      incomplete, the researcher will go over the information again with the patient to clear up
      any misunderstandings.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing Mohs Micrographic surgery for skin cancers on the lower extremities for
      the first time that are left to heal by secondary intention are randomized either to receive
      a scripted teach-back session or a standard of care wound care education. This study wishes
      to compare wound care adherence, patient experience, wound complications, and the number of
      phone calls made by patients to the office between the two cohorts

      primary objective is to determine whether study participants who have received the teach-back
      method have an increase wound care adherence at one week post-operatively, compared to those
      who received the standard of care.

      To characterize differences in the patient experience between the two interventional groups 2
      weeks after surgery.

      To determine whether the number of phone calls made post-operatively by patients will
      decrease in a 2 week follow-up time period.

      To characterize the differences in patient wound care adherence at 2 weeks after surgery.

      To determine whether there is a difference in complication incidence post-operatively

    <description>Study team will provide participant education using the ask-tell-ask method. Participants will receive a post-operative instruction sheet containing detailed information regarding wound care for reference and will receive a phone call at 1 week to inquire about wound care adherence. Participants will come to clinic at 2 weeks to have wounds assessed in addition to answering surveys regarding wound care adherence and participant experience.</description>

    <description>Participant education using the ask-tell-ask method. First the researcher will ask a question about participant understanding of wound care and after hearing the participant's answer, the researcher will then proceed to tell the patient how to best take care of their wound using a standardized script. After the educational portion, the researcher will then ask the patient to repeat the information that was shared. If the participant's answer is wrong or incomplete, the researcher will then explain the instructions again to ensure that the participant understands the steps needed.</description>
