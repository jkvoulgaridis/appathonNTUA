  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the most common sleep breathing disorder in the U.S.
      Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) therapy is the most effective treatment for OSA.
      However, up to 50% of patients who accept using CPAP therapy fail to adhere to it. This study
      will evaluate an information systems (IS)-based solution that sends tailored, motivational,
      educational messages and tailored feedback messages to promote CPAP usage among noncompliant
      OSA patients. The primary aim of this study is to determine the efficacy of the proposed IS
      solution and its effect on fostering the use of CPAP therapy among non-compliant OSA
      patients.
