  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Afuresertib is an AKT inhibitor, a new class of agents under development that may provide
      physicians with a new clinical option to control platinum resistant ovarian cancer (PROC)
      progression. Afuresertib plus chemotherapy has demonstrated anti-tumor efficacy and an
      acceptable safety profile in patients with PROC in a published Phase I/II study. Therefore,
      the combination of afuresertib plus weekly paclitaxel could represent a clinically meaningful
      step forward in the clinical management of these difficult-to-treat patients with PROC.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of approximately 141 patients with PROC are planned to be enrolled and randomized
      with a 2:1 ratio in an open label manner to the 2 arms (94 patients in the combination
      treatment arm and 47 patients in the paclitaxel arm) for efficacy and safety evaluation. The
      randomization will be stratified by country: United States (US) vs China , duration of the
      platinum free interval (PFI): 1 3 months vs &gt;3-6 months and number of prior platinum based
      therapy treatments (1/2 versus 3 prior platinum regimens). The study will consist of 3
      periods. The first period is the Screening Period (Day -24 to -1) during which patients are
      screened for eligibility according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The second period
      is a Treatment Evaluation Period with a randomized, open-label, two arm parallel design (from
      starting study treatment until patients have progressive disease [PD], unacceptable toxicity,
      death, or withdrawal of consent). The PK study will be applied to both the combination
      treatment arm and control arm. The third period is a Follow up Period (safety evaluation at
      30 days after the last dose of study treatment and OS and PFS follow up). Patients will be
      tested at baseline for phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K)/AKT/PTEN pathway alterations, BRCA1/2
      mutations and/or level of phospho AKT by IHC; the correlation of the efficacy endpoints and
      biomarker status will be analyzed retrospectively as an exploratory endpoint.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Female patients at least 18 years of age at the time of signing the informed consent
             form and capable of giving written informed consent, which includes willingness to
             comply with the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.

          2. Must provide informed consent for the procedures and the tests for PI3K/AKT/PTEN
             pathway alterations, BRCA1/2 mutations, and/or level of phospho-AKT. The archival
             tumor biopsy sample collected less than 1 year is preferred. If no archival tumor
             sample is available, fresh biopsy will be recommended. For patients who cannot provide
             a tumor sample or cannot accept fresh tumor biopsy, the Sponsor should be consulted
             about their qualification to enter this study.

          3. Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed high grade serous OC,
             endometroid OC, or ovarian clear cell carcinoma (including fallopian tube and primary
             peritoneal cancers). Carcinosarcoma, sarcoma, mucinous OC, or low-grade serous
             histologies must be excluded.

          4. Must not have previously received prior AKT or PI3K pathway or mTOR inhibitors.

          5. Must have PROC (including fallopian tube and primary peritoneal carcinoma), defined as
             cancer progression between 1 month and 6 months after completion of prior
             platinum-based therapy (at least 4 cycles). Progression is defined by RECIST 1.1
             criteria in association with symptoms necessitating treatment (Appendix 3).

          6. The OC patients must have received 1 to 3 prior platinum-based regimens before PROC
             was diagnosed. No other additional anticancer treatment is allowed except for PARP
             inhibitor or bevacizumab. Combination therapy will be considered as one treatment,
             whereas maintenance therapy will be considered as continuation of the previous
             systemic treatment. Patients should be appropriate candidates for treatment with
             single agent weekly paclitaxel based on investigator's clinical assessment.

          7. Patients must either have received prior treatments with bevacizumab followed by
             disease progression, or bevacizumab cannot be used because of a specific

             contraindication may represent no more than 10% of the total number enrolled):

               -  Platelets ≥ 100,000/µL

               -  Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL

         10. Total serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN) (in patients with known
             Gilbert's syndrome, total bilirubin ≤ 3 × ULN with direct bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × ULN).

         11. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase
             [SGOT])/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamic pyruvate transaminase [SGPT])
             must be &lt; 2.5 × institutional ULN. For patients with liver metastasis, AST/ALT must be
             &lt; 5.0 × institutional ULN.

         12. Creatinine within 1.5 × ULN or creatinine clearance &gt; 30 mL/min by Cockcroft Gault
             formula (Appendix 1).

         13. Toxicities of prior therapy (except alopecia) should have been resolved to less than
             or equal to grade 1 as per NCI-CTCAE v5.0.

         14. Patients must be able to tolerate oral medications and not have any GI illnesses that
             would preclude absorption of afuresertib.

         15. Patient must have a life expectancy of greater than 6 months.

         16. Must have at least one lesion that meets the definition of measurable disease by
             RECIST 1.1 criteria (Appendix 3).

         17. Patients of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (barrier
             method of birth control or abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of
             study participation. If a woman becomes pregnant or suspects she is pregnant while
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.

         18. Must be off strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4/5 treatment for at least 2 weeks
             from Study Day 1.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Platinum refractory disease (progression during or less than 1 month of receiving
             previous platinum containing therapy).

          2. Known or suspected brain metastases.

             (for excipient information, refer to the IB17).

          9. Any condition for which, in the opinion of the investigator, participation would not
             be in the best interest of the patient (eg, compromise well-being) or that could
             prevent, limit, or confound the protocol-specified assessments.

             attacks) within 6 months prior to Study Day 1 or New York Heart Association Class III
             to IV heart disease.

         15. Presence of uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure [BP] &gt; 160 mmHg or
             diastolic BP &gt; 100 mmHg). Patients with a history of hypertension are allowed,

               3. CD4 count &lt; 350 based on a test within 3 months of the screening visit

               4. An acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-defining opportunistic infection within 6
                  months of the start of screening

         17. Had a major surgery ≤ 30 days prior to Study Day 1.

         18. Presence of grade ≥ 2 neuropathy.

         19. Prior receipt of chemotherapy, PARP inhibitor, bevacizumab, or investigational therapy

         20. Patients who are pregnant or lactating.

         21. Patients with high risk of tuberculosis infection, based on investigator's clinical
             assessment, will be screened by tuberculosis screening test, such as the QuantiFERON®

         22. Patients with active hepatitis B (positive hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] test at
             screening) or hepatitis C (positive hepatitis C virus [HCV] antibody test at
             screening) are not allowed to be enrolled in this study. Note:

               -  Patients with past hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection or resolved HBV infection
                  (defined as having a negative HBsAg test and a positive hepatitis B core antibody
                  [HBcAb] test) are eligible.

               -  Patients positive for HCV antibody are eligible only if polymerase chain reaction
