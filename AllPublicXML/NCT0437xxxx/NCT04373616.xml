             received such treatments within a time period corresponding to 5 half-lives of the
             respective agent before screening.

         34. Chronic use of opioid analgesics. However, limited treatment duration for acute
             conditions until 24 hours before cognitive assessment is allowed.

         36. Current use of immunosuppressant or immunomodulating drugs or their use within the 6
             months before study screening. Current use of oral steroids or their use within the 3

             and/or for neurological disorders (passive immunization within the 6 months before
             screening, active immunization at any time point) unless there is firm evidence that
             the subject was treated with placebo only, and the placebo formulation is not expected
             to induce any specific immune response.

         38. Use of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors or use of glutamatergic drugs (eg, memantine,
             topiramate, lamotrigine) if not on stable dose for at least 2 months before screening.

         39. Concomitant participation in any other clinical study using an investigational drug.

         40. Female subjects who are pregnant as confirmed by serum testing at screening or who are
