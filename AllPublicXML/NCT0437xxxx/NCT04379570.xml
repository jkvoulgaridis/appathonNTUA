  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase III trial compares an additional support program (text message reminders and/or
      telephone-based counseling) with usual care in making sure breast cancer patients take their
      endocrine therapy medication as prescribed (medication adherence). Medication adherence is
      how well patients take the medication as prescribed by their doctors, and good medical
      adherence is when patients take medications correctly. Poor medication adherence has been
      shown to be a serious barrier to effective treatment for hormone receptor positive breast
      cancer patients. Adding text message reminders and/or telephone-based counseling to usual
      care may increase the number of days that patients take their endocrine therapy medication as
      prescribed.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare endocrine therapy (ET) adherence at 12 months in diverse women exposed to text
      message reminders (TMR)-only, telephone-based motivational interviewing counseling (MI)-only,
      or both (TMR+MI), versus usual care.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      l. Compare endocrine therapy (ET) adherence at 24 months in diverse women exposed to text
      message reminders (TMR)-only, telephone-based motivational interviewing counseling (MI)-only,
      or both (TMR+MI), versus usual care.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 arms.

      ARM I (TMR): Patients receive online educational information about ET at the start of their
      ET medication. Patients also receive daily text message reminders to take their ET medication
      and monthly text messages about how they are doing with taking their ET medication. These
      text messages continue for 9 months.

      ARM II (MI): Patients receive online educational information about ET at the start of their
      ET medication. Patients also receive a total of 5 motivational interviewing counseling
      sessions via telephone over 30-90 minutes for up to 9 months. These sessions are designed to
      support patients while they take their ET medication, develop health goals, and stay on track
      in achieving those goals.

      ARM III (TMR + MI): Patients receive online educational information about ET at the start of
      their ET medication. Patients also receive text messages as in Arm I and motivational
      interviewing counseling sessions as in Arm II.

      ARM IV (ENHANCED USUAL CARE): Patients attend usual care clinic visits every 3-6 months and
      receive online educational information about ET at the start of their ET medication. Patients
      also receive optional online information about living a healthy life after breast cancer.

      After completion of study participation, patients are followed up for up to 24 months.

               -  Hormone receptor positive is defined as estrogen receptor (ER) and/or
                  progesterone receptor (PR) of &gt; 1%

          -  Patients must have received cancer-directed surgery, and/or completed all other
             adjuvant therapy, except reconstruction

          -  Patients must have initiated an endocrine therapy drug within the 6 months prior to
             registration, OR have received a prescription with stated intent to initiate within 6
             weeks after registration

          -  No history of previous cancer as follows:

               -  Invasive or non-invasive breast cancer at any time

               -  Non-breast cancer, within the past 5 years, excluding non-melanoma skin cancer

          -  Patients must be willing to use a smart phone for study activities

               -  Patient is NOT to be deemed ineligible during the recruitment process if they do

                  be provided to the participant at no cost through the Ohio State University (OSU)
                  partnership with Verizon Wireless for the duration of the study activities

               -  The CRP is ONLY to discuss this option with those patients who self-identify a
