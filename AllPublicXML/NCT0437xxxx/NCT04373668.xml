  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dementia is a devastating condition characterised by progressive loss of cognition leading to
      loss of independence and eventually death. One major unmet need, which remains a critical
      challenge for care provision, is the management of night-time care and sleep-related symptoms
      in people with dementia living in care homes. The causes and impacts of sleep disturbances in
      people with dementia in care homes are complex and multi-faceted, indicating the need of a
      whole-systems approach to the issue. It will require a tailored, person-centred approach
      which accounts for the environmental, personal and clinical factors contributing to the
      symptoms.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate a series of approaches to improve treatment of sleep
      disturbance in people with dementia in care homes, with the goal of reducing the use of
      hypnotic drugs and improving symptoms. This will provide robust evidence to support guidance
      on improving hypnotic drug prescribing and night-time care, both of which are major unmet
      needs in the care of people with dementia.

  <detailed_description>

      The main objective of this current study is to explore the effectiveness of specific benefits
      of key components of the Night Time Care Activities Programme- NightCAP. Particularly
      elements of sleep hygiene and personalised night-time care planning. There may also be
      additional benefit in combining NightCAP elements with pharmacological review protocol to
      enable management of all major contributing factors in sleep disturbance.

      This nine-month cluster-randomised factorial proof-of-concept trial will be delivered in 24
      UK care homes. Participants will be individuals living with dementia and experiencing sleep
      disturbance, as well as staff who care for them. Homes will be randomly allocated to one of
      eight arms. All homes will receive an optimised e-Learning programme; one of the eight is
      optimised usual care only. The remaining seven active interventions arms comprise of one, or
      a combination of two or three, of: (i) personalised night-time care planning (supported staff
      training and implementation); (ii) structured sleep hygiene (staff training); and (iii)
      hypnotic drug review protocol (GP and staff training). Across all 24 homes, 12 will receive
      each active intervention (alone or in combination). The primary contrast is hypnotic drug
      review vs no hypnotic drug review. The primary outcome will be hypnotic drug use at the end
      of intervention delivery. Secondary outcomes will be behaviour symptoms, sleep disturbance,
      quality of life, resident falls, job satisfaction, burden and coping in care staff, and cost
      effectiveness.

    <measure>Neuropsychiatric Inventory- Nursing Home (NPI-NH)</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline, immediately after intervention and at four months follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The NPI is a validated structured interview assessment with the informant (care staff), that assesses behavioural disturbances in patients with dementia. This 12-item version consists of 10 behavioural and two neurovegetative areas. It provides both a total score as well as scores for a number of sub-scales (e.g. delusions, hallucinations, agitation/aggression, depression/dysphoria, anxiety, disinhibition, elation/euphoria, apathy/indifference, irritability/lability, aberrant motor activity, sleep, and appetite/eating disorders). The frequency, severity and caregiver distress for each domain are measured. The total possible maximum score is 144. A higher score reflects increased frequency and severity of the disturbances. This specific version is developed for use in care homes, with adapted questions in the standardised interview and the caregiver distress assessment adapted to occupation disruptiveness.</description>
