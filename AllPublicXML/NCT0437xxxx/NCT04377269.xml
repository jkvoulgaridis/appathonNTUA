      Objective: This study aimed to 1) investigate the long-term effect of taping and bandaging on
      proprioception, balance, and vertical jump among volleyball players with ankle instability,
      2) Compare the short-term effects of taping and bandaging on these outcome measures, 3)
      Compare the long-term effects of taping and bandaging on these outcome measures.

      Design: A single-blinded randomized controlled study Setting: Rehabilitation Laboratory at
      Istanbul Gelisim University, Turkey Subjects: One-hundred participants with a chronic ankle
      sprain (CAI) Primary outcome measures: Proprioception (ankle range of motion absolute error),
      balance(Y-balance test), and vertical jump (vertical jump tester) Interventions: Participants
      were distributed into three groups: taping group (n=33) received ankle rigid taping,
      bandaging group (n=33) received ankle bandaging, and control group (n=34) received placebo
      taping. All three previous external supports were applied for 8 weeks. The measurements were
      performed at baseline, immediately after applying for support, two weeks after support and
      eight months after support.

    <description>Ankle taping: a hard preventive Zinc oxide tape was used. The taping procedures consisted of three separate steps. 1) included the application of the anchor tape. 2) application of the stirrup tape. The stirrup tape was performed two times by holding the foot in a neutral position and the tape is placed as it passed through the medial side of the ankle (under the foot), just over the heel area (posterior one-third of the foot) and up along the lateral side of the ankle. Bandaging: standard 10cm width elastic bandage used. The bandage wrapped around the ankle joint in the form of an 8-figure. Bandage started from the forefoot, moving diagonally upwards and steeply enough to go well above the heel to end around the lower calf area to form an anchor. Then, it moved diagonally down across the mid-foot. Placebo: 10cm long tape was applied on the lateral side of the leg, just above the lateral malleolus and aligned with peroneus longus tendon</description>
