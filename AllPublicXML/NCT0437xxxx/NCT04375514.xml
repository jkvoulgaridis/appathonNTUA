    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK)
      of single doses of ARO-ENaC in healthy adult volunteers; and to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, PK and efficacy of multiple doses of ARO-ENaC in patients with pulmonary cystic
      fibrosis.
