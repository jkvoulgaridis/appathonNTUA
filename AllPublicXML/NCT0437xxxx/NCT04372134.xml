  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is postulated that high frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can
      decrease the corticospinal inhibition and enhance the motor recovery. This study is aimed to
      investigate the effect of high frequency rTMS on lower extremity motor recovery and gait
      parameters in patients with chronic motor incomplete traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI).

      A sham-controlled double-blind randomized study was undertaken. 28 patients with chronic (&gt;1
      year) motor incomplete traumatic SCI were randomized into real rTMS group (n=14) or sham rTMS
      group (n=14). Real rTMS (20 Hz, a total of 1600 stimuli) or sham r TMS were applied in the
      motor cortex area of lower extremities during 3 weeks (15 sessions). In addition to rTMS
      sessions, patients underwent a rehabilitation program including exercises for strengthening,
      walking and balance. Lower extremity motor score (LEMS), the temporal-spatial gait parameters
      measured by 3D gait analysis, Walking Index for SCI-II (WISCI-II) scale and 10 meters walking
      test were assessed at baseline, 3 weeks (after the treatment sessions) and 5 weeks
      (follow-up).
