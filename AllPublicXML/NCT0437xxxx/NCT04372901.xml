  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CAD/CAM (computer aided design/ computer aided manufacturing) constructed screw retained
      implant supported frameworks give solutions for the problems arising from the lost wax
      technique by improving accuracy, adaptation and passive fit of the final restoration.
      However, concerns about the passive fit of a pre-implant insertion CAD/CAM constructed
      framework still exists due to the expected errors in imaging, registration, surgical guide
      construction, adaptation and hence transferring the planned position intra-orally.

    <masking_description>The study is based on different technical procedures of fabrication of the frameworks. Since these differences are visible, the operator, the assessor and the technician involved in the study cannot be blinded. Since blinding was not possible, randomization was delayed till the prosthetic phase to avoid any performance bias in the surgical steps. But the statistician will be blinded .</masking_description>
