  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pressure offloading is often considered the most crucial aspect in healing after a foot
      injury. The investigators have devised a novel foot offloading device (PopSole™) which will
      allow for customization of the area where there is foot pain, as well as allow for
      customizable arch support and elevation of the metatarsals. This validation study is aimed to
      assess improvement of pain with use, ease of use, fit and feel, compliance, and durability
      over a 4 week period. Validated patient reported outcome measures will be used at baseline, 2
      weeks and 4 weeks.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All subjects will receive the PopSole™ offloading device at the screening/baseline visit, be
      asked to wear it for 4 weeks, and will be asked to return for an in-person evaluation at week
      2 and a completion study visit at week 4.

      Screening includes the following procedures:

        1. Performance of a limited physical exam, inclusive of participant's foot exam with a gait
           and shoe gear evaluation.

        2. Medical and surgical history collection

        3. Vital signs, medication profile, allergies, height, weight, and BMI calculation.

        4. Collection of demographic information

        5. 2D Photographs of both feet will be performed

      Subjects will be asked to complete:

        1. Questionnaires

             -  Foot and Ankle Ability Measure questionnaire

             -  Mayo Clinical Scoring System questionnaire

             -  American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society questionnaire

             -  Manchester Foot and Ankle Disability Index

             -  Pittsburgh Foot Survey

        2. Diary cards to document for the feet: pain, bruising, redness of the skin, itching,
           swelling, bleeding, and any concerns/issues not listed, as well as the location, date
           and day for each noted symptom.

        3. Offload Device Distribution. Devices will be provided for both feet to maintain symmetry
           and gait stability between the two feet. One pair of devices will be given for use in
           shoe gear, and one pair will be given for use in a slide in the shower.

      Follow up visit procedures:

      Week 2

        1. Collection of vital signs, medication profile, weight, and BMI calculation

        2. Limited physical exam with a foot exam

        3. Adverse Event Reporting

        4. Collection and distribution of feet diary cards

        5. 2D Photographs of both feet

        6. Foot Assessment Questionnaires

        7. Device survey - questions about the fit and feel of the device

      Week 4

      The same procedures listed for week 2, with the addition of PopSole™ Device removal and final
      foot diary card collection.

    <description>This is an external insole device that fits into a shoe and is reusable for a given subject, not for one-time use. It is comparable to other off-the-shelf insoles readily available and presents minimal risk to the participant during the four weeks of study participation.</description>

    <intervention_name>PopSole™ Offloading Device</intervention_name>
    <description>Specifically, the PopSole™ Offloading Device allows the provider to pop bubbles in the device (like popping paper or plastic bubble sheeting), thereby offloading the surgical area or area of pain. This customizable approach to offloading may increase compliance as it can easily fit in a normal walking shoe and is personalized for each patient. It can also be attached to a slide for use in the shower. Currently no post-operative devices for offloading the foot can be used in the shower.</description>
