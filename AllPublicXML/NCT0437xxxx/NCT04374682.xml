  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      patients with chronic refractory temporomandibular dysfunction were prescribed home exercise
      and were followed for 6 months. Pain , mouth opening and Fonseca's were done at day 1 and
      after 6 months of the study.

      Each patient was seen by the rheumatologist who did the following; Full history taking
      including special habits like chewing gums or biting nails, Pain level measured by visual
      analogue scale 100 (both at rest and during temporomandibular joint movement) Clinical
      Examination of the temporomandibular joint including localized tenderness and amount of mouth
      opening After that the patients were prescribed the rehabilitation program in the form of
      heat modalities and Transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation on the on the temporomandibular
      joint, given an individual demonstration of the home based exercises and were given a
      reminding handout.

      The rehabilitation program consisted of the following exercises: lateral deviation,
      protrusion/retraction and mandibular opening.

      Isometric cervical muscle strengthening exercises were also prescribed for the patients.

      Assessment of the severity of temporomandibular joint affection using the Fonseca's
      questionnaire were done twice; the first at the entry point to the study and once again after
      6 months.

    <description>It is composed of 10 questions, which include checking for the presence of pain in temporomandibular joint, head, back, and while chewing, parafunctional habits, movement limitations, joint clicking, perception of malocclusion, and sensation of emotional stress. The volunteers were informed that the 10 questions should be answered with &quot;yes&quot;, &quot;no&quot; and &quot;sometimes&quot; and that only one answer should be marked for each question. Scoring ranges between 0-50 with higher score indicating worse results.</description>
