  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to create a biobank of oral smears permitting to
      identify the genetic locus/loci associated with an increased risk to develop meningiomas
      after cyproterone acetate (CPA) (Androcur®) treatment, using a GWAS approach As the secondary
      objectives, the study aims:

        -  to evaluate the importance of the genetic susceptibility.

        -  to record the frequence of homonodependant cancers occuring in female patients with
           Androcur® associated meningioma and in their first-degree relatives.

        -  to describe clinical, radiological, histological characteristics of the patients who
           have developed meningioma after cyproterone acetate exposure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The increased risk to develop a meningioma has recently been established for people received
      the cyproterone acetate.

      The investigators observed several familial cases of CPA related meningiomas, suggesting a
      strong genetic factor that modulates the risk to develop meningiomas in patients exposed to
      CPA. The aim of this project is to generate a biobank permitting, in future studies, to
      identify the genetic locus/loci associated with an increased risk to develop meningiomas
      after CPA (Androcur®) treatment, using a GWAS approach.

      Enrollment of patients will take place in hospitals where the patients are treated and also
      via the social networking sites such as Facebook. There will be 4 groups of subjects. Five
      hundred patients will be enrolled in each group targeting 2000 patients in total, among which
      1000 patients (Groupe 1 and Groupe 2) will participate in the biobank.

      Six centers in 5 university hospitals of APHP (Pitié-Salpêtrière, Ambroise Paré, Cochin,
      Lariboisière, Saint-Antoine) will be involved in the study.

      La duration of enrollment will be 24 months. The participation duration for each subject will
      be 1 hour. Statistics analysis method: SAS 9.1.3.
