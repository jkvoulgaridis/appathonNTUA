      This is a single arm, phase II, multicenter study trial evaluating Pembrolizumab in recurrent
      platinum resistant CPS score &gt;1 positive ovarian, Fallopian tube and primary peritoneal
      cancer patients. All the eligible patients will receive Pembrolizumab 200 mg d1 q 21 iv
      infusion in 30 minutes, until disease progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity or
      patient's refusal. Pembrolizumab will be administered for a maximum of 2 years.

      The primary objective of the study is to assess overall survival (OS) of patients treated
      with Pembrolizumab single agent.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Platinum resistant (platinum free interval 1-6 months from last platinum dose)

          2. CPS score&gt;1

          3. Be willing and able to provide written informed consent/assent for the trial.

          4. Be &gt;= 18 years of age on day of signing informed consent.

          5. Have measurable disease or evaluable based on RECIST 1.1 (patients with only CA 125
             increase without evidence of disease are not included).

          6. Be willing to provide tissue from a newly obtained core or excisional biopsy of a
             tumor lesion. Newly-obtained is defined as a specimen obtained up to 6 weeks (42 days)
             prior to initiation of treatment on Day 1. Subjects for whom newly-obtained samples
             cannot be provided (e.g. inaccessible or subject safety concern) may submit an
             archived specimen.

          7. Have a performance status of 0 or 1 on the ECOG Performance Scale.

          8. Demonstrate adequate organ function

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Is currently participating and receiving study therapy or has participated in a study
             of an investigational agent and received study therapy or used an investigational
             device within 4 weeks of the first dose of treatment.

          2. Has received &gt;2 previous CHT lines

          3. Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any
             other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of trial
             treatment.

          4. Has a known history of active TB (Bacillus Tuberculosis)

          5. Hypersensitivity to pembrolizumab or any of its excipients.

          6. Has had a prior anti-cancer monoclonal antibody (mAb) within 4 weeks prior to study
             Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events
             due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

          7. Has had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy
             within 2 weeks prior to study Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at
             baseline) from adverse events due to a previously administered agent.

               -  Note: Subjects with ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy are an exception to this criterion and
                  may qualify for the study.

               -  Note: If subject received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from
                  the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting

          8. Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment.

             Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous cell carcinoma of the
             skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy or in situ cervical cancer.

          9. Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous
             meningitis. Subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided
             they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least four weeks
             prior to the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms have returned
             to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using
             steroids for at least 7 days prior to trial treatment. This exception does not include
             carcinomatous meningitis which is excluded regardless of clinical stability.

         10. Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years
             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive
             drugs). Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a
             form of systemic treatment.

         11. Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or has current
             pneumonitis.

         12. Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.

         13. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

         14. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

         15. Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit
             through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment. Female subject of
             childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum pregnancy within 72 hours
             prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. If the urine test is positive
             or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required.

         16. Female subjects of childbearing potential should be willing to use 2 methods of Birth
             control or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course
             of the study through 120 days after the last dose of study medication. Subjects of
             childbearing potential are those who have not been surgically sterilized or have not
             been free from menses for &gt; 1 year.

         17. Patients should not be breast-feeding during treatment and for 120 days following the
             end of treatment

         18. Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent.

         19. Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies).

         20. Has a known history of Hepatitis B (defined as Hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg]
             reactive) or known active Hepatitis C virus (defined as HCV RNA [qualitative] is
             detected) infection. Note: no testing for Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C is required
             unless mandated by local health authority. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days
             of planned start of study therapy.
