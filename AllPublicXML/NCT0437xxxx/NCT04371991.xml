      Kisspeptins are a family of neuropeptides that are critical for the puberty initiation and
      female fertility. The investigators aimed to investigate in this study kisspeptin levels in
      early pregnancy, ectopic pregnancy, and early pregnancy loss.

      Clinicians can easily do a differential diagnosis of early pregnancy, miscarriage, and
      ectopic pregnancy when the human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) values higher than 2000 mIU/mL
      with transvaginal ultrasound. However, in cases where the hCG value is below the critical
      threshold of 1500 to 2000 mIU/mL (often called the discrimination level) and ultrasound is
      not likely to be diagnostic, the pregnancy is of unknown location. Plasma or serum kisspeptin
      is mainly derived from the placenta during pregnancy and plasma kisspeptin levels
      significantly increase across pregnancy. Plasma kisspeptin levels could be used as a
      potential biomarker for the discrimination of miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy.

      All statistics will be carried out with the use of SPSS (ver. 21, IBM). A P value of &lt;.05 is
      considered to be statistically significant. Pearson chi-square test will be used to evaluate
      between-group differences by pregnancy outcome for categoric data. Kisspeptin differences
      will be calculated between groups with one way ANOVA.

      Kisspeptin is a family of peptide hormones encoded by the KISS1 gene. Kisspeptin acts
      centrally via the kisspeptin receptor to stimulate the release of gonadotropin-releasing
      hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus and has a critical role in the initiation of puberty.
      Kisspeptin was first discovered as an inhibitor of tumor metastasis and, as a result, was
      previously known as metastatin. Kisspeptin is also found in high levels in first-trimester
      syncytiotrophoblast cells.

        Women were considered for the study if they presented between 5-6 weeks of gestation by
        last menstrual period. Patients were included if they had either confirmed intrauterine
        pregnancy (IUP) by ultrasound (n=22) or confirmed miscarriage (SAB) by ultrasound (n=20) or
        ectopic pregnancy.
