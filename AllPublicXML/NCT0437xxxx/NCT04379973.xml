  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ten to 15 percent of couples in their reproductive lifetime face fertility problems which is
      defined by WHO as the absence of pregnancy after minimal 12 months of unprotected sexual
      intercourse. The three most frequent causes of subfertility are: sperm defects, ovulation
      disorders and tubal pathology. In order to exclude tubal pathology, tubal patency tests are
      performed under ultrasound guidance with foam (hysterosalpingo-foam sonography (Hyfosy)) or
      with contrast/water (hysterosalpingo-contrast sonography (Hycosy)).

      This trial will investigate whether tubal flushing with an oil-soluble contrast medium (OSCM)
      can increase the likelihood of a spontaneous conception after tubal patency testing with
      Hyfosy/Hycosy under ultrasound guidance compared to no additional flushing in a population of
      infertile women between 18 and 40 years of age with absence of pregnancy after 12 months of
      unprotected sexual intercourse. The use of Lipiodol Ultra Fluide® is off-label in
      Hyfosy/Hycosy.

      This multicenter, randomised, open-label, comparative and pragmatic trial compares 2 arms
      which will be randomised 1:1:

        -  Intervention group: Tubal flush with 5-10mL oil-soluble contrast medium (Lipiodol Ultra
           Fluide®, Guerbet, France) immediately after Hyfosy

        -  Control group: No additional intervention after Hyfosy The study comprises a screening
           period of maximum 2 weeks (w-8 to w-6), randomisation (w-8 to d1), a start study visit
           at which the Hyfosy is performed (d1) and a treatment period of 6 months (d1-w26). If
           there is no ongoing pregnancy at 6 months after Hyfosy, the follow-up will last till 12
           months (w52). If the participant is pregnant at 6 months after Hyfosy, the follow-up
           will last till maximal 4 months after live birth or miscarriage.

      The primary endpoint is the occurrence of live birth of at least one baby beyond 24 weeks of
      gestation, with the first day of the last menstrual cycle in which the patient conceives
      within 6 months after Hyfosy. Secondary endpoints consist of pregnancy outcomes, number of
      complications during or immediately after the intervention, pain score of the Hyfosy,
      neonatal outcomes, thyroid function of the child and mother, general and disease-specific
      quality of life.
