  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to investigate that a common cholesterol lowering agent
      (atorvastatin) alone or combining with a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (aspirin) would
      reduce the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) in high-risk individuals with Lynch syndrome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an exploratory biomarker trial to assess the ability of atorvastatin (common
      cholesterol lowering agent) alone or combining with aspirin (a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
      drug) to reduce the risk of colorectal cancer in high-risk individuals with Lynch Syndrome.
      Subjects will be stratified based on their prior history of polyps/cancer to receive
      atorvastatin without or with aspirin for 6 weeks. Blood and normal colon biopsies will be
      obtained at Day 0 and at 6 weeks on study. Tissue endpoints for analysis include cell
      proliferation, apoptosis and changes in gene expression. Circulating lipid profiles and
      metabolic function, and post-treatment questionnaires will be used to assess the
      acceptability of the study.

    <time_frame>Changes from baseline to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Effect of Atorvastatin or/and Aspirin on normal colonic proliferation and apoptosis will be evaluated by comparing of immunohistochemical staining of Ki-67 and active caspase 3 using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded biopsies collected before and at the 6 weeks of drug treatments. Number of positive cells and total number of evaluated cells will be collected for both assays. Data of cells with positive Ki-67 or active caspase 3 will be expressed as % of positive cells (# positive cells/#total evaluated cells x 100). Statistical analyses will be performed to compare the difference between baseline and 6-weeks data.</description>

    <measure>Genome-wide expression analyses using RNA-Seq</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes from baseline to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Effect of Atorvastatin or/and Aspirin on gene expressions in normal colonic epithelial cells will be analyzed using RNA-Seq. Total RNA will be extracted from frozen biopsies. RNASeq libraries will be generated and sequenced on an Illumina platform and analyzed. Differential expression between samples at baseline and 6-weeks of drug treatment will be assessed for statistical significance. Genes with false discovery rat ≤ 0.05 and a fold-change ≥ 2 will be considered significant.</description>

    <measure>Rate of adherence of healthy patients with Lynch Syndrome to a 6-week of the treatment regimen (atorvastatin ± aspirin).</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Medication Adherence to the 6-week course of Atorvastatin or/and Aspirin preventive therapy will be assessed by one question in the follow -up survey which participants complete at the end of the study :&quot;Over 6 weeks of preventive therapy, how many Atorvastatin/Aspirin pills did you forget to take?&quot; In addition, participants will be asked to return medication bottle(s) with or without pills. RA will count pills and record number of missing pills in the system.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Frequency of adverse events among patients administered atorvastatin ± aspirin for 6 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The adverse event assessment form is used to collect initial and follow-up information for non-serious and serious adverse events for patients participating in the study. Participants are contacted by RA every two weeks to assess side effects and toxicity. A grading scale from 1 to 5 (1-mild, 2-moderate, 3-severy, 4-life-threatining, 5- death related to AE) and causality (1-unrelated, 2-unlikly, 3-possible, 4-probable, 5-definite, NA- not assessed) are recorded for each adverse event (AE) term. Each AE is reviewed by principal investigator and entered into patient's electronic medical record (EMR)</description>

    <measure>Acceptability of the pilot study intervention and the willingness of the subject to participate in a similar larger study.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Acceptability of the study approach 6 Likert-type items (7 point scale) will assess participants' perceptions of various aspects of the study design as a measure of whether changes need to be made to the study methods or design prior to a larger multi-institutional trial. Participants' scores will be summed and a mean score generated. Mean scores &gt; 4 will be considered in the acceptable range. Our threshold target is 75% of participants with a mean score in the acceptable range.</description>
