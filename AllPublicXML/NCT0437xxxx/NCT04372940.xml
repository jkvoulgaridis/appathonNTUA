  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to examine the use of tranexamic acid (TXA) in gender mastectomy
      surgery, specifically looking at volume loss (blood and transudate) postoperatively.

    <textblock>
      Anecdotal data from plastic surgeons around the country suggests that tranexamic acid has
      decreased patient's drain outputs, swelling, and bruising. Based on these anecdotal reports,
      many University of Wisconsin (UW) surgeons in Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery became
      interested in its use. It has a very safe profile and is inexpensive; therefore, many UW
      plastic surgeons have started using it topically prior to closure in many of procedures.
      Surgeons notice decreased drain output and bruising; and therefore decided to formally study
      the effects of tranexamic acid to determine whether there was a statistical difference in
      outcomes with the use of the drug.

      For this sub-study, topical TXA will be applied to the surface of surgical sites and the
      primary outcome will be days to drain removal postoperatively. Secondary outcomes that would
      be assessed is total drain fluid output in milliliters, hematoma and seroma rates, and need
      for transfusion for hemoglobin &lt; 7.0 postoperatively.

      The hypothesis is that the use of TXA will result in earlier removal of drains by decreasing
      total drain fluid output and decreased need for transfusions, thus minimizing the associated
      complications/risks with drains and transfusions. The overall study is in two-parts, 1) a
      prospective study with retrospective controls via chart review and 2) a prospective
      controlled trial in bilateral procedures where participants serve as their own control with
      one side having tranexamic acid irrigation and the other side having saline irrigation.

      This record documents a prospective controlled trial of the use of TXA in gender mastectomy,
      specifically.
