  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the functional and clinical outcome of this new
      lengthening osteotomy of the lateral trochlea in patients with patella instability, trochlear
      dysplasia Dejour type A or B, short lateral articular trochlea quantified by the lateral
      condyle index and presence of a lateral trochlear bump.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A short lateral articular trochlea leads to failure in stabilizing the patella close to full
      Extension of the knee. To address this type of pathology, a trochlear lengthening osteotomy
      was described. To date only case reports describing the clinical outcome of this new
      osteotomy exist and information on functional outcome regarding muscle strength and
      electromyography (EMG) data is lacking. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the
      functional and clinical outcome of this new lengthening osteotomy of the lateral trochlea in
      patients with patella instability, trochlear dysplasia Dejour type A or B, short lateral
      articular trochlea quantified by the lateral condyle index and presence of a lateral
      trochlear bump.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>presence of a recurrent patellar dislocation/ radiological reduction of the trochlear bump postoperative by plain radiograph of the knee/ lateral view</measure>
    <time_frame>at Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>presence of a recurrent patellar dislocation postoperative by plain radiograph of the knee/ lateral view:
crossing sign: The sign is positive when the trochlear groove lies in same plane as anterior border of lateral condyle. It represents a flattened trochlear groove
double contour sign: The sign is positive when the anterior border of lateral condyle lies anterior to anterior border of medial condyle. It represents a convex trochlear groove/hypoplastic medial condyle
presence of a lateral trochlear bump prominence
the patellar height will be evaluated according to Insall-Salvati method (normal between 0.8 and 1.2) and Caton Deschamps method (normal between 0.6 and 1.3)</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>(Change in) Lateral condyle index assessed by MRI of the knee</measure>
    <time_frame>at Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Lateral condyle index assessed by MRI of the knee (preoperative (always conducted) and in the cases where they are available postoperative MRIs). The lateral condyle index was designed to measure the lateral trochlea by comparing the anterior cartilaginous trochlea (a) and the posterior aspect (p) [(a:p)× 100].</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjective Evaluation of the outcome of the operation</measure>
    <time_frame>at Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The patients will be asked to subjectively evaluate the outcome of the operation according to the following options:
Excellent: Patient is fully recovered and has resumed all activity without restrictions
Somewhat Improved: Patient is mostly recovered and has resumed a majority of activities
Unchanged: Patient outcome is equivalent to pre-operative complaints
Somewhat Worse: Patient is experiencing symptoms worse than pre-operative complaints
Significantly Worse: Patient outcome is worse than pre-operative complaints with significantly worse symptoms</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Kujala Anterior Knee Pain Scale (AKPS)</measure>
    <time_frame>at Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Kujala AKPS is a 13-item screening instrument designed to assess patellofemoral pain in adolescents and young adults, with a variable ordinal response format. For example, a 'Limp' score would be scored as follows: none (5), slight/periodic (3), constant (0). Total scores range from 0 to 100.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Lysholm Knee Score</measure>
    <time_frame>at Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Lysholm Knee Score consists of eight items that measure: pain (25 points), instability (25 points), locking (15 points), swelling (10 points), limp (5 points), stair climbing (10 points), squatting (5 points), and need for support (5 points). Every question response has been assigned an arbitrary score on an increasing scale. The total score is the sum of each response to the eight questions, and may range from 0-100. Higher scores indicate a better outcome with fewer symptoms or disability.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual analog scale score (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>at Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The visual analogue scale (VAS) is a 100-mm horizontal line on which the patient's pain intensity is represented by a point between the extremes of &quot;no pain at all&quot; and &quot;worst pain imaginable.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tegner activity scale</measure>
    <time_frame>at Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Tegner activity scale is a one-item score that graded activity based on work and sports activities on a scale of 0 to 10. Zero represents disability because of knee problems and 10 represents national or international level soccer.</description>

Passive patellar translation in 30° of flexion billaterally in quadrants of translation.
Patellar apprehension test (Fairbank's Test) and the Moving Patellar Apprehension (MPAT) test for the diagnosis of patellar instability. The Fairbank's Test is performed in 30° of Flexion while the MPAT is performed while flexing the knee from 0° to 90°.</description>

    <description>Collection of data for muscle strength:
Muscle strength will be measured bilaterally using a dynamometer (Biodex System 4 Pro: Biodex Medical Systems, Shirley, NY, USA). For the knee, maximum isokinetic Flexion and extension torques will be collected between full extension and full flexion at a movement speed of 60°/s (3 x 5 repetitions) Maximum joint torques in each movement direction will be recorded for each joint and normalized to body weight</description>
