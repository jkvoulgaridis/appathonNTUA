  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An open-label, prospective, observational, multicenter study. The study enrolls adult
      outpatients with CCI from 8 federal districts of the Russian Federation.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Medical data (demographic and clinical characteristics - diagnosis, MoCA test results) are
      collected from patients to whom Divaza is prescribed to be taken according to the following
      regimen: 2 tablets 3 times per day for 12 weeks.

      Neurologists assess the patients' cognitive functions with MoCA scale before starting therapy
      with Divaza (visit 1) and 12 weeks after the treatment (visit 2).

      The efficacy of Divaza for the treatment of cognitive impairment in patients with chronic
      cerebral ischemia (CCI) is evaluated.

      Safety is assessed based on the frequency and severity of adverse events. In addition, the
      relationship between MoCA test performance and gender or regional social and economic factors
      is evaluated.

        Adult CCI outpatients with cognitive impairment (MoCA score &lt;26) or without one (MoCA score
        ≥ 26) recieving unchanged basic therapy of CCI and underlying vascular disease for a 3
        month previous to the onset of the study. Diagnosis of сhronic cerebral ischemia (CCI) was
        based on the clinical history of underlying vascular disease(atherosclerosis and/or
        arterial hypertension) and neurological signs. Vascular nature of cognitive impairment in
        patients with MoCA&lt;26 was determined according to NINDS-AIREN criteria.
