    <textblock>
      This trial aims to prospectively assess the feasibility, complications and functional results
      of free-hand transperineal image fusion targeted biopsies under local anesthesia in a large
      group of patients.

      12-core transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) biopsy is one of the most performed urological
      procedures and remains the standard method for prostate cancer (PCa) histological diagnosis
      according to the most recent Guidelines. During the last decade, the transperineal prostate
      biopsy has attracted renewed interest. However, only a few studies and no large prospective
      studies investigated complications of the transperineal approaches.

      Image fusion of Multi-parameter MRI (mpMRI) and TRUS guided prostate targeted biopsy had
      equivalent results with standard 12-core biopsy. Combination of targeted and standard biopsy
      was recommended in recent Guidelines. Image fusion targeted biopsy needs satisfactory
      anesthetic effect, and no prospective studies investigated feasibility in this approach under
      local anesthesia.

      The scientific urological community is focusing on detection rate and concordance with final
      pathology of the radical prostatectomy specimen, which remain the cornerstones to assess the
      accuracy of a prostate biopsy technique. In this study, the investigators will additionally
      assess the functional results of erectile function and urinary function.

      Together, the investigators will perform free-hand image fusion targeted biopsies plus
      standard biopsies under local anesthesia in patients recruited in this study. Then,
      Feasibility, such as peri-procedural pain, changes in patients quality of life;
      complications, such as infection rate and bleeding rate; functional results, such as erectile
      function and urinary function; and concordance with final pathology will be evaluated.
