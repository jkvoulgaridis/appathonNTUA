  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immunotherapy with anti-programmed death 1 (PD-1) antibodies has revolutionized the treatment
      of metastatic and advanced NSCLC, but its application in neoadjuvant setting has not been
      well established. Results from a pilot clinical study reported the safety and feasibility of
      neoadjuvant PD-1 blockade. There are several neoadjuvant immunotherapy (NEOSTAR, LCMC3,
      NADIM, IMpower131) ongoing, and the preliminary results are reported in 2019 American Society
      of Clinical Oncology, which show promising therapeutic prospect. However, the therapeutic
      response rate (major pathologic response [MPR]) are not so good (20% - 45%) for PD-1
      inhibitor monotherapy. To improve the therapeutic response, the investigators design a
      multiple-canter, open-label, phase II trial for stage II-IIIA resectable NSCLC. The
      participants will receive neoadjuvant PD-1 inhibitor (camrelizumab) combined with
      antiangiogenic drug (apatinib) or platinum-based chemotherapy.

      Detailed Description:

      This is a multiple-canter, open-label, phase II trial, 2-4 cycles treatment will be planned
      as neo-adjuvant therapy for NSCLC participants in stage II-IIIA.

      Study design:

      Participants: Newly diagnosed Resectable II-IIIA NSCLC without EGFR/ALK/ROS1/BRAF mutation.

      Treatment:

      Group A：camrelizumab 200 mg q3w i.v. for 2-4 cycles, apatinib 250mg pd po 3w/cycle for 2-4
      cycles before surgery; Group B：camrelizumab 200 mg q3w i.v. for 2-4 cycles, platinum-based
      chemotherapy q3w i.v for 2-4 cycles before surgery.

      Endpoints:

      Primary objectives are to assess MPR and safety. Secondary objective is to assess 2-year
      overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), OS etc.

      Exploratory end point is to explore biomarkers.

    <description>It refers to the proportion of patients who have had a complete response or partial response (according to RECIST1.1) as confirmed by CT evaluation after 3 weeks in all patients who have completed the neoadjuvant therapy.

    <description>It refers to the time from radical surgery to relapse or death of a participant due to disease progression. In the case of a patient who still survives at the time of analysis, the latest evaluation date will be used for interpolation (censoring).</description>

    <measure>Overall survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 63 months</time_frame>
    <description>It is defined as the time from enrollment to death of participant due to any cause. In the case of a patient who still survives at the time of analysis, the date of last contact will be taken as the censoring date.
