      This study is in two stages:

      Stage 1: A First-in-Human (FIH), single dose escalation study of oral NNZ-2591 in healthy
      volunteers to establish safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic parameters.

      Stage 2: A First-in-Human (FIH), multiple dose escalation study of oral NNZ-2591 in healthy
      volunteers to establish safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic parameters.
