  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a longitudinal study where individual with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) will be
      monitored for 12 weeks. The study aims to develop an objective, sensor-based, algorithm able
      to detect the presence of depression as well as predict treatment response. Measurement-based
      treatment is considered optimal and the development of a valid passive, objective, behavioral
      and biological assessment of depressive symptoms that does not rely on clinician interviews
      will improve monitoring and ultimately improve treatment significantly.

      In this longitudinal study 100 individuals with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) will be
      monitored for 12 weeks. Data will include self-report surveys, in-person assessments,
      physiological features derived by wearable devices and socialization and activity data
      derived by mobile applications. The study will utilize advanced statistical methods to
      integrate different sources of passive sensor-based behavioral and physiological data to
      develop models able to detect depression and predict treatment response.
