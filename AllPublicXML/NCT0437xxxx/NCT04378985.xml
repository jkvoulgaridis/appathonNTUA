    <textblock>
      &quot;Increased health risks and diseases are believed to be caused by multilevel interactions of
      genetic and environmental factors (including lifestyle habits). Considering the recent
      advancements in genetic analysis, wearable devices, and big data analysis techniques,
      collecting and analyzing personal genetic information, lifelogs, and environmental data and
      predicting the exact health risks of individuals could be possible.

      These changes enable the development of healthcare solutions that allow users to actively
      engage in healthcare and provide appropriate care measures to sufficiently delay or prevent
      chronic diseases, thereby minimizing the financial losses of the individuals and the society.
      In particular, chronic diseases such as metabolic syndrome can be prevented or delayed
      through healthy lifestyle habits. Controversy regarding the effectiveness of using wearable
      devices and mobile health applications for maintaining lifestyle habits and losing weight
      exists. Additionally, a study assessing the health of the participants and the disease
      prevention care for the participants using the genetic data and the lifelog data by the
      wearable device has not been conducted yet. Therefore, the objective is to operate a
      lifestyle correction program for examinees who visited a family medicine and health checkup
      center to develop a user-participation health and disease prevention care system using
      genetic data and lifelog data. From adults who visited a family medicine and health checkup
      center, the following should be performed: (1) collect a variety of clinical information,
      including lifestyle data, physical information, metabolic parameters, genetic information,
      and metagenomes, which can affect chronic diseases; (2) establish a service model that
      combines lifestyle data, examination data, and genetic data and analyzes and identifies one's
      health level through a smartphone application; and (3) examine the effects on the metabolic
      parameters, lifestyle data, and metagenome (gut microbiome) after using the device (smart
      healthcare).This pilot study aimed to provide personalized &quot;my data&quot; by linking clinical data
      and personal lifestyle patterns of the participants who visited a family medicine and
      examination center.

      From adults who visited a family medicine and health check-up center, the following should be

           information, metabolic parameters, genetic information, and metagenomes, which can
           affect chronic diseases
