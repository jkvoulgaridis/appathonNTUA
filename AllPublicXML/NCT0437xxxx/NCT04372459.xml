    <textblock>
      This multicenter randomized controlled study will appraise the effectiveness and cost-utility
      of an e-health ecosystem with integrated and stepped psychosocial services that will be
      compared with the usual psychosocial care. The study is developed in the acute survival phase
      among breast cancer survivors. The outcomes of both interventions will be compared in terms
      of the amount of waiting time to receive psychosocial care and changes in several
      psychosocial variables. Finally, a comparative economic analysis will be conducted in other
      relevant psychosocial and health parameters. The e-health platform is expected to outperform
      usual care in the aforementioned indicators, while reaching high acceptability and usability
      by survivors, and additionally reducing costs for health providers.

    <textblock>
      Cancer diagnosis and treatment causes a huge psychosocial impact on breast cancer survivors.
      Psychosocial treatments in cancer survivors have already demonstrated their effectiveness in
      reducing emotional distress and improving quality of life although the access to them still
      presents important barriers, such as poor early detection, long waiting times for diagnosis
      or treatment, as well as other restrictions related to work, mobility or economic situation.
      In addition, the current digitization of screening, monitoring and psychosocial treatment
      poses a revolution in the improvement of the quality of care and the reduction of its
      economic burden. The objectives of this study are, first, to assess the clinical efficacy of
      an e-health platform that includes integrated and stepped psychosocial services, in
      comparison to usual psychosocial care, and second, to examine its cost-utility.

      The study methodology is that of a multicentre randomised controlled trial with 2 parallel
      groups (experimental versus control group). Approximately 193 patients diagnosed with breast
      cancer in the acute survival phase will be recruited from 3 University hospitals in Catalonia
      (Spain) and will be randomised to one of two treatment conditions. All participants will be
      evaluated at the beginning of the study (T1: recruitment), 3 months from T1 (T2), 6 months
      from T1 (T3) and 12 months from T1 (T4). Primary outcome measures will include detection of
      clinical cases, amount of waiting time from detection to psychosocial intervention, and
      proportion of cases solved in the different steps of the intervention, as well as outcomes
      related to emotional distress, quality of life, post-traumatic stress and growth and
      therapeutic alliance. Secondary outcomes will include the acceptability of the platform by
      patients through satisfaction questionnaires and the usability of the platform. For the
      cost-utility analysis, the investigators will assess quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and
      costs related to the number of days of sick leaves, healthcare utilization, adherence to
      pharmacological treatment, health professionals' costs, infrastructure and transport costs.

      The study will provide an important advance in the treatment of breast cancer; in the long
      term, it is expected to improve the quality of patient care and the treatment efficacy and to
      reduce waiting lists as well as direct and indirect costs associated with the treatment of
      the disease in Spain.

    <description>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) (Zigmond &amp; Snaith, 1983; Spanish validation by Costa-Requena, Pérez Martín, Salamero Baró, &amp; Gil Moncayo, 2009). It consists of 14 items, 7 for anxiety and 7 for depression, on a four-point Likert scale (range 0-3), with the total score ranging from 0 to 42. Higher scores indicate a greater level of distress.</description>

    <description>Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-Civilian version (PCL-5) (Blevins, Weathers, Davis, Witte, &amp; Domino, 2015). The official Spanish translation of the instrument was provided by the National Center for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (www.ptsd.va.gov/). The PCL-5 is a 20-item questionnaire, corresponding to the &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders Version 5&quot; symptom criteria for PTSD. The self-report rating scale is 0-4 for each symptom, reflecting a change from 1-5 in the DSM-IV version. Rating scale descriptors are the same: &quot;Not at all,&quot; &quot;A little bit,&quot; Moderately,&quot; &quot;Quite a bit,&quot; and &quot;Extremely.&quot; A total symptom severity score (range - 0-80) can be obtained by summing the scores for each of the 20 items, with higher scores indicating worse outcomes.</description>

    <description>This program features four levels of care, increasing in intensity of psychosocial care as patients move from one level to the next one.
Step 1: Screening and monitoring of several psychosocial variables through the central mobile application of the program (App ICOnnecta't).
Step 2: Online guided and self-help psychoeducation Campus in which patients can consult videos and online resources, co-constructed between health professionals and patients, containing reliable and rigorous information related to the oncological process.
Step 3: Online community of psychosocial support. Participants can choose from 12 cancer-related discussion forums and share with the community any health-related question that worries them fostering, thus, debate and stimulating peer-support.
Step 4: Intensive online group psychotherapy (App ICOnnecta't Videoconsultation), based on the Group Positive Psychotherapy program for cancer survivors (Ochoa, Sumalla, Maté, Castejón, Rodríguez et al., 2010).</description>
