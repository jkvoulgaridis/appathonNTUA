  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prosthetic joint infections (PJIs) are one of the main causes of implant failure after joint
      arthroplasty. Identification of the causal organism is crucial for successful treatment.
      However, microbiological diagnosis of PJIs remains a challenge notably because bacteria are
      embedded in biofilm adhered to the material. Recently, dithiothreitol (DTT) treatment of
      prosthesis has been proposed as a new strategy to dislodge bacteria from biofilm, thus
      becoming an alternative to sonication to improve the yield of the microbiological diagnosis.

      In this study, the investigators evaluate the interest of a commercial device using DTT, the
      MicroDTTect system (Heraeus, Hanau, Allemagne), for the diagnosis of low-grade chronic PJIs
      compared to the conventional culture of periprosthetic tissue (PPT) samples.

    <description>No specific or supplementary intervention is performed among patients. The included patients have scheduled surgery consisting of prosthesis removal or change. Instead of being discarded, the prosthesis which was removed during the surgery was sent to the laboratory using the MicroDTTect system and bacterial culture was performed with the fluid obtained. Results will be then compared to classical culture of periprosthetic tissues (PPT).</description>
