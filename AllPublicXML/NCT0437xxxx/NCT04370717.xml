  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label cohort study of chronic pain patients referred to an interdisciplinary
      community outpatient clinic. The aim of this study is to determine whether video
      consultations are non-inferior to regular consultations in diagnosing and planning subsequent
      interventions. The null hypothesis is that there is no difference in the International
      Statistical Classification of Diseases 10th edition (ICD-10) codes established via telehealth
      and subsequent clinic visits. The patients will complete standard health questionnaires
      online and undergo a structured and detailed interview to clarify the diagnosis and establish
      appropriate treatment. A limited telehealth physical examination based on direct observation
      will be conducted.

      At the subsequent clinic visit, the accuracy of diagnosis and adherence to the plan of care
      will be evaluated.

      The primary and secondary endpoints will be gathered from the electronic charts and from the
      recruited participants by questionnaires completed online one week after the telemedicine
      consultation. The diagnosis and plan of care semi-structured match will be performed during
      the in-person follow-up visit.

    <description>A telehealth consultation will be scheduled and conducted without modifications from the routine clinic protocol. The case report will include ICD-10 code and plan of care.
After one week, patients will receive an electronic satisfaction survey. An in-person follow-up and/or procedural visit will be subsequently scheduled. During this visit, the same physician will complete physical examination, document the diagnosis and proceed with either the same or modified plan of care. The research coordinator will enter diagnostic and procedural codes in the case report form.</description>
