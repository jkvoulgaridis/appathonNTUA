      The purpose of this study is to examine how effective rituximab or tocilizumab are in
      treating side effects for people who are receiving immunotherapy treatment requiring
      prolonged steroid use.

      Immune-related side effects are caused by the activation of the immune system. Because
      rituximab and tocilizumab have been shown to effectively in treating other diseased that
      involve immune system activation, this study seeks to evaluate how effective they will be in
      treating immune-related side effects in people receiving immunotherapy treatment for cancer.

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of two drugs, either
      rituximab or tocilizumab, in patients who develop side effects while on treatment with
      immunotherapy requiring prolonged steroids. Immune-related side effects are caused by
      activation of the immune system from treatment with immunotherapy. Both rituximab and
      tocilizumab have been given to patients with autoimmune diseases (diseases where the immune
      system is activated against normal organs). Immune-related side effects appear to closely
      mirror these autoimmune conditions.

      Participants in this study have developed an immune-related adverse event while on
      immunotherapy and require a long course of steroids to manage this side effect. Steroids can
      cause many side effects with prolonged use including problems with sleep, weight gain,
      diabetes, muscle loss, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, bone loss, and mood
      disturbances. Drugs such as rituximab and tocilizumab have been shown to be effective in
      other diseases involving immune system activation. This study is evaluating the effectiveness
      of these drugs in patients who have immune-related side effects by their ability to help
      patients discontinue steroids.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        -Patients with histologically confirmed advanced (metastatic or unresectable) solid tumors
        that develop irAEs secondary to treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Diagnostic
        evaluation of irAEs must include agreement between medical oncologist and disease-specific
        subspecialist (e.g. rheumatologist, dermatologist) on therapeutic rationale for either
        rituximab or tocilizumab-based therapy or if evidence-based indications exist as summarized
        below: Dermatologic (bullous pemphigoid, pemphigus vulgaris) - Rituximab. Neurologic
        (autoimmune encephalitis) - Rituximab. Hematologic (immune thrombocytopenia, autoimmune
        hemolytic anemia) -Rituximab. Rheumatologic (rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis)
        -Rituximab/Tocilizumab.

        Renal (autoimmune nephritis) - Rituximab. Pulmonary (pneumonitis) - Tocilizumab. Cardiac
        (autoimmune myocarditis) - Tocilizumab

        -Steroid-dependent, defined as inability to wean less than 10mg of prednisone (or
        equivalent) after 6 weeks of therapy; patients who develop intolerance to steroids (e.g.

        myopathy or hyperglycemia) may be enrolled earlier than 6 weeks at the discretion of the
        treating physician and/or the principal investigator.

          -  Be willing and able to provide written informed consent/assent for the trial.

          -  Be â‰¥ 18 years of age on day of signing informed consent.

          -  Female subject of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy
             within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. If the urine
             test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be
             required.

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential should be willing to use contraception, or
             abstain from heterosexual activity for the course of the study and through 12 months
             after last dose of rituximab or 3 months after last dose of tocilizumab. Subjects of
             childbearing potential are those who have not been surgically sterilized or have not
             been free from menses for &gt; 1 year.

          -  Males must practice true abstinence or agree to use a condom during sexual contact
             with a pregnant female or a female of childbearing potential while participating in

          -  Vaccinations must be completed 4 weeks prior to the first treatment with rituximab or
             must not be taken at least 6 months after the last dose of chemotherapy. Non-live
             vaccines may be given during rituximab treatment; however, patients may experience
             reduced response rates. The safety of live vaccines has not been studied during cancer
             treatment and their use is not recommended unless otherwise advised by the oncologist.

        Subject must be vaccinated with the pneumococcal vaccine at least 4 weeks prior to
        initiation of therapy, unless subject was vaccinated within 5 years of study entry. If
        vaccination occurred greater than 5 years prior to study entry, the subject must be
        revaccinated at least 4 weeks prior to initiation of therapy

        weeks) Note: Patients with cytopenias (e.g immune thrombocytopenia, autoimmune hemolytic
        anemia) clinically consistent with irAE will be eligible at the discretion of principal
        investigator. Patients with hematological values below those stated will not receive
        Tocilizumab aspartate aminotransferase (AST)(SGOT)/ alanine aminotransferase (ALT)(SGPT) â‰¤2
        Ã— institutional upper limit of normal Creatinine clearance of â‰¥ 30 mL/min. Creatinine
        clearance (CrCl) should be calculated at screening using the Cockcroft-Gault formula.

        Performance Scale.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Current participation in or has participated in a study of an investigational agent or
             using an investigational device within 4 weeks of the first dose of treatment.

          -  Diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic immunosuppressive therapy other
             than steroids prior to the first dose of trial treatment

             methotrexate, azathioprine, mycophenolate, cyclosporine, hydroxychloroquine,

             might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's participation
             for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of the subject to
             participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

             are excluded except in situations where the potential benefit is determined to justify
             the risk of possible hepatitis B reactivation, which can be fatal. Patients with
             positive serology should have viral DNA levels checked and a gastrointestinal
             consultation obtained. If treated with rituximab, such patients should be closely
             monitored for clinical and laboratory signs of active hepatitis B virus infection and
             for signs of hepatitis throughout their study participation.
