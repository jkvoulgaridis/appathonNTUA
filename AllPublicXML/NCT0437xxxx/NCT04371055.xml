  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who have suffered a stroke are having an increased risk of having recurrent stroke
      in the future. This risk of stroke is increased by atrial fibrillation, which often &quot;comes
      and goes&quot; (called paroxysmal) and hence escapes routine diagnostics. The hypothesis of
      Find-AF 2 is that enhanced (evaluation in a ECG core lab), prolonged (at least 7 days of
      rhythm monitoring annually) and intensified (continuous rhythm monitoring in high risk
      patients) not only finds atrial fibrillation more often, but that changes in therapeutic
      management (e. g. start of anticoagulation after detection of atrial fibrillation) results in
      a decrease of cardioembolism (which can be either recurrent stroke or systemic embolism).

      To prove this hypothesis, patients will be randomised into two groups: the first group will
      receive the currently available standard care for patients with stroke. In the second group,
      cardiac rhythm monitoring adapted to the risk of the occurrence of atrial fibrillation is
      performed - either with a 7-day long-term ECG (at baseline, after 3 and 12 months and every
      12 months thereafter) or with continuous monitoring using an implantable cardiac monitor. If
      atrial fibrillation is detected, this information will be given to the treating study
      physician. Any therapeutic decision is at the discretion of the treating physician, but
      should follow current guidelines.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Find AF 2 study will investigate whether intensified rhythm monitoring in patients with
      recent ischemic stroke leads to a decrease in recurrent thromboembolism (defined as recurrent
      ischemic stroke or systemic embolism). This will be achieved by identifying patients with
      paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and subsequently switching secondary prevention therapy from
      antiplatelet therapy to oral anticoagulation. The intensity of heart rhythm monitoring will
      be risk-adjusted: Patients with an estimated low risk of atrial fibrillation receive a 7-day
      Holter ECG, which is repeated after 3 and 12 months and annually thereafter. Patients with a
      high risk of atrial fibrillation (defined by increased supraventricular ectopic activity)
      receive continuous ECG monitoring using an implanted loop recorder. The control arm is
      treated according to local standards, which includes cardiac rhythm monitoring for at least
      24 hours according to current guidelines. Prior to randomization, a 24-hour Holter ECG is
      performed in both study arms, ensuring minimal ECG monitoring for patients in the control arm
      and allowing risk stratification in the intervention arm. Additional ECG monitoring using
      stroke telemetry and/or additional Holter ECGs is possible according to local standards,
      provided it does not exceed 7 days. Patients in both study arms will be followed up for at
      least 24 months.

      It should be noted that this study only provides diagnostic information, the therapeutic
      decision is left to the treating physician.
