      Background: Breast cancer rehabilitation has gradually expanded from post-surgery
      rehabilitation to continuous rehabilitation including prehabilitation between cancer
      diagnosis and surgical treatment, post-surgery rehabilitation, and return-to-work/return-home
      interventions. Continuous rehabilitation provides patients with tailored training at each
      treatment period, in order to maintain patients' functions or accelerate the recovery of
      functions, reduce the burden of symptoms, and improve patients' independence and quality of
      life. As the functional rehabilitation needs and lifestyle adjustment needs of each patient's
      life role are different, only with an interprofessional rehabilitation team, patients can
      obtain patient-centered and comprehensive rehabilitation interventions. Interprofessional
      shared decision making (IP-SDM) is an decision-making process that interprofessional team and
      patients discussion the treatment options, based on the best evidence and patient values and
      preferences, to make a patient-centered treatment decision. However, the major barriers of
      the implementation of IP-SDM are the lack of IP-SDM skills of clinicians and the lack of
      medical knowledge of patients.

      Purposes: The project aims (1) to develop a patient-centered continuous and interdisciplinary
      shared decision making approach for breast cancer rehabilitation, including IP-SDM training
      for interprofessional rehabilitation team, as well as decision coaching, patient decision aid
      and question prompt list for patients; and (2) to examine the effects of IP-SDM approach on
      the IP-SDM self-efficacy of interprofessional rehabilitation team and patients, quality of
      IP-SDM process, patients' satisfaction with decision, concordance between preferences and the
      chosen options, patients' upper limb function and health-related quality of life.

      Methods: This 3-year prospective project will be divided into four phases: (1) Exploration of
      the IP-SDM needs of continuous breast cancer rehabilitation: We will interview breast cancer
      patients and consult breast cancer care professionals with different disciplines to
      understand the IP-SDM needs of breast cancer rehabilitation in each treatment period. (2)
      Development of communication and decision aids: An expert panel will develop a mobile
      application prototype of communication and decision aids. The prototype will be testes for
      the understandability and applicability by breast cancer patients. (3) Development of
      decision coaching and IP-SDM training programs: We will consult experts to develop a decision
      coaching training program for breast cancer patients and an IP-SDM training program for
      interprofessional rehabilitation team. (4) Evaluation of the effectiveness of the
      patient-centered continuous and interdisciplinary shared decision making approach for breast
      cancer rehabilitation: We will conduct a parallel-group, single-blinded randomized controlled
      trial and recruit 116 breast cancer patients at Taipei Medical University Hospital to
      evaluate the effectiveness of the IP-SDM approach.

      Expected results and impacts: We expect that the patient-centered continuous and
      interdisciplinary shared decision making approach for breast cancer rehabilitation will
      effectively improve patients' IP-SDM self-efficacy, quality of IP-SDM process, patients'
      satisfaction with decision, concordance between preferences and the chosen options, patients'
      upper limb function and health-related quality of life. In the future, this IP-SDM approach
      will be promising to be applied to other medical institutions and other cancer populations,
      so as to enhance patient-centered, interprofessional and continuous practice in cancer care.

    <description>Control Preference Scale (CPS) is to measure the patients' preferred role whether change in making decisions with the medical provider before intervention and after intervention. It consists of five cards, each of which presents a different character in medical decision-making in a cartoon pattern, and performs a series of comparisons to rank the preference.</description>
