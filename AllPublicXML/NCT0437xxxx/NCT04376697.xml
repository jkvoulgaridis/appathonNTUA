  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, single-arm, open-label feasibility study will assess the safety,
      tolerability, and effectiveness of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in
      patients with major depression (MDD) to test the hypothesis that remission rates can be
      increased by additional treatment sessions.

    <description>Outcome measured by a change in depression score at baseline, before every treatment, and at 1 and 4 weeks post-treatment. A 50% improvement in the score is considered a response to rTMS. A score of 12 or less is categorized as remission.</description>

    <description>Outcome measured by a change in depression score from baseline (week prior to treatment) to 1 week and 4 weeks post-treatment. A 50% improvement in the score is considered a response to rTMS. A score of 7 or less is categorized as remission.</description>

             medication pump

          -  have active suicidal intent

          -  have a diagnosis of any personality disorder, and assessed by a study investigator to
             be primary and causing greater impairment than MDD

          -  have a diagnosis of any psychotic disorder

          -  have any significant neurological disorder or insult including, but not limited to:
             any condition likely to be associated with increased intracranial pressure, space
             occupying brain lesion, any history of seizure confirmed diagnostically by
             neurological assessment (except those therapeutically induced by ECT), cerebral
             aneurysm, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's chorea, dementia, stroke, neurologically
             confirmed diagnosis of traumatic brain injury, or multiple sclerosis.

          -  if participating in psychotherapy, must have been in stable treatment for at least 3
             months prior to entry into the study, with no anticipation of change in the frequency
             of therapeutic sessions, or the therapeutic focus over the duration of the study

          -  clinically significant laboratory abnormality, in the opinion of the investigator

          -  currently (or in the last 4 weeks) take more than lorazepam 4 mg daily (or equivalent)
             or any dose of an anticonvulsant due to the potential to limit rTMS efficacy

          -  non-correctable clinically significant sensory impairment (i.e., cannot hear well
             enough to cooperate with interview)
