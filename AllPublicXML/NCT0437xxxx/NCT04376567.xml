  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The absence of reliable data to establish the optimal surgical approach for creating a new
      Brachial Basilic Arteriovenous Fistula (BBAVF) has resulted in high degree of treatment
      equipoise and the decision to use one-stage or two-stage approach is largely based on
      surgeon's preference. The pilot trial will provide a framework for an evidence-based surgical
      approach to create a BBAVF for patients receiving renal replacement therapy. The pragmatic
      trial design will allow the inclusion of different surgical techniques currently used by the
      access surgeons to create a new BBAVF. Subjects in whom randomly assigned approach (one-stage
      or two-stage) is not completed will be considered appropriately treated as intended to
      account for the risk of primary fistula failure. The investigator will use the
      patient-centric clinical endpoints and patient reported outcomes (PROs) to incorporate the
      perspective of patients undergoing complex The goal is to prospectively evaluate the impact
      of the one-stage and two-stage BBAVF approaches on qualitative quality of life (QOL) in order
      to address the knowledge gap within the existing literature on complex arterovenous fistula
      (AVF) procedures. The investigator will use the NIH-sponsored Patient-Reported Outcome
      Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) tool to evaluate
      self-reported measures for functions, symptoms, behaviors, and feelings following the BBAVF
      procedure

      Primary Aim: To compare the primary endpoint event rates in patients with ESRD and candidates
      for a new BBAVF randomized to have one-stage or two-stage BBAVF procedure.

      Primary Endpoint: Primary Clinical Functional Patency, defined as the successful use of the
      index BBAVF with two needles for 75% of dialysis sessions over a continuous 4-week period
      without any endovascular or surgical procedure on the fistula (modified from the HFM
      study).Time to first occurrence of a qualifying clinical event will be compared utilizing
      follow-up at 6-month and 12-month after fistula creation (minimum of 12-month/subject).

      Secondary Aims: To compare the secondary endpoints (Fistula-related, CVC-related, and
      composite clinicaloutcomes) of subjects randomizing to one-stage or two-stage BBAVF
      procedure. CVC-related events will be calculated from the index procedure in the one-stage
      approach and the first procedure for the two-stage BBAVF approach.

      Secondary Endpoints: 1) Fistula-related outcome: stenosis and thrombosis, infection, arm
      swelling, hand ischemia, surgery or intervention, and hospitalization; 2) CVC-related
      outcome: duration of dependency, infection, bacteremia, and additional CVC procedure
      (exchange, placement of new CVC); and 3) Composite outcomes of Primary Clinical Functional
      Patency or CVC-related bacteremia or death.

      Hypothesis: Primary Clinical Functional Patency will be superior following two-stage compared
      to one-stage BBAVF procedure. CVC-related complications will be higher following two-stage
      compared to one-stage BBAVf procedure the investigator will recruit 60 subjects aged 18 years
      or older with ESRD who will undergo a BBAVF. Thirty subjects will be randomized in the
      one-stage approach and 30 subjects in the two-stage approach. The expectation for enrollment
      is 1 subject/month/site, and the recruitment period will be for 12 months.

      Inclusion criteria (all must be present for inclusion): 1. Age ≥ 18 years; 2. ESRD receiving
      hemodialysis (CVC) in need for new hemodialysis access; 3. Candidate for one-stage and
      two-stage BVT procedure as judged by the enrolling investigator; 4. Greater than 3 mm
      diameter of upper arm basilic vein on venous duplex scan; 5.Life expectancy ≥ 12 months; 6.
      Anticipated ability to comply with study procedures;

      Exclusion criteria (none of these can be met for inclusion):

        1. Life expectancy &lt; 12 months;

        2. Brachial artery stenosis or occlusion;

        3. A documented hypercoagulable state (defined as a known blood disorder associated with
           venous or arterial thrombosis);

        4. Current immunosuppressive medication, chemotherapy or radiation therapy;

        5. Pregnancy or lactation
