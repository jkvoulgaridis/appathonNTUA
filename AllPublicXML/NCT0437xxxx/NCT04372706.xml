      Open label, multicenter, multidose, first-in-human Phase 1/2 study of RTX-240 for the
      treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory or locally advanced solid tumors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2, open label, multicenter, multidose, first-in-human (FIH) dose escalation
      and expansion to determine the safety and tolerability, recommended phase 2 dose and optimal
      dosing interval, pharmacology, and antitumor activity of RTX-240 in adult patients with
      relapsed/refractory or locally advanced solid tumors. RTX-240 is a cellular therapy that
      co-expresses 4-1BBL and IL-15TP, a fusion of IL-15 and IL-15 receptor alpha, with the goal of
      harnessing the innate and adaptive immune systems for the treatment of cancer. The study will
      include a monotherapy dose escalation phase followed by an expansion phase in specified tumor
      types.
