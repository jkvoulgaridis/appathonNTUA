      The main objective of the present prospective study is to evaluate the effectiveness of
      posterior zirconia FDPs after 14 years of function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      thirty-seven patients needing to replace either premolars or molars were involved and 48
      3-unit zirconia-based FDPs were fabricated. Patients included in the present clinical study
      met specific inclusion criteria and clinical procedures were standardized.

      Frameworks with a 9 mm2 cross section of the connectors and 0.6 mm minimum thickness of the
      retainers were made by means of Computer Aided Design/Computer Assisted Manufacturing. A
      resin cement was used to lute the restorations. The patients were recalled after 6 and 12
      months and then yearly up to a total follow-up of 14 years. The United States Public Health
      Service criteria were used in order to examine technical and esthetic outcomes. Success and
      survival rates

        In the present prospective clinical study, 37 patients (16 males, 21 females) needing at
        least 1 posterior FDP in the maxillary and/or the mandibular arches were recruited. The
        mean age of patients was 45.3 ± 11.6 years, with a minimum age of 21 and a maximum of 68
        years. All patients were recruited at the Department of Prosthodontics of the University
        &quot;Federico II&quot; of Naples (Italy) from November 2004 to April 2005 (baseline) and provided a
        written informed consent

          -  proper positioning in the dental arch (tooth axes adequate for a FDP);

          -  sufficient occlusal-cervical height of the clinical crown (≥4 mm) for the retention of
             a FDP;

          -  vital or endodontically treated to a clinically sound state;

          -  opposing natural teeth or fixed prostheses.

        Exclusion Criteria:- subjects preferring implant-supported prostheses;
