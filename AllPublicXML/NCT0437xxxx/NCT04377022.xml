  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is one of the major cause of morbidity and mortality and the leading cause of
      disability in adults all around the world. Stroke survivors can suffer several neurological
      impairments and deficits which have an important impact on patient's quality of life and
      which increase the costs for health and social services. After stroke, impairments in ADLs
      and functional status, deterioration in health related quality of life can be seen.

      The purpose of this study is to Determine the effect of Aerobic exercise training on Balance,
      Walking capacity and quality of life in sub-acute stroke.
