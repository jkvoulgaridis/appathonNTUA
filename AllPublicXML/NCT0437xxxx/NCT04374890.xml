      The aim of the study is to evaluate if the new supporting product influences wear time. It is
      the expectation that median wear time is slightly reduced in the period when subjects are
      using the supporting product with their ostomy appliance. Long-term benefits of the test
      product may be less skin redness, less worry of leakage and/or improvement in quality of life
      and social activities.
