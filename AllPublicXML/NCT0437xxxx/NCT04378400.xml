      An institutional audit of the short term complications and long term outcomes of patients
      undergoing laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy for vault/cervical prolapse.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to audit the outcomes of laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy procedures done
      in our unit. The investigators aim to permanently monitor outcomes of this procedure
      correcting vaginal vault prolapse or cervical descent. Auditing institutional performance
      with pelvic floor procedures is increasingly being required by (inter)national societies in
      pelvic floor medicine, so that patients can be counseled on outcomes they can expect at a
      given institution.

      Sacrocolpopexy is offered to patients with symptomatic prolapse (≥stage II) of the vaginal
      apex (vault or cervix). The procedure involves dissection of the promontory and the vaginal
      vault, suturing of two meshes to the anterior and posterior aspect of the vagina using
      minimally three rows of sutures on each side, and one row at the apex. Thereafter the mesh is
      fixed with staples to the promontory and the peritoneum closed, with staples and a running
      suture.

      The investigators started auditing this procedure 20 years ago because of the conversion to
      laparoscopy.

      High anatomical and subjective cure rates are reported on the medium term (range 12-60
      months), though long-term data (60 months or longer) are scarce and most studies focus on
      anatomical outcomes.4 The investigators recently published medium term outcomes of patients
      operated up to 2014 1. Now the aim is to extend this audit to patients operated since 2014
      and install a process of permanent monitoring our performance with this operation. The
      investigators also want to use the availability of outcomes in large numbers and/or the long
      term, to detect potential rare or long term complications, and study the effects of small
      technical increments such as extending dissections, associate other pelvic floor
      reconstructive procedures or the change in bio-materials used for this operation. All these
      may affect outcome.

      Primary outcome is a subjective outcome, using a patient-centered approach and report patient
      reported out-comes. Additional outcomes such as anatomical failure, or complications, both by
      occurrence and time point, re-interventions, and pelvic floor functional outcomes are
      secondary outcomes that allows the investigators to benchmark their performance to previous
      studies and other series. Key in an objective assessment process is that patients are
      examined by an experienced clinician not involved in the management, which will also be used
      herein.

    <measure>Subjective Success Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 10 years postoperative</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective Success assessed by the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGI-C) tool, which is a 5-point Likert scale, where the patients are asked the following question at the follow up visit: &quot;Compared with how you were doing before your recent pelvic floor operation, would you say that now you are: &quot;much better&quot;, &quot;a little better&quot;, &quot;about the same&quot;, &quot;a little worse&quot; or &quot;much worse&quot;.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective success</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 10 years postoperative</time_frame>
    <description>Objective Success will be defined as: achievement of a POP-Q score Stage ≤1, without re-intervention for POP or graft related complication at approximately 12 months.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Postoperative complications</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 10 years postoperative</time_frame>
    <description>Occurrence of operative complications: classified as either intra-operative or postoperative (within 3 months of operation), and according to the Dindo classification, as we earlier did.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Reintervention rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 10 years postoperative</time_frame>
    <description>Reintervention for prolapse as well as its compartment, at any time point during follow up. The time point of reintervention will be a variable per se.</description>

    <measure>Postoperative graft related complications (GRC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 10 years postoperative</time_frame>
    <description>Postoperative graft related complications (GRC) out of a (non-limitative) list of de novo dyspareunia, worsening of pre-existing dyspareunia, incidence of chronic pain, occurrence of exposure, extrusion or any other complication and any reintervention because of the above. GRC will be categorized according to the IUGA classification</description>

    <measure>Prolapse Quality of Life (P-QoL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 10 years postoperative</time_frame>
    <description>P-QoL: self-reported severity of symptoms in patients with urogenital prolapse and their impact on 9 different quality of life domains with scores for each domain, ranging between 0 and 100. Higher scores indicate a greater impairment of quality of life. This has been validated for the Flemish population</description>

        Since our last audit (April 30, 2014), we have operated on more than probably another 250
        patients, who will be contacted. Based on our previous experience, we expect a 85% response
        rate.
