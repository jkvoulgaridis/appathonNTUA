  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PD-1/PD-L1 blockades have attracted much attention in the treatment of lung cancer, however
      only a small set of patients can benefit from this kind of immunotherapy. At present, the
      expression level of PD-L1 is the major factor to evaluate the prognosis，, which is highly
      dependent on the quality of tissue samples and detection methods.Therefore, finding
      predictive markers,especially based on liquid biopsy, to screen the patients who will benefit
      most from PD-1/PD-L1 blockades is an urgent issue in immunotherapy for lung cancer. Tumor
      autoantibodies, as immune response products of the immune system to tumor antigens, are of
      great significance in tumor diagnosis. Till now, the relationship between tumor
      autoantibodies and immunotherapy efficacy has not been reported. In this study, 200 non-small
      cell lung cancer patients will be enrolled with baseline serum tumor autoantibodies
      detection, then treated with PD-1 blockade. The purpose of this study is to explore the
      correlations of serum autoantibodies expression and efficacy of PD-1 inhibitor, so that to
      identify new markers for predicting the efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy in non-small
      cell lung cancer.

        Patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer, PD-L1 expression ≥1%, EGFR/ALK/ROS1 wild
        type will be studied. The serum autoantibodies will be detected before PD-1 blockade
        treatment.
