  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal is to investigate the 180 min postprandial response on blood glucose and insulin
      levels after intake of Pep2Dia® in two different dosages compared to placebo in the context
      of a meal challenge test, providing 75 g of carbohydrates. Pep2Dia® will be administered 15
      min prior to a standardized challenge meal.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      From a previous pilot study (BTS1130/17) there is first evidence that the native whey product
      with alpha-glucosidase inhibiting properties (Pep2Dia®) has the potential to modulate
      postprandial hyperglycaemia in prediabetic subjects.

      Thereby, incremental areas under the curve (iAUC) of glucose as the primary outcome were
      significantly reduced by a single dosage of 1400 mg Pep2Dia® compared to placebo the second
      study is to investigate the 180 min postprandial response on blood glucose and insulin levels
      after intake of Pep2Dia® in two different dosages compared to placebo in the context of a
      meal challenge test, providing 75 g of carbohydrates. Pep2Dia® will be administered 15 min
      prior to a standardized challenge meal. Furthermore, the 120 min postprandial incretin
      response in terms of Glucagon-like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) will be determined. Changes in insulin
      sensitivity will be determined by the Matsuda-index as appropriate outcome measure.
