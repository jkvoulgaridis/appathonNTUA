      To date, the investigators lack characterization of, the burden of, and the systemic
      progression of disease in ENPP1 deficiency and ABCC6 deficiency from a patient and/or parent
      perspective. This study aims to document this characterization, progression as well as the
      burden of disease. Link to the study registration-

      This will be a comprehensive, cross-sectional study conducted in approximately 60 individuals
      (or representative parents of patients) affected by ENPP1 deficiency and the acute form of
      ABCC6 deficiency. All study participants will complete the RSVP, PRO tools and upload a proof
      of disease form, followed by an interview conducted by a trained interviewer. It is estimated
      that each respondent will need up to 60 minutes for the entire process; 20 minutes to
      complete the RSVP, PRO tools and to upload proof of diagnosis of ENPP1 deficiency or the
      acute form of ABBC6 deficiency, and approximately 40 minutes to complete the interview and
      address any follow-up questions if needed.

        60 participants across four groups; person or parent/legal guardian affected by ENPP1 (GACI
        or ARHR2) or the acute form of ABCC6 def. described below;

          -  Acute infantile ENPP1 def. (due to the high infant mortality, this group likely to
             include parents of affected children, both living and deceased)

          -  Acute infantile ABCC6 def. (due to the high infant mortality, this group likely to
             include parents of affected children, both living and deceased)

          -  Progressive pediatric ENPP1 def. who are still growing (note; due to the age of those
             who are still growing, this group is likely to include parents of affected children)

          -  Adult ENPP1 def. who are no longer growing (note: due to the age of those who are no
             longer growing, this group is likely to include both patients &gt; age 18 years and
             parents of affected children who are &lt; age 18 years or who are unable to answer for
             themselves)
