  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many patients with genu valgum present with postural changes, such as: internal rotation of
      the tibial and femoral axes, anteversion of the iliac bones, increased lumbar lordosis,
      thoracic hyperkyphosis and cervical hyperlordosis. Such pathomechanical changes may interfere
      with lumbar range of motion. Investigators of this study try to answer the following
      question: is there a relationship between sacral angle and lumbar range of motion in women
      with bilateral genu valgum. the results of this study will help professionals to plan a
      proper treatment program for patients with genu valgum.

      Sixty four female participants were under the following procedures:

        -  Screening for genu valgum via postural assessment from frontal view, then measuring the
           Q angle bilaterally.

        -  Patients with Q-angle &gt;20 degress were under the following procedures:

      A. Full-Length AP standing X-ray,then the investigators measured the hip-knee angle (the
      angle between the mechanical axis of the femur and the tibia). It will be obtained by
      connecting the center of the femoral head to the midpoint of the tibial eminential spine in a
      line tangential to the femoral condyles, and another line from here to the centre of the
      trochlea tali.

      B-Lumbo-sacral X-ray lateral view was done at the time and the sacral angle was the measured
      by Ferguson´s technique in degrees using a protractor and this was the sacral angle.

      C- During the same session, trunk range of motion was measured by Modified schober test D-
      Collected data were taken for statistical analysis.

    <description>After X-ray lateral view for lumbo-sacral spine, the investigators used a 30 cm long transparent ruler to measure the sacral angle on the X-ray film.
Two lines were drawn, the first line along the superior margin of the sacrum, and the second line was the horizontal line.
The acute angle between 2 lines(sacral angle) was measured in degrees using a protractor.</description>

    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Patient was directed to stand with the back exposed.
Dimples of Venus (posterior superior iliac spine) was determined and was marked by pertinent marker.
Using tape measurement, the researcher marked a point 5 cm below and 10 cm above marked dimples (total marked area was 15 cm).
Then the subject was asked to lean forward without bending the knees.
The distance between 2 points was measured (D), then the ROM was determined by the following equation; ROM = D -15.</description>
