  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study focuses on the relational characteristics of the family and their
      evolution in the course of family therapy, through the evolution of the family alliance
      (degree of coordination achieved by its members to perform a task) and co-parenting (support
      that the mother and father give each other in their roles as parents), assuming that the
      family therapy allows the improvement of these two aspects. The family alliance is evaluated
      via a standardized observation situation (Lausanne Family Play LFP adapted from the Lausanne
      Trilogy Play LTP) whose sessions are filmed. The alliance assessment is carried out by the
      coding and scales of the FASS (Family Alliance Assessment Scales,) tool during viewing.

    <time_frame>At baseline</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire concerns thoughts and emotions that family members may have towards each other and is intended to assess the degree of hostility of the parent towards the patient. Each item is rated according to its frequency, ranging from 4 (daily) to 0 (never). There are 20 &quot;negative&quot; items (they refer to the parent's criticism of the patient and the burden they feel because of the patient) and 10 &quot;positive&quot; items (the patient's affection and positive feelings).</description>

    <measure>Dyadic Adjustment Scale (DAS)</measure>

    <description>This is a scale widely used in research, validated in French (Antoine et al, 2008).
It is composed of 16 items that explore two dimensions of the conjugal relationship: -the first dimension concerns the &quot;degree of agreement in the couple&quot;, it is composed of 10 items relating to areas of divergence (divorce, annoyance) or convergence (common goals, joint attitude in relations with the environment). There are also items of affective expression, consensus and satisfaction. -The second dimension consists of six items and corresponds to the &quot;quality of the dyadic interactions&quot;: the domains and the behaviors of exchange and partnership in the couple.</description>

    <measure>The questionnaire on the developmental stages of families</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline</time_frame>
    <description>This is a questionnaire developed by Marie France Bradley and Robert Pauzé.It was conceived according to the developmental hypothesis of the family, which must, throughout its life cycle, go through a number of stages, namely: the departure from the house of the young single adult, the formation of the couple, the arrival of the children, the entry of children into adolescence, the departure of children from the family, the retirement of parents. For each of these steps, the family needs to reorganize. This instrument seeks to assess whether the developmental tasks they face have been carried out with more or less difficulty.</description>

    <measure>The questionnaire on the developmental stages of families</measure>
    <time_frame>at month 9</time_frame>
    <description>We decided to pass only the part about the family with teenagers. This part contains 43 items, corresponding to developmental tasks divided into 7 categories (support for the autonomy and responsibility of the adolescent, redefining the power of the parents vis-à-vis the adolescent, support for socialisation, support for the identity and personal development of the adolescent, impact of adolescence on the parental couple, multiple demands in adolescence and new issues in adolescence).</description>

    <intervention_name>Lausanne Trilogy Play</intervention_name>
    <description>Trilogical game of Lausanne (&quot;Lausanne Trilogue Play&quot; in English abbreviated LTP), which allows an evaluation of the family alliance. This systematic observation provides a &quot;snapshot&quot; of the family structure and its adaptive abilities. It is based on the assumption that the ability to solve &quot;small&quot; tasks is representative of the ability to solve more important tasks.The LTP consists of modelling the different possibilities of interaction in a triad according to a four-part scenario: 1) one parent plays with the child, the other parent is simply present; 2) the parents switch roles; 3) both parents play together with the child; and 4) both parents have to talk together.</description>

    <description>Lausanne Family Play (LFP) is a game situation adapted to families with more than one child. Thus, like the LTP, the LFP takes place in four phases:1) one parent plays with siblings while the other is in a third-observer position; 2) the parents reverse their roles;3) children play while parents are talking and 4) family members play together.</description>
