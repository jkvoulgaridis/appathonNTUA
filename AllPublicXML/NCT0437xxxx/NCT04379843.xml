  <brief_summary>

      To evaluate whether utilizing a standardized patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) treatment
      algorithm in managing ELBW (extremely low birth weight) neonates ≤1000 grams (g) improves
      clinical outcomes and helps prevent undesirable side effects from PDAs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of PDAs (patent ductus arteriosus) in both the premature and term neonatal
      population has been the source of thorough research for decades. Common treatment pathways
      include supportive care, pharmaceutical treatment (via indomethacin, ibuprofen, or
      acetaminophen), and surgical correction. Many PDAs self-resolve, some are not detected to
      adulthood, and others may never be discovered. However, determining which neonates with PDAs
      require pharmaceutical versus surgical management, and which can be managed with supportive
      care, can be difficult to differentiate. A standardized neonatal PDA treatment algorithm, one
      that assesses clinical significance, echocardiogram findings, and systemic PDA effects, and
      one that recommends the optimal treatment course based on these findings, would be helpful in
      medical management of neonatal PDAs in the ELBW (extremely low birth weight) population.

        Approximately 100-125 infants ≤1000g with a PDA are born or admitted each year between the
        BUMCP and CCMC NICUs. Including ELBW neonates over a space of four years will yield a
        sample size of up to 500, which should be large enough determine how effective the PDA
        algorithm has been.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients admitted to the BUMCP and CCMC NICUs with a birth weight ≤1000g and an
             echocardiogram-confirmed PDA, regardless of GA.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have serious comorbidities that are not directly related to their
             symptomatic PDA will be excluded (chromosomal abnormalities, serious kidney pathology,
             other hemodynamically significant heart defects, or serious comorbidities at the
             researcher's discretion). This will allow the researchers to better determine the
             efficacy of the treatment algorithm, without the results being confounded by unusual
             comorbidities.
