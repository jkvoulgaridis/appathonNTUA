  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) dissection should be performed cranio-caudally in TOETVA
      approach.The aim of this study was to compare the cranio-caudal and lateral approach for RLN
      dissection in regard with the rates of LOS during conventional thyroidectomy using continuous
      intraoperative nerve monitoring (CIONM).

      During the thyroid surgery, the identification of the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) and the
      dissection through its entry point is still the gold standard in prevention of the nerve
      injury and to decrease the RLN palsy rate. Intraoperative nerve monitoring (IONM) has also so
      many benefits to search, identify and dissect the nerve through its course during thyroid
      surgery and especially the most important benefit of the IONM is to have real time
      information about the function of the RLN. Most of the endocrine surgeons use the
      inferolateral approach for RLN identification under the guidance of the IONM in the recent
      years. However after the definition of the transoral endoscopic thyroidectomy vestibular
      approach (TOETVA) technique, the approach to the RLN have to be changed to craniocaudal
      approach in which a way that most of the surgeons are not familiar with. The different
      approaches of the recurrent laryngeal nerve depend on the indications and on the surgeon's
      habit. Several approaches exist such as the superior approach ,the lateral approach, and the
      inferior approach.

    <masking_description>Computer generated random numbers were generated and printed on cards. These cards were placed in sealed, opaque envelopes. On the morning of operation, one envelope was opened before the operation and, depending of the parity of the number, RLN's of the patient were dissected either by cranio-caudal or lateral dissection during the operation.</masking_description>

    <description>Following the ligation of upper pole vessels, the thyroid lobe lobe was pulled anteromedially and the RLN was dissected within the carotid triangle at the level of inferior thyroid artery. The tissue between the carotid artery and the trachea was dissected gently parallel to the direction of the nerve until the nerve is identified visually and,or by hand held stimulation probe. After the identification of RLN, the vessels of inferior thyroid lobe was ligated. The nerve was dissected along its course to the entry point, and then the thyroid lobe was totally dissected from the trachea and the lobectomy was completed. If adverse EMG changes were encountered during lateral approach, traction was released immediately and waited for recovery.</description>

    <description>Following the ligation of upper pole vessels, the upper pole was retracted antero-medially to expose crico-pharyngeal muscle. The RLN nerve was identified at the point of entry both visually and with hand held stimulation probe. The RLN dissection was proceeded craniocaudally by the division of the suspensory ligaments of the berry through the level of inferior thyroid artery. After the identification and visualitzation of the RLN through its whole course, the medial and inferior vessels of the thyroid gland were dissected and ligated. Then, the lobe was dissected from the trachea and lobectomy was completed.</description>
