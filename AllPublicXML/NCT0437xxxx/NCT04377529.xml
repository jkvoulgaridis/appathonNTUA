  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is global recognition in clinical guidelines and governing bodies that low back pain
      (LBP) should be managed with a biopsychosocial approach. Despite this, research indicates
      that physiotherapists, who treat the majority of LBP patients in the community, do not feel
      confident in using this treatment approach. Previous work to support implementation in this
      field has resulted in low uptake and has highlighted several barriers to implementation,
      including the need for additional ongoing support. The use of a local champion to support
      implementation has been successful in other fields and thus, represents a viable strategy to
      explore. Before undertaking a fully powered trial to evaluate the effectiveness of a champion
      for implementation, a pilot study is being conducted to determine the feasibility of the
      intervention as well as determining the feasibility of using a cluster randomised controlled
      trial to evaluate it.

      In this study, a pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial design will be used with an
      embedded qualitative interview study. Physiotherapists will be recruited who manage LBP in
      any publicly funded physiotherapy departments within Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada.
      Individual sites will be grouped into clusters based on their number of full-time
      physiotherapists, geography, and organisational relationships. All participants will be asked
      to complete a previously developed online training course to upskill them to deliver a
      biopsychosocial evidence-based intervention for LBP. Clusters randomised to receive a local
      champion will receive additional support from their champion. A basic champion training
      package has been developed based on known barriers in the literature. This will be tailored
      by co-developing aspects with study champions based on a comprehensive assessment of
      perceived implementation barriers using the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) and the
      Capability, Opportunity, Motivation and Behaviour (COM-B) model. A range of
      physiotherapist-level outcomes pre-post training will be measured and implementation of the
      evidence based biopsychosocial intervention will be monitored during a 6-month period after
      completion of the online training. After this 6-month period, a purposive sample of
      physiotherapists from each cluster who had both implemented and failed to implement the
      biopsychosocial intervention will be interviewed.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Any publicly funded physiotherapy department within Newfoundland and Labrador working
             with adult patients with LBP are eligible to participate.

          -  Clinical leads need to be able to identify at least one champion at each site should
             they be allocated to the champion arm. We defined a champion as a physiotherapist in
             the musculoskeletal outpatient department who i) could commit the additional time for
             training, ii) would be willing to provide support to their peers at the sites within
             their cluster and iii) demonstrates enthusiasm about intervention to manager.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Physiotherapy departments who do not treat adult patients with LBP will be excluded.
