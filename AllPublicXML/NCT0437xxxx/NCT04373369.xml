    <description>Progression-free survival is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first.
Progressive disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study.) In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression.)
Kaplan-Meier product limit estimator will be used to estimate progression-free survival (PFS) at 6 months, with the inclusion of 90% confidence interval.</description>
