  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will compare the outcome of complete pulpotomy in mature permanent mandibular
      molars with deep carious lesions by using Mineral Trioxide Aggregate and Simvastatin -alpha
      tricalcium phosphate as medicament agent
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After a thorough history, clinical and radiographic examination with all eligibility
      confirmation, written informed consent will be taken from the patient after explaining the
      procedure, its associated risks and benefits. Clinical diagnosis of reversible pulpitis will
      be established. Complete pulpotomy will be done in both groups. Mineral Trioxide Aggregate
      and Simvastatin -alpha tricalcium phosphate will be used as pulpotomy agents. Pain analysis
      will be carried out preoperatively and postoperatively at every 6 hours for 1 day and then
      every 24 hours till 7 days after the intervention. All the subjects will be followed up for
      evaluation of clinical and radiographic success at 3, 6 months and 1 year.
