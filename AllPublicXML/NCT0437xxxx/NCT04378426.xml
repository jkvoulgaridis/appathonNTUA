  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) seriously disrupts the lives of many Veterans. Current
      first-line treatments, serotonin reuptake inhibitors or prolonged exposure therapy, take
      weeks to months to bring meaningful improvement, leaving Veterans experiencing prolonged
      suffering. A promising new treatment approach for rapidly reducing PTSD symptoms is nitrous
      oxide, an inhalation anesthetic and putative glutamate modulator that diminishes depression
      symptoms within 1 day and has limited side effects. If shown to be similarly effective in
      PTSD, nitrous oxide may add dramatically to the treatment armamentarium by bringing rapid
      symptom decrease before longer-term therapies take hold. The proposed projects test the
      efficacy of nitrous oxide in relieving Veteran's PTSD symptoms and, in parallel, explore how
      nitrous oxide may modify cognitive and pain outcomes.

      The proposed projects will examine the efficacy of nitrous oxide in relieving Veteran's PTSD
      symptoms and in parallel, explore whether nitrous oxide improves cognitive and pain outcomes.
      Specifically, the investigators will first assess whether nitrous oxide treatment improves
      PTSD symptoms within 1 week. In parallel, the investigators will explore whether the
      treatment improves co-existing depression and pain. In addition, the investigators will
      explore nitrous oxide's effects on a PTSD-associated impairment that is often overlooked -
      disruption in cognitive control, a core neurobiological process critical for regulating
      thoughts and for successful daily functioning.

    <masking_description>Blinding Protections: First, the investigators will separate personnel and location of the team providing study drug from the team performing psychiatric evaluations. Independent evaluators (IEs) blind to treatment assignment will assess participants . Second, records for drug administration will be kept separate from psychiatric assessment case report forms until completion of the study. Third, all participants will be blinded as to the nature of the inhaled gas and IV drug at each session; all participants will be informed that they will receive either nitrous oxide and IV saline or an air mixture with a high nitrogen component and IV midazolam. Integrity of the blinding will be assessed by recording each patient's guess as to which drug was received.</masking_description>

    <measure>Improvement in the severity of PTSD as measured by the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale DSM5 (CAPS-5)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>Improvement in PTSD severity is measured by the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale DSM-5 (CAPS-5). measures frequency and intensity of PTSD-related symptoms. For the CAPS-5 the minimum units are 0 and maximum units are the total scale are 80. The higher the number on the CAPS-5, the more severe the PTSD symptoms. Response is defined as a change in the CAPS-5 of at least 12 points, which represents meaningful improvement in clinical PTSD symptoms.</description>
