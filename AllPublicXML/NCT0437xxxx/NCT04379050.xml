  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurological condition, which affects the brain. PD gets worse
      over time, but how quickly it progresses varies a lot from person to person. Some symptoms of
      PD are tremors, stiffness, and slowness of movement. The purpose of this study is to continue
      testing whether ABBV-951 is safe, effective, and tolerable in participants with Parkinson's
      disease after completion of the parent study M15-741.

      ABBV-951 is an investigational (unapproved) drug containing levodopa phosphate/carbidopa
      phosphate (LDP/CDP) given as infusion under the skin for the treatment of Parkinson's
      Disease. Participants who have successfully completed M15-741 study will immediately enter
      this study's treatment period to continue receiving ABBV-951. Adult participants with
      advanced PD will be enrolled. Approximately 130 adult participants will be enrolled in the
      study at approximately 65 sites worldwide.

      Participants will receive continuous subcutaneous infusion (CSCI) of ABBV-951 for 24 hours
      daily for 96 weeks or until premature discontinuation.

      There may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their
      standard of care. Participants will attend regular clinic visits and have remote assessments
      completed via phone calls during the course of the study. The effect of the treatment will be
      checked by medical assessments, blood tests, checking for side effects, and completing
      questionnaires.

    <time_frame>Up To Week 96</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. The investigator assesses the relationship of each event to the use of the study drug or device as either reasonable possibility or no reasonable possibility. A serious adverse event (SAE) is an event that results in death, is life-threatening, requires or prolongs hospitalization, results in a congenital anomaly, persistent or significant disability/incapacity or is an important medical event that, based on medical judgment, may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed above. Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI) - polyneuropathy, weight loss, hallucinations/psychosis, and somnolence will be monitored throughout the study.</description>

    <description>The Infusion Site Evaluation Scale will be used to assess infusion sites. Infusion Site Evaluation Scale is an eight-point numeric scale used to assess irritation at the infusion site area (0 being &quot;no evidence of irritation&quot; and 7 being &quot;strong reaction spreading beyond the test site&quot;).</description>
