    <textblock>
      Survival and success rates of all-ceramic implant-supported fixed reconstructions fabricated
      with CAD/CAM technology after at least one year in function.

      Survival and success rates (clinical, radiologic and esthetic) of all-ceramic
      implant-supported fixed reconstructions fabricated with CAD/CAM technology after 2 to 10
      years in function.

      Establishment of a database of patients with all-ceramic implant-supported fixed
      reconstructions fabricated with CAD/CAM technology for future longitudinal retrospective
      studies.
