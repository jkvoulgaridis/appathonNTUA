  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II treatment, non-randomized, open label clinical trial to study the efficacy
      of the Cetuximab when administered as single agent in recurrent/ metastatic head and neck
      squamous cell carcinoma after the failure or intolerance of immuno-oncology or
      immuno-oncology combined with chemotherapy.

      Primary Objective:

      • To measure Overall Response Rate to treatment with Cetuximab as single agent following
      treatment with immunotherapy with PD-1 inhibitors alone or in combination with chemotherapy.

      Secondary Objective(s):

        -  Measure Duration of Response (DUR), Progression Free Survival and Overall Survival and
           for treatment with single agent Cetuximab after immunotherapy with PD-1 inhibitors in
           Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma.

        -  Evaluate treatment toxicity with single agent Cetuximab in this patient population.

      Exploratory Objectives:

      I. Evaluate the early positron emission tomography (PET) scan ability to predict tumor
      response.

      II. Collect quality of life (QOL) data on patient reported outcomes every six weeks and
      examine this data for overall tolerability of this treatment.

      III. Bank saliva and blood for future studies of biomarkers. IV. Correlate treatment response
      with human papillomavirus (HPV) and smoking status.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive cetuximab intravenously (IV) over 60-120 minutes once every week in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 week and then every 6-8
      weeks thereafter.

    <measure>Change in Overall Response Rate To Treatment with Cetuximab</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days before start of treatment, 7 weeks after start of treatment, and then every 6-8 weeks for the duration of treatment, up to approximately 2 years.</time_frame>
    <description>Response to treatment with Cetuximab as a single agent following treatment with immunotherapy with PD-1 inhibitors alone or in combination with chemotherapy will be assessed with CT scan or MRI at the discretion of the treating physician within 14 days +/- 7 days before starting treatment and then every six weeks through the treatment. An estimate of a 95% Exact Clopper Pearson confidence interval will be used. RECIST 1.1 criteria will be used to measure tumor size: Measurable disease is defined by the presence of at least 1 measurable lesion. A lesion, not previously irradiated per the protocol prior to enrollment, that can be accurately measured at baseline as ≥10 mm in the longest diameter (except lymph nodes which must have short axis ≥15 mm) with CT or MRI and that is suitable for accurate repeated measurements. Non-measurable: All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter &lt;10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 mm to &lt;15 mm short axis at baseline).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Progression Free Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>At 6 months and at 1 year after enrollment on study</time_frame>
    <description>Progression free survival will be defined as progression of local-regional disease, distant metastases or death without progression and will be reported as median progression-free survival as well as progression free survival at 6 month and 1 year time points. Investigators will estimate Kaplan Meier survival curves and estimate the median duration of response with 95% confidence intervals for these measures.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Overall Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>At 6 months and at 1 year after enrollment on study</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival is defined as death due to any cause and will be reported as median overall survival as well as overall survival at 6 month and 1 year time points. Investigators will estimate Kaplan Meier survival curves and estimate the median duration of response with 95% confidence intervals for these measures.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Treatment-Related Toxicities with Cetuximab as Assessed by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment-related side effects will be collected before each treatment based on clinical laboratory and radiologic changes and will be graded and reported. All patients who receive at least one dose of cetuximab will be considered evaluable for safety analysis. Investigators will create frequency tables that count the number and severity of toxicities observed in this study.</description>

The maintenance dose of Cetuximab is 250 mg/m2 and will be infused over 1h. No further observation time needed.
The loading dose of cetuximab will be given every 7 days (+/- 2 days) starting 7 days (+/- 2 days) after the loading dose of cetuximab.
Pre-medicate with 50 mg Benadryl iv before the loading dose of Cetuximab and as per standard of care before the maintenance treatment.</description>
