  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized unblinded interventional clinical trial:

      Arm Intervention Experimental arm (n=150): Intervention group Administration of the MyPal
      ePRO system the intervention group will use the ePRO tools provided in the project.

      Standard care arm (n=150): no intervention besides general palliative care if required
      general palliative care if required.

      Patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 fashion to use the MyPal system and receive
      related-intervention versus general palliative care, stratified by cancer type (i.e. CLL vs
      MDS), using a computer-generated number sequence, which will be concealed until after group
      assignment.
