  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial uses magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) to estimate tissue stiffness (hardness
      or softness of the tissue) in tissue that is affected by radiation treatment (radiation
      necrosis) and tumor tissue that has come back (recurrent) after treatment in patients with
      gliomas. Diagnostic procedures, such as MRE, may estimate the differences in tissue stiffness
      between radiation necrosis and recurrent glioma post treatment and ultimately lead to a more
      accurate diagnosis and/or surgery, and/or a better assessment of the disease's response to
      treatment.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the mean lesion stiffness in patients with radiation necrosis using magnetic
      resonance elastography (MRE).

      II. To estimate the mean lesion stiffness in patients with glioma recurrence using magnetic
      resonance elastography (MRE).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To investigate the mean lesion stiffness between radiation necrosis and glioma recurrence.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo MRE over 10 minutes and then undergo standard of care magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) of the brain with and without contrast at baseline. Within 4 weeks after the
      initial MRI and MRE scans, patients may undergo standard of care biopsy to check the status
      of the disease. Within 48 hours after biopsy, patients undergo standard of care MRI to check
      the status of the disease. Patients who do not undergo biopsy undergo standard of care MRI
      4-8 weeks after MRE scan to check the status of the disease.

    <description>For each patient, a lesion region of interest (ROI) will be created along with its normal appearing contralateral white matter. The stiffness of the tumor ROI and the contralateral white matter ROI will be measured, and the ratios of the stiffness between the two will be calculated. Interval estimates will be computed for mean stiffness ratio in patients with radiation necrosis or glioma recurrence, separately using a 2-sided 95% confidence interval. Outcome variable of stiffness will be assessed between tumor and contralateral white matter with paired t-tests or Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test or t-tests will be used to assess the associations between the outcome variable of stiffness ratio and tumor status (recurrence/necrosis).</description>
