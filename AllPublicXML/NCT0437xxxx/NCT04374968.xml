      The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of utilizing blood flow restriction (BFR)
      therapy both before and after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) following a
      tear. BFR has been proposed to work by restricting arterial inflow leading to an oxygen
      depleted environment and the ability to induce muscle adaption at lower maximum repetition
      via reactive hyperemia. Muscle atrophy occurs following ACL tear and reconstruction. Thus,
      physical therapy is used in the peri-operative period to regain strength with the ultimate
      goal of returning to activity.

      The goal of this investigation is to determine if using BFR during perioperative therapy
      would lead to increased and expedited strength gains. Additionally we would like to determine
      if BFR helps patients to pass the standard rehabilitative functional tests and return to play
      sooner. We will also look at patient reported outcomes metrics and pain scores to determine
      if BFR has a significant impact on the patient experience surrounding ACL tear and
      reconstruction.

    <description>Patients will be recruited following ACL tear and medical screening for history of DVT/PE. Patients allocated to the BFR intervention group will undergo physical therapy with the use of a blood flow restriction cuff. Rehabilitation will consist of a structured home exercise program prior to surgery. We will instruct patients on how to perform home BFR and test them in the office to ensure competence. Following surgery patients will immediately be started in physical therapy. Therapy will consist of a structured program progressing from range of motion, to strength training and then functional tests. Both arms will use the same protocol with the only difference being use of BFR.</description>
