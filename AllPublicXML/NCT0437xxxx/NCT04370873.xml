  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to assess MK-5475 in the PH-COPD population by evaluating
      the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), changes in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), and
      changes in pulmonary blood volume (PBV) after administration.

      The primary study hypothesis is that the MK-5475 results in superior reduction of the mean
      PVH following 28 days of dosing compared to placebo in participants with PH-COPD.
