    <textblock>
      Background: A small subset of the patient population is responsible for a significant
      proportion of healthcare expenditures. These patients are cared for in academic medical
      centers by internal medicine residents however there has been no research to date about the
      education or the management of patients with complex multimorbidity in the outpatient
      setting.

      Objective: To evaluate the impact of the High Risk Outpatient Intern-led Care (HeROIC) Clinic
      on internal medicine interns' perceived ability to manage complex outpatients as well as pre
      and post intervention total patient healthcare cost.

      Methods: The investigators created the HeROIC outpatient clinic environment to comprise
      longer visit time slots, &quot;bedside&quot; presentations, and team-based care (one intern primary
      care provider, one secondary intern, and one longitudinal attending). All non-preliminary
      interns based at one primary care site participated in the intervention while interns at a
      second site continued to practice in the usual outpatient clinic environment. The interns in
      the HeROIC clinic arm assumed the roles of primary care providers for 34 complex patients in
      total. The primary outcome was the perceived confidence in the management of complex
      outpatients as assessed by a survey. Secondary outcomes included perceptions about the
      ability to provide high-quality outpatient and evidence-based outpatient care, as well as
      statewide pre-post patient healthcare cost data.
