        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 20 years or older in the year of the index first line therapy prescription.

               -  2 or more RCC diagnoses (ICD-9: 189.0; ICD-10: C64.1, C64.2, C64.9) at least 30
                  days apart, in the 1 year prior to the index date until 30 days post index date.

               -  2 or more code for secondary malignancy codes indicating possible diagnoses for
                  metastatic disease at least 30 days apart, in the 1 year prior to the index date
                  until 30 days post index date. (ICD-9: xx-199.xx; ICD-10: C77-C79, except ICD9:
                  198.0 Secondary malignant neoplasm of the kidney and ICD10: C79.0 Secondary
                  malignant neoplasm of the kidney and renal pelvis.)

               -  Exploratory sensitivity analyses were performed to review patients with 1 or more
                  diagnosis codes for advanced or metastatic RCC 12 months prior to the index date
                  and 1 or more secondary malignancy codes around the RCC diagnosis dates.

               -  Continuous enrollment from 12 months prior to the index date. Patients will be
                  required to have continuous enrollment from their index date until the end of the
                  available data. This will allow for sub-analysis of cohorts with 3 months, 6
                  months and 12 months of available data

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Received advanced treatment prior to the study index date.

               -  Prescription records with negative days of supply will be excluded from all the
                  analyses except in cost variable calculation. The day of supply for claims with
                  missing or 0 days will be imputed.

               -  Only one RCC diagnosis in the 12 months prior or one mont post index date.

               -  Patients with data for analysis (&lt; 3 months post index date)
