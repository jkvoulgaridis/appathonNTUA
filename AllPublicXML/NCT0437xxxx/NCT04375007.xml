      Musculoskeletal disorders can be a large burden on individuals, health care and social care
      systems. The aim was to assess the feasibility of performing a prospective study
      investigating whether self-efficacy, fear of movement, empowerment or enablement has any
      relation to the number of visits to physiotherapists among patients with a musculoskeletal
      disorder in primary health care. Design was apProspective study with consecutively selection
      including patients seeking physiotherapist for the first time for a musculoskeletal disorder.
      Primary outcome measure included operational and practical feasibility regarding recruitment
      of participants, use of questionnaires and key variables to be collected as part of the
      study.

      Background: Musculoskeletal disorders can be a large burden on individuals, health care and
      social care systems. Patients with musculoskeletal disorders are often treated by
      physiotherapists in primary health care. Psychosocial variables can be a significant obstacle
      to recover from musculoskeletal injuries.

      The primary aim of this pilot study was to assess the feasibility of performing a prospective
      study investigating whether self-efficacy, fear of movement, empowerment or enablement has
      any relation to the number of visits to physiotherapist among patients with a musculoskeletal
      disorder in primary health care.

      Methods: Prospective study with consecutively selection including patients seeking
      physiotherapist for the first time for a musculoskeletal disorder. Primary outcome measure
      included operational and practical feasibility regarding recruitment of participants, use of
      questionnaires and key variables to be collected as part of the study. Secondary outcomes
      included correlation between self-efficacy (Exercise Self-Efficacy Scale (ESES-S)), fear of
      movement (Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK-SV)), empowerment (Making Decisions Scale ),
      enablement (Patient Enablement Instrument (PEI)) and number of visits to physiotherapist.
      Statistical analysis was done using IBM SPSS statistics version 24 with analysis of
      correlation using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient.
