  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine differences in nicotine delivery, use behavior,
      carbon monoxide delivery, subjective effects, and physiological effects, when cigarette
      smokers use an electronic cigarette with constant device settings and different e-liquid
      concentrations.

    <measure>Plasma Nicotine Concentration</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 205 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Change in plasma nicotine concentration Blood will be taken 5 times in each session to examine changes from baseline (approx. 90 minutes) to immediately follow a ten-puff bout (approx. 100, 120, and 190 minutes), and immediately after the cigarette challenge paradigm (approx. 205 minutes).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Cigarette Challenge Paradigm</measure>
    <time_frame>This task will occur at approximiately 200 minutes until 205 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The cigarette challenge paradigm is a procedure in which participants will be given a 5 minute time period in which they are allowed to smoke their own brand cigarette as much or as little as they want. Study staff will provide the participant with their own brand cigarettes, a lighter, and an ash tray. Latency to start the first puff and number of puffs will be recorded.</description>
