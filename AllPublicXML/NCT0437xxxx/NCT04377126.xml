  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GIFT is a pilot, randomized, double-blinded clinical trial that will examine the effects of
      unacylated ghrelin on walking ability in people with peripheral artery disease (PAD) compared
      to placebo. Preliminary evidence suggests that unacylated ghrelin may improve blood flow to
      the extremities and promote improved skeletal muscle growth and energy use.

      We will randomize 30 participants with PAD to one of two groups: unacylated ghrelin
      injections or placebo injections . Participants will self-administer the study drug or
      placebo subcutaneously once daily for four months. Our primary outcome is change in
      six-minute walk distance between baseline and 4-month follow-up

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our work and that of others shows that patients with lower extremity peripheral artery
      disease (PAD) have greater functional impairment, faster functional decline, and higher rates
      of mobility loss compared to people without PAD. In patients with PAD, ischemia results in
      calf muscle injury that includes myofiber loss and calf muscle mitochondrial dysfunction.
      Therapies to regenerate calf skeletal muscle cells, improve mitochondrial function, and
      increase calf muscle capillary density may improve functioning and prevent mobility loss in
      people with PAD. Yet few effective therapies currently exist for patients with PAD.

      This pilot study will investigate the therapeutic potential of unacylated ghrelin to promote
      capillary growth, increase calf muscle perfusion, and reverse PAD-related skeletal muscle
      abnormalities, thereby improving PAD-related functional impairment. Ghrelin is a peptide and
      hormone that circulates in acylated and unacylated forms. Unacylated ghrelin promotes
      skeletal muscle cell regeneration, improves mitochondrial function, and increases muscle
      capillary density. Unlike acylated ghrelin, unacylated ghrelin does not increase appetite, or
      cause insulin resistance.

      The proposed GIFT Trial will provide preliminary data to test our hypothesis that unacylated
      ghrelin improves walking performance and prevents mobility loss in older patients with PAD.
      We further hypothesize that the favorable effect of unacylated ghrelin will be mediated by
      increased myofiber regeneration, increased muscle capillary density, and improved muscle
      mitochondria function. If our preliminary data support our hypotheses, results will be used
      to design a large randomized trial of unacylated ghrelin therapy, in subsequent study, to
      improve functioning and prevent mobility loss in older people with PAD.

      We will conduct a pilot randomized trial in 30 participants age 55 and older with PAD, to
      gather preliminary evidence about whether daily subcutaneously administered unacylated
      improves the six-minute walk distance (primary outcome), maximal treadmill walking
      time(secondary outcome), and calf muscle perfusion (secondary outcome), compared to placebo.
      We will also perform calf muscle biopsies at baseline and follow up to determine whether
      unacylated ghrelin increases Type 1 skeletal muscle myofibers, satellite cell number,
      capillary density, and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) mitochondrial activity in calf skeletal
      muscle, compared to placebo. If our hypotheses are correct, results will be used to design a
      large, definitive randomized trial of unacylated ghrelin to improve lower extremity
      functioning and prevent mobility loss in the large and growing number of older people who are
      disabled by PAD.
