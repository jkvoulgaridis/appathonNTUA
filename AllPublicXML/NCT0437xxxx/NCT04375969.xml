  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Therapeutic effectiveness of coldness in relieving pain and reducing inflammation has been
      known for many years now. Over that time, various coldness therapies have gained in
      popularity, including winter swimming, snow baths or whole body cryostimulation (WBC) .
      Recent researches have shown positive effects of WBC on metabolic profile, low-to-moderate
      chronic inflammation and related diseases (e.g., obesity). WBC could be, thus, intended as an
      adjuvant method in the treatment of dysmetabolic conditions, such as overweight or obesity.
      WBC is a cheap easily accessible practice, with a few well-defined contraindications and
      limited non severe possible adverse events, if performed in specialized centres. At the same
      time, in sport science appears data, which indicated on inhibition of adaptive changes
      induced by regular training.

      The primary aim is to define, through a randomized controlled approach, the relative
      effectiveness of up to 20 consecutive sessions of either WBC, high-intensity intermittent
      training (HIIT), or their combination (WBC and HIIT) in improving the metabolic status of
      overweight and obese subjects. The effects will be assessed, at different time-points, in
      terms of insulin sensitivity and modification in the profile of hormones regulating the
      energy metabolism (adipokines, myokines, bone-derived hormones) and the inter-organ
      cross-talk.

      Secondary aims are:

        1. To assess the influence of WBC and HIIT on insulin sensitivity and establish the role of
           myokines (irisin and IL-6) in this regulation. To find the answer for the question if
           the rise of mentioned myokines cause a decrease of authophagy protein HMGB1.

        2. To characterize potential effectiveness of these intervention protocols on bone and
           energy metabolisms by stimulating in vitro cultured normal human osteoblastic primary
           cells and β-pancreatic cells with sera obtained from patients at different time points
           during treatment.

        3. To establish, which procedure is most effective at improving insulin sensitivity:
           training or training supported with WBC treatment, which factors modify this response
           (body composition or physical capacity of subjects)

        4. To establish if training supported with WBC treatment impairs adaptive changes of
           trained subjects

        5. To determine the potential beneficial effects of the intervention protocols on the
           metabolic homeostasis, and assess how long these changes are maintained over a period of
           four weeks or three months.

The centre is equipped with an electric cryochamber Zimmer Medicine System, Cryochamber ELECPOL, located in a temperature- and humidity-controlled room. The patient, minimally dressed (e.g., bathing suit, socks, clogs, headband, and surgical mask), remains 30sec at -60°C (vestibule) for body adaptation and, then, passes to the cryochamber, at -110°C and stay there 3 minutes.</description>
