  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients older than 60 years are more and more transplanted. Comprehensive geriatric
      assessment (CGA) have been developed and are currently used in patients with cancer, it has
      been correlated with the prognosis. There is still few data in transplanted patients and the
      aim of this study is to assess these patients before and after transplantation in order to
      monitor their general health and quality of life (QOF) and correlate them to the prognostic.

    <measure>Evaluation of Quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>at one year</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life evaluated using questionnaire &quot;European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire&quot; (EORTC QLQ-C30- v3). The QLQ-C30 is composed of both multi-item scales and single-item measures. These include five functional scales, three symptom scales, a global health status / QoL scale, and six single items. Each of the multi-item scales includes a different set of items - no item occurs in more than one scale. All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level. A high score for a functional scale represents a high/healthy level of functioning. A high score for the global health status/ QoL represents a high QoL and a high score for a symptom scale/item represents a high level of symptomatology/problems.
