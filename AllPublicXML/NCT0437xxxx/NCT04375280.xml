  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic illness is a public health issue and mobility loss is frequent in this population.
      Among its' multiple physical and psychological consequences, increased mortality and
      cardiovascular morbidity seem the main concern. Therefore, the exploration of locomotor
      deficiencies, physical capacities and metabolism of patients with chronic illnesses
      constitutes a major challenge both for the treatment of causal pathologies, as well as for
      evaluating the impact of therapeutic interventions, the benefit of which will be an
      improvement in physical capacities and ultimately mobility. In view of the hypothesis of an
      increase in the prevalence of mobility disorders in this population, this approach is part of
      a logic of screening and improving the effectiveness of the care of these patients with a
      multidisciplinary evaluation of individual risks. The EVALMOB protocol was designed in order
      to try to determine a standard profile of &quot;dysmobility&quot; in patients with chronic illness
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We propose to constitute a prospective cohort of subjects carrying chronic disease. The
      objective is to explore all the different components of mobility (balance, muscle force, body
      composition, walking ability, metabolism, etc.), to assess their impact on the functional
      capacity of individuals and to identify their potential interactions. Processing this data
      could ultimately allow the development of a model to determine a composite standard profile
      of &quot;dysmobility&quot; in patients with chronic disease.

      In the present protocol, parameters will be measured on five occasions (at inclusion, at 6
      months from the inclusion day, at 1,2 and 5 year(s) from the inclusion day). All tests will
      be performed on the same day. New assessments will be done on the same principle as the
      initial evaluation.

      Statistical analyses will be carried out using Stata software (version 13, StataCorp, College
      Station, USA). Data will be described by frequencies and percentages for categorical
      variables and by means and standard deviation (or median and interquartile range if data are
      not normally distributed) for continuous variables. The normality of continuous data will be
      assessed graphically and using the Shapiro-Wilk test. The main analysis will consist in
      determining patient profiles regarding their mobility. Clustering-type approaches (supervised
      or not) will be proposed: k-means, vector machine support, machine learning, factor analysis.
      For example, factor analyses on mixed data will allow the main components of mobility to be
      characterized. They can be followed by an ascending hierarchical classification in order to
      determine homogeneous groups of patients.

      These groups will be described and compared on the main criteria evaluated using standard
      statistical tests: chi2 test (or Fisher's exact test if applicable) for the categorical
      criteria and using an analysis of variance (or Kruskal-Wallis if data are not normally
      distributed) for continuous criteria. The main analysis will be broken down more specifically
      for each of the pathologies considered. In addition, the sensitivity to change will be
      assessed in each pathology and for each assessment criterion. The search for factors related
      to the evolution of the different criteria will be carried out using usual tests and mixed
      multivariate models (logistics for categorical / linear criteria for continuous criteria)
      considering the subject as a random effect, and adjusting on the time criteria (inclusion /
      follow-up) and the criteria highlighted in the univariate analyses and in light of the
      elements reported in the literature. A sensitivity analysis will be proposed in order to
      study the statistical nature of the missing data and to propose, if necessary, the most
      suitable method of imputing the data: multiple imputation, maximum bias or LOCF in the case
      of longitudinal data.

    <description>Participants will be involved in a long-term evaluation program combining, body composition measures, physical tests as well as self-administered questionnaires.

    <intervention_name>Development of a screening algorithm designed to determine a &quot;dysmobility&quot; profile in patients with chronic illness.</intervention_name>
    <description>Firstly, volunteers will be invited to complete online questionnaires on a secure platform. The mobility assessment will be carried out initially (t1) and up to a maximum of 4 times (t1 to t4) as part of a day hospitalization. Questionnaires will be diverse (SF36, KOOS, HOOS, BROCKER, MNA, TAMPA, etc.) in order to assess several aspects that compose mobility.
Physical evaluations will include various validated tests (isokinetic strength measure, TUG, 6MWT, Berg Balance Scale, etc.)</description>
