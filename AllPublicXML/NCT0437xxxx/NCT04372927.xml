    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies two questions in patients with stage III NSCLC: 1) does it
      improve cancer control to add the drug Durvalumab, a type of immunotherapy, earlier in the
      treatment course; and 2) by intensifying treatment with durvalumab, is it possible to avoid
      mediastinal radiation to decrease side effects, without decreasing cancer control?

      OUTLINE:

      Patients will receive platinum doublet chemotherapy per standard of care with durvalumab for
      8 weeks, concurrent with a short course of radiation to the primary lung tumor. Patients will
      then undergo repeat evaluation of the mediastinal lymph nodes. If there is no cancer in the
      lymph nodes, patients will receive 2 years of adjuvant durvalumab. If there is still cancer
      in the lymph nodes, patients will receive 6 weeks of radiation to the mediastinal lymph
      nodes, and 2 years of adjuvant durvalumab.

      After the completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 12 months.

    <description>Patients with squamous cell cancer receive standard of care chemotherapy consisting of cisplatin on days 1, 8, 29, and 36, and etoposide on days 1-5 and 29-33. Cycles repeat every 4 weeks for up to 2 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with non-squamous cell cancer receive standard of care chemotherapy consisting of cisplatin and pemetrexed on days 1, 21, and 42. Cycles repeat every 3 weeks for up to 3 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. All patients receive durvalumab IV over 1 hour Q4W. Radiation to the primary tumor will be given over 8-15 fractions during weeks 1-3 of chemotherapy. For patients who have residual disease in the mediastinal lymph nodes at week 9, radiation will be given to the lymph nodes starting week 11. Durvalumab is given for 2 years after completion of radiationin the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.</description>
