      The primary objective of the present study is to clinically and radiographically evaluate
      nonincised papillae surgical approach and entire papilla preservation approach for the
      treatment of intrabony defects with GTR membrane and hydroxyapatite graft.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Various procedures to treat intrabony defects by preserving the interdental papilla include
      conventional, simplified, and modified papilla preservation techniques. The drawback of these
      techniques is the post-surgical gingival recession.

      In order to overcome this drawback, the &quot;entire papilla preservation&quot; technique has been
      proposed, by preserving the whole integrity of the defect associated papilla providing a
      tunnel-like undermining incision. Recently a novel surgical procedure, termed nonincised
      papillae surgical approach (NIPSA), was designed to maintain the integrity of the interdental
      soft tissues covering intrabony defects. This would prevent biomaterial exposure associated
      with loss of papillary height, increase the amount of space for hard and soft tissue
      regeneration, and minimize gingival recession.

    <description>The basic principle of the technique is the placement of only one buccal horizontal or oblique incision in the mucosa, as apically as possible from the periodontal defect and the marginal tissues, and the raising of a mucoperiosteal flap coronally, which permits apical access to the defect but leaving the marginal tissues intact, acting as a &quot;dome&quot; for the protection of the clot.</description>

    <description>The entire Papilla Preservation Technique is to preserve the whole integrity of the defect- associated papilla providing a tunnel-like undermining incision. The completely preserved interdental papilla provides an intact gingival chamber to stabilize the blood clot and improve the wound healing process. To provide adequate access for debridement, EPP requires a short buccal vertical releasing incision on the buccal side of the neighboring tooth extending just beyond the mucogingival line.</description>
