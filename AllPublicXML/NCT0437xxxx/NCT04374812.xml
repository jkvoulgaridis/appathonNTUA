  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: The NHS is facing significant challenges in recruiting and retaining staff,
      particularly registered nurses (RNs). Recruiting unregistered staff is often adopted as a
      solution to the RN shortage; however recent research found a negative effect of low RN
      staffing levels on mortality with no evidence that high levels of assistant staff could
      mitigate the increased risk. Economic modelling suggested that increases in skill mix were
      potentially cost-effective, but these findings derive from a single NHS hospital Trust with
      limited cost and outcome data.

      Aims and objectives: This project aims to estimate the consequences, costs and cost
      effectiveness of variation in the size and composition of the staff on hospital wards in
      England. In order to provide estimates that are more likely to apply across the NHS, this
      study will include at least four hospitals and consider a wider range of outcomes and sources
      of costs, including death within 30 days of admission, adverse events such as infections,
      length of hospital stay, readmissions and rates of staff sickness.

      Methods: This retrospective longitudinal observational study will use routinely collected
      data on ward and shift level nurse staffing, and patient outcomes. Data will be derived from
      the E-Roster systems, used by hospitals to record all planned and worked shifts. The
      investigators will consider all rostered direct care staff. These data will be linked to
      patient data derived from the hospital patient administration system (PAS); and other
      clinical systems and databases of adverse events (e.g. datix). Relationships between RN and
      assistant staffing levels and outcomes will be explored using survival models incorporating
      mixed effects. The investigators will use the results of these analyses to model the costs
      and consequences of different staffing configurations and to estimate the incremental
      cost-effectiveness associated with change. Our study will provide evidence to inform staffing
      levels and skill mix planning in the NHS, highlighting potential cost savings, and offering
      improved patient safety and reduced adverse staff outcomes.
