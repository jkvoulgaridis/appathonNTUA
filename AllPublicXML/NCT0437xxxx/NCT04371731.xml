      A research study to evaluate the impact of a novel care pathway for patients diagnosed with
      Heart Failure within Chiltern CCG, supported by an integrated clinical patient record.
      Assessment of patient outcomes following implementation of Care4Today(R) Heart Failure
      Platform.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an exploratory study to evaluate the impact of the novel Care4Today HF platform on a
      set of outcomes including hospital admission rate (primary diagnosis), 30 days post discharge
      readmission rate, length of hospital stay for patients with HF (primary and secondary
      diagnosis), patient quality of life, and patient clinical metrics. The study design includes
      comparison of two parallel cohorts: one where patients will be managed via the Care4Today HF
      platform (active cohort) and a second, where patients will be managed as per existing
      standards of care (control cohort).

      Evaluation phase:

      The evaluation phase will be set up to assess the potential benefits of the Care4Today HF
      platform. This will be implemented across 10 GP practices who will be part of the active
      cohort, within the Chiltern CCG region. The outcomes for these patients will be compared with
      the outcomes of patients in the control cohort over a one year period.

      Patients pathway (for the active cohort):

      Once the diagnosis of HF is confirmed, a HF specialist project nurse will register the
      patient on the Care4Today platform and provide the patient with instructions on how to use
      the patient portal, where patients can input various clinical measures, communicate with HCPs
      and track their condition. Complex patients, and/or patients that are deteriorating are
      referred to the community HF specialist nurse team where they will be monitored and managed.
