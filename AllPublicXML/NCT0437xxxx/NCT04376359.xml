  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pneumonia complicating stroke is very difficult to manage and has a very poor prognosis,
      leading to a significantly higher risk of death. Oral opportunistic pathogens have been
      reported to be associated with the incidence of pneumonia among non-stroke immunocompromised
      subjects. Preliminary studies found that patients with stroke had higher carriage rates of
      oral opportunistic pathogens than healthy subjects. Therefore, investigators hypothesize that
      pneumonia complicating stroke is associated with oral opportunistic pathogens, and hyperbaric
      oxygen therapy may reduce the incidence of pneumonia complicating stroke by increasing the
      flow of saliva, which can affect the species and relative abundance of oral opportunistic
      pathogens. In order to prove this, investigators need to (1) firstly conduct a randomized
      controlled trial to confirm whether hyperbaric oxygen therapy is able to reduce the levels of
      plaque, and the incidence of pneumonia complicating stroke at clinical level; (2) secondly
      employ metagenomics analysis to compare oral rinse samples and respiratory samples, and to
      identify pneumonia-associated &quot;oral opportunistic pathogens group&quot;; (3) finally elucidate how
      hyperbaric oxygen therapy influences the species and relative abundance of oral opportunistic
      pathogens. This proposed study will provide evidence for the integration of hyperbaric oxygen
      therapy as part of interdisciplinary stroke rehabilitation.

    <description>Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is the patient put in airtight oxygen tank, by increasing the air pressure in the environment (1.5 to 3.0) under atmospheric pressure, to give 100% oxygen, the patient treatment time is approximately 60 minutes to 120 minutes in this way, can achieve the purpose of greatly increase the oxygen partial pressure in the organization, so as to achieve reverse brain edema, reduce lipid peroxidation, inhibiting leukocyte hyperactivity, rebuild the blood brain barrier.</description>
