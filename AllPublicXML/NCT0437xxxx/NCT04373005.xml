  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of COVID -19 in the cancer patient
      population. This will be done by looking at the rate of asymptomatic COVID-19 infection in
      cancer patients receiving cancer therapy, as well as their immune response and outcome.

      This is a sub-study of the U-DEPLOY study: UHN Umbrella Trial Defining Coordinated Approach
      to Pandemic Trials of COVID-19 and Data Harmonization to Accelerate Discovery. U-DEPLOY helps
      to facilitate timely conduct of studies across the University Health Network (UHN) and other
      centers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Given increasing community transmission and the possibility of asymptomatic carriage of
      virus, it is important to study whether asymptomatic shedders of virus are playing a role in
      propagating the pandemic. There is currently little data available regarding cancer patients,
      yet, this population may be particularly susceptible to the COVID-19 infection.

      Despite the cancer patient population being at higher risk of COVID-19, no systematic
      screening has been established and no biomarkers have been identified to determine which
      patient is at higher risk.

      This study will screen patients on active cancer therapy for COVID-19 as a research test.
      Blood samples and optional saliva swabs may also be taken to assess any patient response to
      the virus.
