    <textblock>
      This is a multicentre, prospective, observational, no post-authorization study. This study
      will be opened for recruitment approximately for 12 months for a pilot phase including at
      least 25-30 patients and 6 controls and for 12 additional months to complete patient and
      control inclusion until 90 patients and 20 control depending on the first part study results.

      After enrolment, patients will be assigned to one of the following cohorts according to their
      level of hormone-resistance:

        -  Cohort A (hormone-sensitive disease).

        -  Cohort B (hormone-resistant disease).

      In both cohorts it will be collected residual pre-treatment tumor samples from metastatic
      lesions, preferably obtained after last treatment just prior to study entry, and/or primary
      breast tumor; as well as serial blood samples at baseline, after 6 weeks, at the same time of
      radiological re-evaluation (3 months after ET initiation) and at progressive disease (PD)
      which will be used for serial analytic determinations of the expression profiles of Natural
      Killer (NK) cells, other lymphoid innate cells, NKG2D ligands, cytokines and other possible
      biomarkers; in addition to obtain local data of hemogram and estradiol, Follicle Stimulating
      Hormone (FSH) and Luteinizing Hormone (LH) levels.

      Patients who have participated in the study during their first line of ET are eligible to
      participate after progression, when they initiate the second line of ET (in this case,
      inclusion/exclusion criteria should be checked newly and Informed Consent Form (ICF) signed
      again).

      From the control population it will be collected blood and local data (e.g. hemogram,
      estradiol, FSH and LH levels), in a single time-point after ICF signature.
