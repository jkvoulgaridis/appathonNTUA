  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if non-invasive distracting devices (Virtual
      Reality headset) are more effective than the standard of care of utilizing existing
      technologies that are currently more common in food allergy research treatment and clinics
      (i.e. television and patients' personal electronic devices) for decreasing levels anxiety and
      fear in pediatric patients undergoing oral food challenge (OFC) and their caregivers.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Children's Fear Scale Score Before and After OFC dosing</measure>
    <time_frame>measurements occur at single time points before and after each food challenge with approximately 4-6 hours between measurements. Thus 4 discrete measurements will be taken over two food challenges which will occur approximately one week apart.</time_frame>
    <description>The Children's Fear Scale (CFS) is used to measure the anxiety or fear level of the children. The one-item scale consists of a row of five sex neutral faces ranging from a no fear (neutral) face on the far left to a face showing extreme fear on the far right.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Childhood Anxiety Meter Score Before and After OFC dosing</measure>
    <time_frame>Before and after each evaluation (approximately 4-6 hours between measurements at each visit, with visits approximately 1 week apart)</time_frame>
    <description>The Childhood Anxiety Meter brief measure of the current level of anxiety in a child using a visual scale (thermometer that is colored to the level anxiety, higher thermometer level means more anxiety).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Level of Immersion after OFC</measure>
    <time_frame>After each evaluation (approximately 1 week apart)</time_frame>
    <description>Modified scale to assess cognitive absorption as a measure of immersion in the technology.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Level of satisfaction - participant, caregiver and provider</measure>
    <time_frame>After each evaluation (approximately 1 week apart)</time_frame>
    <description>Patient, caregiver and provider satisfaction after dosing will be assessed through a custom satisfaction evaluation form, with categorical responses to questions tailored to specific challenges during OFC such as the time it takes to administer a dose, how well a patient complies with dosing, and how available technology may influence patient and caregiver desire to continue with a study.</description>
