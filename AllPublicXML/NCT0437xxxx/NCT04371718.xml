  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2-stage study. All patients will receive prednisolone and AZA as standard of care
      (SOC) during the study. At the end of the second stage, all data collected from both stages
      will be pooled for final analysis of the efficacy and safety of JKB-122 on SOC reduction of
      inflammation in Autoimmune Hepatitis

      This is a 2-stage study. All patients will receive prednisolone and AZA as standard of care
      (SOC) during the study. In stage I, subjects will be randomized to receive 15 mg JKB-122, 35
      mg JKB-122 or placebo in 1:1:1 ratio, adjunctive to SOC. After 90 subjects in Stage I
      complete the study, based on the review of the safety and efficacy data the following
      adaptations may be applied: Drop the inferior dose group and Extend patients with the elected
      dose from stage I. In stage II, patients will be randomized to receive JKB-122 as adjunct
      therapy (15 mg or 35 mg) or placebo in 1:1 ratio. At the end of the second stage, all data
      collected from both stages will be pooled for final analysis of the efficacy and safety of
      JKB-122 provided as an adjunct therapy to on SOC reduction of inflammation in Autoimmune
      Hepatitis
