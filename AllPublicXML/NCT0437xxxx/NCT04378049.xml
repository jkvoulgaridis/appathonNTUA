  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot randomized trial to assess the feasibility of a definitive trial to determine
      the effect of robot-assisted partial knee replacements versus standard total knee
      replacements.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Knee osteoarthritis (OA) pain is an important source of morbidity and cost to the health care
      system. Over 60,000 knee replacement surgeries are performed in Canada every year, making it
      the second most common surgery. Our institution (St. Joseph's Healthcare Hamilton) is the
      first hospital in Canada to purchase a Mako RIO orthopaedic robot to assist with performing
      knee replacements. The knee is divided into three compartments, and one, two, or all three
      compartments can become arthritic. Over 90% of patients with end-stage knee OA receive a
      total knee replacement (also known as total knee arthroplasty or TKA) even if they have one
      or two healthy knee compartments. Partial knee replacements are an option for these patients
      but these procedures are very technically demanding and associated with a higher risk of
      implant failure. For this reason, few surgeons are experts at partial knee replacements. We
      believe that we can use robotic technology to make it easier for surgeons to perform partial
      replacements more accurately, thereby increasing the quality and survivorship of partial knee
      replacements. This may lead to better patient-important outcomes like return to activity,
      pain, and satisfaction, and eventually better access to high-quality partial knee
      replacements for Canadians. This will be the first study to evaluate total knee replacements
      (standard care) versus robot-assisted partial knee replacements, and could lead to greater
      uptake of robotic technology in orthopaedics and a shift toward anatomy-sparing partial knee
      replacements.

    <masking_description>Surgeons cannot be blinded to treatment group. It would not be feasible to blind the health care team and patients because the incisions and imaging are visually distinguishable. We will attempt to minimize bias in subjective measures by presenting patients with balanced information on each treatment group prior to the trial. All participants will receive a computed tomography (CT) scan prior to surgery to maintain blinding and to give surgeons additional information about 3 dimensional modelling for implant placement. Data analysts will be blinded to treatment allocation. An independent outcomes assessor will independently review radiographic alignment for each patient and review relatedness of adverse events and re-operations. The independent assessor cannot be blinded because imaging is visually distinguishable.</masking_description>

    <measure>Return to function questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>We will use the 5-item Return To Function (RTF) questionnaire to determine when a trial participant returns to work, leisure, and activities around the home after an injury or surgery (measured as time to return to unrestricted activities).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Oxford knee score</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>We will measure knee function using the Oxford Knee Score (OKS), which is a validated and well-used 12 item questionnaire used to measure knee function when performing daily activities after total knee replacement surgery. The OKS is scored on a 0-48 scale with higher scores representing a better outcome.</description>

    <measure>Forgotten joint score</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>We will use the Forgotten Joint Score (FJS-Knee) to measure how natural the replaced knee feels. The FJS-Knee is a 12 item questionnaire that aims to assess both function and feeling by asking about patients' awareness of their artificial knee while doing various daily activities. The FJS is scored on a 0-100 scale with higher scores representing a better outcome.</description>

    <description>Overground walking kinematic gait analysis will be performed in the clinic environment using a ten-camera optoelectronic motion capture system. Primary gait outcomes will include the knee joint flexion and adduction angle magnitudes and range during the stance phase of gait. Secondary gait outcomes will include stride characteristics as defined above, knee transverse rotation during stance, knee flexion during swing, hip and ankle range of motion and peak magnitudes during stance.</description>

Pain that began after surgery or a tissue trauma;
Pain is in an area of preceding surgery or tissue trauma;
Pain has persisted for at least three months after surgery; and
The pain is not better explained by an infection, malignancy, a pre-existing pain condition or any other alternative cause.

    <description>Participants with isolated medial or isolated lateral compartment OA who are randomized to the intervention group and have one affected knee compartment will receive a robot-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA). If the patient has medial or lateral OA plus patellofemoral OA they will receive a bicompartmental knee arthroplasty (BiKA) consisting of a two simultaneous UKAs. The partial knee replacement procedures will be performed using the Mako RIO robotic arm (Stryker) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The choice of implant and use of bone cement will be recorded but will be left to the surgeon's discretion. Surgeons will resurface the patella if the patellar cartilage meets Outerbridge grade 3 or 4 criteria</description>
