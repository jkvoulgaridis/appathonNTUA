  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to 20 subjects will be enrolled to evaluate initial safety and performance of the AtaCor
      Temporary Pacing System when used with three (3) strategies for stabilizing AtaCor Temporary
      Pacing System electrical measurements over a two (2) to seven (7) day period. The three
      treatments are (1) Negative Pressure Wound Therapy, (2) Anti-Inflammatory Glucocorticoid and
      (3) increased electrode spacing. A control arm with no additional treatment is also included.
      Safety will be evaluated through analysis of all Adverse Events. Performance will be
      evaluated through (1) the incidence of successful StealthTrac Lead placement using the MACH I
      Delivery Tool, (2) electrical performance measurements, such as pacing capture thresholds,
      sensed R-wave amplitudes, pacing impedance and skeletal muscle stimulation at rest.
      Appropriate sensing and pacing capture will be ascertained from ECG Holter Monitor recordings
      during periods of in-hospital ambulation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Enrolled Subjects will have both a market-released transvenous pacing lead and
      investigational StealthTrac Temporary Pacing Lead placed and evaluated. Following StealthTrac
      Lead insertion, each subject will receive (1) one of three (3) study treatments intended to
      stabilize pacing capture thresholds and pacing impedance over time or receive no treatment.
      The three treatments are (1) Negative Pressure Wound Therapy, (2) Anti-Inflammatory
      Glucocorticoid and (3) increased electrode spacing achieved by the use of two inserted
      StealthTrac Leads. During the placement procedure, diagnostic echocardiograms will be
      performed to detect any new pericardial effusions. Once inserted, the StealthTrac Lead will
      be used to deliver high rate pacing (160 to 220 BPM) in clinically appropriate Subjects, to
      demonstrate suitability for use in transcatheter procedures that require brief periods of
      temporary pacing. Lead positions will be documented using fluoroscopic images before the
      Subject leaves the procedure room. On the following two days after the procedure, electrical
      performance will be evaluated in multiple postures and appropriate pacing and sensing will be
      confirmed during activity using ECG Holter monitor recordings. Subjects will also be asked
      patient-centric questions about their experience with the StealthTrac Lead throughout the
      study period. Evaluations will continue for a minimum of two (2) and a maximum of seven (7)
      days after the index procedure. Prior to StealthTrac Lead removal, an X-Ray will be taken to
      document the final lead position. A final follow-up will be performed 25-30 days after
      removal to identify any latent adverse events before the Subject exits the study.

    <description>• Methylprednisolone 125 mg administered over 30 minutes beginning at least 30 minutes prior to the incision and StealthTrac Lead insertion procedure. This intravenous dose can be repeated every 8 hours on day one of the insertion from 1-3 doses depending on the patient's ability to take oral medications. It can be administered daily thereafter until the patient is able to take oral dosing. In normal circumstances, post op day 2, commence oral glucocorticoid (see below for recommended oral dosing).
Oral (PO) glucocorticoid preparations and dosing:
Prednisone 40-60 mg orally daily based on BMI category. BMI categories: Low (&lt;18); Medium (18-30); High (&gt;30). Low and medium are assigned 40 mg daily. High BMI is assigned 60 mg daily dose. This while the StealthTrac lead remains in place.
Methylprednisolone 16-32 mg daily based on BMI (low, medium and high) while the StealthTrac Lead remains in place.</description>
