    <textblock>
      This pilot study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of PMA-zeolite when used in
      patients with uncontrolled CD (Crohn´s disease). The effect of the PMA-zeolite will be
      compared between a control-group (healthy volunteers) receiving either PMA-zeolite or placebo
      and the test-group (suffering from uncontrolled CD) and receiving either PMA-zeolite or
      placebo. In addition, this pilot-study should furthermore provide indications for the
      effect-size in order to estimate an effect for an eventual further human trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background of the study Crohn´s disease (CD) is a chronic progressive destructive disease.
      Approximately one-fifth of adult and paediatric patients already have evidence of a
      structuring or penetrating intestinal complications at diagnosis. Despite decades of
      research, the aetiology of CD remains unknown. Disease treatments include a variety of
      approaches like dietary changes and immunosuppressive anti-TNFa antibodies as well as
      ancillary antibiotic therapy. Another interesting and promising approach in this context
      might be the supplementation of the certified medical device PMA-(Panaceo micro
      activation)-zeolite (a specific natural zeolite-clinoptilolite) due to its properties
      documented through many studies. In particular, the promising clinical results from a
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) with PMA-zeolite need to be highlighted. The strengthening/
      supporting of the intestinal wall integrity in healthy subjects suffering from intestinal
      problems was measured in this RCT and is claimed as intended main action of the PMA-zeolite.
      Based on these results the application of PMA-zeolite is an interesting and promising
      approach in patients with uncontrolled CD.

      Hypothesis In the present trial, it is being tested if supplementing PMA-zeolite can lead to
      an improvement of the defined markers and parameters (reduction of local and systemic
      inflammation, changes of the microbiota in the gut, positive detoxifying effect and general
      improvement of quality of life) in patients with uncontrolled CD compared to a healthy
      test-group.

      Aims This pilot study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of PMA-zeolite when used in
      patients with uncontrolled CD. The effect of the PMA-zeolite will be compared between a
      control-group (healthy volunteers) receiving either PMA-zeolite or placebo and the test-group
      (suffering from uncontrolled CD) and receiving either PMA-zeolite or placebo. In addition,
      this pilot-study should furthermore provide indications for the effect-size in order to
      estimate an effect for an eventual further human trial.

    <intervention_model_description>The pilot-study is a randomized, placebo-controlled and double blinded study. The 4 subject-groups are consisting of group A and B with healthy subjects (A and B are divided into a placebo-group and into a PMA-zeolite- group) and group C and D which are subjects suffering from CD (C and D are divided into a placebo-group and into a PMA-zeolite- group). No washout phase is planned, but if food-supplements are taken this will be protocolled. The diagnostics will be performed through the defined parameters at defined time-points.</intervention_model_description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy volunteers (at least 18 years old) for first two groups (A,B), homogenous
             starting group in age (30-60Y) and sex (m/f )

             o The health-status will be confirmed through anamnesis.

          -  Groups C and D will include patients with confirmed Crohn's disease that are treated
             with standard therapy and despite of treatment do not achieve the appropriate disease
             remission. Patients with the intermediate type of disease will be also included in
             groups C and D.

               -  Diagnosis has to be confirmed with a biopsy of the intestine and histological
                  exam.

               -  Degree of disease will be assessed by Harvey-Bradshaw Index (HBI). For evaluation
                  of quality BDQ questionnaire will be used. For the assessment of disease activity
                  ordinary laboratory measurements will be performed (CBC, basic biochemical
                  parameters, CRP), and calprotectin from chairs. Colonoscopy must be done in the
                  last six months prior to inclusion of patients in the research protocol.
                  Gastrointestinal system degree of impairment will not have influence on inclusion
                  criteria and patients with histological intermediate type of disease will be
                  included as well.

          -  Signed informed consent as per usual recommendations in vigour in the Republic of
             Slovenia.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Signs of acute bacterial infection (fever &gt;38°C, nausea, vomiting).

          -  Other chronic disease (cancer, renal disease, neuro-degenerative, metabolic disorders,
             diabetic).

          -  Pregnancy or breastfeeding

          -  Food supplements** **NOTE: Food supplements: if taken regularly this should be
             continued also during the study and documented - otherwise a wash - out - phase would
             be necessary
