      Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) are defined by pain in the temporomandibular joint (TMJ)
      and related tissues, limitations in the movements of the lower jaw, and TMJ noises.1,2 TMD
      are classified into four groups as temporomandibular joint disorders, masticatory muscle
      disorders, headache attributed to TMD and associated structures.3,4 Of these, masticatory
      muscle disorders are the most common TMD subtype seen in dental clinics.5-7 In general, two
      major symptoms are seen associated with masticatory muscle disorders: Pain and dysfunction.
      Pain is the vast majority of complaints about masticatory muscle disorders. The other
      important complaint is dysfunction, which occurs as a limitation in the opening range of the
      mandible.8 It is known that individuals with experimental muscle pain are slower than healthy
      individuals when biting hard food and show lower maximum voluntary clenching capacity.9 Also,
      it has been reported that the maximum bite force decreased in patients with temporomandibular
      disorders.10 These consequences directly affect patients' quality of life. Therefore,
      rehabilitation of limited masticatory functions is one of the important therapeutic goals for
      TMD patients.11 In TMD patients, masticatory functions can be measured objectively with bite
      force, bite force endurance, electromyography, and jaw kinematics, etc. Another objective
      method that can be used to determine masticatory functions is the masticatory efficiency
      test. In the literature, there are few studies that measure masticatory efficiency in TMD
      patients.12-16 Only two of these studies investigated the effect of TMD treatment and used
      the sieve method to measure masticatory efficiency.15,16 Although the sieve method is
      considered the gold standard, the procedure is complex and time consuming.17,18 To eliminate
      these disadvantages, masticatory efficiency measurement with two-color chewing gum tests
      which are simple and do not require special equipment or training can be used. The effect of
      many different conditions and treatments on masticatory efficiency was evaluated with this
      method.19 However, to our knowledge, there is no study in the literature evaluating TMD
      treatment with this method.

      The aim of this study was to compare the masticatory efficiency with a two-color chewing gum
      test before and after treatment of the masticatory muscle-related temporomandibular disorder.

    <description>Two-color chewing gum mixing ability test was used to measure masticatory efficiency in the control group, before and after treatment in the experimental group.21 Commercial two-color chewing gum was used.The gum was left on the patient's tongue and he/she was asked to chew 20 times naturally.
After chewing, the gum was put in a transparent plastic bag and squeezed to 1 mm. Both sides of the sample were scanned at 300 dpi resolution on a desktop scanner (HP Deskjet, California, USA) in the same day to prevent the colors from deteriorating due to saliva. For each patient, two sides of scanned images were processed in ViewGum software (version 1.4, Dhal Software, Kifissia, Greece, www.dhal.com) using the method of Halozenitis et al. (2013).22 The value of VOH (variance of hue) was taken as the value of chewing activity. The highness of this value indicates low masticatory efficiency.</description>
