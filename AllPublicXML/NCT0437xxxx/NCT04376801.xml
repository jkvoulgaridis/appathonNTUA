      Humeral intercondylar fractures are very challenging in clinical treatment. There are many
      problems not clear. One of the important problems remained to be solved is which fixation
      method can achieve the best effects after olecranon osteotomy. Therefore, the investigators
      are going to perform a retrospective analysis of patients with distal humerus fractures
      admitted to their hospital in 2012-2017 to compare the functional outcomes of elbow joints
      with tension-band fixation and plate fixation after olecranon osteotomy.

      Humeral intercondylar fractures are very challenging in clinical treatment. Because the
      humeral intercondylar fracture is comminuted and often occurs in elderly patients with
      osteoporosis, it is difficult to achieve rigid fixation during the operation and failure of
      fixation occurs from time to time after the operation. Nonunion and reoperation have brought
      great sufferings to the patients.In recent years, both surgical methods and technique of
      internal fixation have been greatly improved, but there are still many problems not clear.
      Olecranon osteotomy has been proven to be an effective approach for comminuted intercondylar
      fractures and there are different fixation methods to fix the proximal ulna after
      intercondylar fixation. However, it is not clear which method can achieve the best effects.
      Therefore, the investigators are going to perform a retrospective analysis of patients with
      distal humerus fractures admitted to their hospital in 2012-2017 to compare the functional
      outcomes of elbow joints with tension-band fixation and plate fixation after olecranon
      osteotomy.
