      A Randomized Phase IIb Study, Evaluating Efficacy of Salvage Therapy with Brentuximab
      Vedotin-ESHAP vs ESHAP in Patients with Relapsed / Refractory Classical Hodgkin's Lymphoma,

      A phase IIb open label multi-center trial in patients with refractory / relapsed cHL.

      Patients are randomized (1:1) to receive:

      • ESHAP- BV (Etoposide [40 mg/m2/ day IV, D1-4], Solumedrol [250 mg/day IV, D1-4], high dose
      Ara-C [2 g/m2 IV, D5] and cisplatinum [25 mg/m2/day IV, D1-4] + BV [1.8 mg/kg IV, D1], every
      21 days (3 cycles, q21 days).

      Or

      • ESHAP (Etoposide [40 mg/m2/ day IV, D1-4], Solumedrol [250 mg/day IV, D1-4], high dose
      Ara-C [2 g/m2 IV, D5] and cisplatinum [25 mg/m2/day IV, D1-4] (3 cycles, q21 days)

      Stem cell collection will be performed in all patients according to institutional guidelines,
      but preferably after the first / second cycle of ESHAP-BV or ESHAP.

      Patients attaining a mCR (Deauville 1, 2) after receiving 3 cycles of ESHAP-BV, will receive
      up to 13 cycles of BV consolidation (administered every 3 weeks, over 39 weeks).

      Patients who were randomized to ESHAP and attained a mCR after receiving 3 cycles will
      receive up to 16 cycles of BV (same dosage and time intervals).

      Patients who attained less than mCR following ESHAP-BV/ESHAP they will be taken out of the
      trial and will be treated according to their physician's clinical decision. However, they
      will be followed in order to evaluate their clinical outcome in terms of ORR, CR rate, TTNT2
      and OS, that will be analyzed the study separately.
