  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tertiary care IBS patients will be recruited for a prospective low FODMAP intervention study,
      hereby focusing on the reintroduction phase of the diet, where patients are blindly
      challenged with different FODMAP groups administered as powder, to be added to the strict
      FODMAP exclusion phase. During the screening phase of two weeks, baseline data regarding
      psychological, nutritional, microbial, and genetics will be collected. Predictors of
      treatment response (a 50-point drop on the IBS-severity scoring system (IBS-SSS) during the
      strict FODMAP exclusion phase of 6 weeks) will be studied with linear mixed models.

    <description>The primary endpoint is the variable used to assess the main objective, the efficacy of low FODMAP diet on gastrointestinal symptoms in IBS (focusing on the reintroduction phase). The variables used will be the symptom scores of several symptom questionnaires. Ultimately, the efficacy of the diet is based on improvement of symptom scores. Improvement is defined as a 50-point drop on the Irritable Bowel Syndrome Symptom Severity Scale (IBS-SSS). In this questionnaire, each quesiton is scored from 0-100, with a maximum total score of 500. Patients reporting scores &lt;50 are defined as non-IBS individuals, a score from 50-175 indicated mild disease, 175-300 moderate and &gt;300 severe.</description>

    <description>A diet specifically developed for the management of IBS is the low Fermentable Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides, And Polyols (FODMAP) diet. FODMAP is a collective term that includes fructose in excess of glucose, oligosaccharides including fructans/fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS), galacto-oligosaccharides, sugar polyols such as sorbitol and mannitol, and lactose. Controlled studies have established efficacy of the low FODMAP in managing IBS symptoms, but this diet is complex, associated with low calorie intake, and requires individualized explanation and follow-up by an experienced dietician.</description>
