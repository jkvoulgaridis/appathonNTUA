  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma, which are one of the most important causes of morbidity and mortality both in the
      world and in our country, constitute a very serious social and economic burden. An estimated
      300 million people suffer from asthma worldwide, which is a major public health problem.
      Asthma is complex and heterogeneous chronic airway diseases that require a multifaceted
      approach. In asthma, small airways represent key regions of airflow obstruction. Although
      small airway dysfunction is known in chronic airway diseases, the importance of small airway
      dysfunction on disease control, exacerbations and quality of life, and the importance of
      taking place among treatable targets is not clear. Thus, there is an unmet need to assess its
      role in the control of the disease. Therefore, our primary aim in the study is to determine
      the frequency of small airway dysfunction measured by impulse oscillometry in Asthma
      patients. Our secondary aim is to evaluate the role of small airway dysfunction in disease
      severity, disease phenotypes, disease control, quality of life and its effect on predicting
      the risk of exacerbation and its role among treatable targets in Asthma.

      This is a prospective cross-sectional interventional design. 73 asthmatic patients who
      applied to Mersin University Faculty of Medicine Hospital Chest Diseases Clinic between
      01.10.2019-01.04.2020 will be taken. 35 healthy volunteers who were admitted to our clinic
      within the same date range will be taken as control group. Impulse oscillometric pulmonary
      function tests will be performed to all participants. Thorax computed tomography will be
      performed to evaluate small airway dysfunction. To evaluate the degree of disease
      inflammation and phenotype in asthma patients, nitric oxide measurements will be made in the
      breath air with fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FENO) device. The blood eosinophil level
      will be studied to determine the asthma phenotype.Asthma control test (ACT) will be applied
      to measure symptom control in patients with asthma. Asthma quality of life scale (AQLQ) will
      be applied to determine the quality of life in asthmatic patients. All patients will be
      followed for 1 year to record the number of exacerbations requiring emergency and hospital
      admissions for asthma. The effect of small airway dysfunction on asthma group, on the disease
      severity and control degree, disease phenotypes and quality of life, and the effect on the
      risk of exacerbation will be analyzed.
