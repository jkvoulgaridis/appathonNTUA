    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is associated with high morbidity and mortality.
      The Danish Lung Association estimates that 320,000 Danes live with COPD, of which
      approximately 50,000 with severe COPD. In 2017, records showed that 23,979 admissions in
      Denmark were related to COPD; of these patients, about 20% were readmitted 2-30 days after
      discharge. The main symptom is dyspnea, which is often accompanied by anxiety. Primary
      treatment is; oxygen, bronchiolitis, prednisolone, morfica, NIV, and anxiolytics.

      Researchers at Hvidovre Hospital have developed an oxygen robot that continuously monitors
      the patient's SaO2 (oxygen saturation) and automatically administrates the oxygen depending
      on it. The preliminary results show that patients with robot-administrated oxygen were within
      defined SaO2 range in 85.7% of the time versus 46.6% when oxygen was nurse-administrated. The
      research was conducted as a multicentre Randomized Controlled Trial focusing on physiological
      end-points.

      There is a lack of knowledge about the patient perspective of treatment with the oxygen
      robot.

      The purpose of this study is:

      1. To examine the effect of robot-administered oxygen on patients' perception of dyspnoea,
      including the emotional response in the form of anxiety and depression

      The perspective is to be able to provide a holistic response to whether robot-administered
      oxygen can be a better method of treating and alleviating dyspnoea.

    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a high prevalence disease and is associated
      with high morbidity and mortality worldwide. In 2017, there were 23.979 COPD related
      admissions in Denmark, approximately 10% died during hospitalization, while 20% of survivors
      were readmitted between day 2-30 after discharge.

      Patients with COPD often experience long disease trajectories characterized by a substantial
      burden of symptoms, impaired functional status, multiple admissions and thereby reduced
      quality of life.

      The cardinal symptom dyspnea is associated with hypoxemia, anxiety and depression. Evidence
      shows that depression is a significant risk factor for disabling dyspnea, while risk of
      anxiety increases with the severity of Dyspnea. The prevalence of anxiety and depression is
      indicated to lie between 10%-55% and 10%-86% in patients hospitalized with COPD in
      exacerbation . Patients with COPD have an 85% increased risk of developing anxiety compared
      to a matching control group without COPD. The prevalence of anxiety is 10 times higher among
      patients with COPD than in the background population and are strongly associated with the
      risk of hospitalization, long admissions, readmissions and death. Anxiety and depression are
      often treated with benzodiazepines which have a respiratory suppressive effect. Consumption
      of benzodiazepines increases disease progression, and studies have shown that 31.7% of
      patients with COPD have a benzodiazepine consumption and that 9% initiate a new
      benzodiazepine ordination in conjunction with an exacerbation.

      The evidence that oxygen prevents disease progression and mortality is consistent, but there
      is a lack of knowledge about whether oxygen, can reduce the intensity of dyspnea in patients
      with COPD.

      In the acute phase of an exacerbation the oxygen flow is titrated to achieve a SaO2 between
      88-92%. Keeping patients with COPD within the given SaO2 range is essential because too low
      SaO2 can induce tissue damage, heart overload and difficulty concentrating, while
      hyperoxaemia can inhibit respiration and increase the risk of hypercapnia, acidosis and the
      need for ventilatory support in the form of Non-invasive Ventilation (NIV).

      In clinical practice, oxygen flow is administered and titrated, via aggregates, by nurses
      based on point observations, with the risk of patients being outside optimal SaO2 range,
      between observations.

      To improve practice, a group of researchers at Hvidovre Hospital has developed an oxygen
      robot, called O2matic, which continuously monitors the patient's SaO2 and automatically
      administrates oxygenflow according to it.

      O2Matic has been tested in a randomized controlled trial in 2018. Patients admitted with an
      exacerbation of COPD and hypoxemia (SaO2 â‰¤ 88%) was included (N = 19). The design was
      crossover and patients were allocated to either 4 hours of manual oxygen administration via
      nurse followed by 4 hours of oxygen administration via O2Matic, or vice versa. The study
      showed that patients with O2matic controlled oxygen administration were within defined SaO2
      range in 85.7% of the time versus 46,6% of the time when the oxygen was controlled and
      administrated by a nurse . These results are in consensus with a former Canadian study
      testing an alternative oxygen robot (FreeO2). The two RCT Studies provide evidence to
      investigate robot-administered oxygen therapy for inpatient patients with exacerbation of
      COPD in a larger multicenter RCT.

      Dyspnea is defined as; &quot;A subjective experience of breathing discomfort that consist of
      qualitatively distinct sensations that vary in intensity&quot;. The experience of dyspnea is a
      product of a physical perception based on signals from the body to the brain followed by the
      cognitive processing of these into an emotional experience. Dyspnea is thus an emotional and
      sensational experience based on perceptual afferent feedback from various respiratory
      receptors. Up to 16 possible mechanisms are involved in the process . Given the above,
      dyspnea is a complex symptom, mainly induced by the body's attempts to obtain homeostasis,
      when subjected to hypoxemia. Despite this dyspnea is not the same as hypoxemia, as it has not
      been clearly demonstrated that reduced hypoxemia, by oxygen therapy also reduces Dyspnea.
      However, there are indications in the literature that oxygen therapy can reduce the
      experience of dyspnea. A significant barrier to the use of oxygen therapy as an intervention
      on fragmentary dyspnea in patients with COPD is the risk of hypercapnia and acidosis. Oxygen
      therapy administrated according to saturation in a closed-loop-feedback-system by a robot,
      could potentially be an intervention to relieve fragmentary dyspnea in patients with COPD.
      International guidelines show that dyspnea is not treated consistently nor effectively in the
      advanced stages of the disease.

      Opioids are one of the most widely used agents in the treatments of dyspnea. Opioids
      suppress' respiration and treatment should be balanced to avoid respiratory depression.

      Guidelines points out the importance of identifying and graduate the intensity of dyspnea in
      clinical practice, without indicating any superior instruments to achieve this. Majority of
      instruments developed, describe dyspnea in relation to activity. As COPD progress, dyspnea
      intensifies and patients will become more inactive and often live a sedentary life.

      Few questionnaires measure the sensory and emotional domains of dyspnea independently of
      activity and diagnose. One is the multidimensional Dyspnoea profile (MDP) that has currently
      been translated into Danish.

      In order to reduce symptom burden, length of hospital stay, number of re-admissions and
      mortality, new knowledge and more effective methods for treating and alleviating dyspnea and
      the associated anxiety and depression are needed in patients with COPD.

      Studies investigating the effect of oxygen therapy, including time with and degree of
      hypoxemia, in hypoxemic patients experiencing dyspnea, anxiety or depression during
      hospitalization with acute exacerbation, could not be identified.

      Because O2matic provides a new and unique opportunity to reduce and illuminate time with
      hypoxemia during hospitalization and patient's subjective experience of the sensory and
      emotional aspects of dyspnea can be reported on a validated questionnaire via MDP, the
      investigators now have an option to investigate if a robot intervention, that reduces time
      with hypoxemia, has an effect on dyspnea in patients admitted with a exacerbation of COPD.
      Furthermore, investigators want to examine whether this intervention alters the consumption
      of opioids and benzodiazepines.

      Primary hypothesis. Robot-administered oxygen reduces the perception of dyspnea measured at
      scale A1 on the multidimensional Dyspnea Profile (MDP), in patients with COPD and hypoxemia.

      Primary objective. To investigate if oxygen administration by O2matic has an effect on the
      perception of dyspnea in patients admitted with an exacerbation of COPD and hypoxemia, versus
      conventional oxygen administration by oxygen aggregate and a nurse Primary end points.

        -  Global dyspnea measured on scale A1 on multidimensional Dyspnea Profile (MDP) Secondary
           hypothesis. Oxygen administration by O2matic reduces the sensory and emotional dimension
           of dyspnea, respiratory symptoms, anxiety and depression, as well as consumption of
           anxiolytics in patients admitted with hypoxemia and exacerbation of COPD versus
           conventional Oxygen management by aggregate and nurse Secondary aim. To investigate if
           oxygen administration by O2matic has an effect on the sensory and emotional dimension of
           dyspnea, respiratory symptoms, anxiety and depression, as well as the consumption of
           anxiolytics in patients admitted with hypoxemia and exacerbation in COPD versus
           Conventional oxygen management by aggregate and nurse Secondary end-points.
