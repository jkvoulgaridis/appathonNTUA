    <textblock>
      C3731003 is a pivotal Phase 3 study to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of a single
      IV infusion of PF-07055480 (Recombinant AAV2/6 Human Factor VIII Gene Therapy) in adult male
      participants with moderately severe or severe hemophilia A (FVIII:C≤1%) for the study
      duration of 5 years. The study will enroll eligible participants who have completed at least
      6 months of routine prophylaxis with FVIII products in the lead-in study C0371004.

    <measure>Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) instrument - Hemophilia Activities List (HAL)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>HAL is a disease specific measure of the impact of hemophilia on functional abilities in adults. The instrument consists of 42 items across 7 domains, utilizing a past month recall period. Each item is rated on a scale of 0-6 with higher recoded scores indicating more functional limitations.</description>

    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Haem-A-QoL is a disease specific measure of health-related quality of life in patients with hemophilia. Intended for adults, the instrument uses a 4-week recall period to assess health across 10 domains consisting of 46 items. Each item is rated on a scale of 0-6 with lower scores indicating better health-related quality of life.</description>
