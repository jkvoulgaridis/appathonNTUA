      Measurement algorithm control and optimization with subsequent performance evaluation of
      Sanmina biosensors in monitoring of glucose, heart rate (HR), and SpO2 in patients with type
      1 and type 2 diabetes during a standardized meal experiment.

      -  This study is a combined, open label, prospective, comparative single-center study.

        -  The study is separated in 3 consecutive study parts. The first 2 study parts include 12
           patients each. In the third study part 36 patients will be enrolled. Study part 1 and 2
           will be used for optimization and control of the measurement algorithms of the Sanmina
           biosensors. During the third study part with enrolment of 36 patients, the precision and
           accuracy of the final Sanmina biosensor algorithm will be demonstrated. The study
           conduct for all 60 participants of all 3 study parts will be exactly the same. In all
           groups of participants, the Sanmina finger clip and wearable non-invasive monitoring
           biosensor will be individually introduced and assigned. During the study visit at the
           study site, a standardized meal will be given to the participants. At eleven time points
           before and after the standardized meal, glucose, heart rate, and pO2 will be measured
           using the Sanmina finger clip and wearable non-invasive monitoring biosensor. The
           measurement time points are -30, 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 120, 150 and 180 min. The
           measurements will be compared to capillary blood glucose measurements by YSI Stat 2300
           and StatStrip (glucose), and parallel measurements of the heart rate and the pO2 using a
           patient monitor. Further the exact skin colour will be evaluated using a skin colour
           card.
