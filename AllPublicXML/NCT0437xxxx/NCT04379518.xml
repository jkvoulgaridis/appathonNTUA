      This phase I/IIa trial studies the side effects of rintatolimod and interferon (IFN) alpha-2b
      in treating cancer patients with mild or moderate COVID-19 infection. Interferon alpha is a
      protein important for defense against viruses. It activates immune responses that help to
      clear viral infection. Rintatolimod is double stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA) designed to
      mimic viral infection by stimulating immune pathways that are normally activated during viral
      infection. Giving rintatolimod and interferon alpha-2b may activate the immune system to
      limit the replication and spread of the virus.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety of the combination of intravenous (i.v.) rintatolimod administered
      with or without i.v. IFN alpha (recombinant interferon alfa-2b [intron A]) in patients with
      cancer with mild or moderate COVID-19.

      II. To determine the rate of the following complications of COVID-19: (i) progression of
      infection requiring hospitalization; (ii) acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); (iii)
      and 30-day mortality.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the kinetics of viral load in the peripheral blood and nasal swabs in the course
      of treatment.

      II. Determine the kinetics of changes of the immune subsets and circulating inflammatory
      mediators (including C-reactive protein [CRP], cytokines, chemokines, interferons) in
      peripheral blood in the course of treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of recombinant interferon alfa-2b.

      Patients receive rintatolimod IV over 2.5-3 hours and recombinant interferon alfa-2b IV over
      20 minutes on days 1, 3, 5, and 8 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Patients are followed up at days 14 and 28 after initiation of the study regimen.
