  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized controlled trial take place in a fertility outpatient clinic in an
      academic hospital. Women between 18 and 52 years old requiring polypectomy or myomectomy by
      hysteroscopy morcellation for abnormal uterine bleeding or for fertility issue are included.
      The aim is to evaluate pain perception between vaginal and traditional hysteroscopy for
      hysteroscopic morcellation. The investigator's hypothesis is that pain perception is lower
      using vaginoscopy compared to traditional hysteroscopy.

      78 participants will be randomised in two groups:

        1. traditional hysteroscopy: under intravenous sedation, hysteroscopic morcellation is
           perform after speculum insertion, vaginal cleansing, and paracervical anesthesia with
           xylocain 1%.

        2. Vaginal hysteroscopy: under intravenous sedation, hysteroscopic morcellation is perform
           after vaginal cleansing using vaginal distension with saline solution

      In addition to pain perception, other outcomes includes: complication rates, time to continue
      fertility treatment, time to pregnancy
