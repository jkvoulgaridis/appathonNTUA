  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studies indicate that the majority of early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients
      find it important to be involved in treatment decision making. However, in a recent study it
      has been reported that about 40% of the participants experienced decision conflict and feel
      uninformed(1). The investigators therefore developed a patient decision aid (PDA) for stage
      I-II NSCLC patients, that informs and empowers patients to help decide between stereotactic
      radiotherapy (SBRT) and surgery.

      A pilot study in which semi-structured interviews will be conducted (Qualitative research).In
      addition, patients will be asked to fill in a questionnaire about the usability of the
      prototype. A small group of patients (n=15) that have been treated for early stage NSCLC in
      the past will be asked to participate. The persons involved in this pilot are asked to assess
      a patient decision tool and will be interviewed only once. After the interview they will be
      asked to fill in a questionnaire. The burden of the pilot study is very low. No medical
      examinations or procedures will be carried out. Pilot study in lung cancer patients treated
      in the past with radiotherapy or surgery. The participants will all give informed consent.
      The investigators are using a qualitative design. Semi-structured interviews will be carried
      out. In addition the investigators will ask the participants to fill in a questionnaire with
      35 questions.

      No age limits are defined. The pilot study will be carried out in stage I-II NSCLC patients
      who were treated with radiotherapy or surgery, at least 6 months ago. Patients should
      currently be free of disease, no disease progression. The semi-structured interview consists
      of 17 open questions and text recorded, in order to be able to analyze the date afterwards.
      The interviews will take place when the patients come to the hospital for a regular follow-up
      appointment. After the interview, the patient is asked to fill in a questionnaire about the
      usability of the decision aid. In total, the expected duration is about 2 hours.
