  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the synergistic effect of CHX + H2O2 when used as an irrigant during
      biomechanical preparation.in root canal treatment on periapical healing and compared with
      Chlorhexidine( CHX) and Sodium Hypochlorite (NaOCl).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After a thorough history, clinical and radiographic examination with all eligibility
      confirmation, written informed consent will be taken from the patient after explaining the
      procedure and its associated risks and benefits. Patients randomly allocated to one of the
      three study groups Sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), Chlorhexidine (CHX) and combination of
      (CHX+H2O2). All three irrigants will be used according to standard protocol during
      biomechanical preparation. Pain analysis will be carried out preoperatively and
      postoperatively at every 6 hours for 1 day and then every 24 hours till 7 days after the
      intervention. All the subjects will be followed up for evaluation of clinical and
      radiographic success at 3, 6 months and 1year.

Two experienced observers with no knowledge of the treatment protocol will independently examine the immediate post obturation and follow up radiographs, mounted side by side, under controlled conditions. The treatment is considered successful only when both clinical and radiographic criteria are met. The worst outcome of an individual root decide the overall outcome for the tooth. In the event of disagreement, the two observers will meet to discuss their findings and came to an agreement.</description>
