  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of extracorporeal Shock wave therapy
      (ESWT) on functional activity and pain in patients with Achilles tendinopathy
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fifty patients of both sexes with Achilles tendinopathy aged 18-40 years, were assigned
      randomly into two equal groups. The study group received ESWT in addition to a conservative
      physical therapy program for four weeks, while the control group received a conservative
      physical therapy program only. Pain and functional mobility were assessed before and after
      treatment through a visual analog scale (VAS) and Victorian Institute of sports assessment -
      Achilles questionnaire (VISA-A), respectively

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment-Achilles questionnaire (VISA-A).</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>It consists of eight questions that covered the three domains of pain (questions 1-3), function (questions 4-6), and activity (questions 7 and 8.). Questions one to seven are scored out of 10, and question 8 carries a maximum of 30. Scores are summed to give a total out of 100.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The visual analog scale (VAS).</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The VAS is a continuous scale consists of a horizontal line (HVAS) usually 10 centimeters (10-100 mm) in length. For pain intensity, the scale is most anchored by no pain (score of 0) and pain as bad as it could be or worst imaginable pain (score of 10</description>

    <intervention_name>Eccentric training of the calf muscle:</intervention_name>
    <description>The patients were asked to stand with all their body weight on the injured leg on a wooden step. From an upright body position and standing with all body weight on the forefoot, with the ankle joint in plantar flexion. The calf muscle is loaded by having the patient lower the affected limb down by dorsiflexion the ankle until the plantar aspect of the heel lay below the level of the step, and the ankle is in maximum dorsiflexion.</description>
