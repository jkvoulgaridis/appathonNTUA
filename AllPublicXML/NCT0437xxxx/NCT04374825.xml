  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop and tailor an intervention program to improve the
      quality of life in women living with metastatic breast cancer. In the first phase of this
      study, we conducted patient focus groups to gather information about the unique challenges of
      living with MBC and what kinds of support women would like to receive in a tailored
      Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) intervention. In the second phase of the study, we
      will conduct a three-arm randomized controlled trial to the tailored ACT intervention with
      both a Cognitive Behavioral Stress Management (CBSM) intervention and usual care. The CBSM
      and ACT intervention groups will meet with a trained facilitator and 8-9 other patients, once
      per week via videoconference for 90 minute sessions over the course of 8 weeks.

    <intervention_model_description>Patients participating in the online pilot will be randomized to 1 of 3 study arms: 1) a usual care control, 2) CBSM, and 3) ACT. Women taking part in the intervention trial (i.e. women living with Stage IV [M1] breast cancer) will complete self-report psychosocial measures online at four assessments. Change across time will be assessed from baseline to mid-intervention (Week 4 of 8), immediately post-intervention (Week 8), and a one month follow-up.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>This intervention consists of 8, 90-minute online group sessions delivered via video conference. Content will be developed by tailoring an ACT intervention to the specific needs of women with MBC, by using qualitative data gathered in patient focus groups. The intervention will incorporate key concepts of ACT (i.e., creating meaning and purpose in life via coping skills, activities in line with patients' values, and mindfulness meditation).</description>
