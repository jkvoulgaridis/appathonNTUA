  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple Myeloma is an incurable cancer. Therapies for it include oral chemotherapy pills. It
      is unknown whether patients regularly and correctly take these anti-myeloma pills. This study
      wants to measure the rate of adults with MM taking anti-myeloma pills correctly. The
      investigators also want to use a teaching tool to see if it will help patients feel more
      satisfied and more confident in taking their anti-myeloma pills correctly. The investigators
      hope to use this data from this small study to eventually do a larger study in this area.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of patients with myeloma utilizing orally-administered myeloma therapy (OMT)
      is expected to continuously rise within Canada. The MASCC Oral agent Teaching Tool (MOATT)
      interventional tool relies on the concept of improved patient education in turn leading to
      improved adherence. Although the MOATT intervention is currently endorsed by Cancer Care
      Ontario, there is no data using the MOATT intervention in patients with myeloma or within
      Canada. Prior to embarking on a larger, multi-center study, a pilot study is necessary to 1)
      understand the feasibility, acceptability of the MOATT intervention and its preliminary
      efficacy 2) to determine the rates of adherence to OMT and explore factors associated with
      non-adherence and 3) to determine the feasibility of a larger multi-centre trial.

    <intervention_model_description>Patients will be randomized to standard of care counselling done for oral myeloma medications or will be counselled using the novel teaching tool MASCC Oral agent Teaching Tool (MOATT). Standard of care consists of standard counselling and written materials provided by the oncologist or pharmacy (e.g. instructions and information on the regimen, common side effects, symptom management, medication safety and how to contact a clinician for any problems encountered).</intervention_model_description>

    <intervention_name>Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer Oral agent Teaching Tool</intervention_name>
    <description>This tool was developed by an expert panel of oncology nurses and was further revised following external review of health care providers world-wide. This tools involves four key modules 1) patient's baseline knowledge, 2) patient education of oral cancer drugs 4) patient education tailored to a specific cancer drug 4) evaluation of the educational material.
It was originally studied in 30 patients with lung cancer and was shown to be feasible with acceptable knowledge retention. Similarly, in a single center cohort study of general oncology patients, medication adherence self-efficacy appeared to improve with MOATT. The MOATT interventional tool incorporates key components of patient education and also has the advantage of being a potentially feasible tool that can be incorporated into future routine clinical practise.</description>
