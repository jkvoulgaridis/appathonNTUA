      This study aims to investigate the efficacy of guided self-help Acceptance Commitment Therapy
      (ACT) for adults who have a diagnosis for Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and are
      experiencing psychological distress (stress, anxiety or depression).

      This is a repeated measures design, using a single case experimental design (SCED) over a
      period of ten weeks. Each participant (n=8) with be asked to complete weekly measures and
      shortened measures every other day, while they read an ACT guided self-help bibliotherapy.
      For more information about the measures, please see outcome measure section. The ACT guided
      bibliotherapy will be administered to each participant on a weekly basis, over eight weeks.

      Participants will be asked to complete outcome measures at one week and at two-months post
      intervention.

      INTRODUCTION High levels of psychiatric co-morbidity have been found with adults who receive
      a diagnosis of Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD); including stress, anxiety, depression and
      OCD.

      Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is a psychotherapeutic approach and is referred to as
      a &quot;third wave&quot; CBT. There have been over one hundred randomized control trials (RCTs)
      supporting the efficacy of ACT for different types of distress and severity. Researchers
      conducted an ACT based group, for students with ASD; the results indicated that levels of
      stress, hyperactivity and emotional distress were reduced in the treatment group, compared to
      classes as unusual. Results were maintained or improved at a two month follow up. However,
      little is still known about the efficacy of ACT for adults with ASD who experience.

      This research will indicate if guided ACT self-help facilitates increases psychological
      flexibility for adults with ASD, which is known to be less developed in people with ASD.
      Psychological flexibility mediates the experience of psychological distress, for example
      depression, anxiety and stress, which are known to be highly prevalent in this population.
      Currently, there are mixed results in relation to effectiveness of CBT; very few researchers
      have measured the effectiveness of ACT to increase psychological flexibility in an adult ASD
      population and determine if this mediates a reduction in psychological distress.

      PURPOSE OF THE STUDY This research will add to the knowledge about how ACT guided self-help
      can be adapted for adults with ASD. It will give results on how effective ACT guided
      self-help is in supporting adults with ASD, to increase psychological flexibility and reduce
      psychological distress. If guided ACT self-help intervention is effective; this will help
      increase access and availability of psychological intervention for people with ASD,
      specifically in relation to associated difficulties in social communication and interaction.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE To examine whether an ACT bibliotherapy intervention, for adults with a
      diagnosis of ASD who experience psychological distress, increases psychological flexibility.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE(S) To examine whether psychological flexibility mediates changes in;
      personally-identified therapeutic goals, increasing psychological wellbeing and decreasing
      anxiety, stress and depression.

      STUDY DESIGN This is a repeated measures design, using a single case experimental design
      (SCED). Each participant with be asked to complete weekly measures and shortened measure
      every other day, please see the outcome measures section for more details of the measures and
      timeframes. Weekly data collection will last for approximately 10 weeks (baseline and
      intervention phase), with a two-month follow-up.

      DATA ANALYSIS SCED data will be predominantly analysed using visual analysis. Data will be
      plotted onto graphs to analyse the direction of the data (trend), the &quot;magnitude&quot; (level) and
      the variability of the data (stability). To find out if change from pre and post scores is
      reliable, a Reliable Change Index (RCI) will be conducted. To determine if any change is
      clinically significant, a Clinically Significant Criterion (CSC) will be conducted. The data
      will be analysed at the University of Lincoln and Students home (via secured sites). The data
      will be analysed using Excel software. No interim analysis is planned for safety, efficacy or
      management purposes.

    <intervention_model_description>The intervention is a guided self-help Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) bibliotherapy, written by Steven Hayes called 'Get Out of your Mind and Into Your Life'. This book has been split into eight sections, participants will be asked to read one section each week. Each week each participant will speak with the researcher to ask any questions and review the weeks material via a guided telephone call. All telephone calls will follow a pre-determined list of questions to increase standardisation and recorded for fidelity checks.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>23 Item measure of Psychological Flexibility
The CompACT total score (out of 138). Higher scores indicate greater psychological flexibility (openness, awareness and activation)
Th CompACT can also be separated into three subscales:
Openness to Experince (OE) subscale (out of 60): Higher scores indicate greater openness to experience - i.e., willingness to experience internal events (thoughts, feelings, sensations, etc.) without trying to control or avoid them
Behavioural Activation (BA) subscale (out of 30): Higher scores indicate greater behavioural awareness (mindful attention to current actions)
Valued Action (VA) subscale (out of 48): Higher scores indicate greater engagement in valued actions (meaningful activity).</description>

    <description>8 Item measure of Psychological Flexibility. Scores are derived by summing responses for each of the three subscales (Openness to Experience; Behavioural Awareness; Valued Action) or the scale as a whole (CompACT Total score).
The full-scale CompACT Total score ranges from 0-48, with higher scores indicating greater psychological flexibility: The ability to attend and adapt to situational demands in the pursuit of personally meaningful longer-term goals.
Openness to Experience (OE) subscale (0-18) higher scores indicating greater openness to experience (willingness to experience internal events [thoughts, feelings, sensations, etc.] without trying to control or avoid them).
Behavioural Awareness (BA) subscale (0-12) higher scores indicating greater behavioural awareness (mindful attention to current actions).
Valued Action (VA) subscale (0-18) with higher scores indicating greater engagement in valued actions (meaningful activity).</description>

    <description>21 Item measure of depression, stress and anxiety
Scores for Depression, Anxiety and Stress are calculated by summing the scores for the relevant items. Recommended cut-off scores for conventional severity labels (normal, moderate, severe) are as follows:
Depression: Normal 0-9, Mild 0-13, Moderate 14-20, Severe 21-27, Extremely Severe 28+
Anxiety: Normal 0-7, Mild 8-9, Moderate -14, Severe 15-19, Extremely Severe 20+

    <time_frame>Administered once during pre-intervention phase, Two and four weeks post intervention phase</time_frame>
    <description>3 Item statements created by the client and based upon the clients values
The Personal Questionnaire (PQ) is an expanded target complaint measure which is individualized for each client. It intended to be a list of problems or behaviours that the client wishes to work on during the intervention, stated in the client's own words.
Clients rate each question on a likert scale scale (0-5), higher scores indicating more success/achievement at the target behaviour.</description>

    <measure>World Health Organisation Quality of Life Questionnaire (WHO-QoL- BRIEF) repeated measure of change</measure>
    <time_frame>Administered pre-intervention, weekly during baseline and intervention phase, two and four week post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>26 Item measure assessing Quality of Life.
The WHOQOL-BREF produces a quality of life profile. It is possible to derive four domain scores; physical health (out of 35), psychological (out of 30), social relationships (out of 15) and environment (out of 40).
There are also two items that are examined separately: question 1 asks about an individuals overall perception of quality of life and question 2 asks about an individuals overall perception of their health.
The four domain scores denote an individuals perception of quality of life in each particular domain.
Domain scores are scaled in a positive direction (i.e. higher scores denote higher quality of life).</description>
