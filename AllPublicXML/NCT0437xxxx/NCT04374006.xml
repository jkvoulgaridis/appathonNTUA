      This study aims to evaluating inflammatory and apoptotic activity in rat's endometriosis
      lesion treated by Propolis compared to Dienogest

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Propolis has known of having various efficacy. The main benefits are as antimicrobial,
      antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory and antiapoptotic.Propolis has even been
      shown to have an antibacterial effect in vitro, without requiring human immunological
      reactions.

      The immunological effect of propolis is generated through immune suppression directly and
      decreasing cytokine production which stimulates immune process. Although proven to have a
      various efficacy, propolis can't be used as a therapeutic drug due to the difficulty of
      obtaining standard chemical composition as a requirement to be the drug's substances.
      Therefore, it is necessary to have biological composition in each propolis prepartions
      written down before comparing the efficacy.

      Anti tumor activity by propolis, which has been tested in animal previously, showed that
      propolis can inhibit DNA synthesis in tumor cells, induce cell apoptosis and activate
      macrophage to produce factors which regulate the function of B, T, as well as NK cell.

      Dienogest, is the next choice of progestin drug class. It has high selectivity binding in
      progesterone receptors, inhibits cytokine secretion in endometriosis stroma cell and induces
      apoptosis in endometriosis cell. Dienogest also has slight inhibitory effect against
      estradiol, so it can deminisce the symptoms due to hypoestrogenic such as decresing in bone
      mass density.

    <description>Protein samples were obtained from endometriosis tissue taken by the treatment group. The lysis network uses a lysis buffer solution at 4 ° C for 30 minutes. The total protein is then broken down based on its molecular weight by the SDS-PAGE (Sodium Docecyl Sulphate-Polycramide Gel Electrophoresis) method and transferred to the PVDF (Polyvinylidene Difluoride) membrane. The membrane is then incubated with primary antibodies (Anti-Bax antibody [Abcam], Anti-Bcl-2 antibody [Abcam], Anti-Cleaved Caspase-3 antibody [Abcam], Anti-IL-1B antibody [Abcam]), followed by incubation with secondary antibodies (Horse-Radish Peroxidase [Santa Cruz Biotechnology]). Proteins that have been bound to antibodies are then viewed using enhanced chemiluminescent reagent kits [Boster Bio]</description>

    <time_frame>during the procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Twenty-three compounds contained in Propolis were tested by screening using rule 5 (Lipinski's rule), screening results determine which compounds can enter the body and can work in endometriosis tissue. Furthermore, the three-dimensional shape is made of compounds which have passed the first stage. This process was created using the Marvin Sketch program. Furthermore, the compound that has been formed is stored as a ligand with extension pdb (protein data bank). Look for NFĸB receptor proteins, estrogen A, estrogen B, progesterone A and progesterone B in the protein data bank, which will be stored as protein. Ligands and proteins are tested using standard Lamarckian algorithms in the Autodock program. The results obtained are in the form of bond energy (ΔG), where smaller results indicate a higher likelihood of interaction</description>

    <description>In the second laparotomy (before the treatment are given) the investigators take a picture of the lession (as the beginning lession). Then the investigators give the treatment. After the treatment are done, the investigators do the necropsy to take a picture after the treatment was given to compare it with the beginning</description>
