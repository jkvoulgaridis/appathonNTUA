  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fever is one of the key symptoms exhibited by contagious patients infected with the Ebola and
      other viruses. Thermographs and non-contact infrared thermometers (NCITs) are commonly used
      as early detection tools for screening and isolating sick individuals in healthcare settings
      and transit centers such as airports. The objective of this clinical study is to evaluate the
      temperature measurement accuracy of thermographs and NCITs. The study will be accomplished by
      establishing a protocol based on best practices for screening published in the IEC
      80601-2-59:2008 Medical electrical equipment -- Part 2-59: Particular requirements for basic
      safety and essential performance of screening thermographs for human febrile temperature
      screening standard, performing initial measurements in patients to optimize clinical
      procedures, then performing quantitative clinical measurements in febrile and afebrile human
      subjects to compare thermographs - used in accordance with recognized best practices for
      measurement - with NCITs for fever screening. Since thermographs and NCITs represent the only
      currently viable mass screening approaches for infectious disease pandemics, like the recent
      Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa, the study will evaluate these thermal
      modalities as medical countermeasures for fever-related pandemics and therefore improve
      response to these diseases.
