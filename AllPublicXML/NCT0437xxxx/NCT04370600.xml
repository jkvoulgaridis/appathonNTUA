  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic, ambulatory heart failure patients will be given ketone ester dietary supplementation
      to determine therapeutic efficacy, metabolic adaptation, pharmacokinetics, associated
      cognitive changes, and safety within this patient cohort in order to establish preliminary
      data to later conduct a multi-center randomized clinical trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We previously demonstrated a metabolic signature of increased ketone utilization—increased
      peripheral blood concentration of beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) and decreased myocardial
      concentration of BHB—and markedly decreased acylcarnitine levels in the failing human
      myocardium procured from lean, non-diabetic patients with advanced heart failure at the time
      of cardiac transplantation. In this working model of the metabolic adaptations in human heart
      failure where the mobilization of lipids and ketones are required for an energetically
      deficient, failing heart it is likely that the development of insulin resistance may be
      adaptive since increased insulin or insulin signaling would put a brake on the hydrolysis of
      lipids and hepatic ketogenesis. In parallel with the recent discovery that the failing human
      heart is reliant on ketones, investigators at Oxford and the NIH have identified a
      nutritional ketone supplement that reliably increases the serum concentration of BHB in
      humans.

      We hypothesize that the induction of ketosis by exogenous administration of the nutritional
      ketone monoester will improve myocardial function in heart failure by increasing the
      energetic substrate available to the myocardium, in essence supporting the energetic deficit
      of the failing human heart which we have demonstrated to be reliant on ketone bodies for fuel
      given the limited myocardial oxidation of glucose.

      This is a prospective, double-blinded, sequence control crossover trial enrolling NYHA Class
      II-III ambulatory heart failure patients to receive either ketone mono-ester drink versus
      placebo for two weeks. Following 2 weeks of therapy, echocardiogram and peak exercise test
      will be performed. There will be a 1-week &quot;washout&quot; period between phases. Subjects will
      serve as their own controls for this crossover study, as each will have both baseline testing
      and testing in the setting of mild nutritional ketosis.
