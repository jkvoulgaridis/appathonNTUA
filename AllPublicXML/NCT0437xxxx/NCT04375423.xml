  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ecological Momentary Assessment and Intervention (EMAI) is an emerging technique for
      gathering richer and more relevant data through repeated, longitudinal sampling of
      participants in their natural setting in order to deliver real-time interventions. The main
      study objective is to conduct a pilot EMAI study in Rakai, Uganda. Secondary objectives are
      to assess processes, facilitators, and barriers to EMAI. The study will compare behaviors
      between participants randomized to receive intervention messages and those not receiving
      messages. To assess EMAI validity and relevance, EMAI-collected behavioral data will be
      compared with traditional questionnaire-collected data.

      After recruitment, participants will be given a smartphone with an application that will
      collect geospatial coordinates and ask behavioral assessment questions on topics including
      diet/alcohol, smoking, and sexual behaviors. Participants will have training on the phone and
      application, demonstrating proficiency with the EMAI interface prior to study start.

      Days 1-30, Baseline Behaviors: Participants will complete assessment questions to establish
      baseline behaviors. This will include twice-daily and weekly behavioral report prompts and
      participant-initiated event-contingent behavioral reports. After the initial 30 day period,
      participants will return to the study office to complete a short questionnaire and to be
      randomized to the second phase of follow-up.

      Days 31-90, Randomized Evaluation: Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either
      continue assessment questions only (control arm) or to also begin receiving intervention
      messages (intervention arm) in response to reported behaviors. Messages will encourage
      positive behaviors and suggest alternatives to negative behaviors (e.g. &quot;Eating a mixed diet
      (meats and vegetables) is a healthy way to go.&quot;). At 90 days of follow-up, participants will
      return to the study office to complete a brief questionnaire on behaviors and smartphone
      experiences.

      Study hypotheses are as follows: EMAI can be successfully implemented in Uganda, and
      participants receiving intervention messaging will have improved self-reported health
      behaviors compared to controls; EMAI will be feasible and acceptable by this population; and,
      EMAI-collected data will correlate with traditional questionnaire-collected data.

      Outcomes will be assessed using descriptive statistics, multivariate regression and analysis
      of themes in patient EMAI experience and acceptability.

    <description>On smartphones, participants in this arm will receive twice daily and weekly prompts to report on behaviors under study and be able to send self-initiated event-contingent reports on behaviors under study. In response to the behaviors they report, they receive messages on their smartphones supporting ongoing healthy behaviors or suggesting alternative behaviors to limit risks. They will complete in-person assessments at enrollment, 30-days and study exit at 90-days.</description>
