    <textblock>
      This study will assess the control of inflammation at days 1, 7, 14, and 21 days following
      the vitreoretinal surgical procedure analyzing two randomized study arms: Intracanalicular
      dexamethasone insert group or topical steroid drop group.

      Patients must be 18 years of age and older, of any race and either sex, requiring surgery
      with the procedure type of pars plana vitrectomy for either the indication of macular hole,
      epiretinal membrane removal, or vitreomacular traction.

  <detailed_description>

      Topical steroids are the current standard of care for managing postoperative pain and
      inflammation following vitreoretinal surgery. However, topical treatments are limited by the
      potential for patient non-adherence and variation in drug concentrations due to the
      intermittent nature of application. A corticosteroid insert, placed following surgery,
      provides the advantages of reliable and continuous drug delivery without the need for
      patients to adhere to a treatment regimen. Recently, DEXTENZA®, a dexamethasone
      intracanalicular insert was FDA-approved for the treatment of inflammation and pain following
      ophthalmic surgery. DEXTENZA® is placed into the canaliculus via the lower punctum and is
      designed to release steroid medication for 30 days.

      The data is limited regarding the safety and efficacy of DEXTENZA® for postoperative
      management of vitreoretinal surgery. Herein, the aim of this study is to assess the
      management of pain and inflammation following retinal surgery when using a dexamethasone
      implant compared with topical steroids.
