      The objective of the investigators was to delineate the efficacy and safety of Ombitasvir,
      paritaprevir with ritonavir (OBV/PTV/r) plus ribavirin (RBV) on chronic HCV GT4 Egyptian
      naïve patients

      Direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) combination therapies from various mechanisms of action and
      families have been revolutionized the management landscape of chronic hepatitis C virus
      (HCV). Ombitasvir, paritaprevir with ritonavir (OBV/PTV/r) ± ribavirin (RBV) are approved to
      treat HCV genotype 4 (GT4) infection. Here, investigators' objective was to delineate the
      efficacy and safety of OBV/PTV/r plus RBV of HCV GT4 in the treatment of Egyptian naïve
      patients.

      Between 5 January and 8 September 2017, a cohort of 100 Egyptian patients infected with HCV
      GT4 was allocated and administered orally OBV/PTV/r with RBV, for 12 weeks, which given as
      oral tablets based on patient tolerability. The primary endpoint of investigators' study was
      a sustained virological response (HCV RNA &lt; 12 IU/mL) 12 weeks from the cessation of the
      treatment (SVR12).

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation observed after administering a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. A serious adverse event (SAE) is an event that results in, death, participant hospitalization, life-threatening, significant disability/incapacity, or a congenital anomaly.</description>
