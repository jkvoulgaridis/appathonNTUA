      A single-arm post-market follow up study (PMCF) comparing the DESyne X2 PMCF data to the
      historic DESyne acute performance data to confirm the performance of the DESyne X2 Novolimus
      Eluting Coronary Stent System with regards to the residual risks of lesion access and acute
      device implantation through visually-assessed angiographic endpoints and physician feedback.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient must be ≥ 18 years of age.

          2. The patient must have stable angina pectoris as defined by the Canadian Cardiovascular
             Society Classification, documented silent ischemia, acute coronary syndrome, or a
             positive functional study requiring treatment

          3. The patient is considered a candidate for coronary stent implantation and has a
             planned intervention of up to two lesions located in separate major epicardial
             territories. Each lesion/vessel must meet the following criteria:

               1. De novo lesion

               2. The target lesion reference site must be visually estimated to be ≥ 2.5 mm and ≤
                  4.0 mm in diameter

               3. The target vessel must be a major coronary artery or major branch with a visually
                  estimated stenosis of ≥ 50% and &lt; 100%.

               4. The visually estimated target lesion length must be ≤ 34 mm

               5. ≥ TIMI 1 coronary flow

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient has a known hypersensitivity or contraindication to aspirin, heparin,
             ticlopidine, clopidogrel, prasugrel or ticagrelor, heparin/bivalirudin, mTOR inhibitor
             class drugs, cobalt chromium alloy, methacrylate or polylactide polymer, or
             sensitivity to contrast which cannot be adequately premedicated

          2. Women of childbearing potential who have not undergone surgical sterilization or are
             not post-menopausal (defined as amenorrheic for at least one year) as well as women
             who are pregnant or nursing

          3. Previous placement of a stent within 10 mm distal to the target lesion

          4. Previous placement of a stent proximal to the target lesion

          5. Total occlusion or &lt; TIMI 1 coronary flow in the target vessel

          6. The proximal target vessel or target lesion is severely calcified by visual assessment

          7. Aorto-ostial location, unprotected left main lesion location, or a lesion within 5 mm
             of the origin of the left anterior descending or left circumflex

          8. Lesion involvement of a significant side branch (branch diameter &gt; 2 mm) that would be
             covered by stenting

          9. High probability that treatment other than PTCA or stenting will be required for
             treatment of the same lesion

         10. The target lesion, or the target vessel proximal to the target lesion, contains
             thrombus

         11. The patient has suffered a myocardial infarction within the past 72 hours and the CK
             or CK-MB has not returned to normal at the time of the index procedure

         12. The patient is a recipient of a heart transplant

         13. The patient has extensive peripheral vascular disease that precludes safe sheath
             insertion or extreme anti-coagulation

         14. The patient is currently participating in another investigational device or drug study
             that has not completed the primary follow-up phase

         15. Patients who are unable or unwilling to cooperate with study procedures
