  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, investigators propose to randomize 165 human immunodeficiency virus positive
      patients to one of three 16-week treatment conditions: (1) standard care; (2) standard care +
      cell phone-based adherence reminders; or (3) standard care + cell phone-based adherence
      reminders and contingency management. In this latter condition, patients will earn
      reinforcement for sending in time- and date-stamped self videos of antiretroviral therapy
      medication ingestion. Primary outcomes will include viral loads and self-report measures of
      adherence, and effects will be evaluated both during the treatment period and throughout a
      one-year follow-up. Investigators hypothesize that the cell phone reminder condition will
      improve adherence relative to standard care, and the cell phone reminder plus contingency
      management condition will have the best outcomes. Results from this study may have widespread
      implications for the use of cell phones as a novel technology to improve initial adherence to
      antiretroviral therapy, thereby reducing the spread of drug resistant human immunodeficiency
      virus strains to the community.
