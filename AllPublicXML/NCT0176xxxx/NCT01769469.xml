      This is a prospective observational cohort sub-study of subjects enrolled in the Adolescent
      Medicine Trials Network for HIV/AIDS Interventions (ATN) 110 (NCT01772823) or ATN 113
      (NCT01769456), which is a prospective interventional trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective observational cohort sub-study of subjects enrolled in the ATN 110
      (NCT01772823) or ATN 113 (NCT01769456) study. All subjects will be followed for at least 48
      weeks. Subjects who meet specific bone or renal criteria at Week 48 of the ATN 110
      (NCT01772823) or ATN 113 (NCT01769456) study will be followed for an additional 48 weeks in
      the Extension Phase of ATN 110 (NCT01772823) or ATN 113 (NCT01769456) and ATN 117
      (NCT01769469). The maximum duration of participation will be 96 weeks.

      There is no therapeutic intervention specific to this sub-study, and there are no extra study
      visits required for participation in this sub-study. Questionnaires will be administered and
      blood and urine samples for laboratory evaluation of potential emtricitabine (FTC)/tenofovir
      (TDF) (TruvadaÂ®) toxicities will be obtained for this sub-study at visits that are required
      by the ATN 110 (NCT01772823) or ATN 113 (NCT01769456) study. Measurement of bone mineral
      density (BMD) and bone mineral content (BMC) by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan
      are planned as a part of the ATN 110 (NCT01772823) and ATN 113 (NCT01769456) studies, and
      results will be utilized for the analysis in this study. This study does not require extra
      BMD or BMC measurements.

An average Z-score of zero would be expected in this group of healthy adolescents and young adults. An increase in Z-score would signify acceleration of accrual of bone mass, a positive outcome; a decrease in Z-score would signify either bone loss or failure to accrue the expected amount of bone mass, both of which are adverse outcomes.

    <measure>Magnitude of Change in Lumbar Spine BMD Z-score at Week 48</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and wk 48</time_frame>
    <description>The magnitude of change will be measured between Baseline and Week 48. For any given variable, at a given time point, the magnitude of change is the fold change compared to the baseline value (if multiplied by 100 would be the percent change from baseline).
The Z-score is the standard deviation around mean bone mineral density, adjusted for sex, age, and race/ethnicity. An average Z-score of zero would be expected in this group of healthy adolescents and young adults. An increase in Z-score would signify acceleration of accrual of bone mass, a positive outcome; a decrease in Z-score would signify either bone loss or failure to accrue the expected amount of bone mass, both of which are adverse outcomes. The Z-score is a normalized measure.</description>

        <title>Area Under the Drug Concentration by Time Curve (AUC): Change From Baseline to Week 24 in Lumbar Spine BMD Z-score, by Overall Drug Exposure</title>
        <description>Overall drug exposure categories were determined based on the overall tertiles of mean AUC dried blood spot (DBS) Red Blood Cell (RBC) Tenofovir Diphosphate (intracellular) (TFV-DP). Comparisons were performed between the high exposure group and the low exposure group.
The Z-score is the standard deviation around mean bone mineral density, adjusted for sex, age, and race/ethnicity. An average Z-score of zero would be expected in this group of healthy adolescents and young adults. An increase in Z-score would signify acceleration of accrual of bone mass, a positive outcome; a decrease in Z-score would signify either bone loss or failure to accrue the expected amount of bone mass, both of which are adverse outcomes. The Z-score is a normalized measure.
The time points at which data were collected were: weeks 4, 8, 12, and 24.</description>

          <title>Area Under the Drug Concentration by Time Curve (AUC): Change From Baseline to Week 48 in Femoral Neck BMD Z-score, by Overall Drug Exposure</title>
          <description>Overall drug exposure categories were determined based on the overall tertiles of mean AUC dried blood spot (DBS) Red Blood Cell (RBC) Tenofovir Diphosphate (intracellular) (TFV-DP). Comparisons were performed between the high exposure group and the low exposure group.
The Z-score is the standard deviation around mean bone mineral density, adjusted for sex, age, and race/ethnicity. An average Z-score of zero would be expected in this group of healthy adolescents and young adults. An increase in Z-score would signify acceleration of accrual of bone mass, a positive outcome; a decrease in Z-score would signify either bone loss or failure to accrue the expected amount of bone mass, both of which are adverse outcomes. The Z-score is a normalized measure.
The time points at which data were collected were: weeks 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 48.</description>

This measure shows the difference between the Baseline measure and the first Extension Phase visit (BL - EPH1).
The Z-score is the standard deviation around mean bone mineral density, adjusted for sex, age, and race/ethnicity. An average Z-score of zero would be expected in this group of healthy adolescents and young adults. An increase in Z-score would signify acceleration of accrual of bone mass, a positive outcome; a decrease in Z-score would signify either bone loss or failure to accrue the expected amount of bone mass, both of which are adverse outcomes. The Z-score is a normalized measure.</description>

        <title>Changes in BMD/BMC in the Extension Phase: Lumbar Spine BMD Z-score Change at EPH2 From Baseline</title>
        <description>For subjects in the extension phase of the study, the last measured values at the ATN 110 or ATN 113 study week 48 visit will be compared with those measured at the Extension Phase visit 1 (EPH 1, 24 weeks after the ATN 110 or ATN 113 study week 48 visit) and EPH 2 (48 weeks after the ATN 110 or ATN 113 study week 48 visit).
This measure shows the difference between the Baseline measure and the second Extension Phase visit (BL - EPH2)
The Z-score is the standard deviation around mean bone mineral density, adjusted for sex, age, and race/ethnicity. An average Z-score of zero would be expected in this group of healthy adolescents and young adults. An increase in Z-score would signify acceleration of accrual of bone mass, a positive outcome; a decrease in Z-score would signify either bone loss or failure to accrue the expected amount of bone mass, both of which are adverse outcomes.

This measure shows the difference between the Baseline measure and the first Extension Phase visit (BL - EPH1)
The Z-score is the standard deviation around mean bone mineral density, adjusted for sex, age, and race/ethnicity. An average Z-score of zero would be expected in this group of healthy adolescents and young adults. An increase in Z-score would signify acceleration of accrual of bone mass, a positive outcome; a decrease in Z-score would signify either bone loss or failure to accrue the expected amount of bone mass, both of which are adverse outcomes.

          <title>Changes in BMD/BMC in the Extension Phase: Femoral Neck BMD Z-score Change at EPH2 From Week 48 (or Last Visit on Study)</title>
          <description>For subjects in the extension phase of the study, the last measured values at the ATN 110 or ATN 113 study week 48 visit will be compared with those measured at the Extension Phase visit 1 (EPH 1, 24 weeks after the ATN 110 or ATN 113 study week 48 visit) and EPH 2 (48 weeks after the ATN 110 or ATN 113 study week 48 visit).
This measure shows the difference between the last measure on study and the second Extension Phase visit (Last - EPH2).
The Z-score is the standard deviation around mean bone mineral density, adjusted for sex, age, and race/ethnicity. An average Z-score of zero would be expected in this group of healthy adolescents and young adults. An increase in Z-score would signify acceleration of accrual of bone mass, a positive outcome; a decrease in Z-score would signify either bone loss or failure to accrue the expected amount of bone mass, both of which are adverse outcomes. The Z-score is a normalized measure.</description>
