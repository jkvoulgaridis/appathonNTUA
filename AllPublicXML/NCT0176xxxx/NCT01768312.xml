      The purpose of this clinical Study is Tisporin Eye Drops 0.05%(Cyclosporine ophthalmic
      solution) group and Restasis Eye Drops 0.05%(Cyclosporine ophthalmic suspension) group 12
      weeks after treatment, each treatment group comparisons for evaluation of efficacy and safety
      in Moderate to Severe Dry Eye Disease.

    <description>The degree of staining of the cornea after blue fluorescein staining under the slit lamp illumination of a cobalt blue light source using a yellow filter was evaluated on a 6 point scale according to the oxford grading system</description>

    <measure>Tear break up time (TBUT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Administered 4, 8, 12 weeks after</time_frame>
    <description>After blinking blue fluorescein staining of the cobalt blue light source using a yellow filter, it was observed from the blinking point that there was a black spot, a streak pattern or a fluorine defect in the fluorescein-tear layer Was measured in seconds. The measurement results were repeated three times and average values were used.</description>

    <measure>Corneal staining test</measure>
    <time_frame>Administered 4, 8 weeks after</time_frame>
    <description>Corneal staining was performed at each visit. The degree of staining of the cornea after blue fluorescein staining under the slit lamp illumination of a cobalt blue light source using a yellow filter was evaluated on a 6 point scale according to the oxford grading system</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Ocular surface disease index (OSDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Administered 4, 8, 12 weeks after</time_frame>
    <description>The ocular surface disease index was assessed for ocular surface disease, including visual function (five items), eye symptoms (four items), and environmental factors (three items) , 0 point for no symptoms, 1 point for occasional symptoms, 2 points for symptoms of half a day, 3 points for most symptoms, and 4 points for symptoms during the whole day.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Non-anesthetic Schirmer test</measure>
    <time_frame>Administered 4, 8, 12 weeks after</time_frame>
    <description>After the eyes were examined, the eyes were wiped and the Schirmer test paper was inserted into the right eye at 1/3 of the lower eyelid without eye anesthesia and inserted into the left eye. After 5 minutes with the eyes closed, the Schirmer test paper was removed from the right side in the order of insertion and the left side removed. The wet length was measured in millimeters and the length of the midpoint was measured when the wet border was oblique.</description>

    <measure>Conjunctival staining</measure>
    <time_frame>Administered 4, 8, 12 weeks after</time_frame>
    <description>After lysamine green staining under slit lamps, the conjunctiva was divided into the nasal side and the lateral side, and the degree of nasal conjunctiva and bilateral conjunctival staining was evaluated on a 6-point scale according to the oxford grading system</description>
