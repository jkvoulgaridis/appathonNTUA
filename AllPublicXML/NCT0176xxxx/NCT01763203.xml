  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test a newly-developed outpatient clinic and community-based
      care intervention called SUCCEED (Secondary stroke prevention by Uniting Community and
      Chronic care model teams Early to End Disparities) for improving control of stroke risk
      factors among stroke patients in the Los Angeles County &quot;safety net&quot;, and to measure the
      costs of running such an intervention, relative to usual care.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals randomized to the intervention arm will receive care from a team that consists of
      a care manager(CM) who is either a nurse practitioner (NP) or physician assistant (PA),
      supervised by the site PI, and a community health worker (CHW). The CM will follow care
      protocols developed by the research team. The CHW will serve as a liaison between the patient
      and the health care system, and mobilize resources and system support to reduce social
      isolation and improve stroke risk factor control self-management, through a series of
      workshops and home visits. Intervention participants will receive home blood pressure
      monitors. Subjects in either arm are eligible to receive their usual source of care. Five
      hundred participants who have had a stroke or TIA will be enrolled, randomized to the
      intervention or to usual care in a 1:1 ratio, and followed for 12 months. The impact of the
      intervention on systolic blood pressure is the primary study outcome; secondary outcomes are
      other stroke risk factors. Enrollment will occur at four sites in Los Angeles County, and the
      study sample is projected to include over 90% socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals
      from minority groups.

Do not include fried potatoes.&quot; For each question, the participant gives a number, and the frequency (per day, per week, or per month) is also recorded. Responses are converted to a number for day for each question, then summed across the two questions. The question is scored as a dichotomous variable of five or more servings of fruit and vegetables per day versus less than five servings of fruit and vegetables per day. The questions will also be collected at baseline and at 3 months, to track changes over the entire study period</description>

An open-ended question about what the participant believes is a stroke risk factor (&quot;I would like to ask you about stroke risk factors, those are the things that make it more likely for somebody to have a stroke. From anything you might have heard or read, what do you believe are the risk factors associated with stroke? What else...what else?&quot;, will be asked, then converted to three dichotomous variables: correct about at least 3 stroke risk factors versus less than three; correct about at least one stroke risk factor versus none correct; and reports that blood pressure is a stroke risk factor versus does not.

        <description>Two questions from the California Health Interview Survey (CHIS) 2011-2012 will be collected as part of the 12-month outcome survey. The questions are &quot;During the past month, how many times did you eat fruit? Do not count juices&quot; and &quot;During the past month, how many times did you eat any other vegetables like green salad, green beans or potatoes? Do not include fried potatoes.&quot; For each question, the participant gives a number, and the frequency (per day, per week, or per month) is also recorded. Responses are converted to a number for day for each question, then summed across the two questions. The question is scored as a dichotomous variable of five or more servings of fruit and vegetables per day versus less than five servings of fruit and vegetables per day. The questions will also be collected at baseline and at 3 months, to track changes over the entire study period</description>

          <title>Fruit and Vegetable Intake</title>
          <description>Two questions from the California Health Interview Survey (CHIS) 2011-2012 will be collected as part of the 12-month outcome survey. The questions are &quot;During the past month, how many times did you eat fruit? Do not count juices&quot; and &quot;During the past month, how many times did you eat any other vegetables like green salad, green beans or potatoes? Do not include fried potatoes.&quot; For each question, the participant gives a number, and the frequency (per day, per week, or per month) is also recorded. Responses are converted to a number for day for each question, then summed across the two questions. The question is scored as a dichotomous variable of five or more servings of fruit and vegetables per day versus less than five servings of fruit and vegetables per day. The questions will also be collected at baseline and at 3 months, to track changes over the entire study period</description>

        <description>A single question from the California Health Interview Survey 2011-2012 Adult Questionnaire will be collected as part of the 12-month outcome survey. The question asks whether over the interval since the previous study interview, &quot;were you smoking cigarettes every day, some days, or not at all?&quot; The question will also be collected at baseline (with a time frame of over the prior year) and at 3 months, to track changes over the entire study period. The scoring for this outcome is dichotomous: &quot;Smoking&quot; = a response of 'every day' or 'some days', versus &quot;Not smoking&quot; = a response of 'not at all.'</description>

This questionnaire will also be collected every 6 months for up to 24 months after the study is completed to check for vascular events. The scoring was dichotomous: at least one new event (stroke, transient ischemic attack, or heart attack) versus none over the 12-month follow-up period.</description>

        <description>A continuous measure of adherence as percentage of doses taken over the prior 7-day time period will be collected at 12 months and calculated for antithrombotic medication, using a previously published formula.
