  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study has 2 parts. Each participant will receive a daily injection of LY2605541 during
      one treatment period and a daily injection of insulin glargine during one treatment period.
      Each treatment period is 2 to 3 weeks and is followed by a procedure to lower blood sugar
      levels to see how the body recovers after each treatment.
