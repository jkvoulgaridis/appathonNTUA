        <description>Participants rated severity of their pain at 11 point PI-NRS, by choosing a number between 0 and 10. Where 0= no pain and 10= worst possible pain; higher scores signify more pain.

        <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. A treatment emergent AE was defined as an event that emerged during the treatment period that was absent before treatment, or worsened during the treatment period relative to the pretreatment state.</description>
