    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well irinotecan hydrochloride and temozolomide
      with temsirolimus or dinutuximab work in treating younger patients with neuroblastoma that
      has returned or does not respond to treatment. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as irinotecan
      hydrochloride and temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,
      either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from
      spreading. Temsirolimus may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as dinutuximab, may find tumor cells and
      help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. It is not yet known whether giving
      irinotecan hydrochloride and temozolomide together with temsirolimus or dinutuximab is more
      effective in treating neuroblastoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To identify whether temsirolimus or ch14.18 (dinutuximab) is the optimal therapeutic agent
      to consider for further testing in a future Phase III randomized trial for treatment of newly
      diagnosed high-risk neuroblastoma.

      II. To determine the response rate of patients with relapsed, refractory or progressive
      neuroblastoma following treatment with irinotecan, temozolomide and ch14.18 (dinutuximab) and
      to compare this with the known response rate of patients treated with irinotecan and
      temozolomide alone.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the response rates (RR) for patients receiving temsirolimus or ch14.18
      (dinutuximab) in combination with irinotecan (irinotecan hydrochloride) and temozolomide.

      II. To compare the progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) rates for
      patients receiving temsirolimus or ch14.18 (dinutuximab) in combination with irinotecan and
      temozolomide.

      III. To compare the toxicities associated with temsirolimus or ch14.18 (dinutuximab) when
      combined with irinotecan and temozolomide in patients with refractory, relapsed or
      progressive neuroblastoma.

      IV. To compare the ability to maintain intended dose intensity of all agents when
      temsirolimus or ch14.18 (dinutuximab) is combined with irinotecan and temozolomide in
      patients with refractory, relapsed or progressive neuroblastoma.

      V. To determine the concordance between tumor responses as defined by standard International
      Neuroblastoma Response Criteria (INRC) versus response per the revised INRC.

      VI. To study the clinical relevance of naturally occurring anti-glycan antibodies in patients
      receiving ch14.18 (dinutuximab) antibody.

      VII. To study the clinical relevance of natural killer (NK) receptor natural cytotoxicity
      triggering receptor 3 (NKp30) isoforms in patients receiving ch14.18 (dinutuximab) antibody
      or temsirolimus.

      VIII. To study the association between host factors and response to irinotecan, temozolomide
      and ch14.18 (dinutuximab).

      IX. To characterize the tumor immune-microenvironment (gene expression; immune effector
      cells, activities and signaling molecules; immune target expression) following treatment with
      irinotecan, temozolomide and ch14.18 (dinutuximab).

      X. To study the association between changes in the tumor immune-microenvironment (gene
      expression; immune effector cells, activities and signaling molecules; immune target
      expression) with response following treatment with irinotecan, temozolomide and ch14.18
      (dinutuximab).

      XI. To study the association between tumor genomic and transcriptomic aberrations as well as
      levels of circulating ganglioside (GD2) with response to irinotecan, temozolomide and ch14.18
      (dinutuximab).

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I (CLOSED TO ACCRUAL 06/17/2016): Patients receive temozolomide orally (PO) on days 1-5,
      irinotecan hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes on days 1-5, and temsirolimus IV
      over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8.

      ARM II: Patients receive temozolomide PO on days 1-5, irinotecan hydrochloride over 90
      minutes on days 1-5, dinutuximab IV over 10-20 hours on days 2-5, and sargramostim
      subcutaneously (SC) or IV over 2 hours on days 6-12.

      In both arms, treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 17 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.

             minimum of 4 weeks prior to study entry at the site of any lesion that will be
             identified as a target lesion to measure tumor response; lesions that have been
             previously radiated cannot be used as target lesions unless there is radiographic
             evidence of progression at the site following radiation or a biopsy done following
             radiation shows viable neuroblastoma; palliative radiation is allowed to sites that

          -  Serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT) (alanine aminotransferase [ALT]) =&lt; 5.0 x
             ULN for age (=&lt; 225 U/L); for the purpose of this study, the ULN for SGPT is 45 U/L

          -  Adequate central nervous system function defined as:

               -  Patients with a history of central nervous system (CNS) disease must have no
                  clinical or radiological evidence of CNS disease at the time of study enrollment

               -  Patients with seizure disorders may be enrolled if seizures are well controlled
                  on anticonvulsants

               -  CNS toxicity =&lt; grade 2

          -  Shortening fraction of &gt;= 27% by echocardiogram (ECHO) OR

          -  Ejection fraction &gt;= 50% by ECHO or gated radionuclide study

          -  Adequate coagulation defined as:

               -  Prothrombin time (PT) =&lt; 1.2 x upper limit of normal

          -  Adequate pulmonary function defined as:

               -  No evidence of dyspnea at rest, no exercise intolerance, no chronic oxygen
                  requirement, and room air pulse oximetry &gt; 94% if there is a clinical indication
                  for pulse oximetry; normal pulmonary function tests in patients who are capable
                  of cooperating with testing (including diffusion capacity of the lung of carbon
                  monoxide [DLCO]) are required if there is a clinical indication for
                  determination; for patients who do not have respiratory symptoms, full pulmonary
                  function tests (PFTs) are NOT required

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Men and women of childbearing potential and their partners must agree to use adequate
             contraception while enrolled on this study; based on the established teratogenic
             potential of alkylating agents, pregnant women will be excluded from this study;
             female patients who are lactating must agree to stop breastfeeding or will otherwise
             be excluded from this study; females of childbearing potential must have a negative
             pregnancy test to be eligible for this study

          -  Patients with elevated catecholamines (i.e., &gt; 2 x ULN) only or bone marrow disease
             only are NOT eligible for this study

          -  Patients must have been off pharmacologic doses of systemic steroids for at least 7
             days prior to enrollment; patients who require or are likely to require pharmacologic
             doses of systemic corticosteroids while receiving treatment on this study are
             ineligible; the only exception is for patients known to require 2 mg/kg or less of
             hydrocortisone (or an equivalent dose of an alternative corticosteroid) as
             premedication for blood product administration in order to avoid allergic transfusion
             reactions; the use of conventional doses of inhaled steroids for the treatment of
             asthma is permitted, as is the use of physiologic doses of steroids for patients with
             known adrenal insufficiency

          -  Patients must not have received enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants including phenytoin,
             phenobarbital, valproic acid, or carbamazepine for at least 7 days prior to study
             enrollment; patients receiving non-enzyme inducing anticonvulsants such as gabapentin
             or levetiracetam will be eligible

          -  Patients must not have been diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome or with any
             malignancy other than neuroblastoma

          -  Patients with symptoms of congestive heart failure are not eligible

          -  Patients must not have &gt;= grade 2 diarrhea

          -  Patients must not have uncontrolled infection

          -  Patients with a history of grade 4 allergic reactions to anti-GD2 antibodies or
             reactions that required discontinuation of the anti-GD2 therapy are not eligible

          -  Patients with a significant intercurrent illness (any ongoing serious medical problem
             unrelated to cancer or its treatment) that is not covered by the detailed exclusion
             criteria and that is expected to interfere with the action of study agents or to
             significantly increase the severity of the toxicities experienced from study treatment
             are not eligible

        <description>The percentage of patients who are responders will be tabulated, including a 95% confidence interval on the response rate. Responders are defined as patients who achieve a best overall response of complete response (CR), very good partial response (VGPR), or partial response (PR) per the International Neuroblastoma Response Criteria (INRC). Per INRC: CR= Disappearance of all target lesions. No evidence of tumor at any site; VGPR= &gt;90% decrease of the disease measurement for CT/MRI target lesions. All pre-existing bone lesions with CR by MIBG; MIBG scan can be stable disease (SD) or CR in soft tissue lesions corresponding to lesions on CT/MRI. CR in bone marrow. No new sites of tumor; PR= &gt;=30% decrease in the disease measurement for CT/MRI target lesions. Bone marrow with CR. MIBG with either PR/CR in bone lesions; MIBG may be SD or CR in soft tissue lesions corresponding to lesions on CT/MRI. Homovanillic acid (HVA)/Vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) may still be elevated.</description>
