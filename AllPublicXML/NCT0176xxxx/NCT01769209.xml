      This study evaluates the value of bortezomib in combination with specified chemotherapies for
      the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
      Bortezomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for
      cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      Determine the response rate of bortezomib in combination with a chemotherapy backbone of
      doxorubicin (doxorubicin hydrochloride), vincristine (vincristine sulfate), PEG-asparaginase
      (pegaspargase), and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic
      leukemia.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  Estimate the rate of complete response (CR) and CR with incomplete platelet recovery
           (CRp) on Day 29 after re-induction.

        -  Determine progression-free survival (PFS) at 2 years after re-induction.

        -  Determine failure-free survival (FFS) at 1 year after re-induction.

        -  Overall survival (OS) at 1 year after re-induction.

        -  Assess safety and tolerability of the study drug.

        -  Determine whether bortezomib induces reactive oxygen species (ROS) in circulating acute
           lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) blast cells.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive bortezomib subcutaneously (SC) on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11; doxorubicin
      hydrochloride intravenously (IV) on day 1; pegaspargase IV or intramuscularly (IM) on Days 5
      and 22; vincristine sulfate IV on days 1, 8, 15, and 22; dexamethasone orally (PO) daily on
      Days 1 to 14; cytarabine intrathecally (IT) on Day 1 and methotrexate intrathecally (IT) on
      Day 15. Patients with central nervous system disease receive intrathecal treatment per
      investigator's discretion.

      Participants are followed up every 3 months for up to 2 years after completion of study
      treatment.

    <time_frame>Day 29</time_frame>
    <description>Response Rate (RR) was determined as the sum of complete response (CR) and partial response (PR).

CR = No circulating blasts or extramedullary disease; trilineage hematopoiesis; absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt; 1,000/microliter; platelets &gt; 100,000/microliter; &lt; 5% blasts in bone marrow.
CRp = Meets all criteria for CR except platelet count.
PR = Meets all criteria for CR except bone marrow contains 5 to 25% leukemia cells.</description>

    <measure>Complete Response (CR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 29</time_frame>
    <description>Complete response (CR) was determined the number of participants who achieved CR by Day 29 after induction treatment. The outcome is reported as the total number without dispersion. CR is defined as:
CR = No circulating blasts or extramedullary disease; trilineage hematopoiesis; absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt; 1,000/microliter; platelets &gt; 100,000/microliter; &lt; 5% blasts in bone marrow.

    <time_frame>Day 29</time_frame>
    <description>Complete response without platelet recovery (CR) was determined as the number of participants who achieved CRp by Day 29 after induction treatment. The outcome is reported as the total number without dispersion. The outcome reflects only those subjects that meet all complete response (CR) criteria except platelet count; participants that meet all criteria including platelet count are not included in this outcome. CR and CRp are defined below.
CR =.No circulating blasts or extramedullary disease; trilineage hematopoiesis; absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt; 1,000/microliter; platelets &gt; 100,000/microliter; &lt; 5% blasts in bone marrow.
