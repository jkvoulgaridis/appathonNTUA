  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The SBRT (stereotactic body radiation therapy) literature focuses on clinical outcomes in the
      adult population. However, SBRT (stereotactic body radiation therapy) has a particularly
      strong rationale for application in pediatrics given that high biologically effective doses
      have been shown to increase control in histologies, such as sarcoma, which are common in the
      pediatrics population (11,25). With stereotactic radiation therapy techniques, a reduction in
      normal tissue dose surrounding the target lesion of interest may also be accomplished
      resulting in lower toxicity. Given that pediatric patients with sarcomas, presenting with
      limited metastases in lung and bone, are still considered to be a curable population with
      aggressive local therapy, SBRT could have a significant impact on outcomes in oligometastatic
      patients who may be otherwise unresectable (25-28).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pediatric patients with sarcoma who have limited metastases are still potentially curable
      with aggressive local therapy. However, conventional moderate dose radiation is unlikely to
      provide durable local control. Given the recent technologic advances in radiation delivery,
      it is now possible to deliver tumoricidal doses, using stereotactic radiation over a short
      time course with highly focal techniques. Stereotactic radiation has proven efficacious in
      the intracranial setting and in multiple extracranial sites in adults. It has not yet been
      well studied in the pediatrics population where there is a particularly strong rationale due
      to the ablative doses that can be delivered to tumor while simultaneously reducing high dose
      to normal tissues. The proposed trial is a single arm phase II study to determine the
      efficacy of SBRT in pediatric sarcomas with surgically unresectable metastatic disease.
      Oligometastatic sites eligible for treatment in this study include bony sites of disease.
      SBRT will be delivered to each eligible site to a total dose of 4000 delivered in 5 fractions
      of 800 per fractions each day. Following completion of SBRT, patients will undergo treatment
      response assessment with the use of diagnostic imaging, clinical examination, and completion
      of the Brief Pain Inventory to assess quality of life. The primary objective of this study is
      to determine the efficacy of SBRT delivered to a dose of 4000 in 5 fractions of 800 each for
      patients greater than 3 years of age and &lt; 40 years of age with metastatic disease of bone
      secondary to pediatric sarcoma. The secondary objectives of this study include describing the
      toxicity of SBRT with this regimen; assessing clinical response rate of each target lesion;
      assessing long-term clinical outcomes; and assessing quality of life following completion of
      treatment. For patients with potentially curable oligometastatic disease, surgical resection
      in conjunction with systemic therapy remains the standard of care. Patients on this study
      will continue to receive chemotherapy outside of the 2 week window for SBRT. Issues that may
      limit participation include our inability to assess late effects that may not develop till at
      least 10 years after therapy. For this reason, we will limit the population in this study to
      patients who are surgically unresectable and would be otherwise incurable with current
      standard systemic therapies.
