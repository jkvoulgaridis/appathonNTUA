  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multinational, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study
      using a Bayesian design with response adaptive randomization across placebo or 5 active arms
      of BAN2401 to determine clinical efficacy and to explore the dose response of BAN2401 using a
      composite clinical score (ADCOMS). BAN2401-G000-201 Core study is an 18-month study in which
      3 dose levels (2.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg) are given biweekly (once every 2 weeks) to separate
      groups of participants and 2 dose levels (5 and 10 mg/kg) are given monthly (once every 4
      weeks) to separate groups of participants. Participants will be from 2 clinical subgroups:
      mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) or mild Alzheimer's disease
      dementia. Frequent interim analyses will be conducted to continually update randomization
      allocation on the basis of the primary clinical endpoint. Any participant who completes the
      study treatment (Visit 42 [Week 79] of the Core study) or discontinues the Core Study will be
      eligible to participate in the Extension Phase, provided they meet the Extension Phase
      inclusion and exclusion criteria. Participants will receive 10 mg/kg biweekly for up to 24
      months or until the drug is commercially available in the country, where the subject resides,
      or until the benefit-to-risk ratio from treatment with BAN2401 is no longer considered
      favorable, whichever comes first. The Follow-up Visit in the Extension Phase will take place
      3 months after the last dose of study drug.

             ferromagnetic metal implants, e,g., in skull and cardiac devices other than those
             approved as safe for use in MR scanners

          6. Evidence of other clinically significant lesions that could indicate a dementia
