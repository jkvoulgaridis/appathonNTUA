    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if digital photography on a Smartphone and the
      Remote Food Photography Method (RFPM) can estimate infant formula intake. This is a
      validation study; there is no hypothesis.

    <description>Kilocalorie difference between the Remote Food Photography Method and direct weighing separately analyzed by the four different bottle sizes that were prepared (2 oz bottles only, 4 oz bottles only, 6 oz bottles only, and 8 oz bottles only). Each participant prepared 3 sets of 2 oz bottles, 3 sets of 4 oz bottles, 3 sets of 6 oz bottles, and 3 sets of 8 oz bottles and all bottles of the specified size were included in the analysis.

Each participant prepared 3 sets of 2 oz bottles, 3 sets of 4 oz bottles, 3 sets of 6 oz bottles, and 3 sets of 8 oz bottles and all bottles of the specified size were included in the analysis.
Kilocalorie difference is Remote Food Photography Method - Direct Weighing</description>
        <time_frame>Measures will be performed twice about 5-10 days apart</time_frame>
        <population>Since Cohort 2 had a modified protocol where the step involving photographs and direct weights of bottles with powdered formula only was not completed, the kilocalories for all participants in Cohort 2 cannot be determined. Powder not water is the source of kilocalories in formula; we could not accurately determine kilocalories without this step.</population>

          <title>Kilocalorie (Kcal) Difference Between Different Bottle Sizes</title>
          <description>Kilocalorie difference between the Remote Food Photography Method and direct weighing separately analyzed by the four different bottle sizes that were prepared (2 oz bottles only, 4 oz bottles only, 6 oz bottles only, and 8 oz bottles only). Each participant prepared 3 sets of 2 oz bottles, 3 sets of 4 oz bottles, 3 sets of 6 oz bottles, and 3 sets of 8 oz bottles and all bottles of the specified size were included in the analysis.

We anticipate most adverse events will be mild and the participant will be able to resume activities within a day or two of reporting the event.

    <limitations_and_caveats>Without powder alone, kilocalories for all participants in Cohort 2 cannot be determined due to the protocol modification completed prior to Cohort 2. Therefore, primary and secondary outcome results cannot be determined for Cohort 2 participants.</limitations_and_caveats>
