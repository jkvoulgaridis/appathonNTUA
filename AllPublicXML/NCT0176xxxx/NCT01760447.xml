  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of the addition of sitagliptin
      (administered as MK-0431A XR) compared with the addition of placebo to therapy with
      extended-release metformin (metformin XR) for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus
      (T2DM) in pediatric participants with inadequate glycemic control on metformin therapy (alone
      or in combination with insulin). The primary hypothesis is that the addition of sitagliptin
      reduces hemoglobin A1c (A1C) more than the addition of placebo after 20 weeks of treatment.

    <description>Phase A: two sitagliptin + extended-release (XR) metformin fixed-dose combination (FDC) tablets (MK-0431A XR) orally daily (total daily dose: 100 mg sitagliptin and 1000, 1500 or 2000 mg metformin XR) plus two placebo to metformin XR tablets plus/minus background insulin for 20 weeks. Insulin glargine may be administered, or background insulin may be up-titrated as glycemic rescue therapy during Phase A of the study. Phase B: two sitagliptin + metformin XR FDC tablets orally daily (total daily dose: 100 mg sitagliptin and 1000, 1500 or 2000 mg metformin XR) plus two placebo to metformin XR tablets plus/minus background insulin for 34 weeks. Insulin glargine may be administered, or background insulin may be up-titrated during Phase B of the study depending on the participants' glucose and A1C levels.</description>
