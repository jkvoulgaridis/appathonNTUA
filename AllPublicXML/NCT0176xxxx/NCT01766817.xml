  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if study drug (BMS-986020) dose of 600 mg once
      daily or 600 mg twice daily for 26 weeks compared with placebo will reduce the decline in
      forced vital capacity (FVC) and will be well tolerated in subjects with idiopathic pulmonary
      fibrosis (IPF).

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) Rate to Week 26</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>FVC is the is the total amount of air exhaled during the forced expiratory volume test that is measured during spirometry; and is the most important measurement of lung function. This test requires participant to breath into a tube connected to a machine that measures the amount of air that can be moved in and out of the lungs after taking an inhaled bronchodilator medicine which is used to dilate participant's bronchial (breathing) tubes.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Geometric Mean Ratio (GMR) of Quantitative Lung Fibrosis (QLF) Score at Week 26 to Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>The QLF score itself ranges from 0 to 100%, where greater values represent a greater amount of lung fibrosis and are considered a worse health status. Hence smaller geometric mean ratios to baseline were considered favorable. Baseline included all testing done on Day -1 as well as predose on Day 1.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Six-minute Walk Test (6MWT) Distance to Week 26</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>The 6MWT measures the distance (in meters), a participant is able to walk in 6 minutes. This test measures the distance a person can walk quickly on a flat, hard surface in 6 minutes and reflects an individual's ability to perform daily physical activities. Baseline included all testing done on Day -1 as well as predose on Day 1</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) to Week 26</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>FVC is is the total amount of air exhaled during the forced expiratory volume test that is measured during spirometry; and is the most important measurement of lung function. This test requires participant to breath into a tube connected to a machine that measures the amount of air that can be moved in and out of lungs after taking an inhaled bronchodilator medicine which is used to dilate bronchial (breathing) tubes.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Quality of Life as Measured by the Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) to Week 26</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 determines participants' overall quality of life by assessing 1) limitations in physical functioning due to health problems; 2) limitations in usual role because of physical health problems; 3) bodily pain; 4) general health perceptions; 5) vitality; 6) limitations in social functioning because of physical or emotional problems; 7) limitations in usual role due to emotional problems; and 8) general mental health. Items 1-4 primarily contribute to the Aggregate Physical score of the SF-36. Items 5-8 primarily contribute to the Aggregate mental score of the SF-36. Scores on each item are summed and averaged. Range for Aggregate Physical Score : 0=worst to 100=best; and for Aggregate Mental Score: 0=worst to 100=best. Increases from baseline indicate improvement. Baseline included all testing done on Day -1 as well as predose on Day 1</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Carbon Monoxide Diffusing Capacity (DLCO) to Week 26</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>DLCO is a measurement of the ability of the lungs to transfer gases from the air to the blood. Participant breathe in (inhale) air containing a very small, harmless amount of a tracer gas, such as carbon monoxide. Participant hold the breath for 10 seconds, then rapidly blow it out (exhale). The exhaled gas was tested to determine how much of the tracer gas was absorbed during the breath. DLCO, both uncorrected and corrected for hemoglobin in milliliter per minute per millimeter of mercury (mL/min/mmHg) was assessed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Definite or Probable Acute Exacerbation (AEx) of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Upto Day 210</time_frame>
    <description>Acute IPF exacerbations is defined as a clinically significant deterioration of unidentifiable cause in a participant with underlying IPF. Exacerbations of IPF were adjudicated as definite (&gt;=1 AEx) and Probable. Investigators were asked to make the diagnosis of acute exacerbation of IPF on the basis of subjective worsening over 30 days or less, new bilateral radiographic opacities, and the absence of infection or another identifiable etiology. The final diagnosis, however, was confirmed by the study medical monitor.</description>

             phosphatase greater than 2.5 x ULN.

          2. Has creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/minute, calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault
             formula.

             greater or an uncorrected QT of 500 msec or greater at screening. Note: For subjects
             with a machine read QT interval of &gt;500 msec, if their heart rate is &gt; 100 bpm, the
             machine read QT interval (either corrected or not) may not be accurate. If the
             investigator is uncertain about the QT abnormality, it is recommended that ECGs be
             over-read by a cardiologist. The manually read QT interval by a cardiologist should be
             used for assessment of eligibility whenever possible.

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Quality of Life as Measured by the Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) to Week 26</title>
        <description>The SF-36 determines participants' overall quality of life by assessing 1) limitations in physical functioning due to health problems; 2) limitations in usual role because of physical health problems; 3) bodily pain; 4) general health perceptions; 5) vitality; 6) limitations in social functioning because of physical or emotional problems; 7) limitations in usual role due to emotional problems; and 8) general mental health. Items 1-4 primarily contribute to the Aggregate Physical score of the SF-36. Items 5-8 primarily contribute to the Aggregate mental score of the SF-36. Scores on each item are summed and averaged. Range for Aggregate Physical Score : 0=worst to 100=best; and for Aggregate Mental Score: 0=worst to 100=best. Increases from baseline indicate improvement. Baseline included all testing done on Day -1 as well as predose on Day 1</description>

        <description>DLCO is a measurement of the ability of the lungs to transfer gases from the air to the blood. Participant breathe in (inhale) air containing a very small, harmless amount of a tracer gas, such as carbon monoxide. Participant hold the breath for 10 seconds, then rapidly blow it out (exhale). The exhaled gas was tested to determine how much of the tracer gas was absorbed during the breath. DLCO, both uncorrected and corrected for hemoglobin in milliliter per minute per millimeter of mercury (mL/min/mmHg) was assessed.</description>

        <description>Clearance of a drug is a measure of the rate at which a drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. Clearance obtained after oral dose (apparent oral clearance) is influenced by the fraction of the dose absorbed. Drug clearance is a quantitative measure of the rate at which a drug substance is removed from the blood.</description>
