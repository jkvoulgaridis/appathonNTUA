      Phase II trial in which patients with metastatic solid tumors experiencing progression after
      first line standard chemotherapy or for which there is no standard chemotherapy, and for
      which pembrolizumab does not have an FDA or compendia listing approved indication, will
      receive pembrolizumab intravenously at a dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with metastatic or recurrent solid malignancy who have progressed on first line
      standard of care treatment or for which defined standard of care does not exist or is not
      readily available are eligible to participate on this trial. Patients for which pembrolizumab
      has an FDA approved indication and for whom pembrolizumab is covered by their insurance
      should receive standard commercial pembrolizumab and will not be eligible for this trial.

      The primary objective of this trial is to evaluate the Immune-Related Objective Response Rate
      (IR-ORR) achieved with pembrolizumab in patients with Fanconi Anemia Repair Pathway
      functionally competent and functionally deficient tumors.

      Trial treatment should be administered on Day 1 of each cycle after all
      procedures/assessments have been completed. Trial treatment may be administered up to 3 days
      before or after the scheduled Day 1 of each cycle due to administrative reasons.

      All trial treatments will be administered on an outpatient basis.

      Pembrolizumab 200 mg will be administered as a 30 minute IV infusion every 3 weeks. Target
      infusion timing is 30 minutes.

      Expansion Cohort:

      Ten (10) additional subjects with the diagnosis of metastatic or recurrent endometrial
      carcinoma will be enrolled in the trial at the conclusion of regular enrollment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have measurable disease based on RECIST 1.1.

          -  Be willing to provide consent for retrieval of archival tumor material tissue from a
             previously obtained core or excisional biopsy of a tumor lesion.

          -  Have a tumor presentation at screening for which pembrolizumab does not have an FDA
             approved indication for commercial use.

          -  Have a performance status of 0, 1 or 2 on the ECOG Performance Scale.

          -  Demonstrate adequate organ function

          -  Female subject of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum
             pregnancy within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication.

        Expansion cohort - additional criteria

          1. Diagnosis of Endometrial Carcinoma or Sarcoma which is metastatic and has failed
             standard treatment or is recurrent, or for which standard chemotherapy is
             contraindicated or refused by patient.

          2. Sufficient tissue is available for correlative studies

          3. MSI studies have been performed, either by immunohistochemistry or next generation
             sequencing and results show that patient is MS low or stable.

          -  Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy. Note:
