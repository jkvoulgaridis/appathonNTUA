  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      OTL-300 is a gene therapy drug product consisting of autologous hematopoietic stem/progenitor
      cluster of differentiation (CD) 34+ cells genetically modified with a lentiviral vector
      (GLOBE) encoding the human beta globin gene. The TIGET-BTHAL is a phase I/II study evaluating
      safety and efficacy of OTL-300 in subjects with transfusion dependent beta-thalassemia for
      two years post gene-therapy. Subjects with rare disease who have undergone gene therapy are
      followed for efficacy and possible delayed adverse events. Thus, this study is designed to
      follow patients who have received gene therapy on TIGET-BTHAL for an additional six years
      (for a total of eight years).
