      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the combined remission of complex perianal fistulas,
      defined as the clinical assessment at Week 24 of closure of all treated external openings
      that were draining at baseline despite gentle finger compression, and absence of collections
      greater than (&gt;) 2 centimeter (cm) (in at least 2 dimensions) confirmed by blinded central
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) assessment at Week 24.

      This study is to assess the efficacy and safety of Cx601, eASC, for the treatment of complex
      perianal fistulas in participants with Crohn's disease.

      The study will randomize approximately 554 participants.

        -  Cx601 eASCs intralesional injection

        -  Placebo - Cx601 placebo-matching eASCs intralesional injection

      Study treatments will be allocated, on a 1:1 ratio, by central randomization through
      interactive web response system (IWRS). The study will follow an add-on design, participants
      receiving any ongoing concomitant medical treatment, at stable doses at the time of
      screening, for the CD will be allowed to continue it throughout the study.

      The primary efficacy analysis, will be conducted at Week 24 timepoint. The double blind
      design will be maintained up to Week 52 (both participant and investigator) by a specific
      blinding for study treatment administration and for evaluating its efficacy.

      This multicenter trial will be conducted globally across 150 centers. The overall time to
      participate in this study is approximately 5 years.

                  Screening before randomization.

                  - If colonoscopy data are available within 6 months prior to Screening, the
                  following must be documented, otherwise a new colonoscopy (as above) will be

             the referenced upper limit of normal (ULN) (unless the rise is due to a known process
             other than luminal Crohn's Disease), since the last colonoscopy was performed as
             compared to results during the Screening visit.

             AND

    <ipd_description>Takeda makes patient-level, de-identified data sets and associated documents available for all interventional studies after applicable marketing approvals and commercial availability have been received (or program is completely terminated), an opportunity for the primary publication of the research and final report development has been allowed, and other criteria have been met as set forth in Takeda's Data Sharing Policy (see www.TakedaClinicalTrials.com for details). To obtain access, researchers must submit a legitimate academic research proposal for adjudication by an independent review panel, who will review the scientific merit of the research and the requestor's qualifications and conflict of interest that can result in potential bias. Once approved, qualified researchers who sign a data sharing agreement are provided access to these data in a secure research environment.</ipd_description>
