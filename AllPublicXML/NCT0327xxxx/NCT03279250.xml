      This phase II trial studies how well apalutamide and gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog
      with or without abiraterone acetate work in treating participants with prostate cancer prior
      to surgery. Apalutamide and abiraterone acetate may stop the growth of cancer cells either by
      killing the cells or by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Hormone therapy,
      using gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog, may fight prostate cancer by lowering the amount
      of testosterone the body makes. Giving apalutamide, gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog,
      and abiraterone acetate may work better in treating participants with prostate cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the rate of pathologic stage =&lt; pT2N0 at prostatectomy for Group A
      (gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog [luteinizing hormone releasing hormone agonist
      (LHRHa)] plus apalutamide 240 mg orally [PO] daily for 6 months as preoperative therapy) and
      Group B (LHRHa plus apalutamide 240 mg PO daily plus abiraterone acetate 1000 mg PO daily and
      prednisone 5 mg PO once daily [QD] for 6 months as preoperative therapy).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the tumor epithelium volume following treatment in groups A and B. II. To assess
      the rate of positive surgical margins in Group A and Group B. III. To assess the time to
      prostate specific antigen (PSA) recurrence (TTRPSA). IV. To assess the safety profile of the
      two treatment arms (apalutamide with and without abiraterone acetate and low dose prednisone)
      for six months in a preoperative setting.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assessment of the steroid hormone metabolome in blood plasma and tissue by liquid
      chromatography tandem mass spectrometry.

      II. Assessment of androgen signaling (canonical and non-canonical) and candidate pathways of
      resistance to androgen signaling inhibition by protein and ribonucleic acid (RNA) analysis.

      III. Assessment of citrate intracellular tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) metabolite
      concentrations with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LCMS/MS).

      IV. Proportion of patients who achieve pathological complete response (CR). V. Hyperpolarized
      1-13C-pyruvate imaging at study entry and at 3 months in Arm A and Arm B.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM A: Participants receive gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog (leuprolide, goserelin, or
      triptorelin as determined by treating physician) intramuscularly (IM) once every 3 months and
      apalutamide PO QD. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 cycles in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning no less than 48 hours after
      completion of therapy, participants undergo radical prostatectomy.

      ARM B: Participants receive gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog and apalutamide as in arm
      A, abiraterone acetate PO QD, and prednisone PO QD. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to
      6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning no less
      than 48 hours after completion of therapy, participants undergo radical prostatectomy.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed for 4 weeks.

          -  Serum albumin &gt;= 3 g/dl.

          -  Able to swallow the study drug whole as a tablet.

          -  Patients must have normal coagulation profile and no history of substantial
             non-iatrogenic bleeding diathesis.

          -  Agrees to use a condom (even men with vasectomies) and another effective method of
             birth control if he is having sex with a woman of childbearing potential or agrees to
             use a condom if he is having sex with a woman who is pregnant while on study drug and
             for 3 months following the last dose of study drug. Must also agree not to donate
             sperm during the study and for 3 months after receiving the last dose of study drug.

          -  Willing to take abiraterone acetate on an empty stomach; no food should be consumed at
             least two hours before and for at least one hour after the dose of abiraterone acetate
             is taken.

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 12 months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had any prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy for prostate cancer.

          -  Patients who have had &gt; 1 LHRH agonist or antagonist depot injection or received depot
             injection &gt; 30 days before study entry.

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  Patients may not be receiving the concomitant administration of any systemic therapy,
             biologic therapy, or other agents with anti-tumor activity against prostate cancer
             while the patients are on study.

          -  Patients with known metastatic prostate cancer.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to leuprolide acetate, abiraterone acetate, prednisone or apalutamide or
             other agents used in the study.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients on combination antiretroviral
             therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with
             apalutamide and abiraterone. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.

          -  Avoid concomitant strong CYP3A4 inducers during abiraterone acetate treatment. If a
             strong CYP3A4 inducer must be co-administered, increase the abiraterone acetate dosing
             frequency.

          -  Avoid co-administration of abiraterone acetate with CYP2D6 substrates that have a
             narrow therapeutic index. If an alternative treatment cannot be used, exercise caution
             and consider a dose reduction of the concomitant CYP2D6 substrate.

          -  Patients receiving medications known to lower the seizure threshold are ineligible
             unless discontinued or substituted at least 4 weeks prior to study entry. These
             include: 1) aminophylline/theophylline; 2) atypical antipsychotics (e.g., clozapine,
             olanzapine, risperidone, ziprasidone); 3) bupropion; 4) lithium; 5) pethidine; 6)
