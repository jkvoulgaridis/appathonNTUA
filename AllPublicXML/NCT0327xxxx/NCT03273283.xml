  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol use and its consequences represent an important public health problem. As well as
      alcohol dependence, hazardous drinking also contributes to a high burden in terms of
      morbidity and mortality. To improve these patients' prognosis and decrease associated social
      and health care costs, it is necessary to increase early detection, intervention and
      treatment for these problems. For these reasons, SBIRT programmes (Screening Brief
      Intervention and Referral to Treatment) have been developed, evaluated and shown to be
      effective, particularly in primary care and general practice. Nevertheless, effectiveness of
      SBIRT in emergency departments (ED) has not been clearly established.

      The investigators aimed to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of an SBIRT programme in the
      ED of a tertiary hospital.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators conducted a randomized controlled trial to study the feasibility and
      efficacy of an SBIRT programme for hazardous drinkers presenting in an ED. All patients older
      than 18 years old attending the emergency department were potentially eligible. Cognitively
      impaired or medically unstable patients were excluded. Patients seeking treatment for alcohol
      use were also excluded. Patients were randomized to two groups, with the control group
      receiving two leaflets - one regarding alcohol use, and the other giving information about
      the study protocol. The intervention group received the same leaflets as well as a brief
      motivational intervention on alcohol use; and, where appropriate, a referral to specialised
      treatment. The primary outcomes were the proportion of hazardous drinkers measured by AUDIT-C
      scale and the proportion of patients attending specialised treatment at 1.5 and 4.5 months
      and 1 year.

    <description>We assessed participants with AUDIT-C (a tool to assess alcohol consumption). Main outcome 1 is the proportion of patients who score more than 6 i men and 5 in women in this scale.
AUDIT-C is the short version of the AUDIT scale (Alcohol use disorders identification test). Consists of a three items scale ( frequency of alcohol consumption, amount of alcohol units per day of consumption and frequency of binge drinking), and ranges from 0 (abstinence) to 12 (very high alcohol use). The higher the score is, the more important the alcohol use is, and more risk of presenting an alcohol use disorder.</description>
