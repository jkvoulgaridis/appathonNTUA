    <textblock>
      Phase I-II, single-arm, non-randomized, open-label, multicenter, international clinical
      trial, with two cohorts (Soft Tissue Sarcoma and Bone Sarcoma). Seven sites in Spain, 3 sites
      in Italy and 1 site in the United Kingdom.

      Adult patients will receive an initial induction phase from day 1 to day 14 of sunitinib 37.5
      mg/day followed by a maintenance phase of sunitinib 25mg/day orally continuously + nivolumab
      240mg intravenous every 2 weeks infused over 1 hour. Treatment will continue until disease
      progression, development of unacceptable toxicity, non-compliance, withdrawal of consent by
      the patient or investigator decision.

      Pediatric patients will receive an initial induction phase from day 1 to day 14 of sunitinib
      25 mg/day, or 37.5 mg/day if BSA &gt; 1.7, followed by a maintenance phase of sunitinib 25mg/day
      orally continuously + nivolumab 240mg intravenous every 2 weeks infused over 1 hour.
      Treatment will continue until disease progression, development of unacceptable toxicity,
      non-compliance, withdrawal of consent by the patient or investigator decision.

      The main goal is to evaluate the efficacy of the sunitinib plus nivolumab combination as
      measured by the progression-free survival rate (PFSR) at 6 months in patients with advanced
      soft tissue and bone sarcomas.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One arm survival design based on Lawless (Lawless, Statistical Models and Methods for
      Lifetime Data, John Wiley and Sons, 2003). Formulas are based on the assumptions of uniform
      accrual over time, no loss to follow-up, exponentially distributed death times.

      For STS 2nd line cohort sample size has been obtained for the primary endpoint
      progression-free survival rate (PFSR) at 6 months. Estimated accrual time: 24 months. A PFSR
      of 5% will be considered not promising, whereas a PFSRof 15% will be considered promising in
      this population. With a type I error α of 0.05 and a power of 0.90, 43 patients are needed in
      this cohort.

      For bone sarcoma 2nd line cohort sample size has been obtained under the same assumptions
      than above, but with a type I error α of 0.10, therefore 32 patients are needed in this
      cohort.
