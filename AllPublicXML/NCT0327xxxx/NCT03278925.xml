    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of defined green tea catechin
      extract and to see how well it works in preventing liver cancer in patients with cirrhosis.
      Higher levels of the molecule gamma-OHPdG may be found in patients with cirrhosis, which may
      mean a higher risk of the development of liver cancer. Defined green tea catechin extract may
      work better to lower levels of gamma-OHPdG and prevent the development of liver cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To establish maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and to collect safety data of defined green tea
      catechin extract (Polyphenon E/epigallocatechin gallate [EGCG]) treatment in patients with
      cirrhosis.

      II. To determine the effects of Polyphenon E/EGCG treatment on the suppression of
      gamma-hydroxy-1,N(2)-propanodeoxyguanosine (gamma-OHPdG) levels in cirrhotic liver.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To collect Polyphenon E/EGCG pharmacokinetic data in patients with cirrhosis.

      II. To study the correlation between gamma-OHPdG levels and mutation frequency and
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage spectrum in the p53 and beta-catenin genes in cirrhotic
      liver tissue.

      III. To estimate the fraction of patients with liver cirrhosis that have high levels of
      gamma-OHPdG.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the effects of Polyphenon E/EGCG on the grade of cirrhosis as measured by
      FibroScan and Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) score.

      II. To develop a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and/or enzyme-linked
      immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based method for detecting urinary and blood gamma-OHPdG, to
      correlate with liver gamma-OHPdG levels.

      III. To evaluate any hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development during the treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive defined green tea catechin extract orally (PO) once daily (QD) or twice
      daily (BID) for 24 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study intervention, patients are followed up at 28 days.

          -  The effects of Polyphenon E on the developing human fetus at the recommended

             participants of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum pregnancy
             test within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication (if a urine
             test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be
             required)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Inability to swallow capsules

          -  Participant has a known diagnosis of mental incapacitation that may affect their
             ability to consent and be compliant with the protocol

          -  Participant has ever experienced one or more hepatic decompensation events or a
             history of decompensated liver disease as listed below:

             bleeding are considered ineligible for study participation

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical composition
             to Polyphenon E (or green tea); note that participants who are unable to tolerate
             intravenous contrast for CT scans should have MRIs or ultrasounds during the study
             instead of CT scans

          -  Participant is receiving any other investigational agents

          -  Participants have taken supplements or foods that are labelled as containing green tea
             for 8 weeks before start of treatment

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements; hepatitis b virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections are
             allowed

          -  Green tea has been consumed by humans for thousands of years and teratogenic or
             abortifacient effects have not been reported; however, subjects in this study will
             take high doses of Polyphenon E; the teratogenic or abortifacient effects of high dose
             Polyphenon E is unknown; therefore pregnant women are excluded from this study;
             because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events (AEs) in nursing
             infants secondary to treatment of the mother with Polyphenon E, breastfeeding should
             be discontinued if the mother is treated with this study agent
