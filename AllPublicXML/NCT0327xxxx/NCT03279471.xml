  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 40%-80% of children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) exhibit
      clinically significant anxiety symptoms. These symptoms are associated with increased social
      deficits, depression, irritability, and stereotyped and self-injurious behaviors. Children
      and adolescents with anxiety also frequently avoid potentially stressful situations, thereby
      missing opportunities to learn important new skills. However, there is a lack of clarity
      about how to differentiate ASD and anxiety symptoms. There is also little known about how
      anxiety manifests in those with ASD and intellectual disability (ID). The goal of this study
      is to investigate these issues in order to make interventions more precise, more
      personalized, and more likely to promote positive outcomes

      While there is no doubt that anxiety is a very serious issue for those with ASD, what to do
      about this problem is less clear. Multiple small trials have provided promising evidence that
      selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) might
      reduce anxiety in those with ASD. However, this work is in its early stages. In this study we
      will conduct a study in children with ASD and clinically significant anxiety ages 8-12 to
      compare efficacy of these different treatment types.

      Approximately 40%-80% of children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) exhibit
      clinically significant anxiety symptoms. These symptoms are associated with increased social
      deficits, depression, irritability, and stereotyped and self-injurious behaviors. Children
      and adolescents with anxiety also frequently avoid potentially stressful situations, thereby
      missing opportunities to learn important new skills. Despite the significant consequences of
      anxiety symptoms, several critical treatment-relevant issues remain unresolved. First, there
      is a lack of clarity about how to differentiate ASD and anxiety symptoms. Second, little is
      known about how anxiety manifests in those with ASD and intellectual disability (ID). Third,
      the neural substrates of anxiety in ASD are poorly understood. The overarching goal of this
      project is to investigate these open issues in order to make interventions more precise, more
      personalized, and more likely to promote positive outcomes -- an objective consistent with
      the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Roadmap, Precision Medicine, and Research Domain
      Criteria Project (RDoC) Initiatives and the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee (IACC)
      Strategic Plan, Chapter 4.

      While there is no doubt that anxiety is a very serious issue for those with ASD, what to do
      about this problem is less clear. The search for empirically-validated treatments has begun
      with multiple small trials providing promising evidence that selective serotonin reuptake
      inhibitors (SSRIs) and cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) might reduce anxiety in those with
      ASD. However, this work is in its early stages. There is a great need for large, rigorously
      designed trials that validate the effectiveness of both medication and CBT, as well as
      functional neuroimaging studies that identify neural predictors of treatment efficacy and
      markers of therapy-induced change. Such work holds the potential to help answer the questions
      posed above and to assist the field in developing more personalized treatments. In Project 1
      of the Center for the Development of Phenotype-Based Treatments of Autism Spectrum Disorder,
      we leverage the large, well-characterized UC Davis MIND Institute Autism Phenome Project
      (APP) cohort to conduct a comparative efficacy trial in N=132 participants (ages 8-12 years)
      with ASD and clinically significant anxiety.

             score of 8 on the PARS Severity Scale.

          4. Meets criteria for clinically significant anxiety symptoms as defined by qualifying
             for diagnosis on 1 or more non-phobia items on the ADIS.

          5. The child has a Full Scale and Verbal Comprehension IQ greater than 50 as assessed on
             the Wechsler Abbreviated Scales of Intelligence or other standardized cognitive
             measure.

          6. Anxiety symptoms are considered the primary mental health problem (i.e., most
             impairing/distressing)

          7. Stable medication regimen for 8 weeks prior to screening visit, including alternative
             medication, nutritionals, or therapeutic diets.

          8. Stable non-psychotherapy regimen for 4 weeks prior to screening visits.
             Non-psychotherapy regimen may include:

               1. Academic tutoring

               2. Occupational therapy

               3. Speech therapy

               4. School aides

          9. Stable psychosocial treatment regimen for 4 weeks prior to screening visits. Allowed
             psychosocial treatments may include:

               1. School counseling (no more than 60 minutes per week in duration)

               2. Psychotherapy

               3. Social skills training

               4. Applied behavior analysis (ABA) (up to 10 hours per week)

        Exclusion criteria:

          1. Subject is receiving significant concurrent psychosocial treatment with the primary
             aim to treat the child's anxiety.

             a. Families will have the option of discontinuing such services to enroll in the
             study. If a potential participant is receiving non-allowed treatments at the time of
             the phone evaluation and wishes to discontinue these treatments to enter the study,
             the patient will be asked to discuss this option with their clinician to determine
             whether termination would be safe and in the child's best interest. We will not
             influence the decision patients make with their clinician.

          2. History of intolerance to sertraline OR previous unsuccessful treatment with
             sertraline or other SSRIs judged adequate in dose (per list below) and taken for at

          4. Child has unsuccessful treatment for anxiety using a manualized CBT program within the
             previous 2 years (at least 10 sessions over a period of less than 1 year conducted by
             a licensed provider of CBT). This will be determined through parent report, records
             review and speaking with the clinician if appropriate.

          5. Lifetime DSM-5 bipolar disorder, schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder as assessed
             by all forms of information (i.e., clinical history, data from the ADIS-IV, etc.).

          6. Abnormal laboratory or electrocardiogram results at screening that are in the opinion
             of the investigator clinically significant and may jeopardize the safety of the study
             subject.

          7. Child has a major neurological disorder or medical illness that requires a prohibited
             episodic or chronic systemic medication that might interfere with the absorption,
             distribution, metabolism, or excretion of the study medication places the subject at
             increased risk, or that would interfere with study participation (e.g., frequent
             hospitalizations, frequent school absences).

          8. Child pregnancy as indicated by history or positive pregnancy test.

          9. Inability to safely swallow study medication after pill swallowing education.

         10. Contraindications to MRI (i.e. claustrophobia, extreme sensitivity to noise, metal in
             the body).
