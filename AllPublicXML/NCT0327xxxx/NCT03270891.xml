    <textblock>
      This is a 6-month randomized, wait-listed, controlled pilot trial conducted in 6 department
      of family medicine (DFM) clinics at the University of Michigan (UM). Physicians practicing at
      a UM DFM clinical site who are willing to utilize pharmacogenomic (PGx) test results to
      manage antidepressant use will be enrolled. Patients of these DFM physicians who are adults
      with a new prescription for a target antidepressant will also be enrolled.

    <textblock>
      This is a 6-month randomized, wait-listed, controlled pilot trial conducted in 6 department
      of family medicine (DFM) clinics at the University of Michigan (UM). We will enroll
      physicians practicing at a UM DFM clinical site who are willing to utilize PGx test results
      in conjunction with treating patients prescribed certain antidepressants. We will also enroll
      patients of these DFM physicians who are adults with a new prescription for an antidepressant
      (within the past 4 weeks) including patients who have switched to a new antidepressant from
      another antidepressant or have added on a new antidepressant to current antidepressant
      therapy. Patients are excluded if taking an antidepressant for more than 4 weeks or if they
      have had PGx testing in the past. Patients will be randomized to either an intervention or
      control group. Patients in the intervention group will have PGx test results available soon
      after enrollment while the control patients will have test results available 3 months after
      the first visit. All patients will complete a baseline, 3-, and 6-month assessment; control
      patients will have an additional 9-month assessment. Data to be collected include symptoms
      and severity (PHQ-8, GAD7), functional health status (SF-12), PGx knowledge, work status
      changes, demographic information, physician and emergency department visits, adverse effects,
      and medication alterations and adherence.

    <description>A laboratory developed genetic test that differentiates common and uncommon alleles in genes that have been previously identified as being involved in either the metabolism or response of drugs used in the treatment of depression and/or anxiety. The results are provided as a report that contains information related to the allele status of the patient's genes, translates this into a phenotype, and relates this phenotype to recommendation classes for drugs.</description>
