  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase III trial studies how well avelumab works in treating patients with
      Merkel cell cancer that has spread to the lymph nodes and have undergone surgery and/or
      radiation therapy. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as avelumab, may help the
      body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to
      grow and spread.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To compare the clinical activity of adjuvant avelumab to that of placebo, as determined by
      relapse-free survival in subjects with clinically detected nodal metastases from Merkel cell
      carcinoma (MCC) after definitive therapy with surgery [with/without adjuvant radiation
      therapy (RT)] or primary RT alone.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine whether adjuvant therapy with avelumab improves overall survival (OS) as
      compared to placebo.

      II. To examine whether adjuvant therapy with avelumab improves distant metastases-free
      survival (DMFS) as compared to placebo.

      III. To assess whether adjuvant therapy with avelumab improves disease-specific survival
      (DSS) as compared to placebo.

      IV. To assess the safety and tolerability of avelumab in the adjuvant setting.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To explore predictive biomarkers in tissue and peripheral blood for immunogenicity of
      avelumab.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive avelumab intravenously (IV) over 1 hour once every 15 days for the
      first 120 days (Induction Phase 1), once every 30 days for the next 120 days (Induction Phase
      2), and then once every 120 days (Maintenance Phase) for a maximum of 720 days (approximately
      24 months or 2 years total) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive placebo IV over 1 hour once every 15 days for the first 120 days
      (Induction Phase 1), once every 30 days for the next 120 days (Induction Phase 2), and then
      once every 120 days (Maintenance Phase) for a maximum of 720 days (approximately 24 months or
      2 years total) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 3 years for
      a minimum of 5 years from randomization.

             accident/stroke (&lt; 6 months prior to enrollment), myocardial infarction (&lt; 6 months

             including recent (within the past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior; or
             laboratory abnormalities that may increase the risk associated with study
             participation or study treatment administration or may interfere with the
             interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make
             the patient inappropriate for entry into this study

          -  Known prior severe hypersensitivity to investigational product or any component in its
             formulations that could interfere with study endpoints or put patient safety at risk
