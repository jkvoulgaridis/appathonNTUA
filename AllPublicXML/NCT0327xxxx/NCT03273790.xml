        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Previously treated advanced/metastatic NSCLC patients treated with nivolumab at least
             once from 01-Apr-2016 through 31-Dec-2016

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients who meets the inclusion criteria will be included in the analysis to describe

        following criteria will be excluded for analysis for the other primary endpoint; overall
        effectiveness:

          -  History of participation in any clinical trials prior- or post-nivolumab treatment

          -  Patients who are a part of a Post-marketing surveillance study

        Other protocol defined inclusion/exclusion criteria could apply
