      The objectives of this study are:

        1. To compare the OCTA image quality between the SPECTRALIS and the predicate.

        2. To compare the agreement of clinical findings on SPECTRALIS OCTA to the predicate.

    <description>OCT Angiography offers clinicians a non-invasive three-dimensional visualization of vasculature in the retina and choroid. The visualization of perfused vasculature in a three-dimensional layout, offers clinicians an aid in the identification of retinal and choroidal pathologies such as retinal ischemia, microaneurysms, retinal neovascularization and choroidal neovascular membranes.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        All subjects:

          -  Able and willing to undergo the test procedures, sign informed consent, and follow
             instructions.

          -  Age ≥ 22

        Subjects with Normal Eyes:

          -  Subjects presenting at the site without uncontrolled systemic conditions, or ocular
             disease, as determined by the Investigator

          -  Corrected visual acuity ≥ 20/40 in each eye

          -  No history of ocular surgical intervention (except for refractive or cataract surgery)
             in either eye

        Subjects with Pathology:

          -  Subjects with retinal conditions in at least one eye.

          -  Subjects included can have a range of retinal vascular pathologies affecting different
             anatomic depths through the retina and choroid. Retinal conditions including but not
             limited to diabetic retinopathy, wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and
             branch or central retinal vein occlusion that give rise to features such as retinal
             ischemia, microaneurysms, choroidal neovascularization and retinal neovascularization
             will be included.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects unable to read or write

          -  Subjects with ocular media not sufficiently clear to obtain acceptable study-related
             imaging

          -  Subjects who cannot tolerate the imaging procedures

          -  Subjects with known allergies to fluorescein dye, Indocyanine Green (ICG), shellfish,
             drugs for pupillary dilation

          -  Subjects with contraindication to pupillary dilation in study eye
