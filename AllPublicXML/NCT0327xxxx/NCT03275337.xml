  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Emerging neuroimaging studies have shown that the cerebellum contributes to different aspects
      of timing, prediction, learning, and extinction of conditioned responses to aversive stimuli,
      factors that may be relevant to the success of exposure based behavioral therapy. Our goals
      are to determine the cerebellar contributions to fear extinction by attempting to modulate
      key pathways in this process by theta burst stimulation. The long term goal is to lay the
      foundation for future studies in which neuromodulation is used to augment exposure therapy.

      Participants in this study will undergo an assessment for past history and present symptoms
      of mood, anxiety, trauma, substance abuse, and eating disorders. Safety screening for
      functional MRI (fMRI) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) will be
      performed prior to enrollment.

      Phase 1 of the study involves two visits. The first visit involves undergoing an fMRI scan
      and a motor thresholding procedure for rTMS. A clinical assessment will be performed for the
      above symptoms, or a recap of symptoms if the participant had been previously assessed at our
      institute.

      The second visit involves a fear conditioning session performed in the fMRI scanner followed
      by one session of rTMS over either a cerebellar or occipital lobe (control) target. This will
      be immediately followed by a fear extinction phase, also in the fMRI scanner. The participant
      will return in 24hours to determine consolidation of the fear extinction process.

      Phase 2 is similar to Phase 1, except that each participant will undergo two sessions of the
      fear conditioning and fear extinction phases while undergoing an fMRI scan. In one session,
      they will receive rTMS over a cerebellar target. In the other session, they will receive rTMS
      over a control site. These sessions will be separated by at least 1 week.

      The participants will then undergo 10 weeks of exposure therapy for social phobia. The goal
      is to determine whether neuroplasticity related to cerebellar stimulation can predict the
      response to exposure therapy.
