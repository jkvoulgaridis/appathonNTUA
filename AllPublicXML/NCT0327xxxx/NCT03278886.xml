  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to assess the feasibility, tolerability,
      and safety of using opioid receptor antagonists (naltrexone and nalmefene) to treat pain
      among HIV-infected persons with heavy alcohol use and chronic pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pain is a common co-morbidity for HIV-infected patients. Prevalence studies suggest that, on
      average, half of all HIV-infected persons suffer pain. Chronic pain can lead to heavy alcohol
      use among HIV-infected persons, which may in turn be a barrier to treatment/control of HIV
      and contribute to spread of HIV. Thus there is an urgent need to address pain among persons
      with HIV. Opioid receptor antagonists such as naltrexone and nalmefene, which are licensed
      for treatment of alcohol use disorders, show promise as being effective and safe treatments
      for chronic pain among persons with HIV. This study will pilot test novel pharmacotherapies
      (opioid receptor antagonists) to improve chronic pain among HIV-infected heavy drinkers. The
      specific aims of the research is to assess the feasibility, tolerability and safety of using
      opioid receptor antagonists (low-dose naltrexone and nalmefene) to treat pain among
      HIV-infected persons with heavy alcohol use and chronic pain.

    <measure>Medication tolerability measured via a 0-100 visual analog scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Primary endpoint at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Medication tolerability will be measured via a 0-100 visual analog scale. Participants will be asked to indicate on a scale of 0-100, how well they have tolerated the study medication with 0 anchored as &quot;cannot tolerate at all&quot; and 100 as &quot;tolerate perfectly well.&quot; Higher numbers will be indicative of higher tolerability of the medication.</description>

    <measure>Treatment discontinuation defined as patient self-report of stopping medication anytime during the treatment period</measure>
    <time_frame>Endpoint at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measured via one question asking participants if they had discontinued medication since their last visit. Assessed at 4 and 8 week study visits.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adherence to medication defined as self-report of percentage of study medication taken in the past two weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Endpoint at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by participants' drawing a line on a a Visual Analog Scale, which ranges from 0 to 100. Higher numbers indicate higher adherence to study medication.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adherence assessed via riboflavin in the urine</measure>
    <time_frame>Endpoint at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measured through visual inspection of the urine for the presence or absence of riboflavin using ultraviolet (UV) light at the long wave setting (33 mm) in a room with low ambient light.</description>

    <measure>Reported side effects using a Symptom Checklist, plus an open-ended question</measure>
    <time_frame>Endpoint at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measured via a 16-item symptom checklist with the option for participants to report any experienced side effects not on the checklist. Side effect severity is rated by trained research assessors. The checklist is asked at 2, 4, 6, and 8-week study visits.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Medication satisfaction defined as a score from 0-100 measured via the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM), with higher scores corresponding to higher treatment satisfaction.</measure>
    <time_frame>Endpoint at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measured via using the 14-item Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire, which consists of 14 items that result in four domains: Effectiveness, Side Effects, Convenience and Global Satisfaction. Assessed at 4 and 8 week study visits.</description>
