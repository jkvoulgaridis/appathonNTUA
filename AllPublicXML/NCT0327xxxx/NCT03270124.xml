  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being performed in patients who have undergone transcatheter aortic valve
      replacement (TAVR) for aortic stenosis. The goal is to obtain pilot and feasibility data on a
      novel post-procedure rehabilitation strategy, including a daily activity goal using a fitness
      tracking device (Fitbit Alta HR) and in-home resistance training exercises targeting muscles
      related to activities of daily living. We will evaluate the effect of these interventions on
      physical performance and several quality of life domains.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in three phases. Subjects who have been treated commercially with
      TAVR with a SAPIEN 3 valve and are being discharged to home will be eligible for Phase 1.
      Once consented prior to discharge, patients will complete the KCCQ, PROMIS Questionnaires, 5m
      walk, chair stand, and handgrip tests. During phase 1, all subjects will have a Fitbit and
      answer quality of life questions on the iPad about their activities and quality of life.
      After 30 days, the subject will return to complete the PROMIS Questionnaires, 5m walk, chair
      stand, balance tests, and handgrip tests, as well as a KCCQ. If the subject has consistently
      provided data throughout Phase 1, they will be asked to continue on to Phases 2 and 3 and
      complete a 6 minute walk test at this baseline visit. For Phase 2, subjects will be
      randomized to one of two arms. In one arm, they will have a daily activity goal and
      resistance exercises; in the other arm, there will not be a daily activity goal and no
      resistance exercises given. After 6 weeks, the subject will return to complete the 5m walk, 6
      minute walk test, chair stand, balance tests, and handgrip tests, PROMIS Questionnaires, as
      well as a KCCQ. Five months after enrollment into Phase 2, subjects will be given a Fitbit to
      track their daily activity for 1 week (Phase 3). They will also complete a KCCQ, PROMIS
      Questionnaires, and end of study questionnaire.

          -  All exclusion criteria from Phase 1 apply

          -  Stroke during Phase 1

          -  Residing in a skilled nursing facility at the 30 day post-TAVR follow-up visit

          -  Patients with unreliable use of the iPad mobile app or Fitbit during Phase 1 (e.g. not
             wearing the Fitbit at least 10 waking hours a day for at least 5 days a week)

          -  Unwillingness or inability of the subject to provide informed consent for Phases 2/3
             (no LARs allowed)
