  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over a 5 year period infant and baby siblings of children with autism spectrum disorders
      (ASD) will be recruited to this study and will be randomized into 2 groups. Parents of the
      intervention group will receive 12 weeks of coaching in how to implement this intervention.
      Parents randomized to the control group will not receive intervention coaching. Both groups
      will attend a series of clinic appointments for data collection that occur at 3 month
      intervals over a 9 month period.

      This two-site randomized controlled trail (RCT) will include a sample of 80 siblings of
      children with ASD (Sibs-ASD) (11 months, 15 days to 18 months, 15 days) who are stratified on
      initial cumulative-risk status for communication disorder and then randomly assigned to
      Ingersoll's Improving Parents As Communication Teachers (ImPACT; Ingersoll &amp; Dvortcsak, 2010)
      treatment or to a business-as-usual (BAU) control condition. The following hypotheses will be
      tested:

        1. Compared to the BAU Control, children assigned to the ImPACT group will show (a) more
           growth on pivotal skills and language level, and (b) a lesser degree of ASD
           symptomatology and language delay.

        2. Pretreatment, cumulative-risk level will statistically interact with (i.e., moderate)
           treatment assignment to predict children's (a) change in pivotal skills and language,
           and (b) severity of autism symptoms and language delay.

        3. Compared to the BAU Control, parents in ImPACT will have more optimal parenting stress
           and parenting efficacy, at least in parents with average or below average depressive
           symptoms prior to treatment (i.e., depressive symptoms will moderate the effect of
           ImPACT on parental stress and parenting efficacy).

        4. The effect that ImPACT has on growth of pivotal skills and language will be mediated by
           parents' frequency and fidelity of use of ImPACT strategies at immediate post-treatment.

        5. The effect of ImPACT on degree of children's language delay and ASD symptomatology at 6
           months post-treatment will be mediated by their pivotal skill level at 3 months
           post-treatment.
