  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Therapeutic intervention with NKA is intended to delay the need for renal replacement therapy
      (dialysis or transplant) which, based on the current standard of care, is inevitable for
      patients with end stage CKD. The purpose of the present study is to assess the safety and
      efficacy of up to 2 injections of NKA given 6 months (+4 weeks) apart (maximum).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      NKA is made from expanded autologous selected renal cells obtained from each individual
      subject's kidney biopsy.

      All subjects enrolled will receive NKA. Subjects will receive their first NKA injection as
      soon as the NKA product is manufactured and shipped to the clinical site. After 6 months (+4
      weeks), a second injection will be given, as appropriate. Each subject's baseline rate of
      renal decline, based on adequate historical clinical data obtained 24 months prior to
      screening visit, will serve as a comparator for monitoring the rate of progression of renal
      insufficiency over time.

      The rate of progression of renal insufficiency (assessed via serial measurements of eGFR
      through 24 months after the last NKA injection) will be compared against the individual
      subject's rate of eGFR decline through 24 months following the final NKA treatment. The rate
      of progression of renal insufficiency from subjects (if any) who received a single NKA
      injection may be compared against that from subjects who received two NKA injections.

          2. The subject has an established diagnosis of T2DM.

          3. The subject has an established diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy as the underlying
             cause of renal disease.

          4. The subject has an established diagnosis of CKD not requiring renal dialysis, defined
             as having an eGFR between 14 and 20 mL/min/1.73m2 inclusive at the Screening Visit and
             prior to NKA injection.

          5. The subject has blood pressure less than 150/90 at the Screening Visit, prior to renal
             biopsy, and prior to NKA injection(s). Note BP should not be significantly below the
             previously recorded stable pressure.

          6. The subject has stable blood pressure or has ongoing and stable treatment with an
             angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or an angiotensin receptor blocker
             (ARB) initiated at least 8 weeks prior to renal biopsy. Treatment must be stable
             during the 6 week period immediately prior to NKA injection. Stable treatment is
             defined as dose adjustment no less than one half of the current dosage and no more
             than 2 times the current dosage. Dose interruptions up to 7 days due to medical
             necessity are allowed.

          7. A minimum of 3 measurements of eGFR or sCr should be obtained at least 3 months apart
             prior to the Screening Visit or within the previous 24 months to define the rate of
             progression of CKD. The subject should have adequate, historical clinical data to
             provide a reasonable estimate of the rate of progression of CKD. The Medical Monitor
             may be consulted to ensure there is sufficient data.

          8. The subject is willing and able to refrain from NSAID consumption (including aspirin)
             as well as clopidogrel, prasugrel, or other platelet inhibitors during the period
             beginning 7 days before through 7 days after both the renal biopsy and NKA
             injection(s).

          9. The subject is willing and able to refrain from consumption of fish oil and platelet
             aggregation inhibitors, such as dipryridamole (ie, Persantine®), during the period

             injection(s).

         10. The subject is willing and able to cooperate with all aspects of the protocol.

             Investigator).

          5. The subject has hemoglobin levels less than 9 g/dL prior to each NKA injection.

          6. The subject has abnormal coagulation status as measured by activated partial
             thromboplastin time (APTT), prothrombin time international normalized ratio (PT INR),
             and/or platelet count at the Screening Visit.

          7. The subject has a bleeding disorder(s) or is taking anticoagulants, such as Coumadin®
             (warfarin) or direct thrombin inhibitors that, in the judgment of the Investigator,
             would interfere with the performance of study procedures.

          8. The subject has small kidneys (average size less than 9 cm) or has only one kidney, as
             assessed by ultrasound and/or MRI prior to renal biopsy, unless earlier radiology
             reports (generated within 1 year of the Screening Visit) are made available to confirm
             kidney size and number.

          9. The subject has a known allergy or contraindication(s), or has experienced severe
             systemic reaction(s) to kanamycin or structurally similar aminoglycoside antibiotic(s)

         10. The subject has a history of anaphylactic or severe systemic reaction(s) or
             contraindication(s) to human blood products or materials of animal origin (eg, bovine,
             porcine).

             excessive fat surrounding the kidney, or who are otherwise at excessive risk for
             serious complications.

         12. The subject has a history of severe systemic reaction(s) or any contraindication to
             local anesthetics or sedatives.

         16. The subject has incapacitating cardiac and/or pulmonary disorders.

         17. The subject has a history of cancer within the past 3 years (excluding non-melanoma

         18. The subject has clinically significant hepatic disease (ALT or AST greater than 3
             times the upper limit of normal) as assessed at the Screening Visit.

         19. The subject is positive for active infection with Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), or
             Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), and/or Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) as assessed at the
             Screening Visit.

         20. The subject has a history of active tuberculosis (TB) requiring treatment within the
             past 3 years.

         21. The subject is immunocompromised or is receiving immunosuppressive agents, including
             individuals treated for chronic glomerulonephritis within 3 months of NKA injection.
             Note: inhaled corticosteroids and chronic low-dose corticosteroids (less than or equal
             to 7.5 mg per day) are permitted as are brief pulsed corticosteroids for intermittent
             symptoms (eg, asthma).

         22. The subject has a life expectancy less than 2 years.

         23. The female subject is pregnant, lactating (breast feeding), or planning a pregnancy
             during the course of the study. Or, the female subject is of child-bearing potential
             and is not using a highly effective method(s) of birth control, including sexual
             abstinence. Or, the female subject is unwilling to continue using a highly-effective
             method of birth control throughout the duration of the study. Note: A highly effective
             method of birth control is defined as one that results in a low failure rate (ie, less
             than one percent per year) when used consistently and correctly, such as implants,
             injectables, combined oral contraceptives, some intrauterine devices IUDs, sexual
             abstinence, or a vasectomized partner.

         24. The subject has a history of active alcohol and/or drug abuse that, in the judgment of
             the Investigator, would impair the subject's ability to comply with the protocol.

         25. The subject's health status would, in the judgment of the Investigator, be jeopardized
             by participating in the study.

         26. The subject has used an investigational product within 3 months prior to NKA injection
             without receiving written consent from the Medical Monitor.
