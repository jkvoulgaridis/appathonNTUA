  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects of pembrolizumab and romidepsin and to see how
      well they work in treating participants with peripheral T-cell lymphoma that has come back or
      that does not respond to treatment. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as
      pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with
      the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Romidepsin may stop the growth of tumor cells
      by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving pembrolizumab and romidepsin
      may work better than pembrolizumab alone in treating participants with recurrent or
      refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the safety of pembrolizumab in combination with romidepsin. II. Estimate the
      response rate of the combination therapy in refractory or recurrent peripheral T-cell
      lymphoma (PTCL).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimate progression free survival (PFS). II. Estimate overall survival (OS). III.
      Estimate complete response (CR) and duration of response (DOR).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess activation of T-cells after treatment in peripheral blood and tumor
      microenvironment.

      II. Correlate features of peripheral blood T-cell activation with toxicities, clinical
      response, and PFS.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive romidepsin intravenously (IV) over 4 hours on days 1 and 8 or day 8 of
      cycle 1 and days 1 and 8 of subsequent cycles and pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1.
      Cycles repeat every 21 days for up to 36 cycles in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 30 days and then every
      12 weeks.
