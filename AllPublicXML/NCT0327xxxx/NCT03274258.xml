  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well nivolumab and ipilimumab work in treating patients with
      kidney cancer. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab and ipilimumab,
      may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of
      tumor cells to grow and spread.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the objective response rate (ORR) of patients with locally advanced or
      metastatic renal medullary carcinoma (RMC) treated with combination of nivolumab plus
      ipilimumab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the efficacy and safety of the combination of nivolumab plus ipilimumab in
      patients with RMC.

      II. To evaluate potential biomarkers for patient stratification and treatment response, as
      well as tumor antigen-specific immune responses, such as antibody and T cell responses, as
      surrogates for anti-tumor activity.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes and ipilimumab IV over 90
      minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then receive nivolumab IV over 60
      minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 28 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.

The estimate of the posterior ORR and its 95% credible interval will be estimated using the same prior as utilized in the futility monitoring rules. The posterior distribution for ORR of this trial will be compared to the historical data. The Kaplan-Meier method will be utilized to display time to ORR.

    <description>Adverse effects that will be evaluated include, but are not limited to infections, renal toxicity, hepatic toxicity, and pulmonary toxicity. Methods of assessment will include monitoring blood counts, and performing laboratory tests as indicated by clinical signs and symptoms. Evidence of toxicity or adverse events will be recorded at all clinic visits. All observed adverse effects will be graded for all patients and the degree of association of each with therapy assessed.</description>

             examination finding, or clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a
             disease or condition that contraindicates the use of ipilimumab or nivolumab or that

             high risk from treatment complications.

          -  Patients should not receive immunization with attenuated live vaccines within one week
             (7 days) of study entry or during study period; Note: Seasonal influenza vaccines for
