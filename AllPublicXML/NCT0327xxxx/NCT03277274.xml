    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of varying degrees of hepatic function on
      the single dose PK of IV TAK-954.
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-954. This study will evaluate the safety
      and tolerability of single intravenous doses of TAK-954 in participants with varying degrees
      of hepatic function.

      The study will enroll approximately up to 32 participants. Participants will be enrolled in
      one of the 4 treatment groups based on their degree of hepatic impairment which will be
      determined based on Child-Pugh Score as follow:

        -  Group 1 TAK-954 0.2 mg: Mild Hepatic Impairment (Child Pugh Class A)

        -  Group 2 TAK-954 0.2 mg: Moderate Hepatic Impairment (Child Pugh Class B)

        -  Group 3 TAK-954 0.2 mg: Severe Hepatic Impairment (Child Pugh Class C)

        -  Group 4 TAK-954 0.2 mg: Healthy Participants

      The Child-Pugh classification will assess the severity of 5 hepatic parameters (total serum
      bilirubin, serum albumin, prothrombin time, ascites and encephalopathy grade) on a scale of 1
      (none) to 3 (moderate). Total hepatic impairment score ranges from 5 (mild) to 15 (severe)
      where higher score indicates more severity.

      All participants will receive a single dose of TAK-954 0.2 mg on Day 1.

      This study may have a full study design, where Group 1 to Group 4 will enroll approximately 8
      participants in each group or a reduced study design, where no participants will be enrolled
      in Group 1 and approximately 8 participants will be enrolled in Group 2 to Group 4.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Czech Republic and Slovakia. The overall time to
      participate in this study is approximately 7 weeks. Participants will remain confined to the
      clinic for 4 days, with 2 further out-patient visits, and will make a final visit to the
      clinic 10-14 days after receiving their last dose of TAK-954 for a follow-up assessment.

    <ipd_description>Takeda makes patient-level, de-identified data sets and associated documents available for all interventional studies after applicable marketing approvals and commercial availability have been received (or program is completely terminated), an opportunity for the primary publication of the research and final report development has been allowed, and other criteria have been met as set forth in Takeda's Data Sharing Policy (see www.TakedaClinicalTrials.com for details). To obtain access, researchers must submit a legitimate academic research proposal for adjudication by an independent review panel, who will review the scientific merit of the research and the requestor's qualifications and conflict of interest that can result in potential bias. Once approved, qualified researchers who sign a data sharing agreement are provided access to these data in a secure research environment.</ipd_description>
