  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the change in tear meniscus height (TMH) produced by intranasal
      stimulation with TrueTear™ compared with the same device applied extranasally (control).

    <measure>Change from Baseline (Pre-application) in Tear Meniscus Height (TMH) at Eye Opening and Pre-Blink</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-application (Day 0) to time (T) 0 (immediately), 15, 30, 60, 120, 180, 240, 300 and 360 minutes on Day 0 after application</time_frame>
    <description>Tear meniscus height is defined as the mean height of the lower tear prism to the edge of the eye lid measured by the investigator using the Tear scope Plus in conjunction with a Topcon SL-D7 slit lamp biomicroscope and high-resolution digital video recording. Change from Baseline to time (T) T0 (immediately), T15, T30, T60, T120, T180, T240, T300, T360 minutes (mins) after application was reported. A negative change from Baseline (Pre-application) indicates improvement.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline (Pre-application) in Tear Lipid Layer Thickness at Eye Opening and Pre-Blink</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-application (Day 0) to time (T) 0 (immediately), 15, 30, 60, 120, 180, 240, 300 and 360 minutes on Day 0 after application</time_frame>
    <description>Lipid layer thickness is defined as the average thickness of the lipid layer calculated from the thickness of the various pattern weighted by the relative coverage of each pattern measured by the investigator using the Tearscope Plus in conjunction with a Topcon SL-D7 slit lamp biomicroscope and high-resolution digital video recording. Change from Baseline to T0 (immediately), T15, T30, T60, T120, T180, T240, T300, T360 mins after application was reported. A negative change from Baseline (Pre-application) indicates improvement .</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline (Pre-application) in Non-Invasive Tear Film Break-Up Time (NIBUT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-application (Day 0) to time (T) 0 (immediately), 15, 30, 60, 120, 180, 240, 300 and 360 minutes on Day 0 after application</time_frame>
    <description>Non-invasive break-up time is the time in seconds between eye opening and the appearance of the first visible break in the lipid layer of the pre-corneal tear film measured by the investigator using the Tearscope Plus in conjunction with a Topcon SL-D7 slit lamp biomicroscope and high-resolution digital video recording. Change from Baseline to T0 (immediately), T15, T30, T60, T120, T180, T240, T300, T360 mins after application was reported. A negative change from Baseline (Pre-application) indicates improvement.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Pre-application in Protective Index (PI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-application (Day 0) to time (T) 0 (immediately), 15, 30, 60, 120, 180, 240, 300 and 360 minutes on Day 0 after application</time_frame>
    <description>The Protected Index (PI) corresponds to the percentage of the corneal surface that is not exposed to the atmosphere (i.e. fully covered by the tear film) over the full interblink period measured by the investigator using a Tear scope Plus in conjunction with a Topcon SL-D7 slit lamp biomicroscope and high-resolution digital video recording. Change from Baseline to T0 (immediately), T15, T30, T60, T120, T180, T240, T300, T360 mins after application was reported.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Pre-application in Exposed Area (EA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-application (Day 0) to time (T) 0 (immediately), 15, 30, 60, 120, 180, 240, 300 and 360 minutes on Day 0 after application</time_frame>
    <description>Exposed Area is defined as the percentage of the observed area not covered by the tear film at the time of the blink hence exposed to the atmosphere measured by the investigator using a Tear scope Plus in conjunction with a Topcon SL-D7 slit lamp biomicroscope and high-resolution digital video recording. Change from Baseline to T0 (immediately), T15, T30, T60, T120, T180, T240, T300, T360 mins after application was reported.</description>
