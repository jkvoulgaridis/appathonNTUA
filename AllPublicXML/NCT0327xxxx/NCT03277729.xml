    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to find the best dose of genetically modified T-cells, to
      study the safety of this treatment, and to see how well it works in treating patients with B
      cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma that has come back (relapsed) or did not respond to previous
      treatment (refractory).

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of adoptive cellular immunotherapy using ex
      vivo transduced and expanded autologous T cells expressing a third (3rd)-generation fully
      human CD20-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) in patients with relapsed or refractory
      CD20+ B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and toxicity associated with CD20 CAR T cell infusions.

      II. To evaluate preliminary antitumor activity of adoptively transferred T cells in patients
      with measurable tumor burden prior to treatment as measured by overall response rate (ORR)
      and complete remission (CR) rate.

      III. To evaluate progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) among patients
      treated with adoptively transferred CD20-specific T cells.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I/II dose-escalation study of CD20-specific CAR T cell therapy.

      Patients undergo leukapheresis and may receive treatment after if needed for disease control.
      Patients then receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV). Patients may also receive
      fludarabine IV. After 36-96 hours, patients receive CD20-specific CAR T cell infusion.

      Patients will be actively participating in the study for approximately 15 months. The total
      time includes the time for the T cells to be made, the T cell infusion, and for approximately
      12 months after the T cell infusion is given. After completion of study treatment, patients
      are followed up for a minimum of 15 years.
