  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A total of 96 recruited children (aged 6 months to 3 years) with mild or moderate persistent
      asthma who were on regular inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) were randomly allocated to receive
      electronic monitoring combined with instant messaging software -based weekly feeding back
      adherence and reminders to keep taking the ICS (intervention group) and to receive electronic
      monitoring only (control group). The device-monitored adherence rates and caregiver-reported
      adherence rates were analyzed.

    <intervention_model_description>The Study of Asthma Adherence study was a multicentre, single-blind, parallel group randomised controlled trial, with an allocation ratio of 1:1.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Double (Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>Due to the nature of the intervention, the caregivers of the participants and follow-up nurse were not blinded. But the doctors and statisticians were blinded. Both in the intervention group and control group, adherence data were not available to clinicians.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>device monitored adherence rate</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome of the study was change in the adherence rate monitored by the electronic device for 6 consecutive months. This adherence rate was calculated as the number of device recorded times /number of total times prescribed Ã— 100%.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>caregiver-reported adherence rate</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary outcomes for the study were the caregiver-reported adherence rate and the difference between device-monitored and caregiver-reported adherence rates for 6 consecutive months. The caregiver-reported adherence rate was recorded on a monthly basis. It was offered by the caregivers of patients through answering the questions &quot;Has our child inhaled the medicine according to the doctor's instructions&quot; and &quot;How about the frequency&quot;. The device-monitored and caregiver-reported adherence rates were compared monthly.</description>

    <description>All the device-monitored adherence data from the previous week were downloaded from the background database and calculated by a qualified asthma nurse. Through free IMS (WeChat; Tencent, Shenzhen, CHN) available on mobile, the nurse offered feedback to the caregivers weekly according to the adherence rate and reminded them to keep taking the ICS. Caregivers were asked monthly &quot;Has our child inhaled the medicine according to the doctor's instructions?&quot; and &quot;How about the frequency?&quot; by telephone.</description>
