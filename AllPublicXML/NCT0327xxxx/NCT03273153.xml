    <measure>Progression Free Survival (PFS) as Determined by the Independent Review Committee (IRC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 8 weeks (wks) from Day (D) 1 of Cycle (C) 1 through approximately 16 months</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of disease progression, as determined by an IRC according to RECIST v1.1, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. Progressive disease (PD) for target lesion: At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of diameters on study (including baseline). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum of diameters must also demonstrate an absolute increase of &gt;/=5 mm. PD for non-target lesion: Unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.</description>

    <measure>Objective Response as Determined by the Investigator</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 8 weeks (wks) from Day (D) 1 of Cycle (C) 1 through approximately 16 months</time_frame>
    <description>Objective response rate is defined as the percentage of participants with a complete response (CR) or a partial response (PR) on two consecutive occasions &gt;/=4 weeks apart, as determined by the investigator through the use of RECIST v1.1. For target lesion, CR: the disappearance of all target lesions, any pathological lymph nodes must have a reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm. PR: at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of all target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters, in the absence of CR. For non-target lesion, CR: the disappearance of all non-target lesions and (if applicable) normalization of tumor marker level, all lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (&lt;10 mm short axis).</description>

    <measure>Disease Control Rate (DCR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>DCR is defined as the proportion of participants with a complete response, a partial response, or stable disease at 16 weeks. For target lesion, CR: the disappearance of all target lesions, any pathological lymph nodes must have a reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm. PR: at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of all target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters, in the absence of CR. For non-target lesion, CR: the disappearance of all non-target lesions and (if applicable) normalization of tumor marker level, all lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (&lt;10 mm short axis). Stable disease (SD): neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for CR or PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Health-related Quality of Life (HRQoL) Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 16 months. Follow up is reported at weeks after participant treatment discontinuation, which could occur at any time during the study. Total time frame does not exceed 16 months.</time_frame>
    <description>HRQoL scores are assessed through global health status (GHS)/ quality of life (QoL) subscale of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ C30). These are based on questions 29 and 30 of the EORTC QLQ-C30. These questions on global health status/QoL scale are coded on 7-point scale (1=very poor to 7=excellent). Raw scores will be linearly transformed to obtain the score ranging from 0 to 100, where higher score represents a higher (&quot;better&quot;) level of functioning.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 16 months</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events.</description>

        <title>Objective Response as Determined by the Investigator</title>
        <description>Objective response rate is defined as the percentage of participants with a complete response (CR) or a partial response (PR) on two consecutive occasions &gt;/=4 weeks apart, as determined by the investigator through the use of RECIST v1.1. For target lesion, CR: the disappearance of all target lesions, any pathological lymph nodes must have a reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm. PR: at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of all target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters, in the absence of CR. For non-target lesion, CR: the disappearance of all non-target lesions and (if applicable) normalization of tumor marker level, all lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (&lt;10 mm short axis).</description>

        <description>HRQoL scores are assessed through global health status (GHS)/ quality of life (QoL) subscale of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ C30). These are based on questions 29 and 30 of the EORTC QLQ-C30. These questions on global health status/QoL scale are coded on 7-point scale (1=very poor to 7=excellent). Raw scores will be linearly transformed to obtain the score ranging from 0 to 100, where higher score represents a higher (&quot;better&quot;) level of functioning.</description>

        <description>An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events.</description>
