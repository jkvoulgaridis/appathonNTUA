  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Reunion Island, people encounter environmental and social conditions leading to premature
      ageing and subsequent frailty. Social welfare has developped exercise programs to promote
      physical activity especially for elderly with higher risk factors of frailty, including low
      incomes.

      The study evaluates the potent benefit effect of such exercise program on physical
      performance and frailty improvement in seniors from Reunion Island. All seniors participate
      to a 12-weeks exercise program especially dedicated to this targeted population needs and
      ability.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Regular physical activity has been shown to slow down sarcopenia, and increase strengh in
      elders. Nevertheless, senior with low incomes do not usually have access to physical activity
      areas.

      Social partners are in close relationship with these elders and could promote free exercise
      programs dedicated to elders classified as &quot;GIR5-6&quot; according to the French scale &quot;AGIRR&quot;.
      The AGIRR scale takes into account several criteria allowing the evaluation of the level of
      autonomy. The level of autonomy is closely related to frailty and could be reversed since
      elders have not reach a dependant-state. The &quot;GIR5-6&quot; level means that elderly people are
      still not dependant but exhibit several frailty risk factors.

      The level of frailty and the physical performance of the participants is assessed by standard
      geriatric evaluation before the 12-wks exercice program. The improvement of the physical
      performance is assessed after he 12-wks exercice program.
