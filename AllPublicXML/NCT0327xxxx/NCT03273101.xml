      Background: It is unknown whether the self-initiated sit-to-stand training with assistive
      device is effective to regain the independence of sit-to-stand in stroke patients.

      Objective: To compare the effectiveness of self-initiated sit-to-stand training by assistive
      device, with manual sit-to-stand training.

      Design: Parallel randomised controlled and assessor blinded trial between Jan 2015 and May
      2018. Randomisation was performed by drawing lots to allocate treatment to patient.

      Setting: A rehabilitation hospital in Hong Kong

      Participants: 69 patients in medical wards with unilateral hemiparetic stroke. 52 patients
      fulfilled the study requirements.

      Intervention: Ten sessions of intervention with conventional physiotherapy program followed,
      by self-initiated sit-to-stand training with assistive device, or by manual sit-to-stand
      training.

      Main outcome measure: Number of patients regained the independence of sit-to-stand,
      Sit-to-stand test from the balance master® and Five-repetitions sit-to-stand test.

      Results: 69 patients (intervention n=36; control n=33) were randomized (mean age 69.8 (SD,
      10.6), mean post stroke days 18.6 (SD 16.0)) for intention to treat analysis. 17 patients
      were excluded because of dropout before 10 sessions of training, leaving 52 (n=26; n=26)
      patients for per protocol analysis. 18 patients in intervention group and 10 patients in
      control group had regained the independence of sit-to-stand (Phil and Cramer's V: -0.31 and
      0.31). The patients in intervention group were faster to complete the Five-repetition
      sit-to-stand test than the control group (32.7 secs (SD, 1.93) v 48.4 secs (SD, 6.8); 95%
      confidence interval, -30.8 to -0.7; p&lt;0.05). No adverse side effects occurred during and
      after the training across groups.

      Conclusions: Self-initiated sit-to-stand training by assistive device can help more stroke
      patients regain the independence of sit-to-stand.
