  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open−label, single−center Phase I dose escalation study designed to determine the
      dose−limiting toxicity (DLT) and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 225Ac−J591 in a single
      dose regimen.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is for men with advanced prostate cancer. The purpose of this study is to
      find the highest dose level of the study drug, 225Ac-J591 that can be given without severe
      side effects. The research study is being done because the standard treatments for prostate
      cancer that has spread beyond the prostate gland are intended to minimize the adverse effects
      of the disease. These treatments, however, are not curative. Patients who choose to
      participate in this study will have a screening visit to determine whether or not they are
      eligible to participate in the study. The treatment phase is comprised of 8 visits over
      approximately 12 weeks. The study medication is called 225Ac-J591, and participants will
      receive an infusion of the study drug on the Treatment visit of the study. Upon completion of
      investigational treatment with single dose of 225Ac-J591, subjects will undergo
      68Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC injection and same day PET/CT at the end of study visit to document
      treatment response. Subsequently survival data and additional treatment(s) information will
      be captured from their routine Standard of care (SOC) visits.During the other study visits,
      participants will undergo routine tests and procedures, such as physical examinations, and
      routine blood tests. Some blood tests will be done for research purposes only. After
      completion of therapy, participants may be contacted on a periodic basis to see how they are
      doing.

      Key eligibility:

        -  Open to men age 18 and older.

        -  Diagnosis of progressive metastatic prostate cancer

        -  Have been previously treated for their disease with particular types of therapy.
