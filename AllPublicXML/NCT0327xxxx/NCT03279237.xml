      This research study is studying a combination of interventions as a possible treatment for
      gastroesophageal (GE) junction cancer.

      The interventions involved in this study are:

      -FOLFIRINOX which is made up of 4 different drugs:

        -  5-Fluorouracil (5-FU)

        -  Oxaliplatin

        -  Irinotecan

        -  Leucovorin

        -  Paclitaxel

        -  Carboplatin

        -  Proton Beam Radiation Therapy

  <detailed_description>

      This research study is a Pilot Study, which is the first time investigators are examining
      this study intervention.

      In this research study, the investigators are studying the combination of FOLFIRINOX followed
      by radiation with paclitaxel and carboplatin before surgery. The investigators believe that
      this intervention may help decrease the growth and spread of the cancer cells.

      FOLFIRINOX has shown to be very effective in patients whom disease has spread. The
      investigators are evaluating this regimen to see if there is an increase in curability when
      the cancer has not spread.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved FOLFIRINOX as a treatment option
      for this disease.

      The FDA has not approved Paclitaxel or Carboplatin for this specific disease but they have
      both been approved for other uses.

      FOLFIRINOX is a combination of 4 chemotherapy agents that may help shrink the tumor before
      surgery.

      Carboplatin may stop the cancer cells from growing and paclitaxel may stop the cancer cells
      from growing and spreading

    <description>The number of participants that achieved a clinical response following treatment. Clinical response is defined as achieving a best overall response of a complete response (CR) or a partial response (PR).
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm.
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.</description>

    <measure>Pathologic Complete Response Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>29 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The number of participants that achieve a pathologic complete response at surgery following FOLFIRINOX and chemoradiation. All patients will undergo a full pathological review of their surgical specimen according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Staging Classification, 6th edition. Initial gross evaluation and identification of resection margins will be performed jointly by the surgeon and the pathologist. Pathological complete response will be defined as the absence of any viable tumor cells within the pathologic specimen.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression Free Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>5 Years</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from the date of first dosing to the first documentation of radiographic disease progression per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Subjects who are alive with no documented progressive disease by the data cutoff date for PFS analysis will be censored at the date of their last evaluable disease assessment.
Progressive Disease (PD) is defined as having at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>5 Years</time_frame>
    <description>The number of participants alive five years after the start of treatment. Overall survival (OS) is measured as the time from the date of first dosing until death due to any cause. If there is no death reported for a subject by the data cut-off date for overall survival analysis, OS will be censored at the last known alive date.</description>

                  above institutional normal.

          -  The effects of both radiation therapy and the chemotherapy agents used in this trial
             are known to be teratogenic. Therefore, women of child-bearing potential and men must
             agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control;
             abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation plus 30
             days from the last date of study drug administration. Should a woman become pregnant
             or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study,
             she should inform her treating physician immediately.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence of metastatic disease as determined by chest CT scan, abdomen/pelvis CT scan
             (or MRI with gadolinium and/or manganese) within six weeks of study entry. Distant
             nodal disease is allowed if it is in the radiation port.

          -  Any prior chemotherapy, targeted/biologic therapy, or radiation for treatment of the
             participant's gastric or GE junction cancer.

          -  Receipt of chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or
             mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered from adverse
             events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

          -  Treatment of other invasive carcinomas within the last five years with greater than 5%
             risk of recurrence at time of eligibility screening. Carcinoma in-situ and basal cell
             carcinoma/ squamous cell carcinoma of the skin are allowed.

          -  Receipt of any other investigational agents within 4 weeks preceding the start of
             study treatment.

          -  Serious concomitant systemic disorders incompatible with the study (at the discretion
             of the investigator), such as significant cardiac or pulmonary morbidity (e.g.
             congestive heart failure, symptomatic coronary artery disease and/or cardiac
             arrhythmias not well controlled with medication) or myocardial infarction within the
             last 12 months, or ongoing infection as manifested by fever.

          -  History of uncontrolled seizures, central nervous system disorders or psychiatric
             disability judged by the investigator to be clinically significant, precluding
             informed consent, or interfering with compliance or drug intake.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because radiation therapy and the
             chemotherapy agents to be used have the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient
             effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing
             infants secondary to treatment of the mother with these agents, breastfeeding should
             be discontinued while the mother is receiving protocol therapy.

          -  Major surgery, excluding laparoscopy, within 4 weeks of the start of study treatment,
             without complete recovery.

          -  No concurrent administration of cimetidine (as it can decrease the clearance of 5-FU).
             Another H2-blocker or proton pump inhibitor may be substituted before study entry.

          -  Known, existing uncontrolled coagulopathy.

          -  Prior systemic fluoropyrimidine therapy (unless given in an adjuvant setting and at
             least six months earlier). Prior topical fluoropyrimidine use is allowed.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to 5-fluorouracil or known DPD deficiency.

          -  History of allergic reaction(s) attributed to compounds of similar chemical or
             biologic composition to 5-fluorouracil, irinotecan, or oxaliplatin

Subjects who are alive with no documented progressive disease by the data cutoff date for PFS analysis will be censored at the date of their last evaluable disease assessment.
Progressive Disease (PD) is defined as having at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.
