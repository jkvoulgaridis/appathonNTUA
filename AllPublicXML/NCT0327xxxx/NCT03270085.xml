  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare with a randomized trial (n=15 per treatment group), effects of colesevelam and
      placebo treatment, on colonic transit, bowel functions, permeability and tight junction
      expression in rectosigmoid mucosa of IBS-D with Bile Acid Malabsorption.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Compare the effects of Colesevelam versus the placebo on diabetic subjects with chronic
      diarrhea. In this study, diabetic subjects will get either the Colesevelam or the placebo,
      not both.

      The plan is to have about 30 subjects complete this study at Mayo Clinic.

    <description>Stool consistency as reported by the participant via daily bowel diaries. Stool consistency was based on Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS) where 1 - hard lumps, 2 - lumpy sausage, 3 - cracked sausage, 4 - smooth sausage, 5 - soft lumps, 6 - mushy, and 7 - watery. Stool consistency was averaged for the 28 day treatment period.</description>

    <description>Once randomized, subjects will have baseline testing period, treatment period, and treatment testing period the study drug. This consists of nine visits and will be over a period of five to nine weeks.
Baseline testing period consists of: transit test, 4 day high fat diet with 48 hour stool collection, blood samples, rectosigmoid biopsies, one week stool diary, and medication pick up.
Treatment period will have subject take the study drug 1875 mg of medication orally twice daily with lunch and supper for 4-5 weeks.
The last period, is the treatment testing period. This consists of a full transit &amp; urine permeability test, 4 day high fat diet with 48 hour stool collection, blood samples, one week stool diary collection, and the return of the unused medication.</description>
