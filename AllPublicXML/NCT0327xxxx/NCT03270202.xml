  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effect of a new wearable device, that measures physical activity
      level based on heart rates, on relevant health outcomes including cardiorespiratory fitness.
      Half of participants will be instructed in using the Mio Slice wristband, while the other
      half will be requested to follow today`s recommendations for physical activity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two critical challenges precluding the full potential of physical activity in preventive
      healthcare are: 1) The majority of people are not sufficiently active, and 2) there is a lack
      of large, long-term intervention studies documenting the effect of personalized activity and
      improved health in the population. Using HUNT data an algorithm called Personal Activity
      Intelligence (PAI) has been developed. PAI was integrated in a smartphone application and
      user friendly wristband (Mio Slice), that measures heart rate continuously and estimates an
      individual threshold for total physical activity (defined as 100 weekly PAI) that is
      associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality. The primary aim of the
      study is to reveal whether using the wristband will increase cardiorespiratory fitness,
      determined by maximal oxygen uptake, after 4 months among low-fit participants. The secondary
      aims includes the effect on reversing cardiovascular risk factors, cardiac structure and
      function, adherence to physical activity and identification of barriers after 16 weeks and 1
      year.

    <description>Participants randomized to the PAI-group will receive a wearable device (Mio Slice PAI wristband) that measure heart rate continuously and via an algorithm calculates a physical activity score called PAI. The weekly goal of 100 PAI can be reached by a combination of different intensities and durations and the participants will get continuous information about their current score and amount of activity needed to reach the goal. 100 PAI is expected to approximate current guidelines of 150 minutes of moderate intensity or 75 minutes of vigorous intensity for the average participant or somewhat less if the intensity of the chosen activity is high. Proper instruction in use of the device and App will be given both oral and written after baseline testing and randomization.</description>
