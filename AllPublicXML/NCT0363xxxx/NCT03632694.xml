  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Move for Your Health Pilot Study is a 16-week study in older cancer survivors to replace
      and break-up sedentary activity with short bouts of light physical activity.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will determine the feasibility and acceptability of a mobile health
      (mHealth) intervention to replace and break-up sedentary time with intermittent bouts of
      light physical activity. The intervention uses an electronic activity monitor (&quot;Jawbone UP2&quot;;
      worn on the wrist) that pairs with a mobile app, which together promote awareness and enable
      self-monitoring of both physical activity (steps per day) and inactivity (wristband gently
      vibrates after a specified time of inactivity). Pre-post intervention change in objective,
      subjective, and biologic data will be compared between groups.
