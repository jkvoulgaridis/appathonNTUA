  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II/III trial studies how well anamorelin hydrochloride works in reducing anorexia
      in patients with non-small cell lung cancer that has spread to other places in the body.
      Anamorelin hydrochloride may help to improve patients' appetite in order to stop weight loss.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To qualitatively examine experiences related to anorexia in advanced lung cancer patients
      with anorexia-cachexia and the impact of nine weeks of treatment of oral anamorelin
      hydrochloride (anamorelin) (100 mg) and placebo.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore changes in anorexia-cachexia (measured by the Functional Assessment of
      Anorexia/Cachexia Treatment [FAACT] anorexia/cachexia subscale [A/CS]) in patients with
      advanced non-small cell cancer after 9 weeks of oral anamorelin (100 mg) or placebo.

      II. To explore changes in anorexia as measured by the 5-item Anorexia Symptom score (derived
      from the FAACT A/CS) after 9 weeks of oral anamorelin (100 mg) or placebo.

      III. To explore any associations between changes in anorexia with body weight, body
      composition (as assessed by InBody, weight scale, and L3 vertebrae compute tomography [CT]
      scan), quality of life (Functional Assessment of Cancer Illness Therapy [FACT-G]), Patient
      Global Impression of Severity (PGIS), Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC), nutritional
      markers (pre-albumin, IGF-1 and IGFBP-3), inflammatory biomarkers (C-reactive protein [CRP],
      monocyte IL-6&amp;R, TNF-a&amp;R, IL-10,IL-8, IL-1&amp;RA), and food intake after 9 weeks of oral
      anamorelin (100 mg) or placebo.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive anamorelin hydrochloride orally (PO) daily for 9 weeks in the absence
      of disease progression or unaccepted toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO daily for 9 weeks in the absence of disease progression
      or unaccepted toxicity.

    <description>Will be correlated with body composition, nutritional markers, inflammatory biomarkers, and food intake using Spearman correlation. Graphical tools and repeated measures analysis may be employed to assess the change of anorexia symptom scores. Additional analyses focusing on the relationship between these parameters will also be done by comparing the mean change from baseline in body weight/composition, nutritional markers, and food intake between &quot;responders&quot; and &quot;non-responders&quot; for the FAACT A/CS domain and the 5-item Anorexia Symptom Scale.</description>
