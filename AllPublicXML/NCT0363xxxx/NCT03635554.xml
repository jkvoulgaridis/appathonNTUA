  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to develop a clinically feasible version of a laboratory-developed
      assessment battery for language and verbal short-term memory difficulties in aphasia.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over five years, we will develop a clinically feasible test that can be used to assess
      in-depth the language and verbal short-term memory abilities of individuals with aphasia
      (Called the TALSA - Temple Assessment of Language and Short-term memory in Aphasia. Based on
      a test that we have developed and tested over the past decade, we will create a shorter
      version that can be used by clinicians in a rehabilitation setting. The data to support this
      development will come from two sources: (1) clinicians in rehabilitation facilities who will
      use the new clinical test and provide feedback on the test (administration, value etc) and
      (2) people with aphasia who will be administered the longer version to help us identify the
      best test items in the laboratory version of the TALSA to be carried over to the shorter
      clinical version.

      We are recruiting individuals with aphasia as well as people without aphasia (to serve as
      controls) to help with development of this assessment battery. The battery consists of
      between 15 and 20 subtests that assess many aspects of language and verbal short-term memory.

    <time_frame>two to three years December 1, 2017 through December 15, 2017 through November 30, 2022.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be administered 15-20 subtests of the TALSA that assess aspects of language (phoneme discrimination, sentence comprehension) and short-term memory (e.g., repetition span) abilities. Their responses on these measures will be evaluated in a item response analysis to determine which items are ideal to use in a smaller version of this test that is feasible to use in clinical practice. Another group of people with aphasia will be administered the clinical version (when it is complete) to develop normative data for that assessment battery.</description>

        Participants with aphasia will have single or multiple left hemisphere lesions, but no
        right hemisphere lesions. They can be between the ages of 21 and 80. Their aphasia can
        range in severity from mild to severe and can be of any type except global aphasia. Their
        language output can be fluent or nonfluent and their comprehension can be mild moderately
        impaired.
