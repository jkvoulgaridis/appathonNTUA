  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 open label, 2 period, single fixed sequence study designed to evaluate the
      effect of repeat dose oral rifampin on single dose PF 04965842 PK after a single 200 mg oral
      dose in healthy subjects. A total of 12 healthy male and/or female subjects will be enrolled
      in the study so that at least 10 subjects will complete the study.

      Subject will report to the clinical research unit (CRU) at least 12 hours prior to Day 1
      dosing in Period 1 and will be required to stay in the CRU for 11 days and 10 nights.
      Genotyping samples for CYP2C19 and CYP2C9 will be collected predose in Period 1 only. In
      Period 1, subjects will be administered a single oral 200 mg dose of PF 04965842 in the
      morning on Day 1 under fasted conditions. No food will be allowed for at least 4 hours
      postdose and undergo serial blood sample collection for 24 hours postdose to characterize the
      PK profile of PF 04965842.

      In Period 2, subjects will receive rifampin 600 mg QD in the mornings of Day 1 to Day 7,
      approximately 1 hour before the morning meal. On the morning of Day 8, after an overnight
      fast of approximately 9 hours, subjects will be administered rifampin 600 mg 1 hour prior to
      administration of a single 200 mg oral dose of PF 04965842. Subjects will remain in a fasted
      state for 4 hours after dosing with PF 04965842 and undergo serial blood sample collection
      for 24 hours post PF 04965842 dosing to characterize the PK profile of PF 04965842. Subjects
      will be discharged from the CRU on Day 9 of Period 2 after all study procedures are
      completed. The subject will be required to return to the CRU for on site follow up visits 7
      14 days, and have a follow up phone contact 28 35 days after the last dose of PF 04965842.

             supine rest OR Screening supine diastolic BP &lt;50 mm Hg or &gt;90 mm Hg following at least
             5 minutes of supine rest.

             If a subject meets any of these criteria, the BP should be repeated 2 more times and
             the average of the 3 BP values should be used to determine the subject's eligibility.

          8. Screening supine 12 lead ECG demonstrating a corrected QT (QTc) interval &gt;450 msec or
