  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The experience of trauma not only impacts the way an individual thinks and feels, but can
      also produce changes in the way someone remembers their personal past. It is not only
      memories of the trauma that are affected- avoidance of trauma memories can also lead to
      memories of other events becoming vague, and in particular, memories of positive experiences
      can seem out of reach. This memory difficulty promotes posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
      This study will explore an intervention that aims to improve memory difficulties, which
      should then flow on to improve PTSD. The study will be completed with individuals who have
      experienced a single incident trauma. Twenty five participants will complete MemFlex straight
      away, and 25 will go on a waiting list. Once this first group has finished MemFlex, the
      researchers will compare the two groups to see if the programme produced a larger reduction
      in PTSD symptoms. MemFlex is workbook-based, and as such, if it is successful it may offer an
      easy, cheap, and accessible way to offer psychological treatment to PTSD sufferers around the
      world.

    <description>The MemFlex programme has been adapted from the initial format addressing depression-related memory distortions to facilitate completion with individuals experiencing posttraumatic stress. The workbook and associated materials have also been translated from English to Farsi. The programme consists of one researcher-facilitated session and eight self-guided workbook-based sessions that train memory retrieval skills and are completed over a one month period.</description>

    <description>After randomisation, the waitlist control group will be informed that they have been placed on a waiting list for the intervention. The participants will complete the baseline assessment and receive no further contact from the researcher until the post assessment one month later, followed by the follow-up assessment three months later. After the three month assessment, wait listed participants will receive the intervention. No further assessments will be completed.</description>

    <description>MemFlex is a primarily self-guided, paper workbook-based program which aims to reduce overgeneral memory bias and improve recall of positive, specific event memories. Prior to completing one month of self-guided, workbook-based intervention, the participant will attend one 45 minute face-to-face session in which the facilitator outlines the importance of autobiographical memory in everyday life, discusses the impact of trauma on autobiographical memory, and provides information on the different types of autobiographical memories (e.g., specific, general) and their potential everyday functions. The session also introduces the cued-recall tasks which were used to train the memory skills throughout the workbook, and provides facilitator-assisted practice with the tasks. Once participants are comfortable with the training exercises, they set a schedule for completion of the eight-session workbook over the following four weeks.</description>
