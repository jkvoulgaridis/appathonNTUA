  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to generate feasibility safety and performance data for
      the 4Tech TriCinch Coil System in symptomatic patients suffering from moderate to severe
      functional tricuspid regurgitation with annular dilatation.

      The TriCinch Coil System is a percutaneous catheter-based medical device for tricuspid valve
      repair.

    <description>The Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) is a 23-item, self-administered instrument that quantifies physical function, symptoms (frequency, severity and recent change), social function, self-efficacy and knowledge, and quality of life. In the KCCQ, an overall summary score can be derived from the physical function, symptom (frequency and severity), social function and quality of life domains. Scores are transformed to a range of 0-100, in which higher scores reflect better health status.</description>
