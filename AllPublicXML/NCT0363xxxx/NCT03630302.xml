  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study aims to explore the functional use of LFPs recorded intraoperatively for
      the optimization of a directional DBS lead programming

      Aim-1: To determine whether intraoperative LFPs recorded from the segmented DBS electrode can
      predict the optimal stimulation parameters.

      Aim-2: Compare the therapeutic window for stimulation delivered through directional and
      conventional leads and determine if the spatiospectral LFP patterns correlate with the
      presence of stimulation side effects.

      This is a feasibility study designed to evaluate the usefulness of intraoperative LFP
      recordings obtained from the implanted DBS lead to predict ideal stimulation parameters.
      Additionally this study will compare the therapeutic window for stimulation delivered through
      directional and conventional leads and determine if the spatiospectral LFP patterns correlate
      with the presence of stimulation side effects.

      Approximately 15 subjects will be enrolled in this clinical investigation. The clinical
      investigation will be conducted at 2 centers in the USA.

      Subjects participating in this clinical investigation will monitored during DBS implant
      procedure and programming. The expected duration of enrollment is 8 months. The total
      duration of the clinical investigation is expected to be 1 year.

        In this study the investigators will explore the predictive capacity of LFPs recorded from
        STN. In total, 15 patients undergoing bilateral STN DBS will be enrolled for this
        investigation over a 1-year period. The current surgical case load at BCM supports this
        level of enrollment. The details of implantation procedures and blinded trial design are
        given in the following sections
