  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In summary, the investigators want to investigate whether UTE sequences are capable to
      replace imaging techniques involving ionizing radiation for bone imaging in the future. This
      would improve patient care greatly and might reduce medical imaging associated cancer risk
      drastically from an epidemiological standpoint. This field of research can be considered
      cutting-edge. The investigators determine this study promising to provide substantial
      generalizable knowledge and hope that this study results will improve patient care worldwide
      considerably.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To date, definite depiction of anatomy or pathologies of bony structures requires ionizing
      radiation by using radiographs or computed tomography (CT) since conventional magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) that does not require ionizing radiation cannot depict bony
      structures well. Modern MR techniques, collectively referred to as ultrashort time to echo
      (UTE) sequences, have overcome this issue by acquiring the signal data much faster and
      therefore are able to acquire sufficient MR signal from bony structures. The investigators
      want to investigate if UTE sequences are capable to depict bony anatomy and pathology similar
      to imaging examination techniques involving ionizing radiation. Healthy adult and minor
      participants, as well as adult and minor participants, referred for a clinically indicated
      MRI involving the skeletal system will be included.
