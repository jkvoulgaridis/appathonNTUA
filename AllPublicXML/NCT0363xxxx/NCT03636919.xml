    <textblock>
      Pollen allergic rhinitis is a very common condition whose symptomatic treatment is not always
      sufficient or satisfactory. The indication for allergic immunotherapy (IT) therefore often
      arises. The indication is based on the interrogation of the patient (chronology and severity
      of symptoms) and skin tests. But the interrogation, necessarily retrospective, brings often
      vague information and skin tests can be positive for allergens that have no clinical role
      (cross allergies).

      The objective of the project is to help the clinician in the indication of the IT, on the one
      hand by setting up a prospective and computerized collection of symptoms by a computer
      logbook accessible by the mobile phone of the patient. on the other hand by performing on the
      patient's serum a molecular diagnosis allow the identification of the major allergens to
      which the patient is sensitized.

      The same study will be conducted in 7 centers in southern European countries in patients aged
      10 to 60 years with pollinosis. The examinations added by the research will take place during
      two routine visits: during a first visit, these patients will answer a standardized
      questionnaire, have a battery of allergological skin tests and a blood sample for molecular
      diagnosis. An application will then be loaded on their mobile phone and they will record
      their symptoms and medication during the pollen season. During a second visit, at the end of
      the pollen season, the allergist, in view of the data collected in the electronic notebook
      and the results of the molecular diagnosis will be able to prescribe a possible IT.

      diagnosis of pollen allergies is the most complex) in patients aged 10 to 60 years with
      pollinosis. The examinations added by the research will take place during two routine visits:
      during a first visit, these patients will answer a standardized questionnaire, have a battery
