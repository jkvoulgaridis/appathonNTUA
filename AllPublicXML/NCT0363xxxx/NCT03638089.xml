  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to quantify how fall-recovery training improves the
      fall-recovery response of individuals with chronic stroke. Up to 20 participants with chronic
      stroke will be recruited from the community. Over six laboratory visits, participants will
      undergo sessions of fall-recovery training. Each session is comprised of simulated trips and
      slips as participants stand on a computer-controlled treadmill. Trip-recovery training
      consists of treadmill-delivered disturbances that induce a forward fall. Slip-recovery
      training consists of a treadmill-delivered disturbances that induce a backward fall. Separate
      progressions focus on initial steps with the left and right limbs. The training intensity, as
      determined by the disturbance magnitude, is progressive and dependent on participant
      performance. Step length and maximum trunk angle will be calculated. The hypothesis is that,
      with practice, participants will recover from larger perturbations, and they will increase
      step length and reduce trunk rotation during fall recoveries.
