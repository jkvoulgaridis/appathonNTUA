  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the usability of two mindfulness smartphone applications
      (apps) and to evaluate whether text message support can promote engagement with those apps
      through a 4-week trial comparing support vs. no support.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Part one of this study is to conduct usability testing to understand more about the
      acceptability and usability of these existing mindfulness apps in a population with
      depression and anxiety. The goal of usability testing is to identify any usability problems,
      provide information for future app development, and determine the participant's satisfaction
      with the apps. Participants will then be randomized to receive either engagement support or
      no support which will be delivered via text messaging, and will be randomized to use one of
      the two mindfulness applications for the 4 week period. Specific Aim 2.1 is to evaluate any
      differences on outcome measures between the two mindfulness apps. Specific Aim 2.2 is to
      evaluate the differences of outcome measures between text message engagement support versus
      no support, regardless of the mindfulness app. For Aim 2.1, the investigators predict that
      all mindfulness apps will be capable of leading to improvements on outcome measures. For Aim
      2.2, the investigators predict that the text message engagement support arm will engage more
      with the mindfulness app and will see greater improvements in outcome measures regardless of
      the mindfulness app.
