  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MEOPA (Equimolar Oxygen-Nitrogen Protoxide Mix) is a gas used in emergencies for short-term
      painful acts. It is often very effective with an analgesic, anxiolytic and muscle relaxant
      action. It is often combined with other analgesic medicines. It has already been proven in
      emergency medicine for short-term pain and trauma. It seems that it could be used more
      particularly for pains of medical origin. A study has already proved its effectiveness in the
      treatment of migraines in emergencies. The first phase of the NEPHROPAIN study began in 2016
      after a favorable opinion from the Regional Ethics Committee. NEPHROPAIN phase AVANT was a
      prospective non-interventional study on the use of analgesic drugs in nephritic colic in
      emergencies by Dr. Alexandre Tanneau. This study was conducted at the University Hospital of
      Rennes and included 60 patients admitted to the emergency department for suspected renal
      colic. It made it possible to recruit the control group of the NEPHROPAIN study. Its main
      objective was to describe the suspected population of renal colic in Rennes emergencies, to
      determine NEPHROPAIN's primary endpoint and the number of NEPHROPAIN needed subjects.
