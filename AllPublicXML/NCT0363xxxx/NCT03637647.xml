      Primary Aim: The present study is a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected
      clinical data. Anonymized data from patients collected during routine clinical care from 9
      units in the United Kingdom who undertake upper gastrointestinal (UGI) cancer surgery and
      perform pre-operative cardiopulmonary exercise testing will be interrogated. Data will be
      pooled at a central location (University Hospitals Southampton) and used to investigate the
      relationship between selected cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) variables, in-hospital
      post-operative and survival outcomes after major UGI cancer surgery.

      Rationale: Our primary aim is to establish a reliable relationship between post-operative
      1-year survival and oxygen uptake ( o2) at peak exercise ( o2 Peak); a secondary aim is to
      explore the multivariable relationship between selected CPET variables especially o2 at the
      estimated lactate threshold/anaerobic threshold ( L), together with other selected CPET
      derived variables, and other important prognostic variables with post-operative complications
      (morbidity and mortality) in an attempt to risk stratify patients before major UGI surgery.

      Trial Design: Multicentre observational

      Inclusion Criteria: We aim to include all patients aged &gt;18 years considered eligible by the
      MDT for major curative UGI cancer surgery and undergoing an enhanced recovery programme after
      surgery. Patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapies will also be
      included. Patients having a CPET and initially scheduled for curative surgery, but end up not
      having surgery due to disease progression or other clinical reasons will be included and
      analysed separately.

      Exclusion Criteria: Patients will be excluded if they are physically unable to perform a CPET
      on a cycle ergometer, patients having emergency surgery, patients lacking complete
      in-hospital morbidity or mortality data and patients undergoing preoperative exercise
      interventions.

      Primary Trial Endpoints: 1 year overall survival

      Study overview and background

      We hypothesise that reduced physical fitness (measured objectively using Cardiopulmonary
      Exercise Testing (CPET)) will result in worse post-operative surgical outcome (reduced 1-year
      overall survival, and increased in-hospital morbidity measured by Clavien-Dindo-Demartines
      Score). We propose multicentre patient recruitment and analyses of routinely collected
      clinical data, in an attempt interrogate this hypothesis in patients prior to upper
      gastrointestinal cancer surgery. Patients undergoing cancer therapies pre-operatively
      (neoadjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy) will be included in the analyses. Patients
      that become ineligible for an operation, mainly due to metastasis or progression of their
      cancer on neoadjuvant cancer treatments will also be included but will be analysed
      separately.

      Despite advances in anti-cancer therapies, surgery remains the most important treatment for
      oesophageal and gastric cancer. Major UGI cancer surgery carries substantial morbidity and
      mortality, particularly in elderly patients and those with co-morbidities. Recent UK cancer
      audits show 30-day mortality of up to 3% for elective surgery and a 90-day mortality rate of
      5.2%. Outcomes after major cancer surgery depend on modifiable factors such as peri-operative
      medical care and intra-operative technique and what were previously thought to be
      unmodifiable components, such as the ability of the patient to tolerate surgical trauma.
      Centralisation of services and optimisation of perioperative pathways have led to improved
      outcomes, but substantial gains may yet be achieved with accurate and objective preoperative
      risk prediction.

      Current approaches to risk prediction include a plethora of prediction scores and tests, but
      none have proven efficacy above experienced clinical acumen. More recently reduced physical
      fitness (objectively measured using CardioPulmonary Exercise Testing - CPET) has been
      associated with increased postoperative morbidity in a variety of major surgical cohorts.
      CPET provides an objective method of evaluating physical fitness under stress, partly
      mimicking the stress of a major surgical event. Accurate risk prediction methods prior to
      surgery or indeed other forms of 'trauma' like pre-operative cancer therapies might allow
      better patient selection, permit modification of the patients preoperative status, as well as
      improve the optimisation of intra- and postoperative management, and enhances shared
      decision-making. Furthermore CPET allows interrogation of the causes of exercise intolerance,
      when exercise capacity is reduced, with the exciting opportunity of intolerance modulation
      for therapeutic gain (Fit for Surgery).

      To date, 37 cohort studies (including over 7,800 patients) have reported the relationship
      between preoperative CPET-derived variables and postoperative outcome. These data have been
      brought together in several systematic reviews that, in summary, show a remarkably consistent
      positive correlation between physical fitness and postoperative outcome. The Southampton
      based Fit-4-Surgery group have clearly demonstrated this in patients undergoing major
      colorectal surgery, however the relationship between fitness and post-operative outcomes in
      UGI cancer surgery is not yet well defined.

      METHODOLOGY

      Patients in all the recruiting centres will undergo a maximal CPET prior to major UGI cancer
      surgery (defined as a procedure involving oesophageal, junctional or gastric cancer
      resection) according to the CPET protocol defined in Appendix 1 of protocol. If the CPET
      deviates from this protocol, the centre would need to clear their local CPET protocol with
      the Chief Investigator (CI). All variables measured by CPET that will be collected are
      outlined in Appendix 2 of protocol. If the patient is scheduled to have neoadjuvant cancer
      therapies, the recruiting site might elect to test patients pre- and post the neoadjuvant
      therapy to estimate the change in fitness. This is based on changes observed in fitness with
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy in UGI and chemoradiotherapy in rectal cancer patients.

      Following surgery only routine clinically relevant observational data will be collected.
      These data will relate to hospital length of stay, the level of care required following
      surgery, post-operative morbidity (Postoperative Morbidity Survey - POMS and/or
      Clavien-Dindo-Demartins Score) and the recovery process. Most of this information can be
      accessed from prospectively maintained enhanced recovery databases, however electronic
      patient records that are maintained and recorded prospectively are also acceptable
      alternatives.

      Each site would also contribute existing data held on the hospital patient database in
      addition to recruiting patients as they present at the hospital as per methodology above. All
      data from each individual hospital will be anonymized at source by the PI prior to transfer
      to the CI and any analyses. CPET variables, post-operative outcome data, and basic patient
      demographics (outlined in Appendix 2 of the protocol) cannot be linked back to the original
      patient.

      All patients undergoing CPET at each NHS site are given a patient information sheet related
      to risks and benefits related to CPET and routinely undergo written consent prior to testing,
      also asking for their permission for these data to be used for research purposes.

      HYPOTHESIS

      This study tests the hypothesis that selected CPET variables are related to 1-year overall
      survival and to in-hospital morbidity in patients undergoing major UGI cancer surgery.

      Our primary aim is to establish a reliable relationship between 1-year overall survival
      (present or absent) and oxygen uptake (Vo2) at peak exercise (Vo2 Peak); a secondary aim is
      to explore the multivariable relationship between Vo2 at the estimated lactate threshold
      (LT), other selected CPET variables (weight, BMI and Body Surface Area (BSA) adjusted) and
      other important prognostic variables with post-operative complications in an attempt to risk
      stratify patients before major surgery.

      3. DATA ANALYSES

      Cardiopulmonary Exercise Tests (CPET)

      The CPET involves cycling on an exercise bike for 8-12 minutes. Starting with a very low
      resistance on the pedals the patient will pedal at 60 revolutions per minute. After 3 minutes
      of cycling, the resistance will gradually increase until the patient can no longer turn the
      pedals at the required speed. The test will be thoroughly explained to the patient beforehand
      and trained staff will make the experience as comfortable as possible. CPETs will be stopped
      early by the study researcher/doctor in the presence of any adverse events. Each CPET
      appointment will last approximately one hour.

      CPETs carry a small risk (1:10,000) of exercise induced myocardial infarction or dysrhythmia.
      Patients are continuously monitored using a 12 lead electrocardiograph (ECG) during all tests
      and recovery. The CPET test will entail the patient becoming slightly hot or maybe sweaty,
      and appropriate clothing should be worn. The patient's heart will be monitored by an
      electrocardiogram. The patient will wear a soft rubber mask in order to continuously sample
      expired air with an online breath-by-breath gas analyzer. This may cause some mild
      claustrophobia. Full detail of the CPET procedure is given in appendix 1. Accredited doctors
      or allied health professionals with experience in analysis of exercise tests will analyse all
      of the exercise data. Patients will be anonymised and the person performing the data analysis
      will be blinded to the outcome data. All data will be stored, processed and analysed on
      secure NHS computers on NHS encrypted and password-protected servers.

      4. STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY

      Non-parametric receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves will be constructed for Vo2 at
      LT, Vo2 at Peak, O2 Pulse at LT and ventilatory equivalents for carbon dioxide ( E/ co2 at L)
      in order to assess their independent ability to discriminate between patients with and
      without post-operative morbidity. All selected CPET variables will be adjusted for weight,
      BMI and BSA. Optimal cut-points will be obtained by minimising the distance between points on
      the ROC curve and the upper left corner. Variables (to satisfy the 10 events per variable
      rule) will be identified as candidates for a multivariable logistic regression model
      including but not limited to: Vo2 at LT and at Peak, gender, operation type
      (laparoscopic/open), and O2 Pulse at LT and VE/VCo2 at LT. A final multivariable model will
      be obtained using forward stepwise selection (minimising Akaike Information Criteria (AIC)).
      Its sensitivity to variable exclusion and re-inclusion will also be assessed using AIC. Model
      fit will be assessed using the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test. In order to explore the
      univariate relationship between CPET variables and length of stay, continuous CPET variables
      will be dichotomised at the optimal cut-point for the ROC curve and Kaplan-Meier curves will
      be constructed. The log rank test will be used to compare survival curves; patients who died
      before discharge will be treated as right-censored. All analyses will be conducted using
      Stata (StataCorp. 2011 Stata Statistical Software: Release 12. College Station, TX: StataCorp
      LP.). Continuous variables will be reported as mean and standard deviation (SD) or median and
      inter-quartile range (IQR) depending on the distribution. Categorical variables will be
      presented as frequency (percentage). P-values will be obtained using univariate logistic
      regression (continuous) and Chi-squared or Fisher's Exact tests (categorical). Statistical
      significance will be taken at 5%.

      We anticipate an overall death rate of 33.5% in 12 months post-surgery. We assumed that the
      death event rate would increase in the unfit (control) patient group up to 50% while the fit
      group would show the same average of 33.5% rate thus showing a difference of at least 16.5%.
      We consider that this size of the effect (50% reduced to 33.5%) is clinically relevant.
      Assuming 5% (2-sided) significance and 90% power, 150 events are needed to detect this size
      of difference in a log-rank survival comparison of the two trial groups. This requires 376
      patients in total in the analysis. We will inflate this total by approximately 20% to allow
      for attrition, giving a target recruitment of 470 patients (with complete data on CPET
      variables and outcome).
