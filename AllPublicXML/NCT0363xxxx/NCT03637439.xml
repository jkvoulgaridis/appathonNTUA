  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The flexibility of the hamstrings is a very important component both for general health and
      when exercising. The lack of hamstring flexibility has been related to the increase in the
      likelihood of suffering a large number of musculoskeletal pathologies, due to the possibility
      of causing important muscle imbalances, which include lumbar spine pathologies, such as disc
      hernias or spondyloarthrosis. In addition, the decrease in the flexibility of the hamstring
      musculature is also related to the increased likelihood of suffering muscle strains, patellar
      tendon tendinopathies, femoropatellar syndrome and decreased lumbopelvic rhythm.

      Clinically, an invasive technique has appeared, known as Ultrasound-guided Percutaneous
      Neuromodulation (PNM). This minimally invasive intervention consists in the application of a
      percutaneous electrical stimulation (PES) through an acupuncture needle-like electrode that
      is placed in close proximity to the nerve or motor point of the muscle with ultrasound
      guidance. At the clinical level, the PES is always used with the therapeutic aim of relieving
      chronic pain and neuropathic pain. Similarly, in sports, PES is used with the aim of
      improving muscular activity. Therefore, according to the characteristics and the therapeutic
      benefits of this technique, further research is needed to discover multiple clinical
      indications.

      The aim of this study was to examine the effects on flexibility and strength of an
      ultrasound-guided percutaneous neuromodulation intervention in patients with shortening of
      the hamstring muscles.

    <time_frame>Baseline and 5 minutes after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The sit and reach test is a common measure of flexibility of the lower back and hamstring muscles. Using a standard sit and reach box, the participant sat on the floor with shoes on, and fully extended one leg so that the sole of the foot was flat against the end of the box. She then extended her arms forward, placing one hand on top of the other. With palms down, she reached forward sling hands along the measuring scale as far as possible without bending the knee of the extended leg.</description>

    <description>Subjects were treated only once. Specifically, this consisted in the application of a square wave biphasic electrical current, with 10 Hz frequency, a 250µs pulse width, and the maximal tolerable intensity to cause an exacerbated muscle contraction for a total of 1.5 mins, according to the protocol (Valera &amp; Minaya). The subjects were lying prone in decubitus. The middle part of the sciatic nerve was located using an ultrasound machine (cross section), then an acupuncture needle (0.30 mm x 40 mm) was inserted in a short axis approach, perpendicular to the surface of the skin, to the perineurium of the sciatic nerve.</description>
