    <textblock>
      Primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) defines as presence of air in chest cavity occurs most
      commonly in young, tall, and smoker men without underlying lung disease.

      Trends for PSP treatment tend toward more invasive procedures. Thoracotomy with pleurectomy
      and bullectomy is definitive treatment of PSP which significantly reduces recurrence
      probability. This procedure has been reported to cause high rate of morbidity and mortality.
      Thus video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) has become the preferred method for
      treatment of PSP with recurrence rate of 5-10%. For persistent or recurrent cases, mechanical
      or chemical pleurodesis have been suggested.

      Based on guidelines patients with large size of lesions in CT or with unstable condition
      should undergo surgical procedure for recurrence prevention but Patients with small lesion
      size and stable condition can be only observed. Conservative management of PSP is safe and
      effective, but as mentioned this method has high recurrence rate. On the other hand fear of
      recurrence can negatively affect patients' quality of life, so that some patients prefer
      surgical intervention to observation management. Also some studies recommend invasive
      treatments because of cost effectiveness of this methods.

      As mentioned above, chemical pleurodesis is a usual method for treatment in patients with
      persistent or recurrent spontaneous pneumothorax. This method has been done using variety of
      chemical agents including tetracycline, minocycline, blood, and talc to irritate pleura.
      According to different studies tetracycline has the highest efficacy between irritant agents.

      In current study, the investigators have aimed to assess tetracycline chemical pleurodesis
      through tube thoracostomy in prevention of spontaneous pneumothorax in symptom free patients
      with normal CT-scan following first episode of PSP.
