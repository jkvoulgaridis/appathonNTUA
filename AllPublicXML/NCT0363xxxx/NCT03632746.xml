  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early gastric cancer is defined as gastric cancer that only invades mucosal or submucosal
      layer. The 5-year survival rate of gastric cancer can exceed 90% due to appropriate
      treatment. The most important consideration is whether there is lymph node metastasis.
      Preoperative examination including gastroscopy, endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) and CT are
      not accurate enough to predict lymph node metastasis in early gastric cancer. In a
      retrospective study, we created a nomogram to predict lymph node metastasis in early gastric
      cancer. In prospective validation, the sensitivity and specificity of the nomogram was 75%
      and 91%, respectively. Sentinel lymph node is a promising concept in early gastric cancer.
      Using carbon nanoparticles as tracer, the sensitivity and specificity of sentinel lymph node
      predicting lymph node metastasis in early gastric cancer were 90% and 100%. Based on these
      results, we proposed a new method that combines the Nomogram and sentinel lymph node to
      predict lymph node metastasis in early gastric cancer. First, the probability of lymph node
      metastasis of early gastric cancer patients is calculated by the Nomogram. Those with low
      incidence of lymph node metastasis continue to the sentinel lymph node procedure. A patient
      will be considered non lymph node metastasis if his/her frozen pathology of the sentinel
      lymph nodes is negative during the surgery. Then the standard radical gastrectomy is
      performed with lymphadenectomy. By comparing postoperative pathology and sentinel lymph node
      frozen pathology, the specificity of Nomogram combining sentinel lymph node predicting lymph
      node metastasis in early gastric patients is calculated. The primary endpoint of this
      research is that the specificity of the above-mentioned method is over 95%.
