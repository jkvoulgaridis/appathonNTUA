    <textblock>
      This pilot interventional cohort study will examine the effects of intravenous iron in adults
      with cystic fibrosis and iron deficiency.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Iron deficiency is common in adults with cystic fibrosis, and is associated with adverse
      outcomes. Oral iron supplementation is poorly tolerated and may be ineffective. In some
      centres, intravenous iron is used to correct iron deficiency, but concerns have been raised
      about the safety of this treatment in the setting of chronic airways infection. The
      investigators are therefore planning a pilot interventional cohort study examining the
      effects of intravenous iron in a group of adults with cystic fibrosis. Patients will be
      recruited in Oxford and studied prospectively over 16 weeks, with iron given at week 4. The
      primary focus of this single-centre pilot/feasibility study is safety, specifically in
      relation to infection.

    <measure>Change in quality of life (CFQ-R questionnaire)</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R) is a 48-item questionnaire that provides scores in twelve quality of life domains (physical functioning, vitality, emotional state, social limitations, role limitations, embarrassment, body image, eating disturbance, treatment constraints) and three symptom domains (respiratory, digestive, weight). Scores ranging from 0 to 100 are calculated for each quality of life domain, using a published method, where a higher score indicates a more favourable health status.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in quality of life (SF-36 questionnaire)</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The 36-item short form questionnaire (SF-36) provides scores in eight major domains of health (physical functioning, bodily pain, role limitations due to physical health problems, role limitations due to personal or emotional problems, emotional well-being, social functioning, energy/fatigue, and general health perceptions). Each is scored on a scale from 0-100, where a higher value represents a more favourable health status. The domains may be combined to provide two summary scores, namely the 'physical component summary' and the 'mental component summary', each of which is also scored from 0-100. In calculating the respective summary scores, subscales related to physical or psychological health (as appropriate) are positively weighted, according to a published method.</description>
