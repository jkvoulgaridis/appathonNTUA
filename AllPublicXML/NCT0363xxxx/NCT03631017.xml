    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of a study drug called PARPi-FL. This drug
      has been tested in animals but not yet in people. The purpose of this study is to test if a
      PARPi-FL scan can be used to take pictures of head and neck cancer. The usual approach to
      imaging this cancer includes several different imaging scans, including x-rays, CT (computed
      tomography), MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), and PET (positron emission tomography). These
      tests take pictures of the cancer.

    <description>The intervention of this study is the injection of a microdose (&lt; 10 0 ug) of [18 F]- PARPi followed by 3 PET/CT studies to determine the biodistribution of this imaging agent in normal organs as well as the kinetics of uptake in squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck.</description>

    <description>Patients will be injected with approximately 10 mCi of [18F]PARPi and a dynamic PET scan of will be acquired for approximately 30 minutes. A second body PET/CT scan will be started approximately 60 min post injection, and a third PET/CT scan will be started at approximately 120 min post injection. The first (dynamic) and the second (body) PET/CT scan will use &quot;ultra -low dose&quot; CT scan for attenuation correction. The last PET/CT scan will be performed with the investigator's regular clinical low-dose CT settings.</description>
