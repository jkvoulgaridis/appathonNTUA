  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hyponatremia is defined as sodium below the normal range of 135-145. Symptomatically, it can
      cause patients to experience a wide range of symptoms including lethargy, headache, nausea,
      vomiting and in severe cases coma and even death. The goal of this study is to prospectively
      compare two approaches to the postoperative fluid management of patients undergoing
      transsphenoidal resection of a pituitary tumor or cyst to decrease the occurrence of
      postoperative delayed hyponatremia. One group will be placed on moderate fluid restriction
      and the other group will be placed on ad lib fluid intake.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Any adult patient with a pituitary adenoma (either non-functioning, prolactin-secreting,
      growth hormone secreting, gonadotropin secreting, or TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone)
      secreting) or cyst scheduled to undergo transsphenoidal resection will be included in the
      study. Patients with chronic hyponatremia will be excluded.

      Patients will be randomly assigned to one of two groups:

      Group 1: these patients will be treated with moderate fluid restriction (1000 ml/24 hours for
      patients &lt;100kg and 1200 ml of fluid/24 hours for &gt;100 kg starting on postoperative day 1.
      Fluid restriction will be aborted if diabetes insipidus occurs. Diabetes insipidus occurs if
      a patient does not produce enough ADH (anti-diuretic hormone) which is needed to concentrate
      the urine. Diabetes insipidus causes increased urination and increased thirst and can cause
      hypernatremia (an increased sodium level). A person will be diagnosed with diabetes insipidus
      if they meet all of the following criteria: serum sodium level &gt; 146, dilute urine with a
      urine specific gravity &lt; 1.003 and increased urine output defined by urine output &gt;
      300cc/hour for 2 consecutive hours( or &gt; 6 liter/24 hours).

      Group 2: these patients will not be placed on fluid restriction, they will be allowed to
      drink water freely after surgery.

      All patients will be started on D5 ½ normal saline IV fluids (Weight based) and will be
      allowed to eat and drink starting on POD 1.

      All the patients will receive a thirst questionnaire that will be completed daily starting on
      POD 1 until POD 13. The intensity of thirst will be assessed on a scale of 1--10, with 1
      being no thirst, 5 being normal thirst and 10 being unbearable thirst.

      Patients will have basic metabolic panels checked on post-surgical days 1, 3, 7, 10 and 13.

    <description>Patients will be started on a weight-based intravenous fluid replacement with D5 ½ NS on POD 0 (75 cc/hr for patients &lt; 70kg, 100 cc/hr for patients 70-100kg, and 125 cc/hr for patients &gt;100kg). Patients will be allowed to drink water freely after surgery on POD #0. Fluids will be stopped at 8am on POD 1 and patients will be started on a moderate fluid restriction on POD #3 based on their weight (1000 cc/24 hours for patients who weigh &lt;=100 kg and 1200 cc/24 hours for patients who weigh &gt; 100kg). Prior to initiation of a fluid restriction all of the following criteria have to be met:
Serum Na level must be &lt; 145 mEq/l
Patient should be taking fluids by mouth
Patient should not have evidence of DI (as determined by endocrine team following patient) If a patient in Fluid Restricted group develops DI, the fluid restriction will be stopped/not initiated.</description>
