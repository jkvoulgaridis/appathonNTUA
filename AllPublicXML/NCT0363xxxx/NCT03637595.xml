    <textblock>
      This study will assess the efficacy and mechanisms behind Energy Medicine in reducing chronic
      knee pain within an outpatient setting. This study will investigate a form of Energy Medicine
      (EM) performed by a natural solo practitioner, using a standard number of three sessions,
      which will compare to both positive and negative control groups. The positive control group
      will receive acupuncture and the negative control group will receive a sham intervention.
