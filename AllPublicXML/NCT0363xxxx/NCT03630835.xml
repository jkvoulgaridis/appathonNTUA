      Introduction Stroke represents the third cause of death, the first cause of handicap and the
      second cause of dementia in Europe. Carotid atherosclerotic plaques are the cause of ischemic
      stroke in about 15 to 20 % of the patients. In presence of carotid stenosis &gt; 50 %, the risk
      of ischemic stroke is estimated at about 10% per year when the patient has presented symptoms
      of cerebral ischemia but only at 2% per year in asymptomatic patients. Clinical benefits of
      surgical carotid endarterectomy have been demonstrated in symptomatic patients with high
      degree of carotid stenosis, but remain debatable in asymptomatic patients and should be
      balanced with the risks associated with the revascularization procedure. There is an urgent
      need to develop imaging tools that improve the identification of patients at highest risk of
      developing an ischemic stroke Cellular apoptosis is a key feature of ruptured plaques.
      Apoptotic macrophages release large amounts of tissue factor within the plaque thereby
      fostering thrombus formation when plaques rupture. Annexin-V is a 36-kDa protein that binds
      with high affinity and high specificity to phosphatidylserine (PS) head groups expressed on
      the cell surface at early stages of the apoptotic process. In addition, activated platelets
      express large amounts of PS at their surface. In a proof-of-concept study, 99mTc-Annexin-V
      uptake was detected by scintigraphy in carotid atherosclerotic plaques of 4 patients who
      presented an acute ischemic stroke and was associated with the presence of apoptotic cells on
      corresponding carotid plaques obtained after carotid endarterectomy procedure.

      Design : Monocentric interventional non comparative study Investigational medicinal
      product(s): 99mTc-Annexin-V-128 Statistical procedure : Statistical analysis will be
      performed at the end of the study after blinded review and data freezing.

      99mTc-Annexin-V-128 uptake will be analyzed as a binary variable considering the presence or
      absence of detection and as a quantitative variable for the intensity of signal.

    <description>Concordance will be assessed by Cohen's kappa coefficient between:

And

    <description>An intravenous catheter will be placed in the forearm and a dose of 370 Mega-Becquerels of 99mTc-Annexin-V-128 (1-2 ml) over 10 seconds will be injected through the catheter. The patient will wait for 90 minutes in semi-supine position for the clearance of the radiotracer from blood. At 90 minutes p.i., the patient will be placed in a supine position on the bed of a SPECT-CT gamma-camera. A SPECT acquisition including the heart and the brain will be performed over 20 minutes. At the end of the SPECT acquisition, the bed will move to the CT of the imaging system. A CT angiography will be acquired during the intravenous injection of 30-40 ml of iodinated CT contrast agent from the heart to the brain to localize the signal on the SPECT images. The iodinated contrast agent that is currently available at Bichat Hospital for CTA is Iomeron 400 provided by Bracco Imaging.
The total duration of the imaging study will be 2 hours.</description>
