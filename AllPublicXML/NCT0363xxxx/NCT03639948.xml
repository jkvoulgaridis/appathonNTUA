  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The standard treatment for women with stage I, II, and III triple-negative breast cancer
      (TNBC) includes chemotherapy and surgery, with or without radiation therapy. However, because
      TNBC is usually more aggressive, harder to treat, and more likely to come back, it is
      associated with poor long-term outcomes (survival rates) when compared to other types of
      breast cancer. Therefore, researchers are studying how new drugs and treatment combinations
      can improve the outcome of patients with TNBC. This study will test effectiveness of immune
      therapy (Pembrolizumab is an &quot;immunotherapy&quot; that is expected to work with the body's immune
      system to help fight cancer) in combination with chemotherapy given before surgery.
