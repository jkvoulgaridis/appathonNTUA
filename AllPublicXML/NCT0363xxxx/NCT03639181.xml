  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An open-label, single-arm, phase II clinical study of anti-PD-1 antibody GB226 in treatment
      of recurrent or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (B-NHL)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      GB226, 3mg/kg/time, is intravenously infused once every two weeks until disease progression,
      intolerable toxicity or study withdrawal decided by the investigator/subject. It is expected
      that each subject will be followed for 2 years. Subjects receiving GB226 treatment will be
      followed once every 2 weeks to the end of this study. If the patients terminate the treatment
      and their imaging assessment shows no progressive disease (PD), they should be followed once
      every 6 weeks until progressive disease (imaging evaluation). If the patients have
      progressive disease (imaging assessment), they should be followed every 3 months until the
      end of this study or premature withdrawal from the study. Relevant tests and evaluation
      should be completed at each visit according to standard of care. The follow-up visits can be
      performed by telephone. During the study, subjects must complete one imaging test and
      efficacy evaluation every 6 weeks until disease progression. Moreover, patients should be
      closely monitored for adverse events from subject enrollment to 30 days after the last dosing
