  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study looks at different tablets with a new study medicine called semaglutide. It is to
      treat diabetes. The aim of the study is to find out how much study medicine from 4 different
      tablets is taken up in the body. Participants will either get semaglutide in the tablet
      currently being studied in large studies, or 1 of the 3 new tablets that also contains
      'semaglutide' - which treatment participants get is decided by chance. The tablet version of
      study medicine is a new medicine that cannot be prescribed. Semaglutide can be prescribed as
      injections for the treatment of diabetes in some countries. Participants will get 1 tablet
      per day for 10 days. The tablets should be taken in the morning by mouth together with half a
      glass of water. After dosing participants have to wait 30 minutes before participants may eat
      or drink. The study will last up to 70 days. Participants will have 17 clinic visits with the
      study doctor. Some of the visits are overnight stays. Participants will have blood tests at
      every visit.
