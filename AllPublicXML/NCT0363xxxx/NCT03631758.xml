  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patient decision aids are tools that help guide individuals through a healthcare-related
      decision making process. They help users combine evidence-based information and
      recommendations by a health care provider with their personal needs, values and preferences.
      Through this project, Dr. Dobbins and her research team will explore whether the use of
      patient decision aids with high-quality and user-friendly summaries of research evidence, or
      summaries of research evidence alone, help to improve the quality of decision making by women
      facing breast cancer screening decisions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Guidelines for breast screening in Canada are based on low-moderate quality evidence of
      effectiveness and screening is associated with potential harms. Patient Decision Aids (PDAs)
      are tools that assist users to understand treatment options, risks and benefits to align
      decisions with values and preferences. The investigators would now like to know whether use
      of a PDA alongside evidence-based information provided through the McMaster Optimal Aging
      Portal, or simply access to evidence-based information alone, can help users to make informed
      decisions about breast cancer screening in women.
