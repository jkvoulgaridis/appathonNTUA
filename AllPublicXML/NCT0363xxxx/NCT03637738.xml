  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current breast cancer treatment is based on surgery, radiation, chemotherapy and
      hormonotherapy. Conservative surgery or mastectomy are followed by complementary externe
      radiotherapy.

      This adjuvant external breast radiotherapy (EBRT) is heavy, spread over more than 6 weeks
      with :

        -  25 sessions and delivery of a unit dose of 2 Gy to obtain a total dose of 50 Gy (5
           sessions per week in general);

        -  16 Gy overimpression (boost) dose located in the tumour bed, in 5 to 8 fractions, in
           situations at high risk of recurrence.

      In addition, EBRT is responsible for many adverse effects, some of which can lead to lasting
      or permanent sequelae.

      Many focused partial breast irradiation techniques have been developed in recent years with
      the objective of reducing the duration and morbidity of overall breast irradiation.

      Among these techniques, intraoperative breast radiotherapy (IBRT) is recommended in cancers
      diagnosed at early stages for which tumorectomy is expected and which present a low risk of
      recurrence.

      The main advantages of IBRTare :

        -  Improvement of the quality of life due to a single session of radiotherapy associated
           with surgical ;

        -  Increased precision to deliver the necessary dose in tumour tissue;

        -  Preservation of surrounding healthy tissue ;

        -  Reduction in the overall cost of treatment through shorter hospital stays and the
           absence of medical transport for conventional radiotherapy sessions.

      RIOP SEIN is a project supported by Institut National du Cancer (INCa)

      , which consists of a medico-economic evaluation of IBRT, with Intrabeam® system on surgical
      resection bed relative to conventional surgery + EBRT in postmenopausal patients operated by
      conservative surgery for Low risk breast cancer

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Main objective is the economic comparison Intrabeam® system versus EBRT, in terms of real
      costs. Costs will be taken into account:

        -  of equipment,

        -  of staff,

        -  of transport.

      Secondary objectives are :

        -  Compare local-regional survival without recurrence with conventional irradiation

        -  Analyze the rate of early and late complications

        -  Impact of intraoperative irradiation on the esthetic outcome and quality of life of
           patients

      Schedule of the visits :

      RIOP arm : Surgery with Intrabeam®. A first visit will be scheduled at 2 months from surgery
      then at 6 months then every 6 months for 5 years, then every year after 5 years.

      RTE arm: surgery, EBRT over 33 sessions then visit at 6 months then every 6 months 6 for 5
      years, then every year after 5 years.

      In RIOP ARM, additional EBRT may be performed +/- chemotherapy if the treatment received is
      insufficient.

      Quality of life will be assessed in each treatment arm at inclusion before randomization, 2
      months after surgery, every 6 months for 5 years and every year after 5 years using quality
      of life questionnaires: Euroqol EQ 5D, European Organisation for Research and Treatment of
      Cancer (EORTC)-QlQ-C30 and BR23 module specific for breast cancer.
