  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type (NKTCL) is a highly aggressive
      peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL). Patients with newly diagnosed stage IV and
      relapsed/refractory have poor prognosis. 5-year progression-free survival was reported only
      55%. Chidamide is a selective histone deacetylase inhibitor which was approved by FDA in
      treating relapsed or refractory PTCL. In phase I and II studies of chidamide, patients with
      relapsed or refractory NKTCL achieved a higher overall remission. Patients who obtained
      complete or partial remission had much favourable duration of remission. Thus, the invesgator
      design this study to evaluate the role of maintenance treatment of chidamide for induction
      chemotherapy-responded newly-diagnosed advanced and relapsed/refractory NKTCL patients.
