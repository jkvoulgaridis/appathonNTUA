      Cardiac surgery is a recommended therapeutic option as a form of secondary prevention for the
      treatment of cardiovascular diseases, but may present postoperative alterations such as
      reduction of pulmonary volumes and flows, impairment in gas exchange and increase in the rate
      of pulmonary complications. The use of positive pressure may reduce these complications.
      Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of positive expiratory pressure (PEP) in the blow-bottle
      device compared to expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP), both associated with
      conventional physiotherapy, and conventional physiotherapy in the pulmonary function in
      postoperative cardiac patients through a randomized clinical trial. Methods: The study was
      approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Hospital de Cl√≠nicas of Porto Alegre (CAEE:
      70213617.6.0000.5327). Patients undergoing cardiac surgery were randomized into three groups:
      positive expiratory pressure with blow-bottle device associated with conventional
      physiotherapy (G1), positive expiratory pressure in the airways with unidirectional valve
      associated with conventional physiotherapy (G2), and the third group only the conventional
      physiotherapy of HCPA cardiac intensive care unit (G3). Initially, an evaluation was
      performed through spirometry, manovacuometry, radiological changes in the preoperative
      period, prior to the interventions (immediate postoperative) and on the third postoperative
      day, immediately prior to cardiac intensive care unit discharge. Pulmonary complications were
      assessed on the third postoperative day, and length of stay (at the Intensive Care Unit and
      hospital) were recorded untill discharge.

      Cardiac surgery is a recommended therapeutic option as a form of secondary prevention for the

      reduction of pulmonary volumes and flows, impairment in gas exchange and increase in the rate
      of pulmonary complications. The use of positive pressure may reduce these complications.
      Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of positive expiratory pressure (PEP) in the blow-bottle
      device compared to expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP), both associated with
      conventional physiotherapy, and conventional physiotherapy in the pulmonary function in
      postoperative cardiac patients. Methods:This is a randomized clinical trial, with patients in
      postoperative cardiac surgery. On the first day of postoperative, the patients will be
      randomized into three groups: 1 group that will receive positive expiratory pressure with
      blow-bottle device associated with conventional physiotherapy; 2- group that will receive
      positive expiratory pressure in the airways with valve unidirectional therapy associated with
      conventional physiotherapy; 3- group that will only receive conventional physiotherapy. The
      intervention of the positive expiratory pressure with blow-bottle device group will consist
      of exercise with a blow-bottle device of 10 cm high; the positive expiratory pressure in the
      airways group, exercise with unidirectional positive expiratory pressure valve (10cmH2O).
      Both the groups will perform three sets of 10 repetitions per day, by the third day of PO.
      The third group will receive conventional physiotherapy of intensive care unit. The outcomes
      evaluated will be: pulmonary function (primary), respiratory muscle strength, pulmonary
      complications, radiological changes and length of stay (at the Intensive CareUnit - ICU - and
      hospital). Assessment of pulmonary function, muscle strength and radiological changes will be
      performed in the preoperative period, prior to the interventions and on the third
      postoperative day, immediately prior to discharge of cardiac intensive care unit. Pulmonary
      complications and ICU length of stay will be recorded after discharge from intensive care
      unit cardiac. The length of hospital stay was recorded after hospital discharge.

    <description>A 500-milliliter enteral nutrition vial will be used, which will contain a hole in the side, where two silicone tubes of 20 centimeters long will be inserted together with tape on the bottleneck of the vial. To perform the exercise, the vial will be filled with water leaving a water column of 10 cm high. Deep inspirations will be requested at a volume greater than the tidal volume and less than the total lung capacity that can be performed via nasal or oral, then with the mouth connected to the extensors, the patient will exhale slowly, avoiding to totally empty the lungs. The protocol will be executed twice a day, three sets of ten repetitions. The group will receive the conventional physiotherapy of the cardiac intensive care unit of the HCPA.</description>

    <description>The Vital Signs ¬Æ EPAP kit will be used. Exercises will be performed in the bed, and as soon as the patient is released by the medical team to leave the bed, they can be performed in the sitting position or in orthostasis. For performing the exercise, the EPAP mask will be connected to the face of the patient. The expiratory pressure will be adjusted to 10cmH2O. Deep inspirations will be requested at a volume greater than the tidal volume and below the total lung capacity, then the patient will exhale slowly. The protocol will be executed twice a day, three sets of ten repetitions. The group will receive the conventional physiotherapy of the cardiac intensive care unit of the HCPA, as described in the conventional physiotherapy group.</description>

    <description>Conventional physical therapy consists of ventilatory exercises, bronchial hygiene techniques, passive, active-assisted or active exercises for upper and lower limbs, and resisted lower limb exercises; stretching, cough and walking guidelines. Initially the exercises will be performed in the bed, as soon as this is withdrawn and the patient is released by the medical team to leave the bed, the progression of the exercises to be performed in the sitting position, orthostasis, and ambulation is performed, this usually occurs on the 2nd postoperative day, after the removal of the mediastinal drain . Under supervision of the physiotherapist, the protocol will be performed twice daily, two sets of ten repetitions.</description>
