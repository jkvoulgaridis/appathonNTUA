  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to determine the effect of kefir, a natural probiotic, on appetite
      in healthy subjects. A randomized, single-blind and 3-intervention crossover trial included
      22 healthy and normal-weight (BMI 18.5-25 kg/m2) females aged 21-24 years. All participants
      were submitted to three different breakfasts: a low GI and milk content (LGI-Milk), a low GI
      and kefir content (LGI-Kefir), and a high GI and kefir content (HGI-Kefir), with a 1-week
      washout period between meals. Appetite ratings was measured at 0, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150
      and 180 minutes. At the end of three hours, participants were served ad libitum lunch meal.
      Then, the foods eaten at lunch were recorded and their energy and nutrient analysis was
      calculated.

    <measure>Hunger rating</measure>
    <time_frame>Three hours postprandial period</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective assessment of appetite sensations was performed by using a visual analog scale (VAS) composed of lines (of 100 mm in length) with words anchored at each end, expressing the most positive and the most negative rating. VAS ratings were measured by using a question &quot;How hungry do you feel? (not at all hungry - as hungry as I ever felt)&quot; at time points 0, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 minutes, and hunger rating was quantified as AUC (mm x min), which was calculated according to the trapezoidal rule by using those VAS scores. Total scale score changes in a range of 0-100. Higher values represent a worse outcome.</description>

    <measure>Fullness rating</measure>
    <time_frame>Three hours postprandial period</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective assessment of appetite sensations was performed by using a visual analog scale (VAS) composed of lines (of 100 mm in length) with words anchored at each end, expressing the most positive and the most negative rating. VAS ratings were measured by using a question &quot;How full do you feel? (not at all full - totally full)&quot; at time points 0, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 minutes, and fullness rating was quantified as AUC (mm x min), which was calculated according to the trapezoidal rule by using those VAS scores. Total scale score changes in a range of 0-100. Higher values represent a better outcome.</description>

    <measure>Desiring to eat</measure>
    <time_frame>Three hours postprandial period</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective assessment of appetite sensations was performed by using a visual analog scale (VAS) composed of lines (of 100 mm in length) with words anchored at each end, expressing the most positive and the most negative rating. VAS ratings were measured by using a question &quot;How strong is your desire to eat? (very weak - very strong)&quot; at time points 0, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 minutes, and desiring to eat was quantified as AUC (mm x min), which was calculated according to the trapezoidal rule by using those VAS scores. Total scale score changes in a range of 0-100. Higher values represent a worse outcome.</description>

    <measure>Prospective food consumption</measure>
    <time_frame>Three hours postprandial period</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective assessment of appetite sensations was performed by using a visual analog scale (VAS) composed of lines (of 100 mm in length) with words anchored at each end, expressing the most positive and the most negative rating. VAS ratings were measured by using a question &quot;How much do you think you can eat? (no food at all - a large amount of food)&quot; at time points 0, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 minutes, and prospective food consumption was quantified as AUC (mm x min), which was calculated according to the trapezoidal rule by using those VAS scores. Total scale score changes in a range of 0-100. Higher values represent a worse outcome.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Composite appetite score</measure>
    <time_frame>Three hours postprandial period</time_frame>
    <description>The separate visual analog scale components such as hunger, fullness, desire to eat and prospective food consumption were combined to produce an additional measure termed 'composite appetite score'. This validated average appetite score was calculated for each time point 0, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 minutes using the following equation: [(hunger + desire to eat + prospective food consumption + (100 - fullness)]/4 Total scale score changes in a range of 0-100. Higher values represent a worse outcome.</description>

    <measure>Desiring for sweet</measure>
    <time_frame>Three hours postprandial period</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective assessment of desire for specific food types was performed by using a visual analog scale (VAS) composed of lines (of 100 mm in length) with words anchored at each end, expressing the most positive and the most negative rating. VAS ratings were measured by using a question &quot;Would you like to eat something sweet? (No, not at all - Yes, very much)&quot; at time points 0, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 minutes, and desiring for sweet was quantified as AUC (mm x min), which was calculated according to the trapezoidal rule by using those VAS scores. Total scale score changes in a range of 0-100. Higher values represent a worse outcome.</description>
