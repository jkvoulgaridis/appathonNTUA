  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase III randomized, 2 x 2 design, open label, multi-center study that will assess the
      removal of filter ventilation on smoking behavior and biomarkers in a tobacco and nicotine
      product marketplace simulation of a real world environment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, open label, controlled multi-site study will simulate a &quot;real world&quot; tobacco
      environment by providing access to an experimental marketplace where they will be given
      vouchers that can be exchanged for assigned study cigarettes (either ventilated or
      unventilated) and two of the groups will also have access to non-combusted tobacco/nicotine
      products.

      Subjects (N=550; N=125 in each group) will be randomly assigned to: 1) Ventilated cigarettes
      only; or 2) Unventilated cigarettes only; 3) Ventilated cigarettes + alternative nicotine
      delivery systems (ANDS); 4) Unventilated cigarettes + ANDS.

      Smokers will undergo an in person screening and then a 12 week experimental trial consisting
      of 2 weeks of baseline; 2 weeks of usual brand cigarettes in the marketplace and 8 weeks on
      the study cigarettes in the marketplace, plus a follow-up visit 4 weeks after the
      intervention is over. The experimental period will simulate a &quot;real world&quot; environment by
      providing participants with vouchers for a specified number of points that can be exchanged
      for study cigarettes and/or ANDS. At the end of the study they can exchange unspent points
      for money.

      Biomarker samples (total nicotine equivalents, tobacco specific nitrosamines, volatile
      organic compound and inflammation markers), smoking topography and inhalation measures are
      taken at baseline and end of trial.
