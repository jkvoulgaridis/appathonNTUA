  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study (POLAR), is designed to assess the antiviral activity and safety of CAB LA plus
      RPV LA, administered Q2M, in approximately 100 adult HIV-1 infected, antiretroviral (ART)
      experienced subjects. Subjects will rollover from the NCT01641809(LATTE) study, who have
      completed minimum duration of Week 312 and with demonstrated HIV-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA)
      suppression (&lt;50 copies (c) per milliliter [mL]), while receiving a two-drug regimen
      consisting of once-daily oral CAB at 30 milligram (mg) plus RPV at 25 mg. The subjects will
      be offered the option to switch to the LA, intramuscular injections of CAB LA plus RPV LA,
      Q2M or the oral fixed dose combination (FDC) of dolutegravir (DTG) plus RPV, for the
      continued maintenance of HIV-1 RNA suppression, known as the Maintenance Phase (From Day 1 to
      Commercial Approval). Duration of study will vary from country to country, until regiment
      receives regulatory approval and becomes commercially available. The study plans to enroll
      approximately 100 subjects. Any subject who receives at least one dose of CAB LA and/or RPV
      LA and discontinues the CAB LA plus RPV LA regimen for any reason will enter a 52-week
      Long-Term Follow-Up (LTFU) phase. Those subjects must remain on suppressive highly active
      antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for at least 52 weeks after the last dose of CAB LA and or RPV
      LA.

    <measure>Change from Baseline (Day 1) in HIV Dependent Quality of Life (HIVDQoL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Up to Month12</time_frame>
    <description>The HIVDQoL is an individualized, self-completion questionnaire, specifically designed to measure quality of life in people living with HIV. The HIVDQoL was based on Audit of Diabetes-Dependent Quality of Life (ADDQoL) -a widely used questionnaire designed for diabetics and linguistically validated in more than 60 languages. The HIVDQoL includes two overview items, 26 condition-specific domain items and a free text box. The overview items ask subjects to rate their generic 'present QoL' (7-point Likert scale, ranging from 3 [excellent] to -3 [extremely bad]) and HIV-specific 'impact of HIV on QoL' (5-point Likert scale, ranging from 3 [very much better] to 1 [worse]). The &quot;Preference&quot; question will contain a single item exploring whether subjects prefer the CAB LA + RPV LA injectable to the oral CAB + RPV regimen administered in LATTE. The &quot;Reason for Switch&quot; question will contain a single item exploring the reasons why subjects are interested in switching to the CAB LA + RPV LA.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline (Day 1) in HIV Treatment Satisfaction Status Questionnaire (HIVTSQs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Up to Month12</time_frame>
    <description>The HIVTSQ is a 10-item self-reported scale which will measure the overall satisfaction with treatment and by specific domains e.g. convenience, flexibility. The items will be summed up to produce a treatment satisfaction score (0 to 60) and an individual satisfaction rating for each item (0 to 6) and two subscales: general satisfaction/clinical and lifestyle/ease subscales. The higher the score, the greater the improvement in treatment satisfaction as compared to the past few weeks. A smaller score represents a decline in treatment satisfaction compared to the past few weeks. Change from Baseline was defined as the post-Baseline value minus the value at Baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in treatment satisfaction over time using the HIV Treatment Satisfaction Change Questionnaire (HIVTSQc)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Up to Month12</time_frame>
    <description>HIVTSQc is 12-item questionnaire, which retains option of calculating the total score as if it only had the original 10 items (as the original 10 items are included in the HIVTSQ 12). In addition, it allows for calculation of an 11-item scale score including the &quot;easy/difficult&quot; item (item-11). The &quot;pain/discomfort&quot; item (item-12) will be included in questionnaire as a stand-alone item to evaluate potentially painful injectables. Overall satisfaction with treatment and by specific domains e.g. convenience, flexibility is assessed. The items are summed up to produce treatment satisfaction score (0 to 60) and an individual satisfaction rating for each item (0 to 6) and two subscales: general satisfaction/clinical and lifestyle/ease subscales. Higher the score, greater the improvement in treatment satisfaction as compared to the past few weeks. Change from Baseline was defined as the post-Baseline value minus the value at Baseline.</description>

             excluded, however Investigators must carefully assess if therapy specific for HCV
             infection is required; subjects who are anticipated to require HCV treatment within 12
             months must be excluded. (HCV treatment on study may be permitted, following
             consultation with the medical monitor).

          -  Subjects with HCV co-infection will be allowed entry into this study if: Liver enzymes
             meet entry criteria; HCV Disease has undergone appropriate work-up, and is not
             advanced.

          -  Additional information (where available) on subjects, with HCV coinfection at
             screening should include results from any liver biopsy, Fibroscan, ultrasound, or
             other fibrosis evaluation, history of cirrhosis or other decompensated liver disease,
             prior treatment, and timing/plan for HCV treatment.

          -  In the event that recent biopsy or imaging data is not available or inconclusive, the
             fibrosis- 4 (Fib-4) score will be used to verify eligibility where Fib-4 score &gt;3.25
             is exclusionary; Fib-4 scores 1.45 - 3.25 requires Medical Monitor consultation where
             the Fibrosis 4 Score Formula: age multiplied by aspartate amino transferase (AST)
             divided by platelets multiplied by square of alanine aminotransferase (ALT).

          -  Unstable liver disease (as defined by any of the following: presence of ascites,
             encephalopathy, coagulopathy, hypoalbuminemia, esophageal or gastric varices, or
             persistent jaundice or cirrhosis), known biliary abnormalities (with the exception of
             Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones or otherwise stable chronic liver
             disease per investigator assessment).

          -  History of liver cirrhosis with or without hepatitis viral co-infection.

          -  Ongoing or clinically relevant pancreatitis.

          -  Clinically significant cardiovascular disease, as defined by history/evidence of
             congestive heart failure, symptomatic arrhythmia, angina/ischemia, coronary artery
             bypass grafting (CABG) surgery or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty
             (PTCA) or any clinically significant cardiac disease.

          -  Ongoing malignancy other than cutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma, basal cell carcinoma, or
             resected, non-invasive cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, or cervical intraepithelial
             neoplasia; other localized malignancies require agreement between the investigator and
             the Study medical monitor for inclusion of the subject prior to randomization.

          -  Any condition which, in the opinion of the Investigator, may interfere with the
             absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of the study drugs or render the
             subject unable to receive study medication.

          -  History or presence of allergy or intolerance to the study drugs or their components
             or drugs of their class. In addition, if heparin is used during pharmacokinetic (PK)
             sampling, subjects with a history of sensitivity to heparin or heparin-induced
             thrombocytopenia must not be enrolled.

          -  Current or anticipated need for chronic anti-coagulation with the exception of the use
             of low dose acetylsalicylic acid (&lt;=325 mg) or hereditary coagulation and platelet
             disorders such as hemophilia or Von Willebrand Disease.

          -  Corrected QT interval (QTc (Bazett)) &gt;450 millisecond (msec) or QTc (Bazett) &gt;480 msec
             for subjects with bundle branch block.

          -  Any verified Grade 4 laboratory abnormality over the last 6 months in LATTE. A single
             repeat test is allowed to verify a result.

          -  Any acute laboratory abnormality over the last 6 months in LATTE, which, in the
             opinion of the investigator, would preclude the subject's participation in the study
             of an investigational compound.

          -  ALT&gt;=5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) or ALT &gt;= 3 times ULN and bilirubin &gt;=
             1.5xULN (with &gt;35% direct bilirubin) over the last 6 months in LATTE.

          -  Exposure to an experimental drug (with the exception of those in the LATTE study
             including CAB and RPV) or experimental vaccine within either 30 days, 5 half-lives of
             the test agent, or twice the duration of the biological effect of the test agent,
             whichever is longer, prior to Day 1 of this study.

          -  Treatment with any of the following agents within 28 days of Day 1: radiation therapy,
             cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents, tuberculosis therapy with the exception of
             isoniazid (isonicotinylhydrazid [INH]); anti-coagulation agents.

          -  Immunomodulators that alter immune responses such as chronic systemic corticosteroids,
             interleukins, or interferons. Note: Subjects using short-term (e.g. &lt;=21 days)
             systemic corticosteroid treatment; topical, inhaled and intranasal corticosteroids are
             eligible for enrolment.

          -  Use of medications which are associated with Torsade de Pointes must be discussed with
             the Medical Monitor to determine eligibility.

          -  Subjects receiving any prohibited medication and who are unwilling or unable to switch
             to an alternate medication. Any prohibited medications that decrease CAB, RPV and/or
             DTG concentrations should be discontinued for a minimum of four weeks or a minimum of
             three half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose and any other
             prohibited medications should be discontinued for a minimum of two weeks or a minimum
             of three half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose.
