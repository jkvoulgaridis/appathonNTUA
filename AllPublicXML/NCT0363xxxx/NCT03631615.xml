      1. Target population: patients with resectable locally advanced proximal (including
           gastroesophageal junction, fundus and upper body) stomach adenocarcinoma (cT3-4aN+M0).

        2. Primary objective: pathological complete remission (pCR) rate of neoadjuvant
           chemoradiation plus PD-1 antibody (SHR-1210) in patients with locally advanced proximal
           stomach adenocarcinoma.

      Secondary objectives:

        1. pathological remission rate (pRR) of neoadjuvant chemoradiation plus PD-1 antibody
           (SHR-1210)

        2. objective response rate (ORR) of neoadjuvant chemoradiation plus PD-1 antibody
           (SHR-1210)

        3. progression free survival (PFS)/ overall survival (OS) of neoadjuvant chemoradiation
           plus PD-1 antibody (SHR-1210)

        4. safety of neoadjuvant chemoradiation plus PD-1 antibody (SHR-1210)

      3.Trial design: This is a monocenter, single arm, phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of neoadjuvant chemoradiation plus PD-1 antibody (SHR-1210) in patients with locally
      advanced proximal stomach adenocarcinoma.

      4.Treatment plan:

      Patients will be given the perioperative treatment as below once recruited:

        1. induction chemotherapy (3w): one cycle of XELOX regimen (capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 bid*14d
           + oxaliplatin 130mg/m2, d1, Q21d);

        2. within one week after the induction, concurrent chemoradiation will be started (5w):
           intensity modulated radiotherapy was given for tumors and high-risk lymphatic drainage
           areas, total dose:45Gy/25d, 1.8Gy/d, capecitabine (850 mg/m2, bid, po) will be given
           during radiotherapy as sensitizer.

        3. consolidation chemotherapy will be started in 2-3w after concurrent chemoradiation: one
           cycle of XELOX regimen (capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 bid*14d + oxaliplatin 130mg/m2, d1,
           Q21d); From the beginning of induction chemo to 3w before surgery, PD-1 antibody
           SHR-1210 will be given（200mg, iv, q3w).

      Re-evaluation will be conducted in 1-3w after consolidation chemo, resectable patients will
      receive D2 resection.

      Adjuvant chemo: We advice starting 4 cycles of XELOX regimen (capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 bid*14d
      + oxaliplatin 130mg/m2, d1, Q21d) in 4-6w after surgery.

      5.Number of subjects: 36 patients. Number of centers: 1 sites ( Fudan University Affiliated
      Zhongshan Hospital, which has high volume of gastric operations in China, more than 500 per
      year).

      Backgrounds:

      SHR-1210 is a PD-1 antibody developed by Jiangsu Heng Rui Medicine Co. Nowadays, fifteen
      clinical trials of this drug have been conducted in patients with different types of advanced
      malignant tumor, including one combined with radiotherapy and three combined with
      chemotherapy. Until now, SHR-1210 has exhibited favorable safety in recruited patients.
      Incidence rate of SAE is only 1%.

      Several big scale clinical research like POET, RTOG 9904 and TOPGEAR have proofed the
      efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant chemoradiation in treating locally advanced GEJ cancer or
      gastric cancer.

      Study design:

      This clinical trial will be conducted under Simon's optimal two-stage design. The first stage
      needs 15 participants, if ≥1 participants acquire remission, then the study will move on to
      the second stage and enroll the rest 21 participants. The total sample size will be 36
      patients.

      We will shut down the study in advance, if situations below happens: 1) 1 treatment related
      death, &gt;3 disease progression or &gt;2 hyper-progressive disease happen during the first stage;
      2) 2 treatment related death, &gt;6 disease progression or &gt;4 hyper-progressive disease happen
      during the whole study.

      Patients with abnormal autoimmune status, unfavorable body function, factors impeding drug
      taking, absorption and metabolism will be excluded. Study participants with disease
      progression or severe/ intolerant toxicity during treatment will withdraw the study.

      Hyper-progressive disease is defined as 1) progression 2) more than doubled growth rate 3)
      tumor volume increase &gt;50% in 2 months after initialing the treatment.
