  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose escalation first
      in human (FIH) study in healthy adults and in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's
      disease. The study is designed to systematically assess the safety (including immunogenicity)
      and tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of AL002.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in 2 phases:

      In the single ascending dose (SAD) phase up to approximately 56 healthy adult participants
      will be sequentially enrolled into up to approximately 9 cohorts In the multiple-dose (MD)
      phase, approximately 32 patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease will be enrolled
      in three cohorts.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Total body weight between 50 and 120 kg, inclusive.

          2. Clinical laboratory evaluations (including chemistry panel fasted [fasted at least 8
             hours], complete blood count (CBC), and urine analysis) within the reference range for
             the test laboratory, unless deemed not clinically significant by the Investigator. A
             count of the segmented neutrophils and bands should be performed when results from the
             white blood cells (WBCs) are not within the reference range.

          3. Negative test for selected drugs of abuse at screening (does not include alcohol) and
             at admission (testing at admission does include alcohol breath test). A positive
             result may be verified by re-testing (up to one false positive result permitted) and
             may be followed up at the discretion of the Investigator.

          4. Females must be non-pregnant and non-lactating, and either surgically sterile

          5. In good health, determined by no clinically significant findings from medical history,
             physical examination, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), laboratory tests, and vital
             signs.

        For MD cohort

          1. Ages 50-85 years, inclusive.

          2. The participant should be capable of completing assessments alone, per local
             guidelines.

          3. Availability of a person (&quot;study partner&quot;) who, in the Investigator's judgment, has
             frequent and sufficient contact with the participant and is able to provide accurate
             information regarding the participant's cognitive and functional abilities, agrees to
             provide information at clinic visits, which require partner input for scale
             completion, and signs the necessary consent form, per local guidelines.

          4. Clinical diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's disease dementia based on National
             Institute on Aging Alzheimer's Association criteria.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnant or lactating, or intending to become pregnant within 16 weeks after last dose
             of study drug.

          2. Participation in a clinical trial within 30 days before randomization; use of any
             experimental oral therapy within 30 days or 5 half-lives prior to Day 1, whichever is
             greater; or use of any biologic therapy within 12 weeks or 5 half-lives prior to Day
             1, whichever is greater. Participants who have received an experimental therapy that
             has no half-life, like a vaccine, should have completed that therapy at least 12 weeks
             prior to Day 1. Participants who have received an experimental vaccine against a
             central nervous system (CNS) target, such as beta-amyloid or tau, are not eligible for
             this study.

          3. Any non-experimental vaccine within 2 weeks of randomization, until 2 weeks after the
             last dose. It is advised that prospective participants receive their annual influenza
             vaccine as early as possible in advance of the flu season, and then wait 2 weeks prior
             to randomization. It is permitted to receive the annual influenza vaccine during the
             screening period.

          4. Surgery or hospitalization during the 4 weeks prior to screening.

          5. Planned procedure or surgery during the study.

          6. Systemically, clinically significantly immunocompromised patients, owing to continuing
             effects of immune suppressing medication.

          7. Known history of severe allergic, anaphylactic, or other hypersensitivity reactions to
             chimeric, human, or humanized antibodies or fusion proteins.

          8. Past history of seizures, with the exception of childhood febrile seizures.
