  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a randomized controlled crossover study design, ultrasound guided infraclavicular brachial
      plexus blocks will be performed with and without the aid of a needle tip tracking (NTT)
      system. Specialists in anaesthesiology with average experience in ultrasound guided PNB
      techniques will perform the blocks. 26 volunteers will be included. The primary objective is
      to investigate the effect of the NTT system on performance time, as a measure for improved
      block performance. Secondary objectives are the effects of the NTT system on dexterity,
      peripheral nerve block characteristics, subjective experience, and peripheral block
      performance.
