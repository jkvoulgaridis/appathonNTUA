  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is for patients who have previously been treated for Waldenström's
      macroglobulinaemia (WM) and their disease has either not responded (known as refractory
      disease) or has returned (known as relapsed disease). Through this study, the researchers
      would like to find out whether treating these patients with drugs called rituximab and
      pembrolizumab is a safe and effective combination for this disease.

      In this study, pembrolizumab and rituximab will be given together. In other studies
      pembrolizumab has been shown to be effective at treating diseases similar to WM. The
      researchers want to test whether giving pembrolizumab and rituximab together is safe and
      effective.
