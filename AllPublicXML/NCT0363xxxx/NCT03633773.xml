  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is one of the most common liver malignancies. Surgical
      treatment is the first choice. However, for patients without surgical indications, the
      benefits of conventional chemoradiotherapy are limited. CART is one of the fastest developed
      treatments in recent years. MUC-1 CART can target abnormal glycosylation of MUC-1 and then
      killing tumor specifically. Here, investigators intend to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      MUC-1 CART in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators chose MUC-1 positive intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma patients with one
      measurable lesion at least. After general assessment, MUC-1 CART treatment was given to the
      participants. Objective remission rate, disease control rate, duration of overall response,
      progression-free survival, overall survival, drugs related side effects and other endpoints
      events were recorded and analyzed, to assess the MUC-1 CART could or couldn't effectively
      control the progress of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.
