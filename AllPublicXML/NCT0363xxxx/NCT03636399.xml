  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A large proportion of patients with acquired brain injuries (ABI) have cognitive deficits
      that affect the way they communicate. There is much international research done on how
      cognitive difficulties with attention, memory, executive functions and so on affect social
      communication. Without successful social skills, a person may engage in conflicts, become
      isolated and be denied access to social and vocational opportunities. There is more research
      on individual treatment for social communication disorder compared to group treatments.
      Internationally, several group interventions have been developed for treating social
      communication disorders during the last years. Group Interactive Structured Treatment (GIST)
      is a holistic multidisciplinary group treatment targeting social communication skills that
      has received empirical support. The main aim of the present study is to examine the efficacy
      of GIST for improving social communication in persons with acquired brain injury, and also
      compare the standard GIST protocol to an intensive GIST protocol. Efficacy will be assessed
      immediately after intervention, but also three and six months after the intervention. The
      project is in line with international research efforts aimed to establish more knowledge
      about group treatment for persons with social communication disorders after ABI.

    <measure>La Trobe Questionnaire.</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The LaTrobe Communication Questionnaire (LCQ) is a 30-item questionnaire that measures communication ability, a subjective outcome measure. Various communication behaviours are rated on a 4-point scale: 1¼never or rarely, 2¼sometimes, 3¼often and 4¼usually or always, but six items require a reverse in the scoring. Higher scores reflect reduced communications skills. The tool was developed to obtain information from various sources (e.g. self -rating by individual with TBI, rating by support person).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Social Communication Questionnaire with additional questions (SCQ-A)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>SCQ-A is a 37-item questionnaire that measures communication ability, a subjective outcome measure. Various communication behaviours are rated on a 5-point scale. Higher scores reflect reduced communications skills. Additional questions was added by Dahlberg et.al 2007 in their study, to capture all the topics presented in the GIST treatment program.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Profile of Pragmatic Impairment in Communication (PPIC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>PPIC is an objective measure of social communication skills designed specifically for use with people with TBI. It includes 10 feature summary scales that assess communication skills on a 6-point scale from normative (0) to very severely impaired (5), with lower scores indicating better performance. These summary scales—logical content; general participation; quantity; quality; internal relation; external relation; clarity of expression; social style; subject matter; and aesthetics.</description>

    <measure>Mind in the eyes test</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>This test consists of 36 black- and-white pictures of the eye region. The images are presented one by one, along with four adjectives (one target word and three foil words).</description>

    <measure>Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS) is a flexible system of measuring outcome goals, based on a 5-point scale.
Levels of goal attainment are expressed objectively in terms of concrete behaviors that can be observed and recorded.</description>

    <measure>Behavior Rating Inventory for Executive Functions (BRIEF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>BRIEF is a 75-item self and other questionnaire that measures executive functions (inhibition, shift, emotional control, self-monitoring, initiative, working memory, planning/organizing, task monitoring, organizing of materials)communication ability. Various executive behaviours are rated on a 3-point scale.</description>

    <measure>CIQ (Community Integration Questionnaire)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Community Integration Questionnaire (CIQ) is a community integration outcome measure developed for TBI subjects; its social integration and productivity subscales were used for this study. Frequency of such activities as shopping, leisure pursuits, visiting friends or relatives, travel, and one's work, school, or volunteer situation, are scored on a 15-item scale; a higher score indicates greater integration.</description>
