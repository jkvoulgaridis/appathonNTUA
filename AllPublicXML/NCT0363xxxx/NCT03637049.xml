  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety of multiple doses of
      PBI-4050 combined with midazolam in healthy adult subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, single-center, open-label, 2-period, fixed sequence study to investigate
      the effect of multiple doses of PBI-4050 on the PK of midazolam, a cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A
      substrate, in healthy adult men and healthy women of non-childbearing potential (WONCBP), and
      to determine the safety and tolerability of PBI-4050, when co-administered with midazolam.

      On Day 1 of Period 1, subjects will receive a single oral dose of midazolam followed by PK
      sampling of midazolam and its metabolite 1-hydroxymidazolam (1-OH-midazolam). In Period 2,
      subjects will receive multiple daily doses of PBI-4050 for 5 consecutive days (Day 1 to Day
      5) with a single oral dose of midazolam co-administered on Day 5. PK sampling for midazolam
      and 1-OH-midazolam will be collected for 24 hours following dosing on Day 5. PK sampling for
      PBI-4050 and its major metabolite will be collected at pre-dose on Days 3, 4, and 5.

      There will be a washout period of at least 2 days between midazolam dose in Period 1 and the
      first PBI-4050 dose in Period 2.
