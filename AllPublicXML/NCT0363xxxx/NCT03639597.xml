  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a single center, open-label, single arm, prospective pre-market study designed
      to assess the safety and efficacy of the VytronUS Ablation System (VAS) for the treatment of
      atrial fibrillation in patients with drug refractory, recurrent, symptomatic, paroxysmal
      atrial fibrillation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects with documented symptomatic, recurrent, PAF refractory to at least one beta blocker,
      calcium channel blocker or Class I or Class III anti-arrhythmic drug, who meet all
      inclusion/exclusion criteria and are deemed appropriate candidates for catheter ablation will
      undergo PV ablation with the VAS. Pre-procedural CT scan or MRI will be obtained to assess LA
      and PV anatomy and size. PV ablation will be performed utilizing the VAS (see procedure
      description below). Acute post-ablation confirmation of PV electrical isolation will be
      evaluated via standard mapping techniques.
