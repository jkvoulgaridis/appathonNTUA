  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, Phase 1 study of ABBV-011 given as a single agent and in
      combination with ABBV-181 in subjects with relapsed or refractory small cell lung cancer
      (SCLC). The study consists of 3 parts: Part A is a single-agent ABBV-011 dose-finding regimen
      cohort; followed by Part B, a single-agent ABBV-011 dose expansion cohort; and then Part C,
      an ABBV-011 and ABBV-181 combination escalation and expansion cohort.
