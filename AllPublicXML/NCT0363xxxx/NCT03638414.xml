  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a feasibility study of a web-based pain self-management system aimed at providing
      support for acute postoperative pain and enhancing patient care. The ePainQ symptom
      questionnaire provides patients with immediate graded advice dependent on severity of issues
      reported. Information about self-managing these issues are provided via instructions in
      ePainQ with hyperlinks to more detailed advice on the ePainQ website. Patients log on daily
      postoperatively to complete the symptom questionnaire.

      Women with invasive/non-invasive breast carcinoma due to be treated by surgery with curative
      intent will be approached to take part in this study. We will invite consecutive eligible
      patients, consenting as many willing patients as possible within a fixed 12 month recruitment
      period. There are 2 arms to the study: intervention -using ePainQ intervention &amp; standard
      care and a cohort (control) arm, which will be standard care only.

      Primary aim: To test the feasibility of a web-based pain self-management system for breast
      cancer patients undergoing surgery Secondary aims: 1. a) Examine preliminary effectiveness of
      the system (impact on outcome measures, pain etc.) b) Explore the potential associations
      between breast density, post-surgical scarring and pain and outcomes 2. To explore staff use
      and perceived usefulness of ePainQ in clinical consultations.

    <description>Feasibility of the ePainQ system is the primary outcome measure for the study. This will be examined in terms of:
Patient uptake rates
Patient engagement with/use of the system (e.g. log ins and completed questionnaires)
Patient retention rates
Representativeness of the participants (clinically and sociodemographic)
Patient feedback on perceived usability via qualitative interviews
