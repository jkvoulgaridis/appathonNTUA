  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cleft palate repair requires high doses of opioids for pain control postop. An alternative
      approach is placement of nerve blocks in the pterygopalatine fossa bilaterally, blocking the
      maxillary nerve &amp; covering the entire midface. Application of bilateral suprazygomatic
      maxillary nerve blockade of the infraorbital nerve may provide effective analgesia for cleft
      lip repair, improving time to oral intake, pain control and time to hospital discharge.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cleft palate is a common congenital anomaly for which surgical repair is indicated during
      early childhood. The surgical repair of cleft palate is very painful, and generally requires
      high doses of opioids for adequate pain control, placing children at risk for post-operative
      respiratory depression and airway obstruction. An alternative approach to post-operative
      analgesia for cleft palate repair is the placement of nerve blocks in the pterygopalatine
      fossa bilaterally, blocking the maxillary nerve and covering the entire mid-face. This
      randomized, double-blinded study will investigate the utility of maxillary nerve blockade in
      controlling post-operative pain, decreasing opioid requirements, improving post-operative
      oral food and drink intake, and decreasing hospital length-of-stay after cleft palate repair.

    <intervention_model_description>This randomized, double-blinded study. Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of two different protocols by a designated study team member based on a computer generated randomization table. Randomization will occur following consent. Randomization will be 1:1.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>During the block placement the surgical team will be asked to leave the operating room briefly to remain blinded to the group assignment of all patients as the surgical team will manage the subjects post-operative care and determine discharge readiness.
ICU nursing staff and parents will be informed of participation in the study but will not be informed as to group assignment to remain blinded.</masking_description>
