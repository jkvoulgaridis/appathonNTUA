  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 4-year randomized, controlled study to test the efficacy of the CHOICES4Health-T
      (C4H-T) delivered by a computerized tablet, CHOICES4Health-C (C4H-C), delivered by a
      counselor, and brief advice (BA), on reducing preconception substance-exposed pregnancy risk
      (i.e. drinking below risk levels; tobacco and marijuana cessation; effective contraception
      use) among women (aged 18-44) presenting to the 13 primary care clinics that serve adults
      within the Harris Health System. Given the natural fit between contraceptive and HIV
      prevention counseling the CHOICES4Health interventions will also target HIV sexual risk
      behaviors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomized group design (N = 240) will be used to test the efficacy of the C4H-C and C4H-T
      interventions relative to Brief Advice (BA) to reduce the risk of substance-exposed
      pregnancy) SEP in preconception women of childbearing age. Follow-up assessments will be
      conducted at 3, 6, and 9 months.

      Each of the substances targeted in this study (risk drinking, cigarette smoking, and
      marijuana use) is commonly used relative to other substances and is singly or jointly
      associated with risk for poor fetal outcomes. Thus, women who are not using effective
      contraception (i.e., use of effective birth-control methods during all vaginal intercourse)
      and have any one or more substance-risk behaviors in the 30 days before intake will be
      eligible for the study.

      Urn randomization will be used to stratify women on all three substance-risk behaviors to
      ensure a balanced number of women presenting with alcohol-exposed pregnancy (AEP),
      tobacco-exposed pregnancy (TEP), and marijuana-exposed pregnancy (MEP) risks across the three
      study conditions. To address risk distribution for women who present with more than one risk
      behavior the urn randomization will also be programmed to balance single risk and multiple
      risk women across the study conditions. In sum, the urn randomization will include four
      assignment criteria: AEP, TEP, MEP, and multiple risks. Finally, different numbers of women
      will be needed for each type of substance-exposed pregnancy risk in order to provide
      sufficient power for the investigator's analytic tests. For example, approximately 25% more
      women at risk of AEP are required than for TEP to attain the same power. The investigators
      will include oversampling rules and stopping rules to ensure adequate recruitment for AEP,
      TEP, and MEP.

    <measure>Change in risk of alcohol-exposed pregnancy (AEP) as measured by self-reported daily standard drinks, vaginal sex, and use of contraception on the Timeline Followback calendar.</measure>
    <time_frame>3, 6, and 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Risk of AEP is defined as any risk drinking (&gt;3 drinks/day or &gt;7 drinks/week on average) and any occurrence of vaginal sex with no use or ineffective use of contraception in the assessment period. Self-reported daily alcohol use (in standard drinks), vaginal intercourse, and contraception (effective use) data from the Timeline Followback will be used to calculate risk of AEP for the previous 90 days. Change in Risk of AEP will be examined at 3-, 6-, and 9-months post-intake. A participant will be considered at risk of AEP at each of the 3-, 6-, and 9 month timepoints if the participant had any occurrence of vaginal sex without the use of effective contraception and had more than 3 standard drinks on any day or more than 7 standard drinks per week on average in any 30 day period in the previous 90 days. Risk of AEP will be a dichotomous outcome (at risk of AEP or at reduced risk of AEP).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in risk of tobacco-exposed pregnancy (TEP) as measured by self-reported daily number of cigarettes, vaginal sex, and use of contraception on the Timeline Followback calendar.</measure>
    <time_frame>3, 6, and 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Risk of TEP is defined as currently smoking cigarettes (at least weekly use) and any occurrence of vaginal sex with no use or ineffective use of contraception in the assessment period. Self-reported data from the Timeline Followback will be used to calculate risk of TEP for the previous 90 days at 3-, 6 , and 9 months post-intake. A participant will be considered at risk of TEP at each of the 3-, 6-, and 9 month timepoints if the participant had any occurrence of vaginal sex without the use of effective contraception and she had at least weekly smoking in any 30 day period in the previous 90 days. Risk of TEP will be a dichotomous outcome (at risk of TEP or at reduced risk of TEP).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in risk of marijuana-exposed pregnancy (MEP) as measured by self-reported marijuana use, vaginal sex, and use of contraception on the Timeline Followback calendar.</measure>
    <time_frame>3, 6, and 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Risk of MEP is defined as any day with marijuana use and any occurrence of vaginal sex with no use or ineffective use of contraception in the assessment period. Self-reported data from the Timeline Followback will be used to calculate risk of MEP for the previous 90 days at 3-, 6- , and 9 months post-intake. A participant will be considered at risk of MEP at each of the 3-, 6-, and 9 month timepoints if the participant had any occurrence of vaginal sex without the use of effective contraception and had any day with marijuana use in any 30 day period in the previous 90 days. Risk of MEP will be a dichotomous outcome (at risk of MEP or at reduced risk of MEP).</description>

    <description>Cigarette smoking is defined as at least weekly cigarette smoking in the previous 90 days on the Timeline Followback calendar at 3-, 6-, and 9-months post-intake. Cigarette smoking will be a dichotomous outcome (yes or no). In addition, smoking will be validated using biological test to assess cotinine levels.</description>
