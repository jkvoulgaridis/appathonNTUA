  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Liver MSCs or Adult Derived Human Liver Stem/progenitor Cells (ADHLSCs) infusions are
      currently being developed as a therapeutic medicinal product for the treatment of different
      liver defects. Nevertheless, a main concern for clinicians and health authorities is the risk
      of therapy-induced thrombosis, which has been reported in several patients after intravenous
      infusion. Previous studies showed in fact that most MSCs express a procoagulant activity.
      ADHLSCs could be used to treat acute de-compensated cirrhotic patients due to their
      immunomodulatory and anti-fibrotic effects. However in these patients, disturbances of
      coagulation and haemostasis are common and result in profound haemostatic alterations that
      can lead to thrombosis as well as to bleeding complications. The aim of this study is to
      evaluate the effect of ADHLSCs in cirrhotic blood compared to control blood.

    <description>We plan to use the tubing loop model to study the interaction between acute-on-chronic liver failure patient's blood and ADHLSCss. The tubing loop model is a whole blood coagulation in vitro model that mimics the blood flow circulation. It consists of loops made of polyvinyl chloride tubing coated with heparin without any release of heparin in blood. This technique can be used to mimic cell infusion in an in vitro model as close as possible to a patient infusion. Blood parameters are studied after 5 and 60min incubation.</description>

    <description>The thrombodynamics analyser system records and analyses spatiotemporal dynamics of formation of a fibrin clot in a platelet poor plasma (PPP) sample. We plan to use this model to study the interaction between acute-on-chronic liver failure patient's plasma and ADHLSCss.</description>
