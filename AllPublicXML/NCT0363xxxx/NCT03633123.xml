  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects who are planned to undergo an abdominal (colon) surgery and who will meet the study
      entry criteria will be randomly divided into 2 groups: for half D-PLEX will be administered
      concomitantly with the standard of care (SOC). The other half will receive the Standard of
      Care treatment.

      Following the surgery subjects will be followed up for additional 5 visits, at least half are
      in line with the routine practice of surgery Follow-Ups.

      Visits will include patient safety and wound assessments.

    <textblock>
      D-PLEX is a new formulation of extended controlled release of Doxycycline in the applied area
      for about 30 days. This study is aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of D-PLEX in
      prevention of post abdominal surgery incisional infection.

      Eligible and willing subjects will be randomly divided, in a single-blinded manor into 2
      study arms D-PLEX with SOC or SOC alone. D-PLEX will be applied during the surgery at the
      final stage of incision closure. All patients will be followed up for additional 5 visits
      over 2 months, for safety and incisional wound assessment. This will include blood tests for
      hematology, chemistry and PK (for some only) as well as physicians assessment of the
      incisional wound.

    <intervention_model_description>Males and females, &gt;18 years old, undergoing scheduled abdominal colon surgery involving resection and anastomosis or a stoma, who meet the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria and provide signed informed consent will be enrolled in the study.
Subjects will be randomized to either the investigational arm (SOC + D-PLEX) or to the control arm (SOC only) in a 1:1 ratio.
Subjects will be blinded to the study arm.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Subject will be blinded to the treatment arm assignment. Physicians which were not part of the team in the surgery room, or from the hospital's infectious diseases dept. will remain blinded to the study arm, and will be those assessing the incisional wound for the study primary endpoint at each follow-up visit post the index surgery.
On top, for each suspicion of infection, an external, independent and blinded adjudication committee will be the one making the final decision whether an infection occured or not.</masking_description>

    <description>ASEPSIS is acronym of wound assessment and treatment parameters (described in the title), which provides numerically score during an inspection of the surgical site. The final score is being interpreted to severity of wound appearance and the clinical consequences of the infection.
Each parameter will be evaluated and numerically scored. Some (Serous discharge &amp; Erythema) will be marked between 0 - 5 and others (Purulent exudate &amp; Separation of deep tissue) are marked between 0 - 10 - based on the proportion of the wound they affect when 0 is none and either 5 or 10 are for over 80% of the wound.
Other parameters (Additional antibiotic treatment, a requirement for pus drainage, solation of bacteria &amp; Stay duration as an inpatient) are scored Yes or No. No equals 0. Yes is calculated as either 5 points (for some parameters) or 10 for others.
The final score can in the range of 0 - 70. 0 - 10 for wound which heals satisfactorily and over 40 for a severe wound infection.</description>
