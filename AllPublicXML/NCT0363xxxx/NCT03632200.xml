      Whatever are the strategies of coverage, the consideration of the state of bad nutrition is
      not often the priority. According to the last recommendations (2012) of the French Society
      Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (SFNEP), the surgeries of the cancers of the VADS are not
      listed among surgeries with high morbidity. So the specific recommendations for the patients
      undernourished with surgery with low morbidity, only a personalized dietary advice and oral
      nutritional supplements are recommended in preoperative. There is no specific recommendation
      in post-operative.

      Two groups of cancer patients of the VADS will be compared: a control group benefiting from a
      nutritional coverage based on the current recommendations of the SFNEP, an experimental group
      benefiting from an improved nutritional coverage.

      In preoperative, all the patients of experimental group will benefit from dietary advice
      during a multidisciplinary specific consultation. In post-operative, a dietetic consultation
      will be set up in 7 days at the exit of hospitalization and call phone at M1, M2, M4 and M5.
      And for the undernourished patient will benefit a multidisciplinary consultation at the rate
      of a consultation a month during 6 months.

      In the Group control, the patients will be followed according to the current recommendations
      of the SFNEP.
