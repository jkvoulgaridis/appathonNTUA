    <textblock>
      Biceps tendinopathy is a common cause in shoulder-pain symptoms. The major mechanism is
      overuse of the biceps muscles. The long-term accumulated and poor repaired trauma causes
      myofascial trigger points in the related muscles.

      We will conduct the randomized, single blind experiment to evaluate the immediate,
      short-term, and long-term effect of DN.

      Biceps tendinopathy is a common cause in shoulder-pain symptoms. The major mechanism is
      overuse of the biceps muscles. The long-term accumulated and poor repaired trauma causes
      myofascial trigger points in the related muscles. Common symptoms are pain in the anterior
      shoulders and radiating pain in the biceps. Pain can be further elicited with lifting,
      pulling and repetitive overhead activity. Therefore, it can have a major impact on the
      patient's activity of daily life.

      The investigator performed dry needle (DN) treatments with acupuncture needles. Stimulating
      the effected muscle , the investigator move the needle forward and backward several times.
      Muscle twitch may occur by our procedure. The pain caused by myofascial trigger points can be
      decreased effective simultaneously. So far, there is no solid research or clinical trial to
      evaluate the efficacy of the treatment yet.

      The investigator will conduct the randomized, single blind experiment to evaluate the
      immediate, short-term, and long-term effect of DN. Outcome measures include visual analog
      scale, shoulder pain and disability index, pressure pain threshold, pain-free grip test,
      muscle tone changes and ultrasonographic evaluation of biceps peritendinous effusion.

    <description>The visual analogue scale or visual analog scale is a psychometric response scale which can be used in questionnaires. This tool used to help a person rate the intensity of certain sensations and feelings, such as pain. A straight line of 100mm is actually marked with 0 mm on the far left and 100mm on the far right. Two faces are drawn on both ends. Explain to the patient that 0 mm means no pain and 100 mm means very painful. From the left end The right shift indicates more and more pain. Take a pen and let the patient draw a short line vertically on the line, representing his painful position, and record the measured cm value. In this test, if the score of the subject decreases, it can represent the treatment is helpful for the improvement of the patient's pain.</description>

    <measure>Pressure Pain Threshold</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Pressure pain threshold (PPT) is defined as the minimum force applied which induces pain. This measure has proven to be commonly useful in evaluating tenderness symptom.</description>

    <measure>Muscle tension</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Muscle tension is the muscle's resistance to passive stretch during resting state. The measuring tool called Myotone will calculate three parameters such as tone, elasticity and stiffness and get a value to represent the muscle tension. If the value decrease, it can represent the treatment is helpful for the subjective muscle relax.</description>

    <intervention_name>dry needling</intervention_name>
    <description>Dry needling, also known as myofascial trigger point dry needling, is an well-proved technique in alternative medicine similar to acupuncture. It involves the use of either solid filiform needles or hollow-core hypodermic needles for therapy of muscle pain, including pain related to myofascial pain syndrome. Dry needling is sometimes also known as intramuscular stimulation (IMS).</description>

    <intervention_name>Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation</intervention_name>
    <description>Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS or TNS) is the use of electric current produced by a device to stimulate the nerves for therapeutic purposes.
TENS, by definition, covers the complete range of transcutaneously applied currents used for nerve excitation although the term is often used with a more restrictive intent, namely to describe the kind of pulses produced by portable stimulators used to treat pain. The unit is usually connected to the skin using two or more electrodes. A typical battery operated TENS unit is able to modulate pulse width, frequency and intensity. Generally TENS is applied at high frequency (&gt;50 Hz) with an intensity below motor contraction (sensory intensity) or low frequency (&lt;10 Hz) with an intensity that produces motor contraction.</description>
