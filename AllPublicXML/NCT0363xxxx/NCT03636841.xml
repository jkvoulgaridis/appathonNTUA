  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The smoke produced by the electric section of the tissues during laparoscopy alters the
      vision of the operative field and presents potential risks. A new medical device with CE
      marking (Ultravision ©) has been developed to limit electroprecipitation on the wall and
      tissues of the abdomen.

      The aim of the work is to evaluate the effectiveness of this medical device in laparoscopic
      cholecystectomy for cholecystitis. It is an intervention for a common pathology where smoke
      is particularly important due to the tissue inflammation and due to the extensive dissection
      necessary to perform the surgical procedure.

      A randomized double-blinded study will be conducted in two academic hospitals (Marseille
      North Hospital and Timone, APHM) evaluating the use of a smoke electroprecipitation device
      (Ultravision ©) during laparoscopic cholecystectomy for cholecystitis operated at the acute
      phase. A group of 30 patients using the device will be compared to a control group of 30
      patients. The evaluation will last thirty days per patient and the duration of inclusion is 2
      years.

      The main objective is to demonstrate a significant reduction in operating duration by using
      the device. The secondary objectives are to reduce the CO2 consumption, the surgical
      incidents and the discomfort of the surgeon related to the smoke.

    <description>Ultravision © is a medical device that is used during laparoscopy to reduce the discomfort caused by surgical smoke produced by the electrical section of tissue. It works by using the principle of electrostatic precipitation, that is to say it causes the precipitation of suspended smoke droplets on the organs and walls of the abdomen.</description>
