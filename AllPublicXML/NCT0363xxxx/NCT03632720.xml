    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate the non-inferiority of the antibody
      responses to meningococcal serogroups A, C, W, and Y when MenACYW conjugate vaccine is
      administered concomitantly with a licensed meningococcal group B vaccine in the second year
      of life compared to when MenACYW conjugate vaccine is given alone The secondary objective is
      to describe the antibody geometric mean titers (GMTs) of meningococcal serogroups A, C, W,
      and Y when MenACYW conjugate vaccine is administered concomitantly with a licensed
      meningococcal group B vaccine in the second year of life and when MenACYW conjugate vaccine
      is given alone

          -  Moderate or severe acute illness/infection (according to investigator judgment), or
             febrile illness (temperature ≥ 38.0 C), or diarrhea or vomiting on the day of
             vaccination. A prospective subject should not be included in the study until the
             condition has resolved or the febrile event has subsided.
