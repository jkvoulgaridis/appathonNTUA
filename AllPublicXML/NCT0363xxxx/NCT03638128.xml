        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has provided informed consent/assent prior to initiation of any Study 20170534
             specific activities/procedures. Subject's legally acceptable representative has
             provided informed consent when the subject is legally too young to provide informed
             consent and the subject has provided written assent based on local regulations and/or
             guidelines prior to any study-specific activities/procedures being initiated.

          -  Subject is currently/was enrolled in Study 20130173 and completed the 20130173 End of
             Study (EOS) visit (regardless of completing or ending investigational product early)
             OR subjects who do not reconsent to transition to 3-Month Dosing Regimen on Study
             20130173 are also eligible for enrollment OR early terminated from Study 20130173 as a
             result of meeting BMD Z-score IP stopping criteria and was required to early terminate
             from the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Treatment with any prohibited proscribed medications while receiving denosumab.
             Eligibility into study treatment with alternative osteoporosis medication/s of
             investigator's choice, follow guidelines per the specific alternative osteoporosis
             medication/s selected. For subjects off-treatment (observation only), no prohibited
             medications apply.- Subjects currently receiving treatment in another investigational
             device or drug study other than Study 20130173. Other investigational procedures while
             participating in this study are excluded.

          -  For subjects expected to receive investigational product (denosumab) at study day 1:
             Female subject is pregnant or breastfeeding or planning to become pregnant or
             breastfeed during treatment and for an additional 5 months after the last dose of
             denosumab. Females of childbearing potential (Tanner Stage greater than or equal to 2)
             should only be included in the study after a negative highly sensitive urine or serum
             pregnancy test.

          -  For subjects expected to receive investigational product (denosumab) at study day 1:
             Female subjects of childbearing potential unwilling to practice true sexual abstinence
             (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use 1 highly effective method of
             contraception during treatment and for an additional 5 months after the last dose of
             investigational product (denosumab). For study treatment with alternative osteoporosis
             medication/s of investigator's choice, follow contraception guidelines per the
             specific alternative osteoporosis medication/s selected. For subjects not receiving
             any investigational product (observation only), no contraception required.

          -  History or evidence of any other clinically significant disorder, condition or disease
             (with the exception of those outlined above) that, in the opinion of the investigator
             or Amgen physician, if consulted, would pose a risk to subject safety or interfere
             with the study evaluation, procedures or completion.

In general, Amgen does not grant external requests for individual patient data for the purpose of re-evaluating safety and efficacy issues already addressed in the product labelling. Requests are reviewed by a committee of internal advisors. If not approved, a Data Sharing Independent Review Panel will arbitrate and make the final decision. Upon approval, information necessary to address the research question will be provided under the terms of a data sharing agreement. This may include anonymized individual patient data and/or available supporting documents, containing fragments of analysis code where provided in analysis specifications.
