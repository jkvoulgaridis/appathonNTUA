  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective trial comparing improvements in pain, function, and quality of life in
      patients with early-stage knee osteoarthritis conservatively managed with the TriFit™ Web
      Knee Brace. The study design will represent a consecutive series of conservatively managed
      patients with knee-pain not yet candidates for surgical intervention and is non-comparative
      in nature.

      This clinical study will be conducted at the Florida Orthopaedic Institute (FOI) beginning in
      2017. The trial will be a prospective trial of a convenience sample of skeletally mature
      patients with knee pain treated by the Principal Investigator (Jeff Sellman, MD) at Florida
      Orthopaedic Institute with clinically and radiographically confirmed early stage knee
      Osteoarthritis that can be managed without surgical intervention. The study population will
      be defined as all adult patients (&gt;21 years) seen by the Principal Investigator and diagnosed
      with knee osteoarthritis. All patients will be independent in activities of daily living. All
      patients will be seen in the Prinicpal Investigator outpatient clinic at Florida Orthopaedic
      Institute. Patients will be screened as candidates for enrollment into the study and if the
      patient satisfies the inclusion/exclusion criteria, a clinical research coordinator or the
      study Principal Investigator will explain all essential elements of the clinical trial. If
      the patient agrees to participate, the study coordinator or Principal Investigator will
      obtain informed consent. The patient will still be followed clinically for 12 months after
      initial brace application.
