  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in Switzerland. Cigarette smoking
      eventually kills one in two smokers, mostly through cancer, heart disease and respiratory
      failure. Recently, electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS; also called vaporizer or
      electronic cigarette) have become popular with smokers who want to stop smoking or reduce
      their exposure to inhaled chemicals since ENDS use appears to be safer than tobacco smoking.

      Studies suggest that ENDS use improves health outcomes, such as reducing respiratory
      symptoms, and presents only minimal respiratory risks, such as mild throat irritation and dry
      cough.

      In a prospective 6-month randomized, controlled trial evaluating smoking reduction/abstinence
      in 300 smokers not intending to quit experimenting two different nicotine strengths of a
      e-cigarette model compared to its non-nicotine choice, respiratory symptoms similarly
      improved in all three study groups. One study compared the short-term effects of cigarette
      smoking to ENDS use and found that cigarette smoking led to an acute reduction in lung
      function, which was not observed with ENDS. Findings on short-term airway resistance is
      conflicting. Short term increase in resistance in ENDS users might be caused by aerosolizing
      the liquid, and not by the same substances that harm lung function in cigarette smokers.
      Smokers who shifted from tobacco cigarettes to ENDS have offered anecdotes of dramatically
      improved lung function, but animal models suggest that ENDS liquids can increase markers of
      asthma. No large randomized trials have tested the effect of ENDS on respiratory symptoms.

      For this trial, cigarette smokers motivated to quit smoking cigarettes will be included.
      Participants in the intervention group will receive an ENDS and nicotine-containing
      e-liquids, which they will be allowed to use ad libitum. Additionally, they will receive
      smoking cessation counseling. Participants in the control group will receive smoking
      cessation counseling only. All participants will be followed over a 24-months period.
      Respiratory symptoms such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma and dyspnea
      will be assessed by means of questionnaires at baseline and at 6-, 12- and 24-months follow
      up. This trial will provide useful data on changes in respiratory symptoms in a large sample
      of participants.
