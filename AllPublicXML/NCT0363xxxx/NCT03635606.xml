  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac surgery associated acute kidney injury (CSA-AKI) has been recognized as the second
      most common cause of hospital acquired AKI. The development of CSA-AKI is independently
      associated with an increased risk of in-hospital death. There are currently no biomarkers
      that could identify patients at higher risk for AKI and current risk predictor scores that
      are based on clinical and demographic information are inadequate. Therefore, a diagnostic
      test for predicting AKI risk in this clinical context would assist clinicians to optimize
      surgical strategy and postoperative care to prevent CSA-AKI occurrence and improve patient
      outcomes.

      The primary purpose of this study is to validate a cut-off point for AKI-Sapere prognostic to
      identify patients at risk for all stages of CSA-AKI.
