      Plasma concentration data were collected from 37 paedriatic patients and 12 healthy adults
      recruited in a single dose, open-label phase II pharmacokinetic study and in a single dose,
      randomised, open-label two-peiod crossover bioavailability study, respectively. Data were
      analysed using non-linear mixed effect modeling.

      In the absence of a licensed formulation in many countries worldwide, ADV6209, an innovative
      2mg/ml oral solution of midazolam containing cyclodextrin, has been developed for moderate
      sedation in paediatric patients. Population pharmacokinetics for ADV6209 is reported.

      Plasma concentration data were collected from 37 paedriatic patients and 12 healthy adults
      recruited in a single dose, open-label phase II pharmacokinetic study and in a single dose,
      randomised, open-label two-peiod crossover bioavailability study, respectively. Data were
      analysed using non-linear mixed effect modeling. Plasma concentrations of midazolam were
      discribed by a two-compartement model. An additional one-compartement model was added for a
      α-hydroxymidazolam.

    <description>The Aim of the study was to assess the pharmacokinetic analysis of an oral solution of midazolam (ADV6209) oral formulation in paedriatic patients from 6 months to 18 years ols in order to support dosing recommendations. All subjects received a single 0.3mg/kg midazolam dose of ADV6209, without exceeding a total dose of 10 mg.Population pharmacokinetic modelling was performed to characterise the concentration-time course of midazolam and its main active metabolite, and to evaluate the changes in clearance and volume of distibution in the different age groups.</description>

        The planned enrollment is 36 children, stratified in two groups: 24 children between 6
        months and 11 years, and 12 children between 12 and 17 years. Age is considered in years
        past by the date of inclusion. Children aged between 6 months and 11 years old should be
        homogenous in both age groups 6-23 months and 2-11 years. For example, at least 4 children
        in the 6-23 month age group will be recruited.

        Children likely to be included will be hospitalized in the pediatric surgery department at
        Amiens University Hospital.

        Children who will be included in this study will not be able to participate in another
        study within 3 months of their inclusion in this study.
