    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study protocol is to assess whether contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM)
      will increase the accuracy of characterization of microcalcifications detected on screening
      mammography prior to biopsy as either benign, high risk, or malignant.

    <measure>Evaluate risk characterization of screen-detected calcifications by CEM</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 30 days after the CEM</time_frame>
    <description>-The proportion of women with abnormal enhancement (yes/no) will be compared to the pathology results from the core needle biopsy (benign versus high risk/malignant)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of detection of additional sites of disease in the same or contralateral breast on CEM</measure>
    <time_frame>At the time of the CEM (day 1)</time_frame>
    <description>This will be defined as presence of abnormal enhancement in the same breast at least 2 cm away from the margin of the calcifications of interest or any presence of abnormal enhancement in the contralateral breast at the time of CEM
-The reference standard in this case will also be based on pathology results from core needle biopsy (if additional biopsies are performed) or findings on surgical pathology if the patient elects for mastectomy, with the decision for core needle biopsy and lumpectomy vs mastectomy according to surgeon preference and standard of care.</description>

    <measure>Ability of CEM to determine whether accuracy for cancer detection varies as a function of breast density</measure>
    <time_frame>At the time of the CEM (day 1)</time_frame>
    <description>-Breast density category is routinely reported in the screening mammography report and accepted categories include predominantly fatty, scattered fibroglandular densities, heterogeneously dense, and extremely dense.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Ability of whether CEM accuracy for cancer detection varies as a function of the morphology of calcifications as depicted on screening and diagnostic mammography</measure>
    <time_frame>At the time of the CEM (day 1)</time_frame>
    <description>-Morphology of calcifications include amorphous, coarse heterogeneous, fine pleomorphic, or fine linear branching and/or based on distribution of the calcifications as either diffuse, regional, grouped, linear, or segmental, according to the descriptors in the imaging reports</description>

    <description>-Patients who meet eligibility criteria and consent to participate in this study will complete a CEM examination prior to or on the day that biopsy is scheduled. CEM must occur no later than 60 days after the diagnostic mammogram. The standard of care biopsy must occur no later than 30 days after CEM.</description>
