    <textblock>
      Subcutaneous perfusion is an underused technique, the effectiveness of which has been
      demonstrated.

      A number of drugs of different therapeutic classes, including morphine, have a good level of
      scientific evidence for use by this route.

      Subcutaneous Acetaminophen injection is being used in some medical centers, mainly in Europe,
      despite the lack of definite evidence on its efficacy.

      This study aims to quantify the degree of effectiveness of subcutaneous Acetaminophen
      infusions for pain or fever in Geriatrics and Palliative Care, as well as determining its
      safety.

    <textblock>
      Subcutaneous perfusion is an underused technique, the effectiveness of which has been
      demonstrated. It is mainly used in Palliative Care and Geriatrics when a venous line is not
      available. It is a simple and comfortable technique that allows to administer solutes and /
      or medications continuously or discontinuously in the subcutaneous tissue.

      A number of drugs of different therapeutic classes, including morphine, have a good level of
      scientific evidence for use by this route.

      Subcutaneous Acetaminophen injection is being used in some medical centers, mainly in Europe,
      despite the lack of definite evidence on its efficacy. It is sometimes accused of causing
      pain at the injection site; it seems that this is not the case if it is infused slowly, over
      20 minutes to 30 minutes. There is no report of serious local effects.

      The consultation palliative care team at HÃ´tel-Dieu de France (HDF) has used subcutaneous
      Acetaminophen infusions repeatedly without adverse effects since January 2014.

      This study aims to quantify the degree of effectiveness of subcutaneous Acetaminophen
      infusions for pain or fever in Geriatrics and Palliative Care, as well as determining its
      safety.

    <measure>Change in Numerical Rating Scale pain scores for conscious and cooperative patients</measure>
    <time_frame>60 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome measures the decrease in pain scores between t0 (right before acetaminophen administration) and t60 minutes using the Numerical Rating Scale in conscious and cooperative patients, where 10/10 is the worst imaginable pain and 0/10 is no pain at all.
A Minimal Clinically Important Difference (MCID) of 2/10 is set to define efficacy.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change on Algoplus Pain Scale for patients with verbal communication difficulties</measure>
    <time_frame>60 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome measures the decrease in pain scores between t0 (right before acetaminophen administration) and t60 minutes using Algoplus Scale, a behavioural rating scale for acute pain for patients with verbal communication difficulties. A score of 2 or above diagnoses pain with 87% sensitivity and 80% specificity.
The scale evaluates facial expressions, look, complaints, body position and atypical behaviours of patients with verbal communication difficulties.
Each item marked &quot;yes&quot; is awarded one point and the total across all the items gives a total score out of 5.
Efficacy is defined as a decrease of the score to less than 2/5.</description>
