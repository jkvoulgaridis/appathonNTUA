  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of this study is to find a reasonably safe and tolerable treatment for adult
      patients with type 1-diabetes and that regain some of the endogenous insulin secretion,
      improve the patients' quality of life (QoL) and reduce the risk of both short- and long-term
      complications. The hypothesis tested is that oral GABA treatment with the newly developed
      compound Remygen will be safe and induce regain of some endogenous insulin secretion in adult
      patients with type 1-diabetes diagnosis for more than five years. The first part of the study
      will include 6 patients and be performed as a Safety and Dose Escalation study in three
      steps. The main study is a three-arm, open label, single center, clinical trial. Eligible
      patients will be randomized into one of three active treatment arms to receive oral GABA
      treatment for 6 months.
