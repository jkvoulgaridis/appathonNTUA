  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Objective of study is to evaluate the procedural success rate, clinical effectiveness, and
      heath-economic profile using the Intercept Intraosseous Nerve Ablation System in adult
      subjects with chronic low back pain in the post-market setting
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open-label, single-arm, single-center study. There is no randomization
      or blinding. Subjects will receive the Intercept System procedure to treat one or two motion
      segments at L3/L4, L4/L5, or L5/S1 as identified by Modic Type 1 or 2 changes.
