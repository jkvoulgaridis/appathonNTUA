  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      IB-RU-SCOPE is a &quot;routine-clinical practice&quot; oriented cohort observational study of ibrutinib
      efficacy and safety in approx. 70 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia in the Russian
      Federation
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ibrutinib is approved in Russia for treatment of CLL patients both in first line and in
      relapsed/refractory setting. There is a discrepancy in reported ibrutinib toxicity profile,
      efficacy and tolerability between registrational clinical trials and observational studies,
      which to some extent may be explained by patient selection in the former. IB-RU-SCOPE is a
      first &quot;routine-clinical practice&quot; oriented cohort observational study of ibrutinib in CLL in
      Russia. The study is designed to include all previously untreated and relapsed/refractory CLL
      patients older than 18 years with active disease, who have recently started or are about to
      start ibrutinib (both as monotherapy and in combination), and to follow them to a minimum of
      18 and a maximum of 36 months. The study is being conducted in approx. 10 Russian
      hematological centers and aims to include approx. 70 CLL patients.

    <description>In order to evaluate ibrutinib toxicity, all adverse events (AEs), which will occur in study patients, will be collected and analyzed. CTCAE v4.03 criteria and iwCLL criteria will be used for grading of non-hematologic and hematologic AEs, respectively. Frequencies of AEs of all grades will be calculated and reported.</description>

    <description>Time from the first dose of ibrutinib to treatment discontinuation (e.g. due to AEs or CLL progression) will be measured in all study patients.

    <description>In order to evaluate tolerability of ibrutinib in CLL patients in routine clinical practice, all cases of ibrutinib dose reduction and/or drug discontinuation due to causes not related to CLL progression will be collected and analyzed.
