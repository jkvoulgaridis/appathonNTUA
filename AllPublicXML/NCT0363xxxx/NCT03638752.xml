  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is being conducted to assess whether the comprehensive education before
      gastroscopy could reduce the adverse reactions, such as nausea, vomiting and improve patient
      satisfaction.

    <masking_description>The endoscopist and endoscopy nurse will not know to which treatment arm the patient belongs as only the research assistant will has taken down this information. This information does not travel with the patient to the endoscopy room. The patient is also instructed to not reveal to the endoscopist or endoscopy nurse if he or she has taken or not taken the comprehensive education.</masking_description>

  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patients' tolerance scores</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>At the end of the procedure, the patients were asked about the tolerance in the process of gastroscopy by using a 100-mm visual analogue scale. Tolerance includes the extent of pain and nausea. The endpoints were assigned &quot;no nausea or no pain &quot; to the left and &quot;worst possible nausea or worst pain imaginable &quot; to the right.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Endoscopists' assessment scores</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>At the end of the procedure, Endoscopists scored the level of difficulty in introduction of the gastroscope on a 100-mm visual analogue scale. The endpoints were assigned &quot; easiest&quot; to the left and &quot; worst difficult &quot; to the right.
Endoscopists' satisfaction was assessed with 100-mm VAS for the performances of the endoscopes. The endpoints were assigned &quot; worst dissatisfied&quot; to the left and &quot; Most satisfied &quot; to the right.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Systolic/diastolic blood pressure (SBP/DBP)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Patients were monitored the Systolic/diastolic blood pressure (SBP/DBP) throughout using an electronic multifunctional patient monitor unit. The research assistant records Systolic/diastolic blood pressure (SBP/DBP) on 5 min prior to endoscopic intubation, during endoscopy and at time of entry into the stomach body</description>

    <measure>Pulse rate (PR)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Patients were monitored the pulse rate (PR) throughout using an electronic multifunctional patient monitor unit. The research assistant records pulse rate (PR) on 5 min prior to endoscopic intubation, during endoscopy and at time of entry into the stomach body.</description>

    <description>The details of Comprehensive education are as follows:
introduce the purpose, method and function of breathing training and the whole process of gastroscopy;
instruct patients to take deep breath training, inhaling with his/her nose and exhaling with his/her mouth,
provide patients with a disposable dental biting device and repeat exercising deep breathing again until he/she is fully mastered,
inform patients to cooperate with the instructions issued by endoscopist and endoscopy nurse during the whole process of gastroscopy,
inform patients to inhale with nose and exhale with mouth when the gastroscope passes through the throat, then he/she should perform inhaling and exhaling with his/her nose until the end of the gastroscopy when the endoscopist ask to adjust the breathing method,
inform patients that there would be some normal physiological reaction when gastroscopy, such as throat discomfort and nausea/vomiting.</description>
