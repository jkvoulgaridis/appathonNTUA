  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized trial aimed to compare conventional draining seton with or without rerouting
      of the fistula track in treatment of complex anal fistula
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Placement of seton is typically employed when the fistula track is involving more than 30% of
      the external anal sphincter. However, attempts to reroute the seton and the involved fistula
      track were made to preserve the external anal sphincter fibers and hasten healing of the anal
      wound. Mann and Clifton first introduced a transposition technique for the management of high
      anal and anorectal fistulas by re-routing the extrasphincteric portion of the track into an
      intersphincteric position with immediate repair of the external sphincter and reported
      successful outcomes of five patients in terms of quick healing and preserved anal continence.

      The present study aimed to evaluate the outcome of draining seton with or without rerouting
      of the fistula track in treatment complex high anal fistula regarding healing time,
      postoperative pain, and incidence of recurrence and FI postoperatively. We hypothesized that
      rerouting the seton to include the fistula track and the internal anal sphincter only,
      preserving the external anal sphincter muscles, would serve to hasten healing and decrease
      the incidence of recurrence and continence disturbances.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult patients of both genders aging below 60 years old with complex crypto-glandular
             anal fistula were included. Complex anal fistula were defined as high
             trans-sphincteric anal fistulas involving more than 30% of the external anal sphincter
             fibers, suprasphincteric, extrasphincteric, and horse-shoe fistula

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with simple anal fistula.

          -  Patients with acute anorectal sepsis.

          -  Patients with secondary anal fistula caused by inflammatory bowel diseases, sexually
             transmitted diseases, malignancy, or irradiation.

          -  Patients with associated anorectal conditions as hemorrhoids, anal fissure, rectal
             prolapse, or malignancy.

          -  Patients with history of previous surgical treatment of anal fistula.

          -  Patients with symptomatic preoperative fecal incontinence.
