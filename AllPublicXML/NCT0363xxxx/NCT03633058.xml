  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This 4 cohort, sequential, ascending dose study will assess the safety, tolerability and
      efficacy of oral ketamine dosed in a single 5-day BID regimen in addition to placebo, in a
      4-week cross-over design in patients with Rett Syndrome. Approximately 12 patients per cohort
      and up to approximately 48 patients in total are anticipated to participate for approximately
      8-10 weeks at approximately 7 US study centers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to assess oral ketamine for the treatment of Rett Syndrome and
      consists of up to 4 ascending dose cohorts, each assessing 1 dose level of ketamine vs
      placebo. Patients will receive in either order, a 5-day BID regimen of both placebo and the
      cohort-specified dose level of oral ketamine. Patients may only participate in 1 cohort.
      Safety and tolerability will be assessed via patient disposition, vital signs, physical
      examination, adverse events and concomitant medication use. Efficacy will be assessed via
      physician and caregiver questionnaires and assessments, and continuous, wearable, at-home
      biosensor data collection. An independent safety committee will review safety data from each
      cohort to determine if the subsequent ascending dose cohort is warranted. A total of 12
      patients per cohort and up to 48 patients in total is anticipated at approximately 7 sites.
      The screening period will last between 2 and 4 weeks, the cross-over treatment period will
      last 4 weeks, and the safety follow-up period will last 2 weeks. Total patient participation
      is approximately 8-10 weeks.

    <measure>Clinical Global Impression of Improvement</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Clinicians will use a 7 point Likert Scale to rate change from baseline symptom severity by addressing the question, &quot;Compared to the patient's condition of Rett syndrome prior to treatment initiation at baseline, the patient's current condition is: 1 very much improved, 2 much improved, 3 minimally improved, 4 no change, 5 minimally worse, 6 much worse, 7 very much worse. No change would be scored a 0, while improvement would be scored at -1, -2, or -3 and worsening would be scored +1, +2 or +3, depending on the degree of perceived change. Negative change indicates improvement while positive change indicates worsening</description>

    <measure>Motor Behavioral Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>a 37-item questionnaire for clinicians to evaluate current behavioral/social, orofacial/respiratory, and motor/physical symptoms. Each item is rated either 0 (normal or never), 1 (mild or rare), 2 (moderate or occasional), 3 (marked or frequent), 4 (very severe or constant), where higher numbers indicate higher severity. Each subscale is summed for a subscale score, while the total score is a sum of the subscale scores. The behavioral/social subscale score may range from 0 to 64; the orofacial/respiratory subscale may range from 0 to 28, and motor/physical subscale may range from 0 to 56. Total score may range from 0 to 148.</description>

    <description>an 8 category (domain) questionnaire to assess current hand function, walking, verbal and non-verbal communication, comprehension, attention, behavior problems, and mood by considering the question, &quot;Considering your experience with the patient at this visit, please rate the level of function in each category&quot;. Each domain will be rated on a 7 point Likert Scale where the clinician will select 1 of 7 choices: 1 normal, 2 borderline abnormal, 3 mildly abnormal, 4 moderately abnormal, 5 markedly abnormal, 6 severely abnormal, 7 extremely abnormal. Lower values indicate lesser severity while higher values indicate higher severity.</description>

Each domain will be rated on a 7 point Likert Scale where the parent/caregiver will select 1 of 7 choices: 1 normal, 2 borderline abnormal, 3 mildly abnormal, 4 moderately abnormal, 5 markedly abnormal, 6 severely abnormal, 7 extremely abnormal. Lower values indicate lesser severity while higher values indicate higher severity.</description>

A total score of the sum of each item and 8 subscale scores (bedtime resistance, sleep onset delay, sleep duration, sleep anxiety, night wakings, parasomnias, sleep disordered breathing, and daytime sleepiness) are possible. Total scores between 0 and 70 are possible, where higher scores indicate more sleep problems.</description>

Total scores between 0 and 104 are possible, where higher scores indicate more caregiver burden.</description>
