  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hyperinflation ventilator was performed in different modalities and ventilatory
      adjustments, with total pressure of 40cmH2O. The inspiratory volume, inspiratory time, mean
      airway pressure, inspiratory and expiratory flow, and bias flow were evaluated.

      PURPOSE: To compare different ways of applying ventilator hyperinflation. METHODS: A
      randomized crossover clinical trial was performed with 30 patients (66.5 ± 17.3 years) with
      hypersecretion. The ventilator hyperinflation was performed in five ventilatory modalities
      for five minutes, with an interval of 2 hours, the order being determined by randomization:
      controlled ventilation at volume (VCV) with constant flow of 20 (VCV20) Lpm and 40 Lpm
      (VCV40), controlled ventilation pressure ventilation (PCV), controlled pressure ventilation
      associated with inspiratory time adjustment (PCV + Tins) and support pressure ventilation
      (PSV). In VCV mode, the volume was increased every 50mL, until reaching a maximum pressure of
      40cmH2O. In the pressure controlled modes, the inspiratory pressure was increased every 5
      cmH2O until the total pressure reached 40 cmH2O. The inspiratory time was adjusted so that
      the inspiratory flow reached the baseline. The following variables were evaluated: tidal
      volume, inspiratory time (Tins), mean airway pressure (Pmean), peak inspiratory flow (PIFR)
      and expiratory flow (PEFR), PIFR / PEFR and Bias Flow (PEFR-PIFR).

    <intervention_model_description>In order to perform both interventions, the patients were placed in dorsal decubitus with a head elevated at 45 ° and submitted to closed tracheal aspiration, according to the recommendations of the American Association for Respiratory Care. In addition, the bacteriological filter was changed, the cuff pressure was increased and the presence of leaks in the mechanical fan circuits was verified.
All patients underwent five hyperinflation maneuvers, the order being determined by randomization. Controlled volume ventilation (VCV) at a constant flow rate of 20 Lpm (VCV-20) and 40 Lpm (VCV-40), controlled pressure ventilation (VCV-40) was performed for 2 minutes at 10 minute intervals. PCV), pressure-controlled ventilation associated with inspiratory time adjustment (PCV + Tins) and pressure-supported ventilation (PSV). PEEP and FiO2 were maintained throughout the study.</intervention_model_description>
