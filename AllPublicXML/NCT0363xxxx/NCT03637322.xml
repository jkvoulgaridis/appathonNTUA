  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the implementation of a PrEP program for youth aged 13-24 in
      Phoenix, AZ. Numbers of youth who initiate PrEP, how long they continue with PrEP, and the
      barriers for youth who are trying to initiate and continue taking PrEP will be examined.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This observational study will describe the barriers encountered and the benefits found as
      youth engage in a PrEP program, the Phoenix PrEP Access Project and as they participate in
      PrEP provided through standard medical care. This study does not investigate the safety,
      efficacy or other medical benefits of PrEP, but looks at the issues surrounding youth who are
      trying to access PrEP.
