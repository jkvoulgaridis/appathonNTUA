  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Metastatic breast cancer (MBC) is a dark prognostic disease with survival at 5 years of less
      than 20% and a median survival of 24 to 30 months after diagnosis of metastasis. Thus,
      metastatic diagnosis can be expected to have a different impact on the quality of life of
      patients in early and advanced stages.

      However, MBC benefits from therapeutics that improve patients' quality of life and even
      improve overall survival. The main objectives of this prospective study are :

        -  to evaluate the evolution over time of the quality of life of patients treated for
           positive hormonal receptors (RH+) metastatic breast cancer, according to the therapeutic
           class ;

        -  to evaluate the psychological vulnerability of these patients since the announcement of
           their metastatic diagnosis and during their treatments. Finally, when interviewing
           oncologists, to know the factors involved in a treatment change decision process for the
           same patient.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Studying quality of life over time in patients followed for metastatic breast cancer will
      identify when a person may feel most vulnerable in their experience of the disease and
      treatment. A specific and adapted support can thus be set up throughout the disease, from the
      diagnosis and during the different phases of treatment.

      Patients will benefit from a longitudinal follow-up determined according to the treatments.
      For example :

      Chemotherapy : After the first assessment time at 1 month from diagnosis, patients receiving
      chemotherapy treatment are seen every 3 months.

      Hormone therapy : After the first assessment time at 1 month from diagnosis, patients
      receiving hormone therapy are seen every 2 months.

      Each type of treatment has its own schedule based on medical consultation times. At each
      change of treatment, from chemotherapy to hormone therapy or vice versa, the assessment times
      are determined according to the nature of the treatment.

      The rhythm of the evaluation visits will therefore be defined by the doctor, according to the
      habits of the centre.

      Patients will complete an end of study visit 3 years after inclusion

      Quality of Life and Psychological vulnerability will be assessed through questionnaires :

        -  QLQ-C30 explores 5 functional scales (physical, social, psychological, cognitive
           functioning, daily activities) and 1 scale of health status and overall quality of life.
           It allows a detailed analysis of symptoms related to the disease and its treatment
           (fatigue, nausea/vomiting, pain, dyspnea, loss of appetite, sleep disturbance,
           constipation and diarrhea) as well as the financial impact for the patient.

        -  BR23 : specific questionnaire for breast cancer validated in French

        -  Psychological distress scale (PDS)

        -  State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) : Assesses the feelings of apprehension, tension,
           nervousness and worry that the subject feels at the time of the anxiogenic or
           endangerment situation. This questionnaire is therefore an indicator of transient
           changes in anxiety caused by aversive or therapeutic situations.

        -  Beck Depression Inventory (BDI II) : assesses the severity of depression.

    <description>1 month after metastatic stage diagnosis, patients complete their 1st therapeutic sequence evaluation visit (T1) within the recommended standard time frames. If the disease remains stable or if a response to treatment is observed then patients continue their follow-up in the same therapeutic sequence (T1).
If progression occurs, treatment is modified and patients move on to the next therapeutic sequence (T2).
And so on as many times as necessary. Before each evaluation visit with investigator, patients complete the questionnaires QLQ-C30, BR23, STAI, BDI II</description>
