  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label Phase 2 study which will evaluate the efficacy and safety of PT2977 in
      combination with cabozantinib in patients with advanced ccRCC. PT2977 will be administered
      orally and cabozantinib will be administered orally once daily.
