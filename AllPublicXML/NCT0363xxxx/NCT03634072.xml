  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) is the most common cyanotic congenital heart defect with the vast
      majority of survivors of corrective surgery left with some degree of right ventricular (RV)
      volume overload due to pulmonary regurgitation (PR) which cause RV enlargement with right
      heart failure, diminished biventricular function, ventricular arrhythmia, sudden death and
      decreased exercise performance over time. Pulmonary valve replacement has been thought to
      ameliorate these complications but the timing of replacement has yet to be determined with
      equipoise at the moment in this decision making process. As nearly all studies in this regard
      are retrospective with much less data in pediatric TOF than adults, this pilot trial sets the
      stage to create a prospective randomized trial in the teenage years.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to gather information on adolescents and young adults
      to help understand and improve the lives of patients with TOF.

      Some patients diagnosed with TOF will have a procedure called pulmonary valve replacement
      (PVR) and some will not. PVR is done for valves that are too damaged to be repaired. This
      requires a surgeon or an expert in a procedure called cardiac catheterization to replace the
      damaged pulmonary valve with a valve made of tissue or amechanical valve. Multiple studies in
      adult TOF patients have suggested that PVR may lessen many clinical symptoms but no one is
      sure if it truly does. There is little information about PVR in adolescence but it is thought
      that lessening the amount of leakage of the pulmonary valve at a young age may avoid future
      complications such as right heart failure or abnormal beats of your heart. There is no
      agreement among cardiologists, surgeons or other healthcare providers as to whether PVR truly
      helps avoid complications in the future and if it does, when PVR should be done. Using the
      information in this study, we hope to find out if PVR in adolescents is helpful in both the
      short and long term.

      The Investigators believe the results of this study will help provide doctors with enough
      information to support a future large scale research study to further evaluate the outcomes
      PVR. This study will involve randomization to either the PVR or no PVR cohort, medical
      records review, exercise test and Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) , and questionnaires.

    <description>Quality of life will be measured using the Pediatric Cardiac Quality of Life Inventory (PCQLI) - to measure quality of life. The PCQLI has been used for over 10 years and is a validated quality of life metric (Marino BS et al. Pediatrics. 2010;126:498-508). The PCQLI measures disease-specific, pediatric health related quality of life and generates 3 scores, namely, total, disease impact subscale, and psychosocial impact subscale. Each subscale score has a maximum of 50 points, and their sum yields the total score. Higher scores represent better perceived pediatric health related quality of life</description>
