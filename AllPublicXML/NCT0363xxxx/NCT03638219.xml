      assess the validity of applying the bioscore system to predict the disease-specific survival

      Prospective cohort analysis of breast cancer patient's records for patients treated with
      surgery as an initial intervention at our department from 2015 to 2018 will be identified.
      Multivariate analyses of factors, including performance status according to pathologic stage
      (PS), T stage (T), nodal stage (N), grade (G), estrogen receptor (ER) status (E) and human
      epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2) status will be recorded to identify associations with
      disease-specific survival DSS. A score of 0-4 will be assigned for each factor by considering
      the hazard ratio magnitude.

      Analysis of the correlation between performance status, T stage (T), nodal stage (N), grade
      (G), estrogen receptor (ER) status (E) and human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2)
      status combined score and the disease specific survival (DSS), correlation between
      bioscoredisease progression free surival.
