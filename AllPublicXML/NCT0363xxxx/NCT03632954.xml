      This is an observational study to assess the safety and efficacy of MicroMatrix® alone or in
      combination with Cytal® Wound Matrix on primary measures of wound healing.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A single-site, prospective, observational clinical study of Cytal® Wound Matrix alone or in
      combination with MicroMatrix® for the management of wounds. Up to 100 patients with multiple
      wound types including but not limited to, venous ulcers, diabetic foot ulcers, trauma wounds,
      and external surgical wounds will be treated either with Cytal® Wound Matrix alone or with
      Cytal® Wound Matrix and MicroMatrix® for wounds exceeding 3mm in depth. Wound healing
      efficacy, effect of treatment on patient-reported quality of life, complete wound management,
      wound-related adverse event, and wound pathology will be measured. The protocol defined
      patient follow-up is 12 months.

    <description>VAS is a psychometric response scale that measures subjective characteristics or attitudes regarding perceived pain levels from participants. Participants are asked to draw a line on a 10cm horizontal line indicating what their current pain level would be. The distance between the start of the horizontal line to the vertical line is calculated in mm with a higher score (100mm) indicating a greater pain intensity.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 52 week visit (until study completion)</time_frame>
    <description>W-QOL is a 17-item Likert style questionnaire that measures 3 subscales in a participant (Body, Psyche, and Everyday to then calculate an overall global score. An overall global score is obtained from averaging all items. Each item is coded with numbers 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much) with a higher score indicating a lower quality of life.</description>

    <description>The Katz ADL is a 6-item questionnaire measuring independence in activities of daily living such as bathing, dressing, toileting, transfers, feeding, and continence. Each item is dichotomized as either having a score of zero (i.e dependence) or one (i.e. independence). An overall score of 6 indicates full function and an overall score of 2 or less indicates severe functional impairment</description>

          1. Allergy or hypersensitivity to materials in porcine-based study products (per subject
             report) or personal preference.

          2. Subject report of concurrent participation in another clinical trial that involves an
             investigational drug or device that would interfere with this study.

          3. The subject has any condition that, in the Investigator's opinion, would warrant
             exclusion from the study or prevent the subject from completing the study.

          4. The subject's wound shows evidence of infection as determined by the Principal
             Investigator (which may be indicated by the presence of: elevated WBC, pus, moderate
             or greater discharge, abnormal odor, or acute osteomyelitis).
