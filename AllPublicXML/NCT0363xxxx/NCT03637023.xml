  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's Disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disease. Bradykinesia,
      tremor, resting tremor and postural instability are the main motor characteristics of this
      disease. As the disease progresses, mobility, walking, balance are reducing, the risk of
      falls is increasing and patients become functionally dependent. Along with these symptoms,
      cognitive functions are also disturbed. The most commonly distorted cognitive functions are
      executive functions such as planning and reasoning, working memory, episodic memory,
      attention and visual-spatial skills. Pharmacological and surgical treatments are used in
      Parkinson's disease. Pharmacologic treatment has a proven effect on motor symptoms, but since
      there is no approved pharmacologic treatment which has a direct effect on cognitive
      functions, recent studies suggest non-pharmacological treatments to improve cognitive
      function. Physiotherapy is also accepted among non-pharmacological treatments. Conventional
      physiotherapy focuses on optimizing patient independence and safety, focusing on hinting
      strategies, cognitive movement strategies and exercises utilizing transfers, posture, upper
      extremity function, balance (and falls), gait, physical capacity and (in)activity. Virtual
      Reality (VR) technology, a promising commonly used new rehabilitation tool, is a treatment
      method that can be used as one of the non-pharmacological treatment methods in Parkinson's
      Disease. In order to understand how neuronal network dysfunction in the Parkinson's Disease
      leads to clinical symptoms, both the component elements and the interconnections within these
      networks need to be examined in greater detail. Studies of resting state-fMRI (rs-fMRI) use
      correlation of activation of brain regions and time series fluctuations between brain regions
      to give information about connectivity in brain.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the therapeutic effects of virtual reality on
      motor and cognitive symptoms of PD. Furthermore, the investigation of possible effects of
      this effect on neuroplasticity through functional brain networks is our other objective. This
      study will be the first study to evaluate the plasticity effect of virtual reality
      application with rs-fMRI in Parkinson's disease.
