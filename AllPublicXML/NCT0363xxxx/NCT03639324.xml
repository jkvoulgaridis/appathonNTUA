      This phase 1, multicenter, dose-escalation study is designed to find the Recommended Phase 2
      Dose (RP2D) of idelalisib and venetoclax in combination with rituximab in patients with
      relapsed or refractory CLL/SLL and to assess the clinical activity of the combination with
      rituximab in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL/SLL and to assess the clinical activity
