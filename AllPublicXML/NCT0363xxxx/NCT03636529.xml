  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators recruited at-risk individuals (n=26) who were overweight
      (25.0-29.9 kg/m2) and obese (&gt; 30.0 kg/m2) and likely to exhibit one or more conditions
      associated with Metabolic Syndrome (MetS). In this 12-week placebo-controlled 2 x 2 crossover
      dietary intervention, the investigators randomized participants to consume 240 mL (8 ounces)
      daily of either placebo (artificial cherry-flavored, anthocyanin-free beverage) or TCJ for 4
      weeks, followed by a 4-week washout period, then consumption of the alternate beverage for 4
      weeks. Subsequently, the investigators determined the effect of TCJ in at-risk participants
      on markers of uricemia, lipidemia, glycemia, and inflammation.

      In this study, the investigators recruited at-risk individuals (n=26) who were overweight
      (25.0-29.9 kg/m2) and obese (&gt; 30.0 kg/m2) and likely to exhibit one or more conditions
      associated with MetS. Participants were &gt;18 years of age, not pregnant, not diabetic, with no
      unresolved infections or diseases (diabetes, CVD, IBD, cancer and liver disease), and
      nonsmokers. Histories of medication and dietary supplement use were collected and those
      taking anti-inflammatory or lipid-lowering medications were excluded. After enrollment,
      participants were randomly assigned to consume daily either 240 mL (8 ounces) of TCJ diluted
      (1:6 v/v) from concentrate (Coloma Frozen Foods, Coloma, MI ) or a placebo beverage for 4
      weeks. The placebo was prepared by combining 48.3 g each of dextrose and fructose (Batory
      Foods, Des Plaines, IL), food-grade red and blue dyes (2.0 mL and 0.1 mL, respectively;
      McCormick &amp; Company, Inc., Sparks, MD), lemon powder drink mix (0.8 g; True Citrus,
      Baltimore, MD), powdered black cherry drink mix (4.0 g; Kraft Foods Group, Inc., Northfield,
      IL), and filtered, bottled water (local supermarket) to produce 1 liter of placebo beverage.
      After a 4-week washout period, participants consumed the alternate beverage for 4 weeks in
      this 12-week 2x2 crossover, placebo-controlled dietary intervention. Subsequently, the
      investigators determined the effect of TCJ in at-risk participants on markers of uricemia
      (sUA), lipidemia (HDL, LDL, triglycerides, VLDL, total cholesterol), glycemia (fasting
      insulin and glucose, HOMA, QUICKI, McAuley indirect indices), and inflammation (hsCRP,
      TNF-alpha, and ESR).
