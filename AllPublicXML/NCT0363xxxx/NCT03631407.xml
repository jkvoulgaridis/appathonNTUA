    <measure>Objective Response Rate (ORR) based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who achieve a confirmed complete response ([CR]; disappearance of all target lesions) or partial response ([PR]: ≥30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) per RECIST 1.1 criteria.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLTs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 21 of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 21 days)</time_frame>
    <description>DLTs are defined as toxicities that: 1) are possibly, probably, or definitely related to study therapy; 2) meet pre-defined severity criteria; and 3) result in a change in the given dose. For each arm, the number of participants experiencing DLTs will be assessed.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. For each arm, the number of participants experiencing an AE will be assessed.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment Discontinuations due to Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>For each arm, the number of participants discontinuing study treatment due to an AE will be assessed.</description>
  </primary_outcome>

    <measure>Objective Response Rate (ORR) based on Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 for Immune-based Therapeutics (iRECIST)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>A modification of RECIST1.1, iRECIST is adapted to account for the unique tumor response seen with immunotherapeutic drugs. Following initial identification of progressive disease (PD) based on RECIST 1.1, participants who are clinically stable can remain on treatment until PD is confirmed or disconfirmed by iRECIST. For participants where PD is disconfirmed by iRECIST, ORR will be determined, defined as the percentage of participants who achieve a confirmed CR (disappearance of all target lesions) or PR (≥30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is the time from the first dose of study treatment to the first documented disease progression (per RECIST 1.1 criteria) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>

    <measure>Trough Plasma Concentration (Ctrough) of Vicriviroc</measure>
    <time_frame>At designated time points (up to 2 years post-dose)</time_frame>
    <description>Plasma vicriviroc concentration will be quantified for each arm to determine Ctrough, defined as the minimum plasma concentration of vicriviroc observed after administration and just before the subsequent dose.</description>
