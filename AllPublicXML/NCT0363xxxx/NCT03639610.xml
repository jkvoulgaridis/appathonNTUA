             for symptom management of comorbid conditions is permitted but dose should be stable
             for at least 7 days prior to initiation of study therapy. Plasmapheresis is not
             permitted within 14 days of initiation of therapy.

         12. Residual side effects to previous therapy &gt; Grade 1 prior to enrollment (Alopecia any
             grade and/or neuropathy Grade 2 without pain are permitted)

         13. Prior peripheral stem cell transplant within 12 weeks of initiation of study therapy

         14. Prior allogeneic stem cell transplantation with active graft-versus-host-disease.

             of study therapy (this does not include limited course of radiation used for
             management of bone pain to be completed within 7 days of initiation of study therapy).

         16. Known intolerance to steroid therapy
