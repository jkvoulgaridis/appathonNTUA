      This study compare the effectiveness of 2 rehabilitation programmes that use (1) MT with
      TENS, (2) sham-MT with TENS, respectively, in addition to standardized upper limb training
      (TOT), in improving upper limb motor functions, activities of daily living, community
      integration and quality of life in patients with sub-acute stroke.

    <measure>Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Upper Extremity (FMA-UE) - baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (0 week)</time_frame>
    <description>The FMA-UE will be used to evaluate the severity of motor impairment in the paretic upper extremity. The performance of 33 tasks will be assessed using a three-point ordinal scale (0 to 2), with a maximum score of 66. The FMA-UE will assess voluntary movement, reflex activity, grasp, and coordination of the upper extremity, and has a high inter-rater reliability (r=0.99) in patients with stroke.

    <measure>Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT) - baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (0 week)</time_frame>
    <description>Upper limb function will be assessed by the WMFT, which comprises two items of strength-based tasks, and 15 items of function-based tasks. The two strength-based tasks will be measured by weight lift and grip strength. The 15 function-based tasks will be assessed by the time taken to complete each task (in seconds), and the quality rating of the use of the paretic hand in attempting each task (graded 0 to 5). The scores for the 15 tasks will be summed and then averaged to yield the mean functional ability score. The WMFT has a high inter-rater reliability (ICC=0.97) and test-retest reliability for time scores (ICC=0.95). A higher score indicates a better hand function.</description>

    <measure>Stroke Impact Scale (SIS) - baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (0 week)</time_frame>
    <description>SIS will be used to evaluate the health-related quality of life in stroke survivors. The SIS is a 59-item questionnaire which consists of 8 domains: Strength (4 items), memory and thinking (7 items), emotion (9 items), communication (7 items), ADL (10 items), mobility (9 items), hand function (5 items), and participation (8 items). Responses to each item will be based on a 5-point Likert scale that ask participants to score their level of difficulty with a task over the previous 2 weeks. Items from strength, ADL, mobility and hand function domains can be combined to create a composite physical functioning score. Scores for each domain are transformed into a score out of 100 using the formula: [(mean domain score-1)/(5-1)]*100. A higher score is indicative of better self-perceived health. The SIS has demonstrated validity and reliability for assessing health-related QoL.</description>

    <description>Grip strength of both the paretic and intact hands will be measured using the Jamar dynamometer (Sammons Preston Rolyan, Bolingbrook, IL, USA) with standardized positioning and instructions recommended by the American Society of Hand Therapist.

    <description>The MAL questionnaire will be used to assess how frequently and how well a person uses the paretic upper limb in 30 activities of daily life in a semi-structured interview. Based on a six-point ordinal scale, subjects will be required to rate (1) the amount of use (AOU), and (2) the quality of movement (QOM) when performing these 30 tasks in real life situations. The AOU and QOM scores will be summed and averaged to yield a single MAL score for each subject. The MAL has high internal consistency (Cronbach alpha &gt; 0.88), and reasonable construct validity (Spearman r=0.63) in patients with stroke, and the Chinese version of the MAL will be used in this study. A higher score indicates a better use of the affected hand in daily life.</description>
