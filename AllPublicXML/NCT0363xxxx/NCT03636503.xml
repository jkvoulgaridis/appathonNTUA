  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying several new investigational drug combinations as a possible
      treatment for follicular lymphoma.

      The drugs involved are:

        -  Rituximab

        -  Utomilumab

        -  Avelumab

      This research study is a Phase 1 clinical trial. Phase 1 clinical trials test the safety of
      an investigational intervention and also try to define the appropriate dose of the
      investigational intervention to use for further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the
      intervention is being studied.

      Utomilumab and avelumab are drugs which may stimulate the immune system against tumor cells.
      Because they activate the immune system, they are sometimes called immunotherapy drugs. The
      FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved utomilumab or avelumab for
      treatment of this cancer.

      Rituximab is approved by the FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) as a treatment
      option for this disease.

      The purpose of this research is to learn about the effects of combining the immunotherapy
      drugs utomilumab and avelumab with rituximab in follicular lymphoma. The investigators hope
      to learn how safe the combinations of treatments are for participants with follicular
      lymphoma.

    <description>Rituximab works by targeting the CD20 antigen on normal and malignant B-cells. Then the body's natural immune defenses are recruited to attack and kill the marked B-cells. Stem cells (young cells in the bone marrow that will develop into the various types of cells) do not have the CD20 antigen. This allows healthy B-cells to regenerate after treatmen</description>

             patients with a history of inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis and Crohn's

          -  Patients with known leptomeningeal or brain metastases. Imaging or spinal fluid
             analysis to exclude CNS involvement is not required, unless there is clinical

             they can be treated with a prophylactic agent (eg, entecavir); patients with hepatitis

             use double barrier birth control method of contraception during the course of the
             study treatment period and for 3 months after completing study treatment. WOCBP are
             defined as sexually mature women who have not undergone a hysterectomy or who are not
             postmenopausal (no menses) for at least 12 consecutive months. WOCBP must have a
