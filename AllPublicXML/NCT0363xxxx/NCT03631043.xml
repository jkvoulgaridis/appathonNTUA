      This early phase I trial studies the side effects of personalized vaccine in treating
      participants with smoldering multiple myeloma. Vaccines made from a person's blood and bone
      marrow may help the body build an effective immune response to kill cancer cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To demonstrate that developing a custom vaccine for smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) is
      feasible.

      II. To show that a custom peptide-based vaccine in smoldering multiple myeloma is safe.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the intensity and longevity of antigen specific T-cell mediated immune
      responses to the neoantigen vaccine.

      II. Time to progression to multiple myeloma (TTM) at the end of the follow up period (18
      months).

      III. Duration of response. IV. Clinical benefit rate (minor response [MR] or better) after 6
      cycles of vaccine treatment per modified International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria
      for multiple myeloma (MM).

      V. Overall survival.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Rate of minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity at complete remission (CR), if achieved.
      MRD assessment will be based on bone marrow aspirates.

      II. Molecular profiling (including whole exome sequencing, gene expression profiling and
      ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing of tumor/bone marrow samples) and cellular (including flow
      cytometry) profiling at baseline using bone marrow aspirate samples and peripheral blood.

      III. Immunophenotypic characterization of dendritic, T-, B-, natural killer (NK)- and
      NKT-cells, and inhibitory/activation markers on tumor cells at baseline (bone marrow and
      peripheral blood), day 1 of each cycle (peripheral blood only) and at completion of 6 cycles
      of therapy (bone marrow and peripheral blood) in bone marrow aspirate samples and/or
      peripheral blood.

      IV. To identify shared human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I-restricted antigens that can be
      targeted with immunotherapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants undergo collection of blood and bone marrow for making the vaccine. Participants
      then receive personalized vaccine subcutaneously (SC) on days 1 and 15 of courses 1-2 and on
      day 1 of courses 3-6. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 3 and 12 months.
