      The study is divided into 2 phases.

      The course of treatment will be single (course of therapy with the drug/placebo under study)
      for a group consisting of three cohorts, and also single for a group of phase 2 participants
      (770 patients in total) consisting of two cohorts groups. The recruitment of patients to the
      second phase will commence after the evaluation of the data on safety and efficiency by the
      expert commission within the framework of reviewing the amendment to the current Study
      Protocol. At the second phase, it is proposed to study the optimal dosage chosen based on the
      results of the first (search phase) study.

      This study is aimed at evaluating the efficacy, safety and tolerability of the drug
      Ftortiazinon tablets 300 mg (FSBI &quot;N.F. Gamaleya NRCEM&quot; of the Ministry of Health of the
      Russian Federation) in combination with the drug Maxipime®, a powder for the preparation of a
      solution for intravenous and intramuscular administration of 1.0 g (Bristol-Myers Squibb,
      USA), in comparison with placebo in combination with the drug Maxipime®, a powder for the
      preparation of a solution for intravenous and intramuscular administration of 1.0 g
      (Bristol-Myers Squibb, USA), in the treatment of patients with complicated urinary tract
      infections (complicated UTIs) caused by P. aeruginosa.

      FIRST PHASE (search phase) At this phase, the patients will take the drug Ftortiazinon
      tablets 300 mg (FSBI &quot;N.F. Gamaleya NRCEM&quot; of the Ministry of Health of the Russian
      Federation) in combination with the drug Maxipime®, a powder for the preparation of a
      solution for intravenous and intramuscular administration of 1.0 g (Bristol-Myers Squibb,
      USA).

      According to the results of the screening of patients who have signed the Informed Consent
      Form, the patients are recruited in three groups with different doses of the drug. The total
      number of patients who received the drug or placebo will be at least 240 people according to
      the following scheme:

      Group 1 (80 patients) - Ftortiazinon tablets 300 mg (FSBI &quot;N.F. Gamaleya NRCEM&quot; of the
      Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation) plus placebo. The drug is administered
      according to the following scheme on the first day: the first administration of Ftortiazinon
      300 mg (1 tablet) plus placebo (1 tablet) 30 minutes after eating with lukewarm water, the
      second administration - 1 tablet (300 mg) after 12 hours, then within 6 days the drug is
      prescribed 1 tablet once a day plus 1 tablet of placebo (interval: 12 hours) 30 minutes after
      eating.

      Group 2 (80 patients) - Ftortiazinon tablets 300 mg (FSBI &quot;N.F. Gamaleya NRCEM&quot; of the
      Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation). The drug is administered according to the
      following scheme on the first day: the first administration of 600 mg (2 tablets) 30 minutes
      after eating with lukewarm water, the second administration - 1 tablet (300 mg) after 12
      hours, then within 6 days the drug is prescribed 1 tablet twice a day at intervals of 12
      hours.

      Group 3 (80 patients) - placebo in combination with the drug Maxipime®, a powder for the
      preparation of a solution for intravenous and intramuscular administration of 1.0 g
      (Bristol-Myers Squibb, USA). The drug is administered according to the following scheme on
      the first day: the first administration of 2 tablets 30 minutes after eating with lukewarm
      water, the second administration - 1 tablet after 12 hours, then within 6 days the drug is
      prescribed 1 tablet twice a day at intervals of 12 hours 30 minutes after eating.

      For all groups: Maxipime®, a powder for the preparation of a solution for intravenous and
      intramuscular administration of 1.0 g (Bristol-Myers Squibb, USA). The drug is administered
      according to the following scheme: the drug with a dosage of 1.0 g is dissolved in 2.4 ml of
      sterile water for injection or 0.9% sodium chloride solution, or 0.5-1% lidocaine
      hydrochloride solution; then injected deep into the muscle, into the upper outer quadrant of
      the buttocks after pre-aspiration every 12 hours for 7 days*.

      SECOND PHASE (confirmation phase) The transition to this phase of the study to assess
      efficacy and safety of the drug Ftortiazinon will be carried out after selecting the optimal
      dosage according to the results of the first (confirmation phase) study.

      This transition will be carried out by making a corresponding amendment to the Study Protocol
      with the provision of data confirming the efficacy and safety of the selected therapeutic
      scheme.

      The assessment will be conducted according to the results of the 21-day surveillance for
      patients after completion of therapy with a drug/placebo.

      Group 1 patients will take the drug Ftortiazinon tablets 300 mg (FSBI &quot;N.F. Gamaleya NRCEM&quot;
      of the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation) in combination with the drug Maxipime®,
      a powder for the preparation of a solution for intravenous and intramuscular administration
      of 1.0 g (Bristol-Myers Squibb, USA) in accordance with the dosage regimen selected at the
      first phase.

      Maxipime® is a powder for the preparation of a solution for intravenous and intramuscular
      administration of 1.0 g (Bristol-Myers Squibb, USA). It is administered according to the
      following scheme: the drug with a dosage of 1.0 g is dissolved in 2.4 ml of sterile water for
      injection or 0.9% sodium chloride solution, or 0.5-1% lidocaine hydrochloride solution; then
      injected deep into the muscle, into the upper outer quadrant of the buttocks after
      pre-aspiration every 12 hours for 7 days.

      Group 2 patients will take placebo in combination with the drug Maxipime®, a powder for the
      preparation of a solution for intravenous and intramuscular administration of 1.0 g
      (Bristol-Myers Squibb, USA). Placebo is taken according to the scheme corresponding to those
      chosen at the first phase.

      Maxipime® is a powder for the preparation of a solution for intravenous and intramuscular
      administration of 1.0 g (Bristol-Myers Squibb, USA). It is administered according to the
      following scheme: the drug with a dosage of 1.0 g is dissolved in 2.4 ml of sterile water for
      injection or 0.9% sodium chloride solution, or 0.5-1% lidocaine hydrochloride solution; then
      injected deep into the muscle, into the upper outer quadrant of the buttocks after
      pre-aspiration every 12 hours for 7 days.

      Administration/injection of drugs Ftortiazinon/placebo and Maxipime® should be carried out
      simultaneously, preferably in one and the same time every day. Let the administration of
      Ftortiazinon/placebo will be for 30 min after administration of the drug Maxipime®.

      The duration of therapy with Maxipime® will be 7 calendar days; however, if the patient has
      no positive dynamics in the evaluation of clinical symptoms of complicated UTIs, there is an
      increase in uropathogen in the urine culture obtained on Visit 2, and the duration of therapy
      can be increased to a total of 14 calendar days.

                  9. Recurrent complicated urinary tract infection within 12 months before the
                  study (presence of complicated urinary tract infection in anamnesis with a
                  frequency of more than twice per year).

                  10. Suspected infection caused by multiresistant strains of P. aeruginosa,
                  inefficiency of previous treatment.

                  11. High risk of complicated UTI caused by P. aeruginosa (e.g. pseudomonal

                  researcher.

                  12. Prognostic life expectancy of the patient with effective antibiotic therapy
                  and proper maintenance treatment is estimated by the researcher to be at least 6
                  months.

                  13. Women who capable of childbirth (i.e. not in menopause and not surgically
                  sterilized) should have a negative pregnancy test result before randomization.
                  Participants in the study who are capable of procreation, or sexual partners of
                  participants who are capable of childbirth, should agree to the continued use of
                  a highly effective method of contraception from the beginning of screening to the
                  end of the study (medical and pedagogical observations) (highly effective methods
                  of contraception include hormonal implants, plasters, injectable hormones, oral
                  hormonal contraceptives, intrauterine systems, approved cervical ring, prior
                  bilateral ovariectomy, prior hysterectomy, previous bilateral tubal ligation,
                  true abstinence from sexual activity (if confirmed by the researcher), or

                  during sexual intercourse during screening up to the end of the study in case of
                  possible and even existing pregnancy of the sexual partner.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Presence of any known or suspected disease, or condition that may distort the

                  intervention necessary to remove the obstruction or placement of the stent or
                  holding of a nephrostomy until the end of treatment (medical and pedagogical
                  observations).

                  5. Renal function in screening evaluated by creatinine clearance as &lt; 50 ml / min
                  using the Cocroft-Gault formula and serum creatinine values obtained in a local

                  extra-renal origin, such as endocarditis, osteomyelitis, abscess, burn urinary
                  tract infection; meningitis or pneumonia.

                  7. Any signs of sepsis, including shock or deep arterial hypotension, which is
                  defined as SBP &lt; 90 mm Hg or a pressure reduction of &gt; 40 mm Hg from the initial
                  level (if known) not reacting to the load with a liquid.

                  8. Pregnant or breastfeeding women. 9. Established epileptic syndrome requiring
                  ongoing treatment with an anticonvulsant drug, which will not allow the patient
                  to comply with the treatment regimen according to the Study Protocol. Patients
                  with a history of epilepsy or those receiving stable therapy (i.e. unchanged
                  therapy for 30 days) with a well-controlled epileptic syndrome (i.e. with no
                  recurrence within the last 30 days) may be considered for admission to the study.

                  10. Treatment with antitumor chemotherapeutic drugs, treatment with
                  immunosuppressive therapy for transplantation, or drugs preventing rejection of
                  the transplant within 30 days prior to randomization.

                  11. Signs of severe disease or liver dysfunction, including confirmed viral
                  hepatitis or hepatic encephalopathy.

                  12. AST or ALT &gt; 3 x ULN (upper limit of normal) or total bilirubin &gt; 1.5 x ULN
                  at screening.

                  13. Administration of any long-acting systemic antibiotic (i.e. with a frequency
                  of less than once per day) for less than 12 hours prior to randomization.

        However, the following patients may be included:

        • who have received antimicrobial therapy for &gt; 24 hours and have not responded to
        treatment (i.e. signs and symptoms have worsened) and have documented complicated UTIs
        caused by pathogen microorganisms resistant to previous therapy;

          -  who developed signs and symptoms of complicated UTI in the administration of systemic
             antibiotics for other indications, including antimicrobial prophylaxis against
             recurrent UTI;

          -  who received short-acting systemic antibiotic therapy (i.e. with frequency of
             administration more than once per day) for 24 hours before randomization, but not less
             than 12 hours prior to randomization.

             14. Need for additional systemic antimicrobial therapy at the time of randomization
             (including antibiotic, antifungal therapy), other than treatment with the drug under
             study, except for a single oral administration of any antifungal drug for the
             treatment of vaginal candidiasis.

             15. Likelihood of the need for an antibiotic to prevent complicated UTI during patient
             participation in the study (from randomization to medical and pedagogical
             observations).

             16. Impossibility of removal or replacement of temporary catheters installed in more
             than 24 hours prior to the screening from the perspective of evaluating the safety of
             the patient or presence of contraindications to manipulation (temporary catheters
             installed more than 24 hours prior to the screening should be removed or replaced
             prior to collecting the urine sample for analysis and sowing).

             17. History of HIV infection. 18. Presence of significant immunodeficiency or immune
             deficiency, including hematologic malignant disease, bone marrow transplantation or
             receiving immunosuppressive therapy, such as chemotherapy for cancer, administration
             of drugs to prevent graft rejection and long-term use of systemic corticosteroids
             (equivalent to the use of prednisone or equivalent systemic drug at a dose ≥ 20 mg/day
             for ≥ 2 weeks).

             19. Presence of neutropenia (absolute number of neutrophils &lt; 1000/mm3) based on the
             results of the screening analysis in the central laboratory.

             20. Presence of thrombocytopenia (especially in patients diagnosed with disseminated
             intravascular coagulation or risk of serious bleeding) 50,000 platelets/mm3 confirmed
             on the basis of indicators obtained in the central laboratory during screening.

             21. Lactose intolerance, lactose deficiency or glucose-galactose absorption, severe
             hypersensitivity or allergic reaction to β-lactam antibiotics, L-arginine, local
             anesthetics, antiarrhythmics or to the components of the drug in anamnesis.

             22. Presence of any contraindications to the use of β-lactam antibiotics
             (cephalosporins, penicillins, carbapenems or monobactams), to administration of
             auxiliary substances that are part of the relevant dosage forms.

             23. Participation in another clinical trial using the drug or device under study for
             the last 90 days prior to randomization.

             24. Inability or unwillingness to comply with the requirements of the Study Protocol.

             25. Any patients previously randomized into this study.
