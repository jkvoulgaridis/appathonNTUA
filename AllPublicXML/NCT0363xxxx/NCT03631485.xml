  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Caring for children with cancer is described as life-changing experience and overwhelming
      stress for parents. Poor quality of life and mental health problems such as depression and
      anxiety were found in this population. The psychological status of them is still waited to be
      improved. As a dominant term in positive psychology, resilience is commonly regarded as the
      ability to move forward or keep normal under adversity. It was proved to be associated with
      psychological outcomes in adolescents and chronic illness patients, enhanced resilience
      usually along with improved mental health, while little evidence was available in the parents
      of children with cancer.

      A cross-sectional study will be conducted to explore the level of resilience and
      psychological outcomes such as quality of life, depression, anxiety and well-being in parents
      of children with cancer using questionnaires. Such results will be compared with normal
      population to help evaluate the psychological status of those parents. The relationship
      between resilience and these psychological outcomes will also be examined. Lower resilience
      and higher resilience of the parents will be determined by the lowest and highest quartile of
      The Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) scores. Subsequently, a qualitative study will
      be conducted to explore the experience of those parents with lower resilience and higher
      resilience.

      It is anticipated that risk parents of children with cancer could be identified from the
      inferior outcomes of resilience and psychological outcomes. Both the results of
      cross-sectional study and qualitative study will guide the development of interventions
      designed to enhance resilience and promote positive psychological outcomes among targeted
      parents of children with cancer under risk.
