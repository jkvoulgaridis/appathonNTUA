  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      America is in the midst of an opioid epidemic. One of the reasons opioid addiction and
      overdose deaths have recently increased is that doctors are frequently prescribing opioid
      medication as a treatment for pain. If it is possible to develop new ways of increasing the
      pain-relief patients experience from a set amount of opioids, then doctors might ultimately
      be able to prescribe fewer opioid medications, which could help curb the opioid crisis.

      Although &quot;placebos,&quot; a medication whose benefit derives solely from positive psychological
      factors rather than pharmacological factors, are often disparaged in medicine, research
      suggests that placebos can actually help reduce pain. In fact, there is reason to think that
      placebos are effective even when a patient knows they are taking a placebo.

      The goal of the proposed study is to examine the feasibility of using an honest placebo to
      relieve pain for up to 20 real patients. People who are undergoing hand or wrist surgery or
      enrolled for upper extremity trauma in the Emergency Department and agree to participate will
      be asked to take placebo pills in addition to their standard course of opioid pills, given as
      part of standard care. Patients will also answer a few short questions over the phone once
      per day for seven days, and be invited to participate in an exit questionnaire at the end of
      the study. The investigators hypothesize that: 1) At least 50% of eligible participants will
      agree to enroll, 2) At least 80% of participants who are enrolled will be retained, and 3)
      Participants who are enrolled will take a placebo at least 50% of the time they also take an
      opioid pill
