    <intervention_name>collagenase clostridium histolyticum (CCH)</intervention_name>
    <description>Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Endo) is developing collagenase clostridium histolyticum (CCH) for the treatment of EFP. Because CCH is a proteinase that can hydrolyze the triple-helical region of collagen under physiological conditions, CCH has the potential to be effective in lysing sub-dermal collagen, such as those observed in the dermal septa, which are the underlying cause of the skin dimpling in women with Edematous Fibrosclerotic Panniculopathy (EFP). CCH targets the collagenase structural matrix (e.g., dermal septa) at the site of injection and does not require systemic exposure to be effective.</description>
