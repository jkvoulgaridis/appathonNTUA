      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy, safety, and durability of two different
      strategies to treat participants with a history of sub-optimal adherence and control of their
      HIV infection: long-acting (LA) antiretroviral therapy (ART) and all-oral standard of care
      (SOC).

      This study will compare the efficacy, safety, and durability of two different strategies to
      treat participants with a history of sub-optimal adherence and control of their HIV
      infection: long-acting (LA) antiretroviral therapy (ART) with rilpivirine (RPV) LA and
      cabotegravir (CAB) LA versus all-oral standard of care (SOC).

      The study includes four steps. In Step 1, participants will receive a SOC oral induction
      regimen consisting of an ART regimen that involves at least 3 drugs for 24 weeks.
      Participants who achieve milestones will receive conditional economic incentives at Weeks 2,
      4, 8, 12, 16, and 20.

      In Step 2, eligible participants will be randomized to receive either oral RPV + oral CAB for
      4 weeks followed by RPV-LA + CAB-LA every 4 weeks for 48 weeks or to continue on SOC for 52
      weeks.

      At the completion of Step 2, eligible participants randomized to SOC will have the option to
      register to Step 3 and receive LA ART, which includes oral RPV + oral CAB for 4 weeks
      followed by RPV-LA + CAB-LA every 4 weeks for 48 weeks. Participants already receiving RPV-LA
      + CAB-LA in Step 2 will continue on this regimen in Step 3 for 52 weeks.

      Eligible participants will enter Step 4 and be followed for 52 weeks on locally sourced oral
      ART.

      Participants will be followed for up to a total of 180 weeks. Study visits, which will occur
      throughout the study, may include physical examinations; blood, urine, and hair collection;
      liver function tests; questionnaires; and an electrocardiogram (ECG).

             chemiluminescence immunoassay (E/CIA) test kit at any time prior to study entry and
             confirmed by a licensed Western blot or a second antibody test by a method other than
             the initial rapid HIV and/or E/CIA, or by HIV-1 antigen, plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load.

               -  NOTE: The term &quot;licensed&quot; refers to a FDA-approved kit, which is required for all
                  IND studies.

               -  WHO (World Health Organization) and CDC (Centers for Disease Control and
                  Prevention) guidelines mandate that confirmation of the initial test result must
                  use a test that is different from the one used for the initial assessment. A
                  reactive initial rapid test should be confirmed by either another type of rapid
                  assay or an E/CIA that is based on a different antigen preparation and/or
                  different test principle (e.g., indirect versus competitive), or a Western blot
                  or a plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load.

          -  HIV-1 Plasma viral load (VL) greater than 200 copies/mL within 60 days prior to study

                  time points at least 4 weeks apart) in individuals who have been prescribed ART
                  for at least 6 consecutive months.

               -  Lost to clinical follow-up within 18 months prior to study entry with ART

                  missed greater than or equal to 2 appointments in a 6-month period. ART
                  non-adherence is defined as a lapse in ART greater than or equal to 7 days
                  (consecutive or non-consecutive), in the 6-month period where they were lost to
                  clinical follow-up per participant report.

             laboratory that has a CLIA certification or its equivalent within 60 days of study
             entry (see protocol for more information), nor history of such mutations on review of
             prior resistance tests by the site investigator. Genotypic analysis using proviral
             (i.e., archived) DNA is not allowed.

          -  Ability of site clinician, in conjunction with participant, to construct an oral
             induction antiretroviral (ARV) regimen that must include at least three ARVs of which

                  methods for contraception from 30 days prior to the first dose of study
                  medication, while receiving the study drugs, and for 30 days after stopping oral
                  medications, or the duration specified in the product label if receiving study
