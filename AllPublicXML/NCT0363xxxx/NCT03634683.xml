  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represent approximately 70-85% of liver cancer, in which
      Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is the major etiologic agent accounting for at least 80% of HCC in
      Asian countries. Overall, transplantation remains the best option however, HCC recurrence
      rate is high among liver transplant patients.

      While there are limited treatment measures for HBV-related HCC recurrences, the study
      hypothesized that LioCyx is capable of lysing target liver cells expressing the HBV cognate
      antigens and provide clinical benefit to patients with HBV-related HCC.

      The study is a Phase I/II, open label, single-arm, multicenter study of LioCyx. Subjects with
      recurrent hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma who undergone liver
      transplantation will be enrolled.

      Approximately 6-12 subjects will be enrolled in Phase 1 dose regimen exploration, and
      approximately 60 subjects will be enrolled to characterize the safety and evaluate the
      efficacy of LioCyx&quot;

      All subjects will be followed up for survival until death.
