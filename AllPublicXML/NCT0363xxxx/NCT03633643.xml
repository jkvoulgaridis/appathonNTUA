      The optimal duration of antimicrobial prophylaxis (study medication Cotrimoxazole
      (Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole)) in transurethral resection of the prostate and Greenlight
      Laser vaporisation of the prostate is investigated by comparing a guideline-conform
      single-dose prophylaxis (intervention) versus usual clinical care (i.e. 3-day prophylaxis;
      control) for prevention of urinary tract infections.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Increasing antimicrobial resistance rates have a substantial impact on morbidity, mortality
      and healthcare costs and is particularly prevalent among urological patients due to an
      overuse of antimicrobial agents for therapeutical and prophylactic indications. Transurethral
      resection of the prostate is one of the most frequently performed urological procedures in
      Switzerland and a single-dose of antimicrobial prophylaxis is recommended to reduce
      postoperative urinary tract infections. For photoselective vaporisation of the prostate with
      the Greenlight Laser, a similar operative alternative, there are currently no international
      guidelines for antimicrobial prophylaxis.

      The optimal duration of antimicrobial prophylaxis in transurethral resection of the prostate
      and Greenlight Laser vaporisation of the prostate is investigated by comparing a
      guideline-conform single-dose prophylaxis (intervention) versus usual clinical care (i.e.
      3-day prophylaxis; control) for prevention of urinary tract infections.

      The study medication Cotrimoxazole (Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole) is a routinely used
      antimicrobial substance recommended in international and in-house guidelines for
      antimicrobial prophylaxis and treatment of urinary tract infections. Perioperative
      antimicrobial prophylaxis will be Cotrimoxazole short infusion in both groups. Postoperative
      study medication packages consists of either five tablets of placebo or five tablets of
      Cotrimoxazole (Nopil forte®) 800/160mg using licensed product repacked in a new immediate
      container which is blinded
