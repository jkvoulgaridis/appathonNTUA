  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The finding that the combination of the inactivated probiotic Bifidobacterium Lactis (BPL1),
      inulin as a source of soluble fiber and omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and
      docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in a surimi matrix has positive effects on visceral adiposity ,
      insulin resistance and plasma tryclycerides in a preclinical model of rats that present
      obesity induced by diet is the basis of the present hypothesis. This finding is based on the
      fact that these three bioactive compounds exert these effects through sensibly different and
      complementary mechanisms, which suggests that their combined use may have synergistic
      effects.

      On this basis the present hypothesis is posed: the consumption of surimi enriched with
      inactivated probiotic BPL1, inulin and omega-3 fatty acids, in the same doses that have been
      effective in obese rats (SIAP), can induce a reduction of more than 5% of visceral adipose
      tissue, being clinically relevant in people with abdominal obesity.

      If the effect on abdominal obesity is associated or not with a lower glycemia and / or
      absorption of fats induced by the consumption of surimi can be evaluated by monitoring these
      parameters for 4 hours after the ingestion of a breakfast high in fat.

      The main objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of the consumption of surimi
      enriched with the probiotic BPL1, inulin and omega-3 fatty acids, on visceral abdominal
      adiposity in people with abdominal obesity.
