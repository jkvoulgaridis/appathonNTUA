        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female 55 years of age or older on the date of signing the informed consent

          2. At Screening Visit, subjects must meet all the following inclusion criteria:

          3. Must have had prior treatment in the study eye with any intravitreal vasoactive
             endothelial growth factor (VEGF) medication (at least 3 anti-VEGF) treatments within
             the prior 2-6 months), throughout which clinical examination and SD-OCT imaging has
             shown recurrent or persistent exudative activity, as shown by the presence of
             intraretinal or subretinal fluid, and/or subretinal exudation or hemorrhage.

          4. Best corrected visual acuity of 65 to 20 Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study
             (ETDRS) letters (20/50 to 20/400) in the study eye.

          5. Presence of significant subretinal fluid and/or cystoid macular edema secondary to
             exudative age-related macular degeneration as assessed by optical coherence tomography
             in the study eye, with a minimum of 300 µm within the central subfield.

          6. Total lesion size of ≤9 disc areas, lesion containing ≤50% hemorrhage and ≤50%
             subretinal fibrosis and ≤50% retinal pigment epithelial atrophy in the study eye.

          7. Reasonably clear media and reasonable fixation ability in the study eye to allow for
             good quality tomography and fundus photography.

             At Baseline Visit (Day 0), subjects must meet all the following inclusion criteria:

          8. Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) of 65 to 20 ETDRS letters (20/50 to 20/400) in the
             study eye.

          9. Presence of significant subretinal and/or intraretinal fluid secondary to exudative
             age-related macular degeneration as assessed by SD-OCT in the study eye, with a
             minimum of 300 µm within the central subfield.

         10. Total lesion size of ≤9 disc areas, containing ≤ 50% hemorrhage and ≤ 50% fibrosis and

             injection.

          5. Intravitreal or periocular corticosteroid, within 3 months prior to Baseline Visit
             (Day 0) and throughout the study;

             mmHg) in the study eye.

             the outcome of the study (e.g., active diabetic retinopathy, posterior uveitis, adult
             vitelliform dystrophy, moderate/severe myopic degeneration).

         10. History of vitrectomy surgery in the study eye.

         11. Anticipated need for any ocular surgery involving the study eye during the course of

             eye.

         13. Intraocular surgery, including lens removal or ophthalmologic laser procedure, within
             90 days prior to Baseline Visit (Day 0) in the study eye.

         14. Ocular or periocular infection in either eye.

         15. Pupillary dilation inadequate for good quality fundus photography in the study eye.

         16. Media opacity that would limit clinical visualization, fundus photography, fluorescein
             angiography, or SD-OCT evaluation in the study eye.

         17. History of herpetic ophthalmic infection in the study eye or adnexa.
