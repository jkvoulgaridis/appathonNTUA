      infants (born at ≥37 weeks of gestation), age 0-6 months and discharged from the hospital at
      time of enrollment will be enrolled to obtain records of sleep, stress, and infant nutrition
      from parents of infants (preterm and full-term) through interaction with the study chatbot.

      Data obtained from parents of preterm infants and parents of full-term infants on sleep,
      stress, and infant nutrition will be compared.

      An evaluation of the usability of the mobile app hosting the chatbot, the study chatbot and
      its functionality in general among this population will also be conducted
