  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Eligible patients have multiple myeloma with measurable disease in the blood and a targetable
      soft tissue or bony lesion with radiotherapy. All eligible patients will receive
      immunotherapy (Nivolumab) plus radiotherapy, 6 Gy x 5 fractions, to a targetable lesion.
      Immunotherapy treatment starts with the first radiotherapy fraction. Nivolumab will be given
      every 2 weeks. Patients will have specified laboratory values measured bi-monthly and
      evaluated for response at 12 weeks as defined by International Myeloma Working Group
      Criteria. Patients will continue to receive their respective immunotherapy until disease
      progression or dose limiting toxicity is reached.

             related procedure not part of normal medical care, with the understanding that consent
             may be withdrawn by the subject at any time without prejudice to their future medical
             care.

          3. Must have received 2 consecutive cycles of systemic myeloma therapy.

          4. Documented refractory or relapsed and refractory (R/R) multiple myeloma

               1. patients had less than minimal response, or had achieved at least a minimal
                  response to previous treatment, but progressed within 6 months

               2. patients must have failed, be intolerant or are ineligible to treatment with an
                  IMiD, proteasome inhibitor and anti-CD38 agent

          5. Targetable plasmacytoma, either intra-or extramedullary that is visualized on imaging
             (PET/CT or MRI) and is causing symptoms (eg. pain, neurological compromise) or
             potential to cause symptom as per clinician's judgement; and measurable disease at
