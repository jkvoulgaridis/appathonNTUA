      Procedure for Requesting Expanded Access:

      The treating physician requesting expanded access must contact Humacyte directly with the
      basis for the request. Please include your contact information so that Humacyte may follow up
      with you directly.

      General Criteria:

      We will evaluate and respond to each expanded-access request that we receive on a
      case-by-case basis. Humacyte will consider the nature of the request, the patient's health,
      the available medical and scientific information about the investigational product, the
      balance of risk and potential benefit to the patient, the availability of investigational
      product, and the potential regulatory impact.

      Anticipated Timing:

      If you contact Humacyte as described above, Humacyte anticipates that we will acknowledge
      receipt within ten (10) business days or less.
