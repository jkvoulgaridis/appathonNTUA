      To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Cardio Flow FreedomFlow™ Orbital
      Circumferential Atherectomy System for atherosclerotic plaque removal and vessel compliance
      modification in de novo native target lesions in the peripheral vasculature of the lower
      extremities.

      The FAST II study is a prospective, multi-center, non-randomized single-arm trial designed to
      evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the FreedomFlow™ Orbital Circumferential Atherectomy
      System in subjects diagnosed with peripheral arterial disease of the lower extremities.

      The FreedomFlow™ Orbital Circumferential Atherectomy System is a minimally invasive,
      catheter-based system designed for improving luminal diameter and modifying vessel wall
      compliance in patients with PAD.

      The FreedomFlow™ Orbital Circumferential Atherectomy System is indicated to remove
      atherosclerotic plaque and modifying vessel wall compliance within peripheral arterial
      vessels. The therapy is intended for patients who are acceptable candidates for percutaneous
      transluminal atherectomy.

      The objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the FreedomFlow™
      Orbital Circumferential Atherectomy System for atherosclerotic plaque removal and vessel
      modification in de novo target lesions in the peripheral vasculature of the lower
      extremities.
