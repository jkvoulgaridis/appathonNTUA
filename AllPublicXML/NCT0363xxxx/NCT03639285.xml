      The goals of this protocol is to diagnose, care for, and understand the clinical histories
      and outcomes of people with leukodystrophies.

    <textblock>
      Inherited leukodystrophies affect close to 1 in 7500 children with mortality greater than
      30%. Affected patients face additional serious medical complications including epilepsy,
      developmental regression, and intellectual disabilities. Diagnosis is difficult and requires
      the assistance of a specialist. Finally, identifying treatments and improving outcomes is
      complex.

      The Western Leukodystrophy Project, which is part of the University of Utah and of Primary
      Children's Hospital, and which is a certified Leukodystrophy Care Network Center, provides a
      specialized resource for patients with leukodystrophies.

      This clinical study assists with diagnosis of leukodystrophies; suggesting treatment options
      and implementing care guidelines, and improving outcomes for all patients by understanding
      the clinical histories and outcomes of affected patients..
