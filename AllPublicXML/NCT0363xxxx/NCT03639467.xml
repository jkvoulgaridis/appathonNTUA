  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gemcitabine plus cisplatin (GC) is more effective than fluorouracil plus cisplatin in the
      treatment of recurrent or metastatic NPC (R/M-NPC). GC is the standard first-line
      chemotherapy regimen for this population. However, the median progression-free survival was
      only 7 months for GC regimen. Anlotinib is a kinase inhibitor of receptor tyrosine with
      multi-targets, especially for VEGFR2、VEGFR3、PDGFRβ and c-Kit, which has strong effect of
      anti-angiogenesis. This study is aim to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination
      regimen of anlotinib plus GC as first-line treatment for R/M-NPC.

      In the phase Ib portion, an escalated dose cohort is recruited to determine the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of anlotinib when given in
      combination with gemcitabine/cisplatin. The phase II portion is designed to characterize the
      efficacy and safety of the combination therapy in previous untreated patients with R/M-NPC.

In the phase II portion, patients received anlotinb at recommended phase II dose determined in the phase Ib portion, in combination with fixed dose of gemcitabine and cisplatin every 3 weeks.
The combination of anlotinib plus gemcitabine / cisplatin was repeated every 3 weeks for up to six cycles. Patients with disease control (defined as a complete response, a partial response, or stable disease) continue to receive anlotinb until disease progression or unacceptable toxic effects, whichever occurred first.</description>
