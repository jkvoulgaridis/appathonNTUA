      Validation of a Test System to develop new medications for alcoholism (TEMA)

      The 'TEMA', a progressive-work alcohol self-administration paradigm, can be validated by
      reproducing the effect of Acamprosate and prove the effect of Calcium to reduce motivation to
      work for alcohol after 14 - 19 days of treatment during a period of 15 - 20 days of alcohol
      abstinence in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled three-arm parallel-group design.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Objective of this study is to show that a laboratory alcohol self-administration method can
      predict the therapeutic potential of new compounds to reduce relapse in alcohol-dependent
      patients.

      The 'TEMA&quot; translates several animal behavioral paradigms of alcohol self-administration into
      corresponding human experiments.

      84 at least high risky drinkers (WHO) with at least mild alcohol use disorder perform two
      alcohol self-administration experiments, one before and one after 14-19 days of randomized
      double-blinded treatment with Acamprosate, Calcium Citrate or Placebo.

      Each alcohol request requires prior work in a constant attention task according to a
      progressive schedule to earn the next alcohol infusion.

      Secondary objectives refer to investigations, whether

        1. administration of Acamprosate or Calcium citrate in comparison to placebo leads to a
           change in perception of subjective alcohol effects

        2. effectiveness of Acamprosate or Calcium can be predicted by calcium parameters (baseline
           and changes during medication period)

        3. administration of Acamprosate or Calcium leads to a reduction in alcohol craving

        4. Frequency of alcohol consumption during the imposed abstinence period differs between
           treatment groups and influences primary outcome

        5. study participation modifies motivation to change drinking habits and utilization of
           addiction care services

        6. Acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) activities are applicable as biomarker and predictor of
           medication effects.

        7. safety issues occur due to study medication
