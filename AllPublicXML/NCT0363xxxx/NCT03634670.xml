  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to its high prevalence and the substantial individual and socio-economic burden chronic
      pain is a huge challenge for patients, physicians and the society. Using neuroimaging
      structural and functional alterations have been described in the brain of patients suffering
      from chronic pain (Apkarian, Hashmi et al. 2011, Baliki and Apkarian 2015). However,
      reproducibility and functional significance of these changes are only incompletely
      understood. For example it remains unclear, if these changes covariate with clinical
      parameters and if they can be influenced or reversed by appropriate therapy. Some of the
      structural and functional brain changes in chronic pain patients have been shown to be
      reversible using magnetic resonance imaging after successful interventional pain treatment
      (Seminowicz, Wideman et al. 2011) or cognitive-behavioral therapy (Seminowicz, Shpaner et al.
      2013, Shpaner, Kelly et al. 2014). Interdisciplinary multimodal pain therapy (IMPT) as a
      biopsychosocial treatment approach comprising physiotherapy and psychotherapy in structured
      programs has been shown to be effective in alleviating chronic pain of different entities
      including those where interventional therapy options are lacking or have been unsuccessful
      (Kaiser, Treede et al. 2017). The present study aims to investigate the influence of a
      structured IMPT approach provided in a day-clinic program of 20 treatment days on the
      functional brain network structure in chronic pain patients. To this end, a graph-theory
      based analysis (Bullmore and Sporns 2009) will be applied to electroencephalography (EEG)
      resting-state data from 30 chronic pain patients before and after IMPT and results will be
      correlated with behavioral and clinical data. In this observational study chronic pain
      patients that have been screened for participation in IMPT as part of routine medical care
      are invited to participate in a baseline visit prior to participation and a follow-up visit 6
      months after completion of the program.

      This will add to a better understanding of the complex functional brain alterations in
      chronic pain and might contribute to identify neuronal markers or even predictors for
      therapeutic responses in multimodal pain treatments. Moreover, the broad availability and
      easy applicability of EEG-measurements might enable a wide therapeutic application of
      potential findings in the near future.

    <description>The IMPT-program is provided in a specialized day-clinic setting over a period of 20 treatment days. There are two different treatment programs with either 5 days per week over a period of 4 weeks or 3 days per week over a period of 7 weeks. IMPT comprises individual pharmacotherapy evaluated in regular consultations with a physician as well as a structured physiotherapy and psychotherapy programs on group level and individual level. Group physiotherapy comprises exercise therapy, movement experience and relaxation techniques. Additionally individual physiotherapy is provided in two extra sessions focusing on the individual needs and problems of the patient. Group psychotherapy comprises educational contents (e.g. pathophysiology and biopsychosocial aspects of pain) as well as cognitive-behavioral-interventions e.g. regarding stress-management. Additionally individual psychotherapy is provided in four extra sessions focusing on the individual needs and problems of the patient.</description>
