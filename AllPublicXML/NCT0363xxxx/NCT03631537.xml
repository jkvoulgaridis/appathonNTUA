  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research studies patients with advanced gastrointestinal cancer who receive chemotherapy
      in the medical oncology department of the First Affiliated Hospital of Xian Jiaotong
      University. All patients receive the nutritional risk assessment by the nutritional support
      team first, and patients with nutritional risk or malnutrition are randomly assigned to the
      study group and the control group. The study group receive nutritional intervention from the
      nutritional support team during the period of chemotherapy, while the control group receive
      routine nutritional support from their clinicians. In the control group, nurses execute the
      doctors' advice on nutrition, and the nutrition support team does not actively communicate
      with doctors about the nutritional risk of patients or interfere with it. The baseline
      characteristics, chemotherapy efficacy, adverse events and prognosis are collected in both
      groups. At last, data are analyzed to clarify the nutritional status and related factors of
      patients with advanced gastrointestinal cancer in our hospital, and most important to explore
      the effect of nutrition-support-team intervention on nutritional status, chemotherapy
      tolerance and prognosis of patients with advanced gastrointestinal cancer.

      Baseline data include age, gender, pain, sleep condition, family care, tumor type, tumor
      stage, combined disease, chemotherapy regimen and concomitant medication.

      Nutritional risk assessments are performed by the nutrition support team just after
      enrollment, every two cycles of chemotherapy and at the end of the study. The adverse events
      of chemotherapy are collected and recorded at the end of each cycle. CT or MRI is performed
      to evaluate efficacy of chemotherapy every two treatment cycles. Patient after one treatment
      cycle can receive CT or MRI in advance if the clinical condition is worsening.
