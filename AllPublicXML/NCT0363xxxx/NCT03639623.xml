      This is a phase 2A, single center, open-label, single-arm, 24-week study to evaluate the
      safety, tolerability and efficacy of Saroglitazar Magnesium 4 mg in liver transplant
      recipients with NAFLD.

      The study will be conducted over a period of up to 33 weeks and will include 5 weeks
      screening, a 24 week treatment period and 4 week follow-up period. The primary end point of
      the study is to assess the safety of Saroglitazar Magnesium 4 mg in liver transplant
      recipients with NAFLD over 24 weeks of treatment.
