      Single visit outcome study to obtain qualitative and quantitative data for a new BGMS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During ASCEND, patients will complete a single visit clinical study divided into two distinct
      parts. Part 1 involves each subject completing a number of simple quantitative exercises to
      gauge their level of comprehension of diabetes related information. Subjects will then
      continue during the same visit to complete part 2 which involves gathering qualitative
      feedback from each subject on the new Blood glucose monitoring system.
