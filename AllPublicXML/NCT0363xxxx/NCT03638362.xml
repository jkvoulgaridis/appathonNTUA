  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators recruited at-risk individuals (n=10) who were overweight
      (25.0-29.9 kg/m2) and obese (&gt; 30.0 kg/m2) and likely to exhibit one or more conditions
      associated with Metabolic Syndrome (MetS). In this 10-week placebo-controlled 2 x 2 crossover
      dietary intervention, the investigators randomized participants (n=10) to consume 240 mL (8
      ounces) daily of either placebo (artificial cherry-flavored, anthocyanin-free beverage) or
      authentic TCJ for 4 weeks, followed by a 2-week washout period, then consumption of the
      alternate beverage for 4 weeks. In this study, the investigators determined the effect of TCJ
      in at-risk participants on markers of inflammation, glycemia, and lipidemia.

      In this study, the investigators recruited at-risk individuals (n=10) who were overweight
      (25.0-29.9 kg/m2) and obese (&gt; 30.0 kg/m2) and likely to exhibit one or more conditions
      associated with MetS. Participants were &gt;18 years of age, not pregnant, not diabetic, with no
      unresolved infections or diseases (diabetes, CVD, IBD, cancer and liver disease), and
      nonsmokers. Histories of medication and dietary supplement use were collected and those
      taking anti-inflammatory or lipid-lowering medications were excluded. After enrollment,
      subjects were randomly assigned to consume daily either 240 mL (8 ounces) of authentic TCJ
      (R.W. Knudsen, Chico, CA) or a placebo beverage (commercial fruit punch; Great Value,
      Bentonville, AR) for 4 weeks. After a 2-week washout period, participants consumed the
      alternate beverage for 4 weeks in this 10-week 2x2 crossover, placebo-controlled dietary
      intervention. Subsequently, the investigators determined the effect of TCJ in at-risk
      participants on markers of lipidemia (HDL, LDL, triglycerides, VLDL, total cholesterol),
      glycemia (fasting insulin and glucose, HOMA, QUICKI, McAuley indirect indices), and
      inflammation (hsCRP, TNF-alpha, and ESR).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  This study was a 12-week 2 x 2 crossover, randomized, placebo-controlled dietary
             intervention in overweight and obese participants (BMI&gt;25.0 kg/m2) who are more likely
             to exhibit &gt;1 of the 5 risk conditions associated with metabolic syndrome (MetS). BMI
             was the minimal criterion for recruitment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants were &gt;18 years of age, not pregnant, not diabetic, with no unresolved
             infections or diseases (diabetes, CVD, IBD, cancer and liver disease), and nonsmokers.
             Histories of medication and dietary supplement use were collected and those taking
             anti-inflammatory or lipid-lowering medications were excluded.
