  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to provide critical information on the safety, reactogenicity
      and immunogenicity profile of the investigational recombinant chimpanzee adenovirus Type
      155-vectored RSV (ChAd155-RSV) vaccine in infants likely to be unexposed to RSV, and will
      assess a single lower dose and a higher two dose regimen, before moving to future studies.
      This study will also assess if there is a risk of 'vaccine-induced enhanced RSV disease'
      after vaccination of these infants with the ChAd155-RSV vaccine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The RSV PED-011 study is indicated as a Phase 1 in the study design due to programming
      limitations. In fact, the study is considered a Phase 1/2 and is designed to evaluate the
      safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of the RSV candidate vaccine when administered to
      infants aged 6 and 7 months before moving to a proof-of-concept trial in infants. The
      ChAd155-RSV vaccine will be administered before the RSV season to increase the probability of
      enrolling infants unexposed to RSV, who will be followed through two RSV seasons. For the 2
      dose groups, the second dose of ChAd155-RSV vaccine will be given one month after the first
      dose. Approximately two thirds of the infants (100) in this study will be given the
      ChAd155-RSV vaccine, whereas all infants (150) will receive either an active control
      comparator vaccine (Bexsero, or Nimenrix, or Synflorix, or Menveo), or Placebo (Formulation
      buffer S9b). After a screening visit lasting up to 30 days (Epoch 1), this study will be
      conducted in an observer-blind manner, during the 2 month vaccination phase (Epoch 2) and in
      a single-blinded manner during the follow-up phase, for 10 months until the end of the first
      RSV season (Epoch 3) and then for an additional follow-up year, until the end of the second
      RSV season (Epoch 4).
