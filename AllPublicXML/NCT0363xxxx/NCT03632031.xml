  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the clinical performance, safety, and
      cost-effectiveness of Oasis ECM as a treatment for different types of chronic wounds in the
      community setting in the United Kingdom. The Oasis ECM is commercially available for the
      treatment of partial and full-thickness skin wounds, including chronic wounds, wounds from
      trauma, and wounds that occur during surgery. The ability of the Oasis ECM to promote the
      healing of chronic wounds will be evaluated in this study.

      About 40 patients (men or women) over 18 years old will be involved in this study at up to 3
      different centres in the United Kingdom.

    <description>The Wound Quality of Life (QoL) questionnaire is used for measurement of Health-Related Quality of Life in patients with chronic wounds. The total value of this measurement is derived from an average of 17 questions; each question has a value of a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 5. The lower the score, the better the outcome. Subscales are not combined to compute a total score.</description>
