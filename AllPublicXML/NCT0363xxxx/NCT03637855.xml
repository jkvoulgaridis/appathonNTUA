  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Identify the unique associations of body shape to body composition indices in a population
      that represents the variance of sex, age, BMI, and ethnicity found in the US population.

      Describe the precision and accuracy of 3DO scans to monitor change in body composition and
      metabolic health interventions.

      Estimate the level of association of 3DO to common health indicators including metabolic risk
      factors (glucose, triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol, blood pressure, VAT, WC and strength) by
      gender, race, age, and BMI.

      Investigate holistic, high-resolution descriptors of 3D body shape as direct predictors of
      body composition and metabolic risk using statistical shape models and Latent Class Analysis.

        We will recruit a stratified sample of 720 participants, approximately 360 from each site,
        using the following equally-weighed stratifications: sex, age (18-40, 40-60, 60-80 years),
        BMI (less than 25, 25-30, 30 and above) and ethnicity (White, Black, Mexican-American,
        Asian and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander).

        Within this sample, we will include up to 36 participants with very low and high BMI by
        special recruitments from our facilities Anorexia Nervosa (AN) and bariatric surgery
        clinics. The remainder of the participants will be recruited as a sample of convenience
        using local advertisements around our facilities.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy participants will be included in the study if they have a self-reported
             ability to:

               1. walk one-quarter of a mile and climb 10 steps without difficulty,

               2. perform activities of daily living (ADLs) without difficulty, and

               3. have no life-threatening conditions or diseases that would alter their body
                  composition from what is typical for their age, sex, ethnicity, and BMI.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants will be excluded if they have any internal metal artifact (e.g.
             pacemakers, internal fixation, arthroplasty), amputation, physical impairment or
             previous fracture that would alter body composition assessment or are pregnant or
             breastfeeding.

          -  All premenopausal females will be asked for a spot urine sample for pregnancy test
             prior to participation.

          -  Those unwilling to comply with this will not be included.
