  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching aim of this study is to assess the downstream effects of abrupt estrogen
      deficiency in women undergoing elective bilateral oophorectomy by studying:

        1. the rate of in vivo adipogenesis in the subcutaneous abdominal (scABD) and subcutaneous
           femoral (scFEM) adipose tissue depots following bilateral oophorectomy surgery using an
           innovative (and tested) 8-week incorporation of stable isotope (deuterium; 2H)
           administered in the form of heavy water (2H2O) to endogenously label adipose tissue DNA;

        2. the changes in expression of subcutaneous adipose tissue genes and proteins specific to
           adipocyte expansion and function; extracellular matrix remodeling and fibrosis; and
           inflammation in the scABD and scFEM depots before and after elective bilateral
           oophorectomy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a cross-sectional study that will enroll up to 10 women undergoing laparoscopic,
      elective bilateral oophorectomy at a local hospital in Baton Rouge, LA. Women will complete 7
      study visits over 3 months; a single screening visit to assess eligibility, a pre-bilateral
      oophorectomy visit for imaging and adipose tissue biopsy collection, and 5 post-bilateral
      oophorectomy visits to &quot;dose&quot;, maintain compliance and subject retention, and perform
      follow-up imaging and adipose tissue biopsy collection for outcome measures.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of in vivo adipogenesis (via deuterium-enrichment of adipose tissue DNA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline in enrichment of DNA of adipose cells with deuterium at 8 weeks post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Deuterium from the deuterium-labeled water is incorporated into the newly-synthesized DNA of newly-formed fat cell precursor cells through cell replication. The latter carry over the label when they become fat cells through differentiation. Enzymatic digestion of the fat tissue isolates the individual cells constituting the fat tissue. Centrifugation of the cell suspension allows the separation of fat cells into a floating layer and a pellet comprised of stromal-vascular cells including the fat cell precursor cells and small fat cells. As the fat cell precursor cells and small adipocytes have the property to attach quickly to plastic surfaces of culture dishes, a brief culturing of the stromal-vascular cells sorts these cells from the remaining cells. Thus, measuring the deuterium-enrichment of DNA from plastic-adherent stromal-vascular cells indicates the rate of in vivo formation of new mature fat cells and pre-adipocytes, a process collectively termed adipogenesis.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Size of adipocytes</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline in size of adipocytes at 8 weeks post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Fat cell size will be determined using osmium fixation of the lipids and measurement of their diameter with Coulter Counter followed by calculation of fat cell volume. The mean lipid content of fat cells will be calculated by multiplying the fat cell volume by the density of triolein (0.915).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of adipocytes</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline in number of adipocytes at 8 weeks post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Fat cell number will be estimated by dividing the volume of adipose tissue depot of interest to the mean fat cell volume or the fat mass of the depot to the mean lipid content in fat cell.</description>

    <measure>Body composition (by Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA))</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline in body composition at 8 weeks post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Fat mass, fat-free mass, and percent body fat will be assessed using a whole-body scanner GE iDXA.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Body composition (by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI))</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline in body composition at 8 weeks post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Visceral adipose tissue (VAT), subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), and total adipose tissue (TAT) will be assessed by MRI scan (3T GE Discovery 750w).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adipose tissue gene and protein expression</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes from baseline in gene and protein expression at 8 weeks post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Expression levels of genes and proteins involved in adipocyte expansion and function (ERα, PPARγ2, C/EBPα, aromatase, adiponectin, and LPL), extracellular matrix remodeling and fibrosis (COL6(a1, a2, a3), COL4a1, and TGFβ), and inflammation (IL-6 and TNFα) will be assessed.</description>
