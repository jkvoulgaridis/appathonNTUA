  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Extubation stay at high risk of reintubation even scheduled and in the best condition of
      hematosis. Re-intubation's rate in main studies in chronic obstructive diseases reach to 20%
      and it is associated to a higher mortality, higher pneumonia under mechanic ventilation, and
      higher duration of hospitalization especially in intensive care units.

      Place of NIV in this situation is still on evaluation. A recent meta-analysis demonstrates
      that use of NIV in post-extubation in COPD seems to decrease re-intubation rate.

      HFO, thanks to its properties (oxygen, humidification and heat with high flow) could be
      useful in this population in ventilatory weaning. Compared to oxygen conventional therapy
      with high-concentration mask, HFO seems to be as efficient and better tolerated. A recent
      study shows that HFO is non-inferior to NVI in post-extubation in patient with high risk of
      re-intubation.

      Furthermore, oxygenation in post-extubation should be optimized to avoid hypoxemia and
      hypercapnia in this patient at risk of hypoventilation. Place of AFOT could improve hematosis
      by providing adapted flow of oxygen to each patient.

      The investigator choose the hypothesis for this study that HFO is as effective and tolerated
      in post-extubation than NIV with AFOT.
