  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A multi-center, randomized, controlled clinical trial will be conducted to test the
      effectiveness of a home-based video intervention on improving kidney transplant candidate's
      knowledge, self-efficacy, quality of life, beliefs in medications, and education satisfaction
      as compared to usual care.

    <textblock>
      Kidney transplantation is the best treatment for most patients with end-stage kidney disease,
      but it is an extremely complicated process. To become active on the transplant waitlist,
      patients must learn new information, navigate the healthcare system and undergo several
      specialized tests. After the transplant, another set of challenges emerge. Transplant
      recipients must commit to lifelong therapy with immunosuppressive medications and adapt to
      lifestyle changes. Up to half of all patients have difficulty taking the medications as
      prescribed, which can lead to transplant rejection, kidney loss, and death. The transplant
      process is challenging and confusing; however, increasing education and support to transplant
      candidates demands greater use of care providers' time and resources in a health care system
      that is already stretched.

      A patient-oriented video series has been developed according to best practices for transplant
      education, featuring an animated character embarking on a transplant journey. Animated
      segments illustrate difficult concepts for patients with poor health literacy, and patient
      narratives provide support and encouragement.

      A multi-center, randomized, controlled clinical trial will be conducted to test the
      effectiveness of a home-based video intervention on improving kidney transplant candidate's
      knowledge, self-efficacy, quality of life and beliefs in medications as compared to usual
      care. Participants will be randomized (1:1) to the control group, or the intervention group,
      who will be provided access to the video series, in addition, to standard of care.
      Differences in changes in transplant knowledge, self-efficacy, beliefs about medicines,
      quality of life, and education satisfaction will be evaluated by a pre-and post-intervention
      survey. A thorough assessment of video-viewing habits and satisfaction with the intervention
      will provide insight on the feasibility of expanding home-based education to other health
      settings.

    <measure>Change in transplant knowledge score between the intervention and control groups as measured by the Kidney Transplant Understanding Tool (K-TUT)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by the Kidney Transplant Understanding Tool (K-TUT) (self-reported electronic survey). The K-TUT consists of 9 true/false and 13 multiple-choice questions, and scores are based on the number correct answers [YES/ NO format] of 69 items.</description>

    <measure>Difference in self-efficacy between the intervention and control group as measured by the Generalized Self Efficacy Scale (GSE)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by the Generalized Self Efficacy Scale (GSE) (self-reported electronic survey).The GSE measures an individual's self-beliefs in their ability to cope with various demands in life. It is a 10-item psychometric scale with a score for each item ranging from 1 to 4. The scores are summed and a higher score indicates stronger patient beliefs in self-efficacy.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Difference in quality of life between the intervention and control group as measured by the Short Form-12 (SF-12)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by the Short Form-12 (SF-12) (self-reported electronic survey). The SF-12 is a 12-item psychometric scale that measures functional health and well-being. Responses are indicated on a likert scale and aggregated into two sub scales; the mental component summary (MCS) and the physical component summary (PCS). The scores are converted to adjusted norm-based values of a healthy individual with a midpoint score of 50 indicating average health comparable to norm values.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Difference in beliefs of medicine between the intervention and control group as measured by the Beliefs of Medicine Questionnaire (BMQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by the Beliefs of Medicine Questionnaire (BMQ) (self-reported electronic survey). The BMQ is an 18-item psychometric questionnaire which consists of two subscales. The BMQ-Specific assesses perceptions of medication prescribed for personal use, while the BMQ-General assesses beliefs about medications in general. The BMQ-General can be further classified into domain of General-Harm and General-Overuse. Items are scored on a 5-point likert scale, with higher score indicating stronger beliefs in each subscale.</description>

The videos will be initially viewed in the following order: Video 1: Introduction; Video 2: The Kidney; Video 3: Assessment and Waitlist; Video 4: Operation and Recovery; Video 5: Medications; Video 6: Your New Life. After the series has been viewed in its entirety one time, participants will be able to replay a specific video as often as desired.</description>

    <description>Solid Organ Transplantation: An Educational Mini-Series for Patients consists of 6 videos ranging in length between 3 and 23 minutes, and has been developed according to best practice for designing education for patients with end-stage renal disease pursuing transplant. Each video outlines a subsequent stage of the transplant process, featuring an animated character embarking on a transplant journey. Animated segments illustrate difficult concepts for patients with poor health literacy, and patient narratives keep the content relevant and culturally inclusive. The educational intervention was developed with experts in medication adherence, video education, motivational psychology, cultural education (First Nations perspective), healthcare providers, and most importantly patients.</description>
