  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an assessment of the overall performance of participants with symptomatic mild
      knee OA taking Tregocel® as a dietary supplement in addition to standard of care treatment.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tregocel® is a combination herbal product which as a dietary supplementation may help
      maintain proper performance of joints. Although some studies have reported beneficial effects
      for individual components of Tregocel®, there have been no clinical assessments of
      supplementation with Tregocel® as a finished product. This study will involve collection of
      data on Tregocel® supplementation in participants with symptomatic mild knee osteoarthritis
      (OA) who are already receiving standard pharmacological treatment.
