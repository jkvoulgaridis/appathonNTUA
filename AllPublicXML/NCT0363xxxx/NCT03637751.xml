  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given the salient role of early-life adversity and the resulting biological embedding in
      disease risk, there is a critical need to understand the mechanisms operating at multiple
      levels of analysis in order to promote effective clinical treatments and intervention efforts
      for survivors. An example for such an effort could be to utilize models of dynamic cellular
      markers as individual-level factors to account for variation in intervention response and
      clinical outcomes. Results of this study will lead to new knowledge about specific gene
      expression pathways in response to stress, and whether the response is moderated by previous
      exposure to early adversity, shorter telomere length (a marker of cellular aging) and
      self-report mental-health measures. Thus, the long-term effects of this study will advance
      our understanding on stress-related transcriptomic changes that play a downstream role in
      disease susceptibility and accelerated aging, with the goal of targeting specific pathways
      and genes for potential intervention studies and pharmacological treatments to reverse the
      effects of exposure to early adversity. For example, considering high failure rates for
      depression treatments, and in order to tailor individual interventions, identifying objective
      changes in stress-induced gene expression may help to predict intervention efficacy in
      clinical and non-clinical settings, as seen, for example, in breast and leukemia cancers.
      Thus, findings will have a range of impacts for basic science, intervention studies and
      clinical practice that will influence treatments to match the specific cellular processes
      operating within an individual.

    <description>Testing will be carried out in Penn State's Clinical Research Center (CRC). The CRC has rooms for conducting the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) stress-task and for resting. Participants will make two visits to the CRC, one week apart, on the same day of the weekday. Sessions will be scheduled from 11:00 am to 4:15 pm. We will use a randomized counter-balanced order for the two sessions (i.e., TSST and control conditions) with group membership blind to the subjects and lab personnel.</description>
