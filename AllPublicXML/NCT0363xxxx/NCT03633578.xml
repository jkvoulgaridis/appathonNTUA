  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Motor control, notably expressed through the complexity of the variability of the locomotor
      pattern, is disturbed at the central level by an apprehension of pain and movement, more than
      pain itself (or by biomechanical / structural damage of the spine) in chronic low back pain
      (cLBP) patients.

      The aim of this study is to control that variability is reduced during gait at comfortable
      level and to test that distraction can reduce pain avoidance and therefore increase
      variability in cLBP patients.

    <measure>Dallas Pain Questionnaire for Back Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire has been designed to give health care provider information as to how pain affects daily activities. It assesses the impact of low back pain (LBP) on four components (daily activities, work and leisure activities, anxiety/depression, and social interest) (expressed as a value between 0 and 100) of daily life.The higher the score, the more the low back pain has an impact on the quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Fear Avoidance Belief Questionnaire (FABQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0</time_frame>
    <description>The Fear Avoidance Belief Questionnaire is a two-part questionnaire assessing fear, avoidance, and beliefs about professional activity and physical activity.
The FABQ physical activity score of 14 responds better to a cognitive/behavioral approach and de-emphasize the traditional pain specific treatment goals. The &quot;Fear Avoidance Belief Questionnaire&quot; Work score that is &gt;18 has a decrease likelihood of success from a joint manipulation/mobilization treatment approach. The &quot;Fear Avoidance Belief Questionnaire&quot; Work score of 34 or greater increases the risk for prolonged disability and will most likely require a multi-disciplinary approach to treatment.</description>
