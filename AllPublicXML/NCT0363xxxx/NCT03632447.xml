      A randomized controlled trial for patients with stress urinary incontinence or
      stress-dominant mixed incontinence. Subjects will be randomized to 8-weeks of home kegel
      exercises or 8 weeks of pelvic floor muscle exercises using the leva digital pelvic health
      system that includes visual biofeedback via smartphone.

      A randomized controlled trial for patients with stress urinary incontinence or
      stress-dominant mixed incontinence.Subjects will be randomized to 8-weeks of home kegel
      exercises or 8 weeks of pelvic floor muscle exercises using the leva digital pelvic health
      system that includes visual biofeedback via smartphone. Leva subjects will perform guided
      pelvic floor muscle exercises for 2 1/2 minutes twice daily. Home kegel subjects will perform
      kegel exercises three times daily. Following 8-weeks of training, subjects will be permitted
      to continue the exercises or pursue additional therapies as indicated. Subjects randomized to
      the leva digital health system will be further randomized to receive automated reminders for
      the remainder of one year, or no additional reminders.

    <description>Subjects will undergo pelvic floor muscle training using the leva device (a vaginal probe) which provides immediate visual feedback via smartphone regarding the motion of pelvic floor muscles. Subjects will perform exercises 2 1/2 minutes twice daily for 8 weeks. At the beginning of the study, four weeks later, and eight weeks later subjects will undergo pelvic floor muscle testing using the PFDx device and surveys to document response to training. After eight weeks, subjects may pursue any additional treatments they wish, but may continue to use the device. They will be further randomized to receive reminder text messages or no messages over 10 months. Subjects will be asked to complete follow up surveys at 6- and 12-months.</description>
