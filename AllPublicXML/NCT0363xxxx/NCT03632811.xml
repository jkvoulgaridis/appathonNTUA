  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mastocytosis is a heterogeneous rare disease. A 27-item questionnaire to assess the quality
      of life of patients with cutaneous/ indolent systemic mastocytosis was developed in the
      German language and validated in the English language in 2015.

      The team of the University Charité Berlin and the company Moxie - intellectual proprietor of
      the questionnaire - proposed the use of the recommendations of Baiardini et al. 2010, for
      linguistic adaptation of this questionnaire in other languages.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The first two steps of the program of linguistic translation have already been carried out
      under the direction and supervision of teams from Charité University, Berlin and Moxie
      Company. The result of these two steps is a secondary version of the Mc-QoL questionnaire in
      French. The last step of this adaptation process in the target language (French, France)
      needs to be carried out and it is the subject of this study.

      The objective of this study is the French language adaptation of the Mc-QoL questionnaire in
      adult patients with indolent cutaneous and / or indolent systemic mastocytosis.

      During this study, the second version of the Mc-QoL questionnaire in French will be evaluated
      on 10 adult patients, with cutaneous and / or indolent systemic mastocytosis and native in
      the French language. The comprehension tests will be carried out by means of the structured
      interviews during which the investigator will ask if the patient has had difficulties to
      understand the recommendations, the questionnaires, will verify the interpretation of all the
      items and the understanding of each word by the patient. In case of problems, the
      investigator will propose and / or test translation alternatives, or will ask the patient to
      propose alternatives.

      Revisions to the second version of the Mc-QoL questionnaire in French will be done to rectify
      the problems identified in the conceptual equivalence. The result will be a third French
      version of the Mc-QoL questionnaire, which will be the final version.

      A report on the interviews will be written in English: it will describe the number of
      respondents, their age, the time required to complete the questionnaire, the difficulties
      encountered, the solutions suggested and retained and how the third version of the
      questionnaire was produced.
