      Single blinded Randomised Controlled trial comparing standard therapy to the intervention of
      up to 1 hour of physiotherapist-prescribed resistive training exercises administered via a
      telerehabilitation device per day in addition to standard therapy for a total of 10 sessions
      over a 2 week period. Total recruitment: 60 patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single blinded randomised control trial. From August 2018 to March 2019, a total of
      60 subjects, who match the inclusion exclusion criteria, will be recruited from patients
      transferred to the SGH Isolation wards.

      They will be randomly assigned to control or treatment arm based on a block randomisation
      strategy predetermined and held by an independent party.

      The treatment arm will be given up to 1 hour of physiotherapist-prescribed resistive training
      exercises administered via a telerehabilitation device per day in addition to standard
      therapy for a total of 10 sessions over a 2 week period. They will be evaluated for motor
      strength, activity of daily living performance, mood and perceived level of health.

      The control arm will be subject to the same assessments as the treatment arm at the start and
      end of the two week period. They will receive standard care in the ward including
      physiotherapy as prescribed by the managing team.

      The assessors will be blinded to the arm of the study the subjects will be assigned to and
      will be independent of the terating physiotherapist.

      1.1. Hypothesis We propose that for patients with deconditioning after a prolonged period of
      hospitalization and needing inpatient isolation precautions, that a 2-week course of daily,
      up to 1-hour long, physiotherapist-developed resistive training exercises will result in a
      20% improvement in the motor power and a corresponding improvement in motor functioning and
      the perceived quality of life compared to a control group receiving standard therapy.

    <description>The FIM Provides a uniform system of measurement for disability based on the International Classification of Impairment, Disabilities and Handicaps; measures the level of a patient's disability and indicates how much assistance is required for the individual to carry out activities of daily living based on their score in 18 categories (13 motor and 5 cognitive function items). Each category or item is rated on a 7-point scale (1 = total assistance required, 7 = fully independent).

    <measure>Level of anxiety/ depression</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score. The HADS is a fourteen item clinical assessment scale to assess levels of anxiety and depression. Seven of the items relate to anxiety and seven relate to depression.
Each item on the questionnaire is scored from 0-3 and this means that a person can score between 0 and 21 for either anxiety or depression. The HADS uses an ordinal scale.
A number of researchers have explored HADS data to establish the cut-off points for diagnosis of anxiety or depression. A systematic review of a large number of studies identified a cut-off point of 8/21 for anxiety or depression. For anxiety (HADS-A) this gave a specificity of 0.78 and a sensitivity of 0.9. For depression (HADS-D) this gave a specificity of 0.79 and a sensitivity of 0.83.</description>
