      The study will enable the clinical applicability of the multiple-spectral-sonography for
      detection of severe brain injury in ICU patients. For this, the ACG diagnostic system
      (Sonovum AG, Leipzig, Germany) should be used as additional diagnostic tool in prospective
      single-center study.

      A multiple-step procedure, including repetition of the clinical examinations after a waiting
      period and use of additional technical diagnostic tools e.g. magnetic resonance tomography
      and Transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD) are needed for determining of severe brain injury
      and irreversible brain function failure.

      This study will enable the clinical applicability of the multiple-spectral-sonography for
      detection of severe brain injury in ICU patients. For this, the ACG diagnostic system
      (Sonovum AG, Leipzig, Germany) should be used as additional diagnostic tool in prospective
      single-center study.

      The ACG-method is a bedside non-invasive sonography that has been shown to be useful in
      previous studies analyzing circulatory changes in rat cerebral blood vessels, for example, to
      distinguish between brain-ischemia and -hemorrhage. Additionally, in the case of brain death,
      the spontaneous electrical activity, which can be measured by means of ACG as global
      elasticity, was not longer detectable.

      In the study should include 30 adult ICU-patients in patients suspect to severe brain injury.
      The inclusion of patients will be started if written informed consent was obtained from
      participants or their representatives. After the inclusion, the ACG is measured three times a
      day. In addition, the routinely practice (treatment and diagnostic) for patients with severe
      brain injury (neurological clinical examinations, use of additional technical diagnostic
      tools e.g. magnetic resonance tomography and Transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD); Standard
      Medical Care) should be made and documented. From all patients basic demographic data,
      pre-morbidity, vital parameters, blood parameters, Illness severity scores (APACHE-II, SOFA,
      GCS), drug levels, microbiological results and cranial MRI/CT results will be recorded.
