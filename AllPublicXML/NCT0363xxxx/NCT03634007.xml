  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is an open label, dose-ranging study designed to evaluate gene therapy to
      treat patients who are APOE4 homozygotes with clinical diagnosis varying from subjective or
      mild cognitive impairment to very mild to severe dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. All
      subjects will have evidence of amyloid plaque by nuclear PET scan and/or cerebrospinal fluid
      (CSF) biomarkers consistent with Alzheimer's disease. The study will assess the safety and
      toxicity of intracisternal administration of AAVrh.10hAPOE2, serotype rh.10 adeno-associated
      virus (AAV) gene transfer vector expressing the cDNA coding for human apolipoprotein E2
      (APOE2), directly to the CNS/ CSF of APOE4 homozygotes with Alzheimer's disease. The study
      will establish a maximum tolerable dose and generate preliminary evidence regarding whether
      direct administration of AAVrh.10hPOE2 to the CNS of those Alzheimer's patients will lead to
      conversion of the APOE protein isoforms in the CSF of APOE4 homozygotes from APOE4 to
      APOE2-APOE4.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  APOE4 homozygotes

          -  Males and females, age 50 or older

          -  Willing and able to provide informed consent (or consent provided by legally
             authorized representative)

          -  Mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease, or clinical diagnosis of very
             mild to severe dementia due to Alzheimer's disease

          -  Evidence of amyloid plaques by nuclear PET scan and/or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
             biomarkers consistent with Alzheimer's disease

          -  Serum neutralizing anti-AAVrh10 titer &lt;10-2

             comply with all study requirements, or would require the administration of treatment
             during the study that could potentially affect the interpretation of the study data,
             or would place the individual at an unacceptable risk by his/her participation in the

          -  Individuals who cannot participate in MRI, PET and CSF studies
