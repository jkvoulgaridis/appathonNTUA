    <textblock>
      Keratoconus (KC) is a corneal ectatic disorders, with incidence rate 1 per 50,000 among the
      population. Hormonal imbalances may be associated with KC as it affects the corneal
      metabolism. In this study, we aim to examine this clinical association between thyroid gland
      dysfunction (TGD) and KC.

      Keratoconus (KC) is a corneal ectatic disorders, with incidence rate 1 per 50,000 among the
      population. Moreover, the pathophysiological processes underlying KC have not been fully
      elucidated with proposed mechanisms to include proteolytic degradation in the corneal stroma,
      oxidative damage, epithelial mechanical injury, immunological factors, and genetic factors.
      However, Hormonal imbalances may be associated with KC as it affects the corneal metabolism.
      Furthermore, thyroid gland dysfunction (TGD) can frequently associated with eye diseases such
      as Graves disease. Previous studies investigated the association between TGD and KC.
      Interestingly, thyroxine (T4) is important for corneal dehydration and transparency during
      embryonic development and regulates the synthesis of keratin sulfate proteoglycan in the
      chicken. T4 receptors (T4Rs) have been found in the lacrimal gland, confirming that the tear
      producing gland is a target organ of T4. T4 level was elevated in the tears of patients with
      KC. Hence, in this study, we aim to investigate the clinical association between TGD and KC.

    <measure>measuring the serum concentrations of free T4 (fT4) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)</measure>
    <time_frame>We will recruit patients who meet the inclusion criteria during the study period of 3 months (June- August 2018). We will take only one blood sample from each patient recruited after the recrutiement and during this period</time_frame>
    <description>The endocrinologic examination will include measuring the serum concentrations of free T4 (fT4) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) using an immunoassay method (ADVIA Centaur; Bayer Diagnostics, Germany). The normal reference ranges for TSH and fT4 were determined to be 0.35 to 4.5 mIU/ L and 0.7 to 1.65 ng/dL, respectively. Clinical cases with fT4 serum concentrations beyond these reference ranges will be defined as TGD. All examinations will be handled anonymously.</description>
