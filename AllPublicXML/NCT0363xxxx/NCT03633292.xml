  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The development of gingivitis in patients during orthodontic treatment is widely known, with
      the characteristic response of gingival inflammation and hyperplasia and traumatic rashes or
      ulcerations of the oral mucosa derived from the treatment. The use of chemical agents such as
      CHX, although it has proven to be useful in these patients, but has the disadvantage of
      having side effects such as staining, even restricting its use during treatment.

      The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy of Aloe vera gel at 80% compared to
      0.12% Chlorhexidine gel to alleviate the effects derived from any orthodontic treatment, such
      as gingival inflammation and hyperplasia and friction or ulcerations. of traumatic oral
      mucosa-derived from treatment in patients after cementation with metal brackets in the two
      arches. A total of 140 patients between the ages of 10 and 55 who were randomized and
      assigned in the two study groups treated with Aloe vera gel versus the conventional
      Chlorhexidine gel with a sample of 70 subjects in each group participated.

      The index of gingival inflammation, plaque index, as well as the simplified hemorrhage index,
      were evaluated.

    <description>The patient will attend his scheduled appointment for bracket cementation. Before cementing, we will complete the clinical history (frequency of brushing, smoker or non-smoker, age, sex) aided by intraoral photographs, always collected in the same order according to protocol and by the same researcher. After the cementation, the patient will be included in the study in a random way in the corresponding group. One month after cementing and coinciding with the periodic visit of the patient, the presence / absence of friction or traumatic ulcers will be evaluated.</description>

    <measure>Prevalence of gingival inflammation</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>One month after cementing and coinciding with the periodic visit of the patient, the presence / absence gingival inflammation through the gingival inflammation index will be evaluated.
0 = Normal gingiva, absence of inflammation, no change in color, no bleeding.
1 = slight inflammation, slight change in color, small alteration of the surface, no hemorrhage. 2 = Moderate inflammation, redness, edema and hemorrhage on probing and pressure. 3 = Strong inflammation, intense redness, edema, tendency to hemorrhages, eventually ulceration. It is interpreted as follows: Sum of the degree of each face / No. of faces observed 0.0-1.0 = incipient gingivitis 1.1-2.0 = Moderate gingivitis 2,1-3,0 = Severe gingivitis</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Prevalence of gingival bleeding</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>One month after cementing and coinciding with the periodic visit of the patient, the presence / absence of gingival bleeding through the gingival index or Simplified haemorrhage index (DHI). It is taken on four sides of the tooth, distal, vestibular, mesial and palatal. The average of the four measurements will be the value of that patient. Periodontal probe will be used. 0 = absence of hemorrhage; 1 = presence of haemorrhage.</description>

    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>The study subject is obliged to communicate, by telephone or personally, any type of symptom: redness (erythema), thickening (edema) and peeling (ulcer) occurred after application of the products under study, and will must immediately interrupt the use of it, registering the adverse effects and number of participants with treatment related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0 and using as a rescue product for the treatment of contact mucositis and antiallergic drugs.</description>

Master formula of 80% aloe vera gel Aloe Vera extract, obtained from the central part of the caudal leaves of plants with more than 8 years of life, eliminating its bark. Formulated with carbopol, hydrophilic crosslinked polymer of acrylic acid and vitamin C. The mixture is presented in containers that serve as a container for preparation and will be dispensed in the canister format with applicator tube.</description>
