  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inserting a Bladder catheter during catheter ablation is standard practice at most
      Institutions. Unfortunately, bladder catheters are associated with adverse outcomes,
      including catheter associated cystitis, hematuria, dysuria, and urethral damage.

      The investigator proposes a prospective, randomized clinical trial comparing group A that
      will receive a catheter during the ablation procedure and group B that will not receive the
      procedure. The Investigator hypothesizes the group receiving the bladder catheters will have
      a higher rate of complications.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      (AF) is the commonest arrhythmia worldwide and accounts for significant morbidity. The
      mainstay of treatment for drug refractory AF is catheter ablation. A preponderance of
      evidence indicates better outcomes when this procedure is performed under general anesthesia;
      this is standard of care at our institution. However, for a variety of reasons including long
      procedure time, procedural intravenous fluid administration, and prolonged bedrest following
      the procedure, standard of care at our institution and others is for bladder catheter
      placement during the procedure (4). Unfortunately, bladder catheters used during cardiac
      surgery have been associated with adverse outcomes, including catheter associated cystitis,
      hematuria, dysuria, and urethral damage(

      Fortunately, the landscape of AF ablation is changing rapidly, and procedure times are
      rapidly decreasing. Improvements in three dimensional mapping technology has allowed for less
      reliance on fluoroscopy and allows for real time visualization of ablation lesions.
      Improvements in ablation catheters have allowed for significantly reduced intravenous fluid
      administration during the procedure. The Site has also adopted an expedited protocol for
      venous hemostasis following the procedure that involves a figure-of-eight groin stitch,
      allowing for earlier mobility and a shorter bed rest following the procedure. Therefore, we
      question the need for routine bladder catheter placement during AF ablation procedures

    <description>Per patient reported outcomes, subjects will be asked if they experienced any of the following complications: cystitis, hematuria, dysuria, urethral damage and urinary retention. The primary composite outcome of cystitis, hematuria, dysuria, urethral damage or urinary retention will be compared using Chisq or Fisher's exact test. Additional bivariate correlates to the primary outcome will be analysed including age, gender, operator, procedure satisfaction score, procedure duration, procedural fluid administration, total hospital stay fluid administration, and baseline clinical variables. Variables with p value &lt;o.o5 on bivariate analysis will be included in a multivariate regression model.</description>
