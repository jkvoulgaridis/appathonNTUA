    <textblock>
      The study will assess the glycemic variationusing continuous glucose monitoring system in
      type 2 diabetic patients with euglycemia control respectively when patients was treated with
      Basalin and one week after changing the insulin into Lantus.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The participants will take continuous glucose monitoring system for 3 days when they change
      the insulin into Lantus after reach euglycemia control with Basalin treatment for one week.
