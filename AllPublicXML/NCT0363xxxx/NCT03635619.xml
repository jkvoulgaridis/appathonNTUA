  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is very significant that assessing TN staging in esophageal cancer patients before
      surgery, furthermore, determining the optimize surgical strategy, predict the the efficacy of
      radiotherapy for patients who were not chosen to be surgeried, and define the range of lymph
      node for radiotherapy. It has been reported that the application of MRI in metastasis of
      lymph node of other cancer, but not in metastasis lymph node with esophageal cancer. Only a
      few studies focused on T staging using conventional MRI in esophageal cancer, however,
      relatively new sequences in the chest deserve widely used. To develop a pre-treatment
      evaluation methods for TN staging in patient with esophageal cancer by utilization of the new
      imaging methods (T2-TSE-BLADE, T2 maps, StarVIBE). By analysising the relationship between TN
      staging and imaging features to find the imaging characteristics for TN staging, and to find
      the indicators of magnetic resonance imaging new technology and reference values for
      facilitate pre-treatment diagnosis of lymphnode metastasis, optimize surgical strategy,
      predict the the efficacy of adjunctive therapy, and OS and define the range of lymph node for
      radiotherapy, as making personal treatment planning for esophageal cancer.

      To explore the value of 3 T MRI using multiple sequences, including T2-TSE-BLADE, T2 maps and
      StarVIBE, in evaluating the preoperative TN staging and prediction of response to neoadjuvant
      therapy and OS in patients with esophageal cancer.

      Patients with endoscopically biopsy-proven EC were prospectively enrolled for imaging on a 3
      T scanner. The MRI protocol included T2-TSE-BLADE, T2 maps and StarVIBE sequences, and so on.
      Patients received treatment according to NCCN guideline. Readers assigned a TN stage on MRI,
      and post-operative pathologic confirmation was considered the gold standard. Inter-reader
      agreement, the diagnostic accuracy of TN staging on MRI were analyzed and compared to
      post-operative pathologic TN staging. MRI features were analyzed to find the correlation
      between pretreatment MRI features and response or OS. The study will includ 400 patients.
      Inter-reader agreements of TN staging were analyzed excellent for MRI. Diagnostic accuracy of
      MRI will be calculated.
