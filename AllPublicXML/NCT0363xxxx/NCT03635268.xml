  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intravitreal injections (IVI) of antiangiogenic agents (AA) have revolutionized the
      management of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and diabetic macular edema (DME) in
      particular. Approximately 600,000 AA IVIs are performed each year in France.

      Corticosteroid IVIs are an alternative in the treatment of macular edema when it is diabetic
      or related to venous occlusion, but also due to inflammation.

      Endophthalmitis is one of the most feared complications after IVI because of its poor
      prognosis, despite its low incidence (values found in the literature between 0.01% and
      0.08%). IVI practices have evolved over the years based on the recommendations of specialized
      organizations, with the current recommendation not to use antibiotic prophylaxis.

      The purpose of this study is to study the effect of intravitreal injections of
      anti-angiogenic agents and corticosteroids on the occurrence of endophthalmitis within 28
      days following an injection.
