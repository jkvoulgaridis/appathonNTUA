  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Consumption of slowly digestible carbohydrates can elicit higher satiety feeling compared to
      rapidly digestible carbohydrates, however not all individuals respond the same. The
      physiological mechanism that accounts for the satiety effect and the lack of consistency
      among subjects is not fully understood. The overall aim of this research is to determine if
      consumption of slow digestible carbohydrates (e.g., millet couscous) can induce
      non-responding subjects (i.e., with rapid gastric emptying) to activate the ileal brake and
      delay rate of gastric emptying.

      The purpose of this study is to understand how consumption of slowly digestible carbohydrate
      (e.g. millet couscous) over time may affect overall health. The investigators will be
      recruiting 15 volunteers for this study. To be eligible for this study, you need to be
      between 18 and 50 years old, have a normal Body Mass Index, have a normal fasting blood
      glucose level, be free of any gastrointestinal diseases, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases,
      be free of wheat allergens, gluten intolerance or sensitivities, and allergy to millet, and
      not be pregnant or nursing. If you have any questions about the criteria, please ask the
      person consenting you.

      In this study participants will consume 200-300 g slowly digestible carbohydrates/day for 30
      days. For the duration of the study there will be 5 testing days, in which participants will
      consume a meal with a C13 tracer, breath into test bags and wear a glucose monitor. During
      testing days participants will be required to stay in the laboratory. Testing day sessions
      will last about 4 hours with a short 30-minute visit the day prior to install glucose
      monitor. For non-testing days participants will consume meal in the laboratory but are not
      required to stay. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the continuous effect of slowly
      digestible carbohydrates consumption on gastric emptying and its potential health benefits.
