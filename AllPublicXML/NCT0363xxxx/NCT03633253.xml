  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of the proposal is to examine the epidemiology of the newly reported
      &quot;motoric cognitive risk&quot; (MCR) syndrome, which is a pre-dementia syndrome combining
      subjective cognitive complaint (i.e.; memory complaint) with objective slow gait speed, in
      the Quebec elderly population.

      Cognition and locomotion are two human abilities controlled by the brain. Their decline is
      highly prevalent with physiological and pathological aging, and is greater than the simple
      sum of their respective prevalence, suggesting a complex age-related interplay between
      cognition and locomotion. Both declines in cognition and locomotion are associated,
      furthermore the temporal nature of their association has been unclear for a long time.
      Recently, a systematic review and meta-analysis has provided evidence that poor gait
      performance predicts dementia and, in particular, has demonstrated that MCR syndrome is a
      pre-dementia syndrome, suggesting that low gait performance is the first symptom of dementia.
      The uniqueness of MCR syndrome is that it does not rely on a complex evaluation or laboratory
      investigations. Indeed, this syndrome combined subjective cognitive complaint and objective
      slow gait speed, and is easy to apply in population-based settings.

      Prevalence and incidence of MCR syndrome, as well as its association with incidence of
      cognitive decline and impairment, have never been reported in Canada. Nutrition as a
      determinant of successful aging: The Quebec longitudinal Study (the NuAge study) is a Quebec
      population-based observational cohort study performed in healthy older community-dwellers
      adults which provides a unique opportunity to: 1) obtain reliable estimates of MCR syndrome
      prevalence and incidence, 2) determine the distribution of clinical characteristics
      associated with MCR syndrome, 3) examine the association of MCR syndrome with cognitive
      decline and incidence of cognitive impairment in the Quebec elderly population.

    <description>First, prevalence of MCR syndrome will be determined by classifying participants into MCR and non-MCR syndrome groups. Second, between-group comparisons of participants' characteristics will be performed using unpaired t-test, Mann-Whitney, analysis of variance with LSD correction or Chi-square test, as appropriate. Third, multiple regressions will be performed to examine the association between MCR syndrome (dependent variable) and cardio-vascular risk factors and/or diseases (independent variables) adjusted on participants' characteristics. Fourth, the incidence of MCR syndrome during the follow-up period of NuAge study will be reported. Fifth, regression will be performed to examine the association between MCR syndrome (dependent variable) and cognitive decline as well cognitive impairment (independent variables, separated model) adjusted on participants' characteristics.</description>
