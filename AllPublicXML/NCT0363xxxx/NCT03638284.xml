  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Agitation and aggression impose a tremendous burden on the individuals living with dementia,
      their families, caregivers, and healthcare systems. Neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia
      (NPS) affect up to 80% of patients with Alzheimer's dementia. These symptoms impair patient
      and care giver's quality of life, increase the chances of hospitalization and also result in
      faster progression of the illness. The efficacy of current treatments is limited and the
      antipsychotic medications commonly used to treat these symptoms are associated with serious
      side effects. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive brain
      stimulation technique that uses a very low intensity electric current to modulate cortical
      excitability and brain plasticity. tDCS can be safely administered to awake persons and is
      very well tolerated. In this study the investigators will use tDCS to treat agitation related
      to NPSD.

      Agitation and aggression impose a tremendous burden on the individuals living with dementia,
      their families, caregivers, and healthcare systems. Neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia
      (NPS) affect up to 80% of patients with Alzheimer's dementia. These symptoms include
      aggression and agitation, anxiety, depression, hallucinations, and delusions. These symptoms
      impair patient and care giver's quality of life, increase the chances of hospitalization and
      also result in faster progression of the illness. The efficacy of current treatments is
      limited and the antipsychotic medications commonly used to treat these symptoms are
      associated with serious side effects including cerebrovascular events, falls and increased
      risk of death. Electroconvulsive Therapy may be effective as well, however it requires
      anaesthesia and adversely affects cognition. Non-pharmacological or behavioral interventions
      are universally recognized as the first line treatment for agitation and NPSD. They are most
      effective when individualized and delivered in a person centered approach. Transcranial
      direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique that uses a
      very low intensity electric current to modulate cortical excitability and brain plasticity.
      tDCS can be safely administered to awake persons and is very well tolerated. Studies in
      healthy individuals and patients with Alzheimer's disease have shown that tDCS applied to
      frontal brain regions can enhance cognitive function. Further, tDCS applied to frontal brain
      regions can improve depressive symptoms. The effects of tDCS on NPSD are not known. In this
      study the investigators will use tDCS to treat agitation related to NPSD.The objective of
      this proposal is to conduct an open label pilot study of tDCS for treatment of agitation.

    <time_frame>2 weeks, 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patients who undergo tDCS course will have reduced neuropsychiatric symptoms assessed using the Cohen Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI). tDCS will result in a significant reduction in agitation as assessed by CMAI -frequency total score between baseline and post treatment follow up two weeks later. CMAI-frequency score ranges between 29 to 203 and CMAI-disruptiveness ranges from 29 to 145 for each category. Higher scores indicate worsening of symptoms.</description>

    <time_frame>2 weeks, 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patients who undergo tDCS course will have reduced neuropsychiatric symptoms assessed using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). tDCS will result in reduced burden of neuropsychiatric symptoms as assessed by Neuropsychiatric Inventory after the 2 week intervention. Each NPI domain is scored based on the interview conducted by the clinician. Frequency of symptoms are rated on a scale of 0 - 4 (Higher scores indicate symptoms occur more frequently). Severity / intensity of symptoms are rated on a scale of 0 to 3 (Higher scores indicate greater severity of symptoms). Caregiver distress is rated on a scale of 0 to 5 (Higher scores indicate increased caregiver distress).</description>

    <description>Patients who undergo tDCS course will have reduced neuropsychiatric symptoms as assessed using Clinical Global Impression -Improvement Scale CGI-I. tDCS will result in a significant improvement in clinical symptoms as assessed by CGI-I scale after the two week intervention. CGI-I scores range from 0-7, higher scores indicating worsening compared to at baseline.</description>
