  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Home HD (HHD) is associated with better outcome in end-stage renal disease patients compared
      to in-center HD, in particular in terms of quality of life. However fear of AVF cannulation
      is a known barrier for patient's choice and adoption of a HHD program. Providing nurse
      assistance for the cannulation can help developing HHD programs. The aim of this study is to
      evaluate the feasibility of assisted home hemodialysis, with the intervention of a nurse at
      home for arterio-venous fistula cannulation.

      -  Monocentric prospective interventional study.

        -  Intervention is assisted HHD, defined as: rope-ladder cannulation at the patient's home
           provided by a trained private nurse at each dialysis session, and connection to the
           Nxstage System One

        -  pilot study, with main objective defined as feasibility of the investigator's assisted
           HHD program. Pilot study usually concerns a small population, allowing us to develop
           thereafter a bigger study if the results are encouraging.

        -  primary end-point criteria defined as definitive cessation of HHD with transfer to an
           other dialysis modality.
