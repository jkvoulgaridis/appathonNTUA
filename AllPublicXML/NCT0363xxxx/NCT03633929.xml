  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Twenty individuals diagnosed with opioid use disorder (OUD) will be recruited to participate
      in a beta test to demonstrate feasibility of using an online tool to help them better
      self-manage their recovery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be enrolled in a 4-week single group pre-post evaluation. All participants
      will attend a two hour orientation to complete baseline assessments, learn how to access and
      use the software, and participate in a training session. Study participants will be asked to
      complete assessments online at least twice per week, but no more than once daily. The
      software may still be accessed by participants as many times as desired to review advice and
      graphs. After the four week evaluation phase, participants will return for a two hour
      debriefing and completion of assessment surveys. This approach permits users to be adequately
      trained while also evaluating the software within their typical environment rather than in a
      lab setting.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>User Satisfaction and Usability</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Systems Usability Scale-Modified (SUS), a single-factor, 10-item self-report scale will be used to evaluate participants' subjective experience using the software. SUS yields a single number representing a composite measure of the overall usability of the system being studied. SUS scores have a range of 0 to 100, with higher scores representing a better outcome. Systems in early development may expect to have a rating of 30, while more mature systems should rate between 60 - 80. An additional 7 point (0=strongly disagree to 7=strongly agree) Likert-type questionnaire focusing on health metrics specific to the software will be used to evaluate: (1) the content, appropriateness and relevance of the advice; (2) enhancement of self-management skills; (3) self-awareness and (4) overall satisfaction with health. Higher scores indicate better outcomes. Open ended questions will be asked to solicit suggestions, criticisms and comments.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Opioid Use</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Addiction Severity Index - Lite Version will be used to measure opioid use. The ASI-Lite is a semi-structured instrument used in face-to-face interviews conducted by clinicians, researchers or trained technicians. The ASI obtains lifetime information about problem behaviors, as well as problems within the previous 30 days. The ASI has both open ended questions and questions that are provided to patients on the following scale: 0 - Not at all, 1 - Slightly, 2 - Moderately, 3 - Considerably, 4 - Extremely. A composite score for opioid use is calculated with a 0.0 to 3.0 range with higher scores indicating worse results.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Depression</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) will be used to measure depression. The PHQ-9 is a nine question survey regarding depression in which patients answer on a 4 point scale (Not at all, Several days, More than half the days, or Nearly every day). A 0-3 number is applied to each answer and multiplied by the number of answers, and then summed. Scores range from 0-27 with higher scores indicative of greater depression severity.</description>
